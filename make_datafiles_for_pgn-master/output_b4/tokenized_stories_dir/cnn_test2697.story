Istanbul , Turkey -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- About 200 Kurdish demonstrators marched up a narrow Istanbul street behind a large banner that said `` political prisoners are our pride , we will not stay silent over the deaths in prison . ''

The group 's organizers were expecting trouble . They were marching on Tuesday without a government permit .

Barely 200 yards up the road , the crowd encountered a squad of armored Turkish riot police and a big police vehicle blocking the road .

Without any verbal warning , the vehicle lurched forward and unleashed its water cannon on the crowd . The demonstrators huddled behind their banner for a moment , until riot police unleashed a volley of tear gas canisters into the crowd .

As stinging , acrid smoke engulfed the neighborhood , the middle-aged Kurdish demonstrators quickly gave way to masked youths hurling stones and fireworks at the police .

Tuesday marked the second time in two days Turkish riot police used force against unsanctioned gatherings of political groups challenging the government .

On Monday , security forces in Ankara used pepper spray and water cannons to disperse secularist groups trying to hold a rally celebrating the anniversary of the foundation of the Turkish republic . Participants gathered in defiance of a government ban .

The next day , Turkey 's chief prosecutor announced he was launching an investigation into the secularist gathering .

The crackdown during Republic Day in Ankara highlighted how powerless Turkey 's once dominant secular establishment has become . It has also led to accusations by long-time supporters in Turkish newspapers that Turkey 's Islamist-rooted prime minister is adopting the same authoritarian tactics of the secularist ancient regime .

Tuesday 's Kurdish clashes reflect a different power struggle . The riots in Istanbul and other Turkish cities mark yet another day in a bloody 30-year cycle of violence between the Turkish state and the Kurds . It is Turkey 's oldest and deadliest ethnic conflict , one that has claimed more than 30,000 lives .

The conflict developed a disturbing new dynamic in recent weeks as a mass hunger strike has spread through the Turkish penal system . According to the Turkish government statistics , at least 680 Kurdish prisoners are now starving themselves , some for nearly 50 days .

`` They want two things , '' said Gulcin Isbert , a member of the Peace and Democracy Party -LRB- BDP -RRB- , which is Turkey 's largest and best-organized Kurdish nationalist party . `` The right to education and defense in court in their native language , and for the leader of the Kurds , Abdullah Ocalan , to have health , security and freedom . ''

For decades , the Kurdish language was banned in Turkey despite the fact the Kurds make up the country 's largest ethnic minority . Those restrictions have been relaxed over the past decade by the government of prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , which introduced a state Kurdish-language television station .

But Kurdish partisans want to expand those linguistic freedoms .

The demand for the release of Ocalan is much more problematic . He is the founder of the Kurdistan Workers Party , or PKK , a group that Turkey , the U.S. and the European Union label as a ` terrorist organization . '

Though Ocalan has spent more than a decade imprisoned on a Turkish island in the Marmara Sea , the guerilla war he began against the Turkish state continues to be fought .

Last month , the nonprofit conflict mediation organization International Crisis Group published a report arguing Turkey 's PKK conflict had reached its deadliest levels in some 13 years , with more than 700 people killed during a 14 month period .

Last weekend , Turkey 's semiofficial Anatolian Agency reported a police officer was killed in an apparent rebel attack in southeastern Turkey , the main battle ground in the conflict .

The ICG report also cited Turkish Ministry of Justice statistics indicating Kurds have been targets of a massive wave of detentions , with more than 7,000 prisoners accused of PKK links thrown behind bars over the past several years .

The parents of some of those prisoners were in a tent in a park in Istanbul 's Okmeydani neighborhood Tuesday morning , staging a sit-in to support their children on hunger strike . Women in Kurdish head-scarves sat on carpets , some of them decorated with traditional facial tattoos , swaying and singing folks songs in Kurdish .

`` Of course we are worried , '' said Feride Akdogan , whose 26-year old daughter Sehnaz had been on hunger strike for the past 15 days .

Asked whether it was worth losing her daughter to improve prison conditions for PKK-leader Ocalan , Akdogan said simply `` thousands of our people have thrown themselves on the fire for our leader . ''

Ebu Bekir Polat and his wife , Behiye , were participating in the sit-in for their daughter Ciyan . She was arrested two and a half years ago at the age of 18 , Polat said , and accused of membership in a terrorist organization , though she had yet to be convicted in court .

`` No one has the right to make our kids rot in jail like this for two and a half years , '' Polat said .

He insisted the hunger strikers were staging their potentially lethal protest in the interest of peace .

`` These kids have given their bodies to the fire of hunger ... not just for the Kurdish people , but for the future of Turkey . So that this war can end , so that neither soldiers , police or guerillas in the mountains die , '' Polat added .

Last week , Turkey 's Justice Minister made a televised appeal to prisoners to stop their hunger strike .

`` Reform and change , work on expanding freedoms is ongoing , '' Sadullah Ergin said during a visit to a prison in Ankara . `` For your bodies , for your health , for the family members who love you ... stop this action . ''

But on Tuesday , riot police in Istanbul had little sympathy for relatives of the prisoners .

As squads of riot police and armored cars chased stone-throwing Kurds through the streets of Okmeydani , a police vehicle rounded a corner and started firing its water cannon at the tent where at least 20 mostly middle aged Kurdish women sat on carpets .

A lawyer for the Kurds rushed forward , arguing that the sit-in by the Kurdish mothers was peaceful and had nothing to do with the nearby street clashes .

`` They are throwing Molotov cocktails at us , '' a police commander answered . `` They can have 15 minutes to leave the area . ''

But less than five minutes later , armored police officers began ripping down the tent . Another officer popped open a tear gas canister and tossed it into the tent , at the feet of the increasingly panicked women inside .

As women stumbled to their feet half-blind trying to escape , a Kurdish man kicked the canister out of the tent . A police officer in a suit and gas mask then picked it up and threw it back into the tent .

`` Get the mothers ! Get the mothers out of there ! '' yelled a silver-haired Kurdish man named Ali Riza Bilgili , as he struggled to help a woman out of the tent .

A half dozen police officers in helmets and gas masks then worked together to rip down one of the metal ribs holding up the tent .

`` Enough ! '' another Kurdish man screamed . `` What has this woman done wrong ? You 're only doing this because I do n't have a gun . ''

Moments later , the police withdrew . Reinforcements were arriving in the neighborhood . But the protests were also growing . A kilometer away , young Kurdish men momentarily blocked a major commercial road ... intimidating drivers by laying rocks on the pavement .

Turkey 's Kurdish conflict is still very far from over .
