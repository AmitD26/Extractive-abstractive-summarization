-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It might be better to travel than arrive , but in the case of British footballers succeeding abroad the journey has all too often been painful -- and all too frequently they have returned home after barely arriving .

Quite what Gareth Bale 's $ 134 million journey to Real Madrid brings is open to conjecture , but with his painfully protracted transfer now concluded , the hard part really begins .

The spotlight on a British footballer on a global stage has never been greater , with the 24-year-old having eclipsed Cristiano Ronaldo as the world 's most expensive player of all time .

But there are no guarantees that Bale will live up to the price tag nor shine in La Liga . After all , many of the great and good of British football have faltered away from home .

`` Why are there over the last 40 years only about five English players who have done well abroad ? '' said Dutch great Johan Cruyff , who both played for and coached Real 's rivals Barcelona . `` There 's something going on there , something strange . ''

Herbert Kilpin was the first British footballer to ply his trade overseas professionally in 1891 and he was a founding member of Italian club AC Milan eight years later .

There have been others to have made their mark since : John Charles at Juventus , Gary Lineker at Barcelona and , most recently , David Beckham at Real Madrid , AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain .

But for the successes , there have been under-performances and failures , ranging from Ian Rush , who was famously but falsely quoted as saying his spell in Juventus was `` like playing in a foreign country , '' to fellow striker Mark Hughes , who managed just four goals in 28 games at Barcelona .

The language barrier is often given as the main reason for the initial struggle for Brits who have failed to settle .

It is no surprise that among those to shine were the players who swotted up on the lingo early on . David Platt began Italian lessons while still at Aston Villa -- a move to Bari then just a possibility -- while Steve McManaman mastered Spanish quickly to become at ease almost instantly with Real Madrid teammates and fans alike .

Looking back on his foreign sojourn , Lineker recalled : `` I looked at British players who went abroad and were successful . They were the ones who learned the language and adapted to the culture . The ones that did n't tended to be home pretty quickly . ''

One of the current crop of Britons on the continent is Kris Thackray , currently with German side Alemannia Aachen , who has also had spells with Italian sides in five seasons away from home so far .

`` Leaving home and settling in was difficult , '' he said of the early days abroad . `` The complete change of culture from food , people , climate and mainly the language was challenging .

`` The language is the most important thing , not knowing it isolates you and stops you from expressing your personality and prevents you from understanding simple messages on and off the pitch . ''

Rush never really mastered the language and , as a result , felt a lonely figure in the Juve dressing room while Paul Gascoigne made no secret of being homesick while in Serie A with Lazio as he never managed more than a few token phrases of Italian .

Chris Waddle , who won three league titles in France with Marseille as well as reaching the 1991 European Cup final , said that it took three months to learn the language and , after that , he slotted right in .

But language is not the sole barrier , the cultural differences as a whole are a more deep-rooted issue for many , and , like with Gazza , plain old home sickness .

Rush used to get his family to bring over digestive biscuits while former England goalkeeper Scott Carson , who spent two seasons in Turkey with Bursaspor , repeatedly bemoaned a lack of baked beans .

Jamie Lawrence is a young English player who has been in Holland since the age of 16 . He initially joined Ajax in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam and now , aged 21 , plays for RKC Waalwijk 's under-23 team .

His advice for Bale would be to immerse himself in the Spanish culture , which in turn will help him settle into the Madrid way of life .

`` The great thing about moving to a new country is all the new experiences , '' London-born Lawrence told CNN . `` If you do n't put too much pressure on yourself , you can really enjoy it .

`` I would say learn the most you can about the Spanish culture and become a part of it . I lived in an English culture for 16 years , moved here and it 's completely different . It 's so great the culture here , I 'm involved in it . ''

For others , the issue was of being the virtual alien in the midst of a new bunch of players .

Kevin Keegan was a huge success story abroad with a spell at Hamburg , which resulted in two Bundesliga titles and with him twice being named European Footballer of the Year .

But things started far from well , with reports that some players would not even pass to him in training , unhappy he had been brought to the German club .

So , playing abroad -- for a Brit or otherwise -- takes a certain strength of character . Former Liverpool striker Stan Collymore admitted he was n't up to such a culture shock , leaving Spanish side Real Oviedo after just three appearances for the club .

So how exactly does Bale avoid falling into the trap of some of his esteemed predecessors ? After all , Real fans can be a heartless bunch , whatever the price tag . One former player , Jonathan Woodgate , another Brit , was voted the worst signing of the 21st Century in a poll by Spanish newspaper Marca .

`` The world has been littered with English players who have n't adjusted to being a big player at a European club , '' journalist Michael Calvin , who has regularly crossed paths with Bale during his meteoric rise over the past three years , told CNN .

`` He knows he is a disposal commodity . If he does n't perform he is toast . ''

Making sure he does not fall by the wayside particularly with the size and variety of expectation -- from what he does on the field to off it -- is the big trick .

`` Real Madrid and Perez are looking at him as helping them launch into a completely different commercial market , '' added Calvin , author of the recently published `` Nowhere Men , '' which looks at football 's unknown football talent spotters -- a club 's scouts .

`` They want him to do a Beckham and his world is going to change irrevocably . He is right up in the upper strata .

`` Is this a top three player and can he drive that commercial momentum ? Can he operate in the same side as Ronaldo ? Is he Ronaldo lite ? Will he have physical weaknesses ? It is unique opportunity and unique challenge .

`` He will need that foundation stone of his family and his friends . It is a huge leap from being the boy at home playing FIFA to being the hope of world football . ''

Calvin , though , also makes the point that Bale is no innocent bystander in all this .

`` The whole scorpion dance of a big move comes in , '' added Calvin . `` He understands his clout . He is not an innocent . People in his situation are n't innocent . They are products of an occasionally brutal world . ''

In Spain , there is the goldfish bowl aspect for Bale to encounter along with his partner Emma Rhys-Jones , bigger at Real than at most clubs in the world .

Already , Bale has made about a third of Spanish newspaper Marca 's front pages in August alone .

On the issue of the media spotlight , Calvin said : `` His parents are model parents and helped him get through an academy system , which is predisposed to producing bad Dads and mad Mums .

`` That value structure will come under unprecedented scrutiny and he will have to quickly get used to the current absurdities of that world . That 's where he is going to have to readjust and recalibrate his life . ''

It could go a number of ways .

He could become Charles , nicknamed the gentle giant and voted Juventus ' greatest foreign import above Zinedine Zidane and Michel Platini , or else McMamanan , who is still talked favorably about by the Madridistas after winning the Champions League in his first season with Real .

Or else he could do down the Woodgate route , of being reviled rather than revered . The eyes of the world will be watching which way it goes .
