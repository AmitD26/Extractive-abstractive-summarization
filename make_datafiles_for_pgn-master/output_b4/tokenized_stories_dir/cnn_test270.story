-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British and American scientists watching Greenland 's massive ice sheet have found what appears to be a 460-mile `` megacanyon '' far beneath the frozen surface of the world 's largest island .

Airborne radar images taken by the U.S. space agency NASA and compiled by scientists at the University of Bristol revealed the canyon 's existence , Bristol glaciologist Jonathan Bamber said Thursday . It 's buried under the layer of ice that blankets Greenland , a covering up to 3 kilometers -LRB- 1.9 miles -RRB- thick .

The gouge is about 50 % longer than Arizona 's 277-mile Grand Canyon , but not as deep -- ranging from 650 feet to about 2,600 feet -LRB- 200 to 800 meters -RRB- , Bamber said . It runs from the middle of Greenland to its northern shore , on the Arctic Ocean , and it 's likely to have been covered over by ice for 4 million years .

`` It 's a continuous canyon . It 's pretty deep . It very much looks like it predates the ice sheets , '' Bamber said . `` We think it 's indicative of a river system that was here before the ice sheet was there , and which perhaps was modified by the ice sheet cover some , but not much . ''

The discovery is a byproduct of the intense scientific focus on Greenland amid concerns about rising global temperatures . The radar images were shot by NASA 's Operation IceBridge , which flies aircraft over the island because the ice sheet is too thick for satellite-based radar to penetrate , said Michael Studinger , the project 's lead scientist .

Bamber and colleagues from Bristol , the University of Calgary in Canada and Urbino University in Italy published their findings Thursday in the journal Science . They were trying to compile an updated set of ice-sheet records when they noticed `` this long linear feature that seemed to be pretty continuous , '' Bamber said .

`` It looks like it was a pretty extensive river system millions of years ago , '' he said .

The find is n't a `` first-order concern '' for scientists studying climate change but will help researchers understand how the ice ebbs and flows across the face of Greenland and other polar environments , Bamber said .

The main reason Greenland is under study is to record the height of the ice above it , not to map the land beneath , Studinger said . The existence of the canyon is `` basically a tiny piece in the big puzzle of what 's going on in Greenland , '' but still an exciting find , he said .

`` We live in the 21st century , and we are still discovering 750-kilometer features under the Greenland ice sheet that we did n't know about , '' he said .
