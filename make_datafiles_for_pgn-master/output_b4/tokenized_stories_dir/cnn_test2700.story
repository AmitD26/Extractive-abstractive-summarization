Jos , Nigeria -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A string of bombs struck churches in five Nigerian cities Sunday , leaving dozens dead and wounded on the holiday , authorities and witnesses said .

The blasts mark the second holiday season that bombs have hit Christian houses of worship in the west African nation . In a statement issued late Sunday , Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan called the bombings `` a dastardly act that must attract the rebuke of all peace-loving Nigerians . ''

`` These acts of violence against innocent citizens are an unwarranted affront on our collective safety and freedom , '' Jonathan said . `` Nigerians must stand as one to condemn them . ''

Bombs targeted churches across the country , hitting the cities of Madalla , Jos , Kano , and Damaturu and Gadaka , said journalist Hassan John , who witnessed the carnage in Jos. The death toll in Madalla alone was 18 , including two people reported dead overnight at a nearby hospital , Nigeria 's National Emergency Management Agency spokesman Yushau Shuaib told CNN .

John said witnesses in Madalla reported a higher death toll , with more than 30 killed . Some victims died after being taken to a hospital , he said .

In Damaturu , a northern town in Yobe state , a police station and a state security building were also bombed , an aid worker said . The worker asked not to be named for security reasons .

Nwakpa Okorie , a spokesman for the Nigerian Red Cross , said the some of the wounded were taken to the capital Abuja for treatment .

`` The situation is under control now . The security agents have secured the streets close to the bombed areas ... in Madalla , Jos and Dematuru , '' he said .

Jonathan said his government `` will not relent in its determination to bring to justice all the perpetrators of today 's acts of violence and all others before now . '' And in Washington , the White House said U.S. officials would help Nigeria pursue those behind `` what initially appear to be terrorist acts . ''

`` We condemn this senseless violence and tragic loss of life on Christmas Day , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a written statement . `` We offer our sincere condolences to the Nigerian people and especially those who lost family and loved ones . ''

The first explosion Sunday struck near a Roman Catholic church in Madalla , west of Abuja , Nigeria 's capital , the National Emergency Management Agency said . Church officials were trying to get a picture of what happened in the city .

`` Lives have been lost but we do not have the details , '' said the Rev. Michael Ekpenyong . `` The area has been cordoned off . I tried to call the priest , but I could n't get through . ''

Ekpenyong , the secretary general of the country 's Catholic Secretariat , said the church that was bombed was `` not a big church , but lots of people attend . '' Photos from the scene showed burned-out cars and at least three bodies on the ground , one covered with a blanket , at the rural church .

Usman Abdallah Baba , who witnessed the bombing , said there were at least 15 or 16 casualties and that authorities were still counting the toll .

Baba said local people were already blaming the violent extremist Muslim Boko Haram sect , which has targeted Christians as well as Muslims its members consider insufficiently Islamic .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the acts `` in the strongest terms , '' his office said in a statement Sunday .

He expressed his condolences to the Nigerian people and reiterated a call `` for an end to all acts of sectarian violence in the country . ''

In 2010 , five churches in Jos were attacked while residents were celebrating Christmas Eve . The blasts killed dozens in Jos , which lies on a faith-based fault line between the Muslim-dominated north and the mainly Christian south .

On Sunday , two blasts targeted the Mountain of Fire Ministries church in Jos , northeast of the capital , said John . No one was killed in that bombing , which John called a `` miracle '' -- but a police officer who got into a gun battle with the attackers died of his wounds later , John said , citing officials .

The second church , in Jos , was hit by two explosions when young men threw bombs , John said . Police responded quickly and exchanged gunfire with the attackers , who wounded at least one of the police officers , he said .

The injured officer was rushed to the Jos University teaching hospital for medical attention , but died of his wounds , John said . The attackers fled into the crowd and disappeared after the attack , John said .

Police arrested four people and recovered four unexploded devices , Nigerian state television reported .

Nigeria is Africa 's most populous nation and has the world 's sixth-largest Christian population -- about 80.5 million people as of 2010 , according to a report published this month by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life in Washington . That makes the country just over 50 % Christian , according to the Pew figures .

Dozens killed in fighting in Nigeria

The latest attacks follow two days of clashes between militants and security forces in northern Nigeria . Lt. Gen. Azubuike Ihejirika , the Nigerian army chief of staff , said the clashes left three soldiers dead and several more wounded .

The fighting began Thursday between Boko Haram militants and the military in the Yobe state town of Damaturu , Ihejirika said .

`` There was a major encounter with the Boko Haram in Damaturu , '' Ihejirika said Friday . `` We lost three of our soldiers , seven were wounded . But we killed over 50 of their members . ''

Boko Haram translates from the local Hausa as `` Western education is outlawed . '' The group has morphed into an insurgency responsible for dozens of attacks in Nigeria in the last two years .

Boko Haram 's targets include police outposts and churches as well as places associated with `` Western influence . ''
