-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.N. inspectors returned to Syria on Wednesday to look into at least a half-dozen claims of chemical weapons use -- some allegedly by the regime , others allegedly by rebels .

The team has already confirmed the August 21 use of chemical warfare near Damascus but did not explicitly say who was responsible . According to U.S. estimates , that attack left more than 1,400 people dead .

The move came the same day a U.N. diplomat told CNN that three basic premises have been agreed upon for a U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria 's chemical weapons disarmament .

Russia has basically agreed to the points , but `` small issues '' remain to be decided , the source said .

The deal could still fall apart .

According to the source , the three premises are : 1 . Accountability for attacks on August 21 ; 2 . Binding and enforceable language for measures against Syria in case of violations in the disarmament regime or the use of chemical weapons ; 3 . The council will remain seized of the matter , meaning that further discussion will be expedited .

The resolution would not authorize automatic use of force if Syria is said to be in violation , as was previously sought by the United States , the source said .

Among their tasks , investigators will try to figure out if chemical weapons were used in the northern city of Khan al-Asal in March . State-run media blamed rebels for the attack , which it said killed 25 people and injured more than 110 others . Syrian rebels , meanwhile , accused government forces of a chemical weapons attack on the rural Damascus suburb of Ateibeh .

Syrian rebels reject interim government , embrace Sharia

But the inspectors face a litany of challenges , like trying to find physical and forensic evidence from more than six months ago .

Then there 's the security situation . During the inspectors ' last visit , mortar shells landed near their hotel in Damascus , and their convoy came under fire while en route to a scene .

And just like their investigation into the August 21 attack , the inspectors will only try to determine whether chemical weapons were used during this trip , not who was responsible .

CNN 's Nick Paton Walsh , Holly Yan , Nick Thompson and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report .
