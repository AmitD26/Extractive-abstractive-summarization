-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The news that Catherine , Duchess of Cambridge , is pregnant is being celebrated throughout Britain , the British Commonwealth and beyond . As well as wonderful news for the royal couple , it has positive implications for the future of the British monarchy .

It means that the reigning House of Windsor will have , for the first time since 1894 , no fewer than three generations in line to the throne at the same time . As early into this century as we are , it effectively means that the succession is secure even into the next one .

Whether the royal couple 's new baby is a boy or a girl , he or she will ascend the throne as monarch one day , come what may -- short of a republican revolution . The Commonwealth changed the law this year , meaning sex discrimination will end and males will not be favored over females , as they have been for the past thousand years .

News : Baby news sparks media frenzy

Although we ca n't know what the child 's name will be , we can be sure that he or she will have a lot of them : Some heirs to the throne had as many as seven or eight . Should they have a girl , it would be surprising if the names Elizabeth , after her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and great-great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother , and Diana , after her paternal grandmother , are missing from the list .

Yet the bookmakers ' predictions for a boy 's name -- Charles , at 10 to 1 ; and John , at 8 to 1 -- are very unlikely . Charles is already taken as the name of Prince William 's father , and John was one of the worst kings in British history .

Any concerns that Prince Harry might one day have ascended the British throne -- he was third in line and will soon be fourth -- have been allayed by this announcement . Granted , he was a brave soldier who saw action fighting against the Taliban in Afghanistan , but he was not really considered suitable material for a king . The knowledge that Catherine can have children removes the danger that a future King Harry might embarrass the nation with his naked hijinks and Las Vegas antics .

What we do know is that the child will be brought up in the harshest of media spotlights and will remain in its full flood for a lifetime . Bookmakers already are taking bets on the color of the baby 's hair .

To exist in this gilded cage will require a firm sense of self and a strong personality . Many people might be hurt psychologically by the relentless publicity accompanying every move they make , but Prince William has demonstrated that such attention does not necessarily lead to problems .

News : Royal baby announcement marks dramatic break with tradition

The British state is far more protective toward its royals than it was in the days of Prince Charles and Princess Diana , and it is fully conscious of the disasters that can arise when the paparazzi are in full pursuit . The public , too , despises those who invade the younger royals ' private lives , although admittedly that has not stopped people from buying the newspapers and visiting the websites responsible for the worst excesses .

In a sense , all monarchy is a lottery , in that nobody can tell whether a sovereign will turn out well or ill . A large number of the best ones -- Elizabeth I , Queen Victoria , George V , George VI , Elizabeth II -- were not necessarily going to be king or queen when they were born .

Some who were born to be king -- such as Edward VIII , later Duke of Windsor -- turned out to be disappointments . With Elizabeth II , Britain won the lottery , and it seems as though the present popularity of the monarchy itself , which opinion polls show to be at its highest in more than a quarter-century , is very much down to her and Prince William .

Although 1992 was an `` annus horribilis '' for the queen , when Windsor Castle suffered a terrible fire and two of her children 's marriages collapsed , 2012 has been a wonderful 12 months , more than making up for it two decades later .

The Diamond Jubilee was spectacular , proving yet again how much the British people love her . The London Olympics were a huge success . And the future of her dynasty seems on the verge of being confirmed throughout this century and beyond .

There will be talk , inevitably , of whether the queen or perhaps the future King Charles III might abdicate , to avoid a situation in which the next three monarchs will be advanced in years . This will not happen .

If the queen has inherited her mother 's longevity , she will easily beat Queen Victoria 's time on the throne , and become -- in September 2015 -- the longest-reigning monarch in history .

Abdication is not in her job description : She considers it a dereliction of duty , something that disgraced her uncle King Edward VIII with the family . If she lives as long as the Queen Mother , she will still be on the throne in 2027 , which will almost inevitably mean that her successor King Charles III would have one of the shorter reigns , as he would be nearly 80 when he acceded .

Arguments about elderly monarchs have been made before in the reign of Queen Victoria , yet it did n't prevent the present queen coming to the throne aged only 25 only half a century later , after the deaths of three more monarchs in the meantime .

Part of the lottery of monarchy is that one can not predict the future , and the job only makes sense if it is for life . One of the strengths of having a family serve as successive heads of state is that when a bad chapter ends , a better one can begin .

With the birth of what would have been her first grandchild , the shade of Princess Diana 's era is forever behind the House of Windsor , and the British people can look forward to a new generation of royals . Small wonder that Britain and the world are celebrating with William and Kate .
