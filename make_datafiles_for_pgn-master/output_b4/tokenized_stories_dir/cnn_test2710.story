-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A leading tennis player believes he has been `` treated like a criminal '' after being hit with an 18-month ban for flouting doping regulations and plans to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport .

World No. 53 Viktor Troicki was suspended by the International Tennis Federation -LRB- ITF -RRB- Thursday after being found guilty of failing to provide a blood sample in a drugs test during April 's Monte Carlo Masters .

But Serbian Troicki has rejected the charge , alleging the doctor conducting the blood test allowed him to miss the procedure and says he will now appeal the decision .

`` The doctor in charge of the testing told me that I looked very pale and ill and that I could skip the test if I wrote an explanation letter to the ITF about it , '' he said in a statement .

`` She dictated the letter to me and let me go without giving blood . She was very helpful and understanding .

`` Now I 'm being charged for refusing to undergo a blood test without justification . This is a real nightmare .

`` I put my trust in the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne , I really hope they will look for the truth and find it . ''

The 27-year-old Troicki confirmed that he underwent a test the following day by the same doping control officer with the result coming back negative .

He also revealed that he had never previously missed a test and had undergone several blood and urine examinations during his career .

But the ITF has taken a different stance on the story , insisting that the doping control officer had told Troicki that `` she could not advise him as to whether his reason for not providing a blood sample was valid , and that no such assurances were given by her . ''

`` I feel like I 'm being treated like a criminal , '' added Troicki as he contemplated the 18-month ban .

`` I have a fear of the needle and I always have trouble drawing blood . But I always did . I am clean and will always be clean throughout my career .

`` I just had the wrong doctor , who did n't tell me at all that I was risking anything . She showed me a letter of the ITF saying she is in charge of the decisions and I trusted her completely .

`` I wish I had recorded the discussion , there would never have been a case if I had .

`` This enormous sanction makes me speechless . It feels like the world that I help building day-by-day has let me down . It is the worst feeling you can imagine . ''

Troicki reached a career high of 12 in 2011 and has won $ 4.5 million in prize money during his career .

He is the third tennis player to be hit with a ban for drug violations in 2013 .

In May , Brazil 's Fernando Romboli was handed an eight-and-a half-month ban after testing positive for diuretics , furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide .

In February , Barbora Zahlavova Strycova of the Czech Republic was banned for six months after testing positive for sibutramine , a substance which is often found in weight-loss products .

In March , the ITF confirmed it would introduce biological passports to tackle drug cheats .

Each player will have an individual electronic biological profile and be tested more regularly to monitor their levels and alert the authorities to possible drug use .

The scheme was welcomed by the world 's top players with Roger Federer telling CNN that it was `` naive '' to think tennis was free of players who use drugs to enhance their performance .

But Troicki believes he was simply misled and insists he has no problem with the current drug regulations .

`` The doping rules are strict and they must remain strict . But this was a clear mistake from the on-site doping control officer who was also a doctor and the person in charge to decide , '' added the Serbian .

`` She let me go and reassured me . In my opinion , once she found out that she did n't follow procedures she turned her back on me .

`` I am destroyed and exhausted . The whole period I have been thinking about this issue and it 's not over , so I ca n't really describe it .

`` I am not even angry with the doctor . I believe that maybe she was told her organization that she made a big mistake letting me go . She backed up and tried to save her job .

`` I am a fighter and I will try to fight together with my team and my lawyers but I am quite destroyed now . I hope this nightmare will come to a good end . I really want to continue playing . I do n't deserve this . ''
