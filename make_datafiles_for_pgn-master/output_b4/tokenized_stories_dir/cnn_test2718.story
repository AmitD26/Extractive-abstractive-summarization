-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mexico confirmed Tuesday that its forces killed Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano , reputed boss of the ruthless Zetas cartel , but it remains uncertain what effect , if any , the killing will have on the larger scourge of drug trafficking and violence .

The kingpin 's death is arguably the Mexican government 's biggest takedown since President Felipe Calderon launched an offensive six years ago , but the record is mixed on the impact of such successes .

Mexican marines killed Lazcano in a shootout on Sunday in a small town in northern Mexico , 130 miles from the Texas border , the country 's navy said .

Lazcano was a onetime special forces soldier who became a founding member of the Zetas , a group accused of some of the most violent atrocities that have come to define the drug wars .

In a twist , a group of armed men stole Lazcano 's body from a funeral home , though authorities had already taken fingerprints and photographs to confirm his identity .

Lazcano 's death `` certainly weakens dramatically the Zetas , '' said George Grayson , professor of government at the College of William & Mary and author of a book on the cartel . The death is the latest in a string of blows against its leadership , he said .

Other analysts said it was unclear how Lazcano 's death would affect the Zetas .

`` Even though the head falls , there is immediately a substitute , '' said Anabel Hernandez , a Mexican journalist who has investigated the country 's cartels .

The intelligence firm Stratfor said it expects Lazcano 's death to have little impact on the Zetas ' operations .

Lazcano 's health had been failing and he had already transferred much control of the organization to Miguel Angel Trevino Morales , Stratfor said .

The United States and Mexico combined had offered rewards of more than $ 7 million for information leading to his capture .

Praising the navy 's efforts Tuesday , Calderon described Lazcano as `` one of the most important and most dangerous '' people on Mexico 's list of most wanted criminals .

The organization he led , Calderon said , is behind `` countless high-impact crimes and extreme violence that many communities in the country have suffered . ''

The Zetas are responsible for smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs annually to the United States , generating many millions of dollars .

The name of the cartel conjures up some of the most violent images of the drug war : a casino fire that killed 52 people , the deaths of 72 migrants , and tortured bodies hanging from bridges .

The marines who killed Lazcano had responded Sunday to reports of an armed group in the town of Progreso , in the northern state of Coahuila , the navy said .

They were attacked with grenades thrown from a moving vehicle and a firefight ensued , it said .

A local newspaper reported scenes of `` panic and terror '' as the shootout erupted next to where families were enjoying a baseball game .

Rather than after an ambush , the shooting started after the marines tried to search a suspicious Ford Ranger , the Zocalo newspaper said .

Authorities at the scene recovered two assault rifles , a grenade launcher and 12 grenades , as well as a rocket launcher and two rockets .

The Zetas -- headquartered in Nuevo Laredo , Mexico , directly across the border from Laredo , Texas -- make up Mexico 's largest drug cartel in terms of territory . The group has operations in 11 Mexican states .

Another reputed Zetas leader , Ivan Velazquez Caballero , alias `` El Taliban , '' was captured last month .

Lazcano , 37 , joined the Mexican armed forces in 1991 and was part of its elite airborne special forces group , dedicated to battling drug cartels .

Soon after , Lazcano and several other special forces members were recruited by the Gulf cartel to create its enforcement arm , Los Zetas .

In ensuing years , the Zetas split into a major drug trafficking organization and have since branched out into extortion , kidnapping and human smuggling .

The cartel is in the midst of a bloody turf war with its former employer , the Gulf cartel , and also with the Sinaloa cartel . The fight for access to lucrative smuggling routes in northern and central Mexico has left thousands of civilians dead .

The violence is particularly acute in three northeastern states that are some of the Zetas ' strongest-held territory : Coahuila , Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas .

In 2010 , the bodies of 72 migrants from Central and South America were discovered at a ranch in Tamaulipas state . The Zetas have been blamed for the mass graves and for the deaths of the migrants .

The cartel also is blamed for setting a fire at a casino in Monterrey that killed 52 people .

In May , authorities found 49 decapitated and dismembered bodies along a highway in Nuevo Leon . The orders to commit the grisly crime allegedly came from Lazcano , who originally wanted the bodies to be left in a town 's central square . In banners purportedly hung by the cartel , the group denied involvement .

Mexican officials have said that more than 47,500 people have been killed in drug-related violence since Calderon began his crackdown on cartels in December 2006 . Some groups say the number is much higher .
