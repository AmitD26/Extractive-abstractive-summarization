-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 's odds of holding power `` are slipping away '' as the nearly 2-year-old revolt against his rule grinds on , Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev says .

In an interview that aired Sunday on CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS , '' Medvedev distanced Moscow from its longtime Middle East client . But he repeated Russia 's longtime insistence that outside powers should n't be picking Syria 's leaders .

`` From the outset , the Russian Federation was not an exclusive ally of Syria or President Assad , '' Medvedev said . `` We used to have good relations with him and his father , but he had much closer allies among the Europeans . ''

Russia has `` never said that our goal was to preserve the current political regime , or making sure that President Assad stays in power , '' he added . `` That decision has to be made by the Syrian people . ''

It 's the latest in a series of grim assessments of al-Assad 's chances from Russia , which has been Syria 's leading arms supplier since the days of the Cold War . President Vladimir Putin said in December that Moscow wo n't support al-Assad `` at any cost , '' and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov noted a few days earlier that the Kremlin `` ca n't exclude a victory by the opposition .

When the Arab Spring revolts erupted across the region in early 2011 , Syrians took to the streets to demonstrate against al-Assad 's rule . The Syrian leader quickly responded with a crackdown by police and the army that soon exploded into a civil war . The United Nations says the conflict has now killed more than 60,000 people , and opposition activists said more than 100 were killed Sunday .

Rebel forces -- many of them led by former soldiers , others by jihadists linked to the al Qaeda terrorist network -- are now regularly battling government troops in the capital , Damascus , and the country 's commercial hub of Aleppo .

Medvedev said he blames both the opposition and al-Assad 's government for refusing to negotiate . He said he personally lobbied al-Assad to open up his regime to reform and that his resistance was an `` important , if not fatal '' mistake .

`` The chances for him surviving are slipping away as days and weeks go by , '' Medvedev told CNN . `` But once again , it should not be up to us . It should be up to the Syrian people . ''

Russia has criticized Western powers , including the United States , that have recognized the opposition as Syria 's rightful leadership . Russia and China have blocked U.N. Security Council attempts to take action to end the conflict and force al-Assad to step down .

Medvedev spoke to CNN at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland . His comments contrasted with those of Jordan 's King Abdullah II , who said Friday that al-Assad is not likely to fall for months .

`` Anyone who says that Bashar 's regime has got weeks to live really does n't know the reality on the ground , '' he said during a panel appearance with Zakaria at the World Economic Forum . `` They still have capability . ... So -LRB- I expect -RRB- a strong showing for at least the first half of 2013 . ''

But Medvedev warned that if al-Assad 's rule is `` swept away '' by the revolt , the result could be a conflict among its successors that could last `` for decades . '' Asked about concerns that jihadists could use a successful campaign in Syria to spread into southern Russia , where Islamic militant groups have been battling Moscow for more than a decade , he said that prospect should alarm the West as well .

`` They can travel to Europe . They tried to . And in the U.S. , '' Medvedev said . `` So it is alarming for all of us . It does not mean , though , that we should bring to power radical opposition leaders . It should be a difficult process , led by civil society . ''
