-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After you 've had a major showdown between good and evil , killed off a major character and broken ratings records , what do you do for an encore ?

That 's one big question on the minds of the legions of fans of `` The Walking Dead '' going into the fourth season premiere on Sunday .

Last season , the show ranked as the No. 1 scripted show on television , a first for cable , and certainly something no one would have predicted for a series about a zombie apocalypse .

The show returns with new showrunner Scott Gimple and without the latest victims of the walkers : Andrea , Merle and Milton . -LRB- There 's also the promise of a spinoff set in a different location during the apocalypse , due to arrive in 2015 . -RRB-

Executive producer Gale Anne Hurd spoke to CNN about what to expect this season .

CNN : After all of the events of last season , where do we find our survivors now ?

Hurd : The survivors have essentially taken residence in the prison and realized that , at the moment anyway , that is the safest haven . They need to integrate new members .

CNN : And where is Rick 's head at now ?

Hurd : As we like to say , Rick spent a little time in `` Crazytown '' last season . But he 's always someone who will step up if necessary . This season , he 's in a very different place . He realizes that perhaps the most important role in the zombie apocalypse is that of a good father . He needs to raise Carl not to be a trigger-happy child soldier , and his baby , Judith , he 's taking that responsibility very seriously .

CNN : Last we saw the Governor , he massacred many of his followers from Woodbury and drove off to parts unknown with a few loyalists . Will we find out what became of him ?

Hurd : We definitely get a sense that he is out there . No one has forgotten and forgiven what he 's done . Some people have moved on . As to what he 's up to , as the season develops , we 'll certainly get some insights into that . I ca n't say when we 'll find out , but we 'll find out . The Governor is pretty formidable . We know he 's out there , and he 's not one to give up a grudge .

CNN : With a good number of the original main characters deceased , we 're seeing the possibilities of new characters emerging , like the Woodbury survivors now living in the prison .

Hurd : Some of the people are already significant characters in the comic book , people like Tyreese . We did n't have enough bandwidth last season to spend much time getting to know him . Now we have the time to do that . We will also explore those who used to live in Woodbury .

CNN : Will we learn new things about the nature of the walkers ?

Hurd : What has n't changed is they have n't developed into super-fast walkers . We have very much the same rules for them , but some of them are more desiccated than ever . They 're more ravenous than ever , and there are a lot more of them . We 'll get to see how that plays out very quickly .

CNN : What is showrunner Scott Gimple bringing to the new season ?

Hurd : Scott Gimple has been in the writers ' room since season two . So he 's someone who is very deep into the show . He was a fan of the comic book from the time it came out , and it 's celebrating its 10th anniversary . What he focuses on incredibly well is the juxtaposition between the epic scope of a zombie apocalypse -- which people will see very quickly in the first episode of the new season -- and making sure that with our characters this season , we 'll see how they handle escalating threats , as well as what decisions they make , both for themselves , the people they love and their allegiance to the group .

CNN : Of course , there are a few characters in particular that hold a lot of interest for the fans . What 's the status of Glenn and Maggie 's relationship ?

Hurd : They 're the example of love among the ruins . As long as love exists , there 's hope . We 'll see if their relationship strengthens in times of calm , or is it strongest in times of crisis ? Do they see the world from the same perspective or will different outlooks create conflict between them ?

CNN : And of course , Daryl Dixon 's following has taken on a life of its own . Will Daryl fans be satisfied this season ?

Hurd : There 's no question . Daryl , as brought to life by Norman Reedus , is someone who -- I think all of us have encountered characters with a dark , brutal past who seem to be broken . We want to see them be able to interact and communicate with other people , and we 'll see if this is possible with Daryl .
