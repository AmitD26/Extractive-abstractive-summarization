MOSCOW , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From the uncertainty that followed the breakup of the Soviet Union , a newly invigorated Russia has emerged , displaying unprecedented political , military and economic confidence that has , at times , put it on a collision course with the West .

A resurgent Russia has been flexing its military , political and economic muscles .

With no sign of strongman Vladimir Putin taking a political backseat , Russia looks set to continue its bid to regain superpower status , providing that its citizens can endure the crippling impact of the global financial crisis and shrug off fears that their newfound freedoms , outlook and relative prosperity will be short-lived .

Here CNN Moscow Correspondent Matthew Chance explains what has driven Russia 's re-emergence , how this has affected its role on the world stage , and what can be expected from the country in the future .

Q : What has been the driving factor behind Russia 's resurgence ?

A : Affluence was behind Russia 's resurgence , but there 's a real sense in which the global financial crisis has checked Russia 's aspirations of a return to superpower status .

Before the downturn , the booming price of commodities , such as gas and oil , of which Russia is big supplier , fueled prosperity and gave Russians a confidence they had n't previously enjoyed .

It also saw the Kremlin being taken much more seriously on the international stage , inserting itself into Middle East peace talks , the Iranian nuclear issue and a host of other issues .

It has also encouraged Russia to assert its presence in what is known as the near-abroad -- the former Soviet states . Many of those states want to move towards NATO and Europe , but Russia wants to keep them within its sphere of influence .

The obvious example of this is Russia 's war last year with Georgia . After Georgia announced its intentions to sign up to NATO , Russia launched a military offensive much to the dismay of the international community .

Q : Is there a change of atmosphere in Russia these days ; are people more optimistic about the future than they were 10 or 15 years ago ?

A : Despite the financial crisis , people enjoy a lot more freedom and a lot more prosperity than they did 15 years ago , but there 's a deep-seated insecurity among Russians that it could all -- the money , the freedom -- come to an end .

Watching their currency collapse by 30 percent over the last year , unemployment soar 10 percent and industrial output plunge has made Russians very uncomfortable about the future . At the moment people do n't see an end to the hardship .

At the same time , the Kremlin has spent a lot of its hard currency softening the blow of the crisis , bolstering pensions and the welfare system , and that 's been appreciated by many Russians too .

Q : Is there much rose-tinted reminiscing about the past ?

A : There is on lots of levels , certainly among Russia 's pensioners , who gave their lives to the cause of communism , fought in World War II against Nazi Germany and perhaps enjoyed a privileged position in Soviet society .

There 's a great sense of loss about the collapse and nostalgia about what were seen as the good things : strength , order and global power . The younger Russians did n't have that experience of the Soviet Union .

Nevertheless , icons of that period such as former Soviet leader Josef Stalin are still viewed with affection by many people in part because of what he represented : Russia as a world power . The idea that he oversaw brutal oppression is very much ignored .

Q : Are there any changes in the way Russia sees the rest of the world ?

A : Yes , not least because in the Soviet period people did n't get to travel overseas and foreigners always viewed Russia with suspicion . This has started to change noticeably .

Russians are more visibly internationally . They go on holiday all over the world : Turkey , Thailand , the South of France , the Caribbean . They are much more assimilated into the global village than they ever were during the Soviet period . This has broadened people 's minds here and made them much more tolerant in their global outlook in general .

Q : Will Vladimir Putin remain key to Russia 's future ?

A : There is very little doubt in the mind of most Russians that Vladimir Putin remains not only a central figure in the country 's decision making , but is perhaps the main decision maker .

A recent opinion poll by an independent Levada-Center showed that 24 percent of Russians consider Putin to have the real power , compared to just 12 percent for his hand-picked successor , President Dmitry Medvedev .

As for the future , in the past year since Medvedev was sworn in , there is very little sign he has stamped his mark . It still looks to domestic and international audiences that Putin is calling the shots . At this point it 's hard to see any evidence that the situation is going to change .
