-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On one hand , Cristiano Ronaldo is still scoring goals for fun and Gareth Bale is starting to justify his mammoth transfer fee .

On the other , Real Madrid 's defensive game is appalling .

Carlo Ancelotti , who learned the game in a league where solidity at the back is everything , must be having kittens .

So would you if your team took a three-goal lead against the bottom team in La Liga , then proceeded to hang on nervously for a 3-2 win that so easily could 've ended in misery .

Especially when your previous outing started similarly and ended in a 7-3 scoreline . And even more so when your next game is a trip to Juventus in the Champions League .

`` A disaster , '' Ancelotti called Saturday 's second-half display against city rival Rayo Vallecano , a team which had conceded 27 goals and scored just eight in 11 previous Spanish league matches .

`` Against Sevilla we were 3-0 up and let them back into the game . Today the same thing happened and that is not a coincidence , '' the Italian told reporters .

`` We need to change and remove the superficiality we have on the pitch , the second half was a disaster . You can not let a team back into the game like that when you have the quality of Real Madrid .

`` It is something that we have to talk about in the dressing room . It has happened twice that being in front has changed the attitude out on the field , and that is not good . ''

Real had started so well , with Ronaldo waltzing down the left and firing in a low shot for a third-minute opener .

Rayo had a good penalty appeal turned down and a goal disallowed before Real 's marquee signing Bale laid on a perfect cross for Karim Benzema to head the second just after half an hour , having been set free by Xabi Alonso .

Alonso , making his first start this season , was a major factor in Real 's first-half dominance but the Spain midfielder did not come back out after the break due to another fitness problem which puts him in doubt for Tuesday 's trip to Italy .

Nonetheless , Bale was again the provider as Ronaldo punished Rayo at the near post soon after the interval , putting the Portugal captain above Atletico Madrid 's Diego Costa in the Pichichi standings with his 13th league goal this season .

It was downhill from there for Real .

Vallecano won two penalties in quick succession -- both converted by Jonathan Viera , one coming after Joaquin Larrivey hit the bar -- while Diego Lopez did well to tip Alberto Bueno 's shot onto the post .

The result left third-placed Real six points behind Barcelona -- which won 1-0 against Espanyol on Friday -- and two behind Atletico , which hosts Athletic Bilbao on Sunday .

Real Sociedad moved up to seventh with a 5-0 drubbing of Osasuna , while Almeria climbed off the bottom on goal difference with a 1-0 win over Valladolid .

Celta Vigo moved away from the bottom three with a 1-0 win at Sevilla -- which had conceded seven against Real in midweek .

In Italy , Napoli and Juventus moved to within two points of Serie A leader Roma with respective victories on Saturday .

Second-placed Napoli , which hosts Marseille in the Champions League on Wednesday , beat Catania 2-1 with first-half goals from former Real Madrid forward Jose Callejon and Slovakian Marek Hamsik -- putting both on six in the league this season .

Juve , which needs to beat Real to have any chance of a place in the knockout stage , triumphed 1-0 at Parma thanks to a 77th-minute strike from midfielder Paul Pogba .

Struggling AC Milan lost 2-0 at home to fourth-placed Fiorentina ahead of Wednesday 's trip to Barcelona in Europe 's top club competition , further progress in which may be the key to the future of under-pressure coach Massimiliano Allegri .

His Rossoneri hold the second qualifying place above Scottish side Celtic , but languish 11th in Serie A -- 18 points behind pacesetting Roma , which will seek an unprecedented 11th successive win at Torino on Sunday .
