-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I turned 18 years old a week before Election Day in 1982 and was excited to exercise my newly earned right to vote . The first ballot I ever cast was for United States Senate . The race pitted a popular veteran Congresswoman against a political neophyte businessman who was the decided underdog . The underdog won . His name was Frank Lautenberg .

Sen. Lautenberg went on to win two more rough-and-tumble races before retiring . However , he jumped at the chance to return to Washington in 2002 , when incumbent Bob Torricelli , dragged down by ethics allegations , announced that he wanted to withdraw less than two months before the election . In a move that became known as `` the switcheroo , '' Democrats were allowed to put Lautenberg 's name on the ballot instead . He then coasted to a double digit win and did the same in 2008 .

Lautenberg was unabashedly liberal on social issues such as abortion , the environment , and gun control . His major legislative legacy , though , centers on transportation issues . He was a strong supporter of improving the country 's mass transit infrastructure including funding Amtrak .

Memories of his father 's early death attributed to unhealthy working conditions , though , kept Lautenberg fighting on the environmental front . In fact , he used transportation-related legislation to further his larger health and safety agenda . This included a smoking ban on airplanes , which was the first widespread limitation on using tobacco in public . He also created a de facto national drinking age by reducing federal highway funds for states whose minimum age was lower than 21 .

What I will remember most about Lautenberg is that he always stood his ground . He was never shy about telling you why he was right and the other guy was wrong . A Lautenberg opponent once described him as a `` swamp dog . '' While the senator initially bristled at the characterization , he took pride in having a street-fighter 's reputation .

Some observers thought that the octogenarian met his match in 2010 . That was when recently-elected New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- hardly a shrinking violet himself -- cancelled plans to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River to New York City . Lautenberg came out swinging , calling Christie 's decision one of `` the biggest public policy blunders in New Jersey 's history . '' The feud escalated , but Lautenberg would not back down . The two did n't really patch things up until they worked together to get federal aid for Hurricane Sandy recovery .

Lautenberg leaves tricky political question for Christie

Chris Christie now has the opportunity to appoint a replacement for Lautenberg . He is faced with the decision of either appointing a caretaker or giving an ally the ability to run as a sitting senator , while also clearing other Republicans from the field .

Coincidentally , the last time a New Jersey governor was faced with this decision was 1982 , after a Democratic senator had resigned . At the time , New Jersey Republicans had n't won a U.S. Senate seat in nearly 10 years . But Ronald Reagan had won the state by 13 points two years earlier and this was seen as a prime opportunity for the GOP .

Republican Gov. Tom Kean , who had won the closest gubernatorial election in state history only a few months before , opted to appoint a placeholder as a gesture of goodwill . As a result , it was Lautenberg who was able to squeeze out a come-from-behind 4-point win over Congresswoman Millicent Fenwick .

Christie is now faced with a similar prospect -- except that now the New Jersey GOP has n't claimed a U.S. Senate win in more than 40 years . New Jersey law has two conflicting statutes on whether a special election has to be held this year or can wait until 2014 . This could well end up in court .

If the election is held this year , whoever runs as the GOP standard-bearer for the remainder of the term could appear on the same ballot as the extremely popular Chris Christie . Considering the coattails potential of his almost certain re-election bid , there is no better time for Republicans to take this seat . If they win now , they will have a voter-tested incumbent running for a full term in 2014 .

Of course , a contested senate race could bring out Democratic voters who were apathetic about the governor 's race . This could cut into Christie 's winning margin , which he hopes will be large enough to use as a selling point in a 2016 presidential run . The risk is particularly high if the Democrats field a well-known and well-funded challenger like Newark Mayor Cory Booker .

Booker has been working to establish himself as the heir-apparent for 2014 -- which Lautenberg did not appreciate . A special election this year , though , may entice some of New Jersey 's sitting congressmen to make a run without having to give up their House seats . So it could be a crowded field .

Christie can also call a special election for the senate seat before the gubernatorial election in November . This could be a free-for-all with many Democrats and Republicans getting into the fray , although Democrats would have a greater chance of holding onto the seat in this scenario .

None of the possible contenders , though , can claim the pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps , Greatest Generation personal story that shaped Frank Lautenberg 's years of public service . Regardless of who fills the seat , one thing is clear : We will not see another `` swamp dog '' in the U.S. Senate .
