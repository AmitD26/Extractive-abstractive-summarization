Caracas , Venezuela -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Standing in his food shack under posters of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in a Caracas slum , 70-year-old Miguel Bigello relays his backhanded support for Barack Obama .

`` For all the deaths he 's caused , he 's not touched Latin America , '' he said . `` The other guy -LSB- Mitt Romney -RSB- is too radical . He will fight here for the oil . ''

The elderly man is an avid supporter of Chavez , his `` Comandante , '' and in the small wooden hut sits a carving of the face of Che Guevara as well as a poster depicting Latin American independence hero Símon Bolívar .

Bigello shares the view of his president . `` If I was from the U.S. , I 'd vote for Obama , '' Chavez said buoyantly on state television just a week before he won his third six-year term two weeks ago , potentially extending his tenure to two decades . `` Obama is a good guy . ''

Venezuela is still hungover from its own presidential election and in this fervently political country -- mostly thanks to Chavez 's ubiquity , strength of personality and polarizing policies -- the U.S. election campaign offers some light relief after a trying few months .

The contest between Chavez and Henrique Capriles , the Venezuelan opposition 's first real hope in 14 years , made the Romney-Obama matchup look like child 's play . Chavez welcomed his opponent to the ring in February by calling him a `` low-life pig '' who would be `` pulverized . '' There were no debates here as Chavez felt Capriles was below him . `` The eagle does not chase flies , '' said a defiant Chavez .

The self-styled socialist leader 's supporters see Obama taking a leaf out of Chavez 's book . `` Obama is working for the people just like Chavez , '' said Gomez Darwin , 42 , stood under a huge Che Guevara mural in a primarily Chavez-supporting Caracas barrio .

However , it is the contenders ' world views which really matter here . Gloria Torres helped organize prayer vigils for Chavez as he suffered cancer last year . `` Obama 's policies towards Latin America have n't been aggressive , '' she said , offering her support for the U.S. incumbent before adding : `` The other guy does n't seem to have any friendly intentions towards us ! ''

Venezuela has come up a number of times in Republican rhetoric during the U.S. race . Mitt Romney branded the Venezuelan government a `` threat to national security '' earlier this year , adding that Chavez had spread `` dictatorships and tyranny throughout Latin America . ''

Romney 's running mate , Paul Ryan , added : `` In a Mitt Romney administration , we will not keep practicing this policy of appeasement ... We will be tough on -LSB- Cuban President Raúl -RSB- Castro , tough on Chavez . It 's because we know that 's the right policy for our country . ''

This antagonism from the Romney camp towards Chavez -- compared to Obama 's softer approach -- has attracted some of Venezuela 's more wealthy hard-line opposition .

`` Romney named Chavez in his manifesto ; Obama did n't , '' said Aixa Armas , eating breakfast at one of Caracas ' high-end hotels . `` Obama has closed his eyes to the problem , a regional problem , and he is too friendly with Chavez . ''

The lubricant between Caracas and Washington is the world 's highest oil reserves on which Chavez sits . It is that wealth that has kept Venezuela 's economy from collapsing -- despite epic mismanagement which has led to the region 's highest inflation rate and a severe shortage of U.S. dollars . America is Venezuela 's biggest oil market and the Latin American country is among the top five exporters to the U.S. .

`` The U.S. remains the only actual customer paying cash and at full-price , '' said Russ Dallen , head trader at Caracas ' BBO Financial Services . `` Romney may want to use that leverage to stop subsidizing a thorn in America 's side . ''

Dallen adds that Venezuela , or at least the Chavez government , needs oil prices to stay high , and Obama may be a safer bet for that . `` Obama is more willing to tolerate high gasoline prices because gas at $ 4 a gallon makes people more willing to invest in alternative technologies and for those technologies to be more cost effective . ''

Chavez is unlikely to be thinking in such depth . His support for Obama recently marks the apex of the 58-year-old strongman 's relations with Washington since coming to power in 1999 . The infamous nadir came in 2006 when Chavez stood at the United Nations lectern , theatrically sniffing the air . `` The devil came here yesterday , '' he said , a day after former President George W Bush 's speech . `` It smells of sulfur still . '' He then went onto describe Bush 's `` domination , exploitation , and pillage of the peoples of the world . ''

Chavez quipped two weeks ago that Obama would support him too , had he been born in Venezuela 's slums . After some shaky relations , Chavez is prepared to start again . `` With the likely triumph of Obama , and the extreme right defeated both here and there -LSB- in the U.S. -RSB- , I hope we can start a new period of normal relations .
