-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South Sudanese government forces have recaptured the key town of Bor from rebels after fierce fighting , the town 's mayor said Saturday .

Bor , the strategically important capital city of Jonglei state , north of South Sudan 's capital , Juba , has changed hands several times in a month of fighting .

The mayor of Bor , Nhial Majak Nhial , told CNN on Saturday that the rebels were fleeing and that government forces were on the ground .

He said that the defeated rebel force numbered well over 15,000 , and that the rebels had lost a lot of people in the fighting .

The conflict has also taken a heavy toll on civilians in the town . Local agencies estimate that between 1,200 and 1,400 civilians were killed when rebels held Bor between December 17 and 24 , the mayor said .

It 's not yet known how many more civilians lost their lives between December 31 , when the rebels recaptured the town , and the government 's reported victory Saturday .

But Nhial said more atrocities had been committed while the town was again in rebel hands .

`` They have taken all the cows , they have killed all the people , all the people who they 've found , they 've killed them , '' he said .

`` There will definitely be more than 1,200 civilians killed , '' he said . `` Absolutely more than that . The local population is more than 225,000 , and they can not all run . Anybody who could n't leave the town or the area is killed by the rebel forces . They 've even killed my own aunt . ''

The mayor said there was no food in his town , much of which has been burned to the ground , and he made an urgent appeal for humanitarian aid .

The area around Juba , about 125 miles -LRB- 200 kilometers -RRB- away , is now safe , he added .

Ethnic violence

The country erupted into violence on December 15 , when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup . Since then , militia members loyal to Machar have battled government forces loyal to President Salva Kiir .

The conflict has taken on an increasingly ethnic dimension , with widespread atrocities reported .

Representatives of the government and rebels have been holding talks in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , but violence continues to wrack the world 's newest country .

U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic warned Friday , at the end of a four-day visit to South Sudan , that one month of fighting had `` set South Sudan back a decade . ''

`` Mass atrocities have been committed by both sides . During my visit , I have received reports of mass killings , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary detention , enforced disappearances , sexual violence , the widespread destruction of property and the use of children in the conflict , '' Simonovic said .

`` Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands are now displaced , with about 70,000 people seeking protection in U.N. camps and 30,000 in the two U.N. compounds in Juba alone , '' he added .

Medecins Sans Frontieres said Wednesday that heavy fighting over the preceding few days had wounded hundreds of people and displaced thousands .

The humanitarian group , also known as Doctors Without Borders , said its teams had treated 116 people suffering from gunshot wounds in the towns of Malakal and Nasir in Upper Nile state amid clashes there and elsewhere .

The charity said Friday that it had been forced to suspend its activities in Malakal after its compound was looted by armed men who threatened its staff . `` This leaves thousands of people without much needed surgical and general health care -- a matter of huge concern to us , '' general director Arjan Hehenkamp said .

Museveni : Ugandan forces involved

The conflict has forced many South Sudanese to flee their homes .

The United Nations said this week that about 413,000 people are displaced within South Sudan in total , many of them women and children .

Another 80,000 people have fled to neighboring countries , more than half of them to Uganda , the United Nations said .

Speaking Wednesday at a summit of the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region in Angola , Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said some of his country 's troops were fighting alongside South Sudanese government forces , the Sudan People 's Liberation Army .

On January 13 , he said , `` the SPLA and elements of our army -LRB- the Uganda People 's Defence Forces -RRB- had a big battle with these rebel troops at a point about 90 kilometers from Juba where we inflicted a big defeat on them . ''

He added , `` Unfortunately , many lives were lost on the side of the rebels . We also took casualties and also had some dead . ''

Museveni criticized South Sudan 's governing SPLM party for failing to prevent what he said began as an internal political struggle from turning into a deadly conflict .

`` To turn a political problem into a military one , having mismanaged the political problem itself in the first place is not acceptable , '' he said .

South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war .
