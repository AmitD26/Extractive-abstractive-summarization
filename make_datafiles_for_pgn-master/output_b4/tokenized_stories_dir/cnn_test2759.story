Mexico City -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After awaiting reforms that may or may not come , thousands of young undocumented immigrants have abandoned their American Dream voluntarily or because they were deported . They still consider themselves DREAMers , but now they dream in Mexico .

`` I returned -LRB- to Mexico -RRB- because in the U.S. I always wanted to study dentistry . When I graduated from college , I ran into the problem that my great hope , the DREAM Act , still had not been approved , '' said Pedro Hernandez , who lived in Los Angeles for eight years .

The DREAM Act -- Development , Relief , and Education for Alien Minors -- would remove a roadblock to education and a future in the United States for such youths .

Undocumented immigrant youths have the right to study through high school . After that , they can study at private universities -- with high costs and without access to student loans -- or in public universities -- most of which charge them tuition at an `` out-of-state '' rate , which can be double what in-state students pay . Only some states have laws allowing undocumented students to attend state universities at in-state rates .

Those who manage to graduate tend to find job offers for unskilled workers , offering low wages .

`` I think I returned because I know that my parents left to give us a better education , and while I was there , I felt that all of that effort was for naught if I worked as a florist , caring for someone 's baby or working at a butcher shop '' 27-year-old Maru Ponce said . She immigrated to New York when she was 8 years old . Now she works in the Mexican capital as a sales operation analyst for a company and dreams of doing graduate studies in the same area .

In general , undocumented immigrants in the United States can not get a driver 's license or credit cards , and can not travel freely in the country .

`` I could n't move around like I wanted , and to go to school I had to drive with fear , '' said Moises Zarco , 27 . Originally from Mexico 's east-central state of Hidalgo , Zarco lived in Georgia for eight years . Six states recently approved laws that allow the undocumented to have driver 's licenses .

`` Everything seems nice on the surface , but you do n't really belong to that place and you 're never going to be American even if you have your papers , '' said Samantha Hernandez , who voluntarily returned to her city , Tijuana .

Between 2005 and 2010 , more than 1.4 million Mexicans returned to their country after living in the United States , according to the Pew Hispanic Center . It is estimated that more than 400,000 of those who returned in the past decade were youths , according to a government-supported survey .

In June 2012 , President Barack Obama instituted a policy of deferred action that granted lawful status to undocumented youths who had arrived before their 16th birthdays , were in school or graduated , and had no major criminal records .

The impact of returning

Only 5 % to 35 % of those who returned to Mexico during the past five years and remained there did not go back voluntarily , the Pew Hispanic Center estimates . The range is wide because `` data on who is sent back and what happens to them are sketchy , '' it says on its website .

The majority had experienced a lack of educational and job opportunities , and increases in anti-immigrant policies , the center says , citing government data from both countries .

In Zarco 's case , police stopped him on the state line between Georgia and Florida , and he was detained for being in the country illegally . He spent three months in a detention center in Miami and later returned to Mexico City , where his mother awaited .

`` When I arrived I was very happy to see my family , but at the same time very sad because I had left everything behind , '' he said . `` All my dreams had collapsed . ''

Zarco now works at a call center in Mexico City and dreams of studying dentistry at the National Autonomous University of Mexico .

The majority of these youths migrated to the United States because of their parents ' decisions and more than half crossed the border illegally . Initially it was n't them , but their parents who sought the dream .

`` My mother was living in the U.S. and she decided to take me there , '' Zarco said . `` I did n't want to go because I did n't want to leave my friends and my relatives . ''

Back in Mexico , he now tries to find his own dream .

In addition to having been deported or having returned voluntarily , these youths must unlearn the routines they grew into in the United States , where they spoke Spanish and ate tacos at home while they learned the American culture and honored the U.S. flag .

They find themselves immersed in a bicultural reality that can create feelings of not belonging , even when they return to Mexico .

`` I never felt like a U.S. citizen , I always felt like a Mexican , '' said Daniel Arenas , who lived in the United States for 14 years .

` From here and from there '

While it is true that the obstacles the youth face depend on individual circumstances , `` 100 % go through traumatic events because of the separation and lack of belonging , '' according to Jill Anderson , author of a book called `` The Other Dreamers . ''

Humiliation over a supposed failure and feelings arising from the combination of culture tend to be common , Anderson said .

`` It 's hard to understand that they can be both from here and from there , '' she said .

`` You belong to a country that you have not lived in , that you do n't know , '' said Marco Antonio Castillo , president of the Popular Assembly of Migrant Families , a Mexico City-based group that helps advise migrants .

The loneliness and confusion in dealing with the new environment can push many youths to join organized crime , Castillo said .

`` For example , those who arrive in -LRB- the state of -RRB- Guerrero , if they have a criminal record , will not find opportunities in the formal economy , '' Castillo said . `` But he can put his English to use for organized crime , acting as a translator or smuggler of drugs toward the United States . ''

Drowning in paperwork

Anderson leads a group that shares the name of her book , whose members insist on finding the Mexican Dream and seek opportunities in their country . The group , formed by youth immigrants who returned to Mexico , was born out of the impact they suffered upon their return , feeling lost among the legal paperwork and social customs . They used a Facebook page to orient themselves on how to maneuver through the Mexican bureaucracy .

Many do n't speak Spanish well and the Mexican system does n't have programs for social reinsertion .

`` The migrants do n't know how to do the paperwork and to what agencies to go to , '' Anderson said .

`` Returning to Mexico and not speaking Spanish or dressing a certain way , or liking a certain type of music , also creates conflict , '' Arenas said .

To study in Mexico , the education ministry requires that all documents be translated and bear the seal of the institute that issued them . Unable to complete this step , these youths `` are treated like undocumented immigrants in their own country , '' Anderson said .

Sometimes , a lack of family support or economic resources keep needed paperwork from being completed .

`` There are times when the schools in the United States ask for their former student to show up in person to pick up documents , even though they 've been deported , '' she said .

In most cases , the young immigrants left their families in the United States . They dream of returning to see them or to earn a livelihood in Mexico to bring them over . The loneliness and emotional exhaustion can bring feelings of not belonging to any place .

But that is not true in every case .

`` I felt that I arrived and was here in my place here in Mexico from day one , '' Hernandez said .

Once they adapt to Mexican society , many feel free . They enjoy not having to hide . They feel thankful for the country that once again is their home .

`` It 's true , I am achieving my Mexican Dream now in this moment , but my life is incomplete , '' said another youth , Pedro Hernandez . `` I am far from my family . ''
