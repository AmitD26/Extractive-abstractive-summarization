-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Floating high above the Earth , astronaut Karen Nyberg pointed her camera at a swirling white cloud spreading across the planet . Little did she know the devastation that was unfurling beneath .

This remarkable image of Super Typhoon Haiyan over the Philippines , was taken by the NASA astronaut during a five-month mission in space .

It was one of many specular photographs taken by Nyberg -- who in 2008 became the 50th woman in space -- and was retweeted thousands of times by her followers back on Earth .

CNN spoke to the mechanical engineering professor earlier this year , in a live broadcast from the International Space Station .

As she returned to Earth this week , we again caught up with the American astronaut to chat about her fascinating experiments and adjusting to life back on the blue planet .

CNN : What was it like , taking a photograph like that and realizing the impact it might have on Earth as you looked out the window ?

Karen Nyberg : It definitely makes you think , because it 's so beautiful when you look out the window . I could n't even fit the entire storm in one picture . I used a 50 millimeter lens to capture as much as I could , but just knowing the devastation underneath this beautiful cloud is pretty sad .

CNN : You 've also taken some other photographs which have been just as beautiful , and not caused such a devastating impact -- like sunrises over Earth .

KN : Yes , I love taking pictures and I enjoyed it more and more as the mission went on -- that 's probably one of the things I 'll miss the most . It was a great geography lesson for me too , to get these images from all over the world .

CNN : Do you see the world in the same way , as before you went up as an astronaut ?

KN : You actually do see it a little differently -- in a strange way you feel closer to everybody . I wish everybody could experience that .

CNN : What sort of experiments were you working on while you were up there ?

KN : A lot of the experiments were being done on us -- looking at our eyesight and how that changes , and looking at our bone density and how that changes by the effects of micro gravity .

We also did a lot of experiments on fluids and combustion -- a lot of these are for developing systems to travel further into outer space , and a lot of them will really benefit what we 're doing on Earth .

CNN : A lot of astronauts apparently experience long-term vision problems after returning to Earth -- is that something that 's happened to you , and do you know what causes it ?

KN : I had some vision changes during my stay on the space station , but it 's coming back to normal again -- I think that 's happened frequently to other astronauts . I have n't experienced long-term changes but we have done quite intensive studies on me and my crew mates .

CNN : What are other changes you 've noticed since coming back to Earth ?

KN : It seems like I never left in a lot of ways -- it 's almost a time warp . You get back to home and work , and it 's like you were never away . I think I 'll need to go back and look at my pictures pretty soon and reminisce .
