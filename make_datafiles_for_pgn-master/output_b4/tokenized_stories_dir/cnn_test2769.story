-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly a year after the presidential election , the excitement of Barack Obama 's campaign has faded into the reality of an Obama White House .

As observers try to determine what time it is in American politics , they arrive at opposite conclusions .

To some , said Tulane University political scientist Thomas Langston , Obama is like Jimmy Carter , and the nation will soon hammer the nails into the coffin of a dying Democratic coalition just as voters , tired of the Carter `` malaise '' era , handed the White House to Republicans in 1980 .

To others , Obama has come to usher in a new understanding of the relationship between the government and the people . To them , Langston said , it 's the dawning of a new age , as depicted in a famous 1984 Ronald Reagan campaign ad that declared , `` It 's morning again in America . ''

Both Obama and Carter were elected into office at a time when voters were hungry for change . Carter represented the antithesis of President Nixon and a break from the disillusionment and mistrust of government caused by the Watergate scandal .

Carter , like Obama , learned the ropes in a state Senate . Critics accused Carter of being inexperienced , having served one term as the governor of Georgia . But the Democratic candidate presented himself as a politician outside of politics and a reformer uninterested in partisan games .

`` With Carter himself , there was a sense of a kind of national renewal in some ways that people have said has been true after the very difficult years of the Bush presidency , '' said Russell Riley , chair of the Miller Center 's Presidential Oral History Program at the University of Virginia .

Shortly after taking office , Carter 's approval rating peaked at 75 percent but dropped to the low 40s in a little more than a year . He entered office weighed down by a sagging economy , and eventually , the energy crisis , the Soviet Union 's invasion of Afghanistan and the Iranian hostage crisis took a toll on his administration .

`` He ended his presidency , of course , holed up in the White House as a virtual captive himself of the Iranian hostage takers , '' Langston said .

The parallels to Carter come primarily from Obama 's Republican critics . Florida Gov. Charlie Crist speculated last month that a Carter-esque loss `` may happen again , '' and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has predicted that a Republican resurgence -- like the one he led in the mid '90s -- could be just around the corner .

`` Carter is held up as the model of the ineffectual president -- a saint of a man but an ineffectual president . And so when people compare Obama to Carter , that is an attack , '' said David Gergen , a senior political analyst for CNN who also worked in the Nixon , Ford , Reagan and Clinton administrations .

The comparison to Carter , Gergen said , is more of a danger sign for Obama than it is a reality because it shows how the storyline has changed .

When Obama first came into office , observers likened him to some of the most successful presidents in U.S. history , such as Franklin Roosevelt , Gergen said . Now , Obama 's also being compared to a president who did n't live up to expectations .

The Carter comparison shows how much polarization has occurred in the country since the election , Gergen said .

Under Carter , there was also a sense of polarization -- but it was in the president 's party . The liberal wing of the Democrats felt abandoned to the point that Sen. Edward Kennedy , one of the top liberals in Congress , challenged Carter in his 1980 re-election bid . Kennedy came up short , but his bid severely weakened Carter and contributed to his eventual defeat in the 1980 election to Reagan , Riley said .

While the similarities are not lost on Riley , what 's more telling is the `` most important mistake that -LSB- Obama -RSB- did n't make . ''

When Carter took office , there were Democrats with executive branch experience available , but he did n't want to use them . `` Carter was criticized for bringing in the ` Georgia Mafia , ' '' Riley said , referring to Carter 's decision to give key positions to people from his home state .

Obama , however , stacked his bench with pros from the Clinton administration . He brought in some advisers from Chicago , Illinois , some from Washington and others such as Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel with deep ties to both places .

That move was critical , Riley said , `` because if you 've got seasoned people in these positions , they 're much more likely to make adjustments and to know Capitol Hill in a way that will allow them to weather the kinds of problems that were common to both Carter and Obama . ''

John Geer , a Vanderbilt University political scientist , said the comparisons to Carter are weak .

`` Jimmy Carter is a very rare exception in American history . Most first-term presidents get a second term , '' he said , adding that it 's especially rare since Carter 's term came on the heels of previous Republican rule .

President George H.W. Bush also served one term , but it came after eight years of Republican control of the White House .

The more analogous comparison so far , Geer said , is to Reagan , who also entered the White House with a full plate of foreign policy problems -- mostly surrounding the Cold War -- and a major economic crisis at hand .

Reagan was a gifted politician , Geer said . He was known as an inspiring communicator , and his appeal crossed party lines . Like Obama , polls showed that Reagan was more popular than his policies . More than 20 years after he left the White House , Republicans still look to him as the last great face of the party .

`` Reagan continues to be the touchstone , the smiling Buddha figure . Everybody rubs his belly for good luck , '' Langston said . `` Like the smiling Buddha , he is whatever you want him to be . ''

In his book `` The Audacity of Hope , '' Obama wrote that although he and Reagan had differing political viewpoints , he understands the Republican president 's appeal .

`` Reagan spoke to America 's longing for order , our need to believe that we are not simply subject to blind , impersonal forces but that we can shape our individual and collective destinies , so long as we rediscover the traditional values of hard work , patriotism , personal responsibility , optimism , and faith , '' he wrote .

Gergen , who was director of communications for Reagan , said the comparisons to Reagan are strained because of their opposite governing styles . Where as Obama tries to draw consensus , Reagan drew lines , he said .

`` Reagan was a conviction politician , and Barack Obama is a consensus-seeking politician , '' Gergen said . `` Barack Obama was a magical figure in his campaign , ran an extremely good campaign , but also based it more on the sense of hope and change as ideas , the particular policy solutions , Ã  la Reagan . ''

Martin Anderson , an economic policy adviser to Reagan , said Obama and Reagan faced similar problems in their first year but approached them with different solutions .

Faced with an economic crisis , Reagan 's strategy was to reduce taxes , let the American people figure out what to do and then find out what went wrong , Anderson said .

After Reagan cut taxes in his first year , there were no immediate changes . `` It looked terrible , and it did n't look very good during the second year . And then it began to catch and it worked ... and it was really terrific on the third and the fourth and the fifth and so on , '' Anderson said . As for Obama 's approach to country 's economic woes -- it 's too early to tell what will happen , he said .

In his first few months in office , Reagan also went through a game-changing experience that had ramifications for both him and the country : He got shot .

`` He came very close to dying . It was right down next to his heart . Just stunned everything , stunned everybody , '' Anderson recalled .

But within weeks , Reagan was back at work -- with a positive attitude and good sense of humor .

`` And the Democrats -- after he came to life again -- they took a deep sigh and said , ` OK , you can do whatever you want , ' '' Anderson said .

As tragic as the 1981 assassination attempt was , Reagan 's quick recovery -- and the sympathy from Democrats -- provided momentum for the president 's agenda .

`` The first year is a very tough year for any president , '' Anderson said , noting that each year thereafter is `` dramatically different . '' Asked what he thinks about comparisons to Carter and Reagan , Anderson replied , `` You know who he looks like ? Obama . ''

Looking to administrations past , Obama can learn a valuable lesson , Gergen said .

`` Do n't spend time wallowing in arguments about who you might be -- spend time worrying about who you are and worrying about governing . ''

The similarities between Obama and his predecessors , while interesting to discuss , are not foreboding , Riley said .

`` There is no exact historical parallel to what we are looking at right now . There are bits and pieces here and there , '' he said . It 's impossible , however to take those similarities and `` piece out from them a guaranteed scenario that he is going to end up in the same place . ''

That idea , he said , is perhaps best summed up in a quote attributed to Mark Twain : `` History does n't repeat itself , it rhymes . ''
