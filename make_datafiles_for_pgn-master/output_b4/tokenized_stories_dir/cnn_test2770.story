-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sitting inside the quaint tasting room of Chateau O'Brien , an award-winning French-style winery in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Northern Virginia , co-owner Debbie O'Brien pours some of the best red wine in the region .

The original structure for Chateau O'Brien was an old French farmhouse that Howard O'Brien , Debbie 's husband , transformed into a first-class winery known for its large copper doors , wrap-around sundeck and rich aged wines that include a medium-bodied Malbec , a full-bodied Cabernet Franc , an elegant Petit Verdot , and the fast-selling Tannat Limited Reserve and Late Harvest Tannat .

The secret to Chateau O'Brien 's success : `` We grow our own grapes , '' said Howard O'Brien , who owns three sprawling Virginia vineyards .

Chateau O'Brien is one of about 230 wineries in the state , many of them small , boutique operations that specialize in regional wines . Virginia is relatively new to the wine-making industry by European standards , but it 's quickly gaining notoriety among wine enthusiasts from across the country . Virginia ranks fifth in the nation for number of wineries and for wine grape production .

As evidence of the emerging quality of Virginia wines , the U.S. Treasury Department designated Middleburg , Virginia , as the newest American Viticulture Area .

Many wineries in Northern Virginia are situated about 50 miles from Washington , which makes the experience great for day trips or weekend retreats .

Tasting fees at most Northern Virginia wineries range from $ 6 to $ 15 per person , and while some Virginia wine loyalists are somewhat optimistically comparing the region to Napa Valley and Sonoma , there are indeed several standouts that can compete with some of the nation 's better wineries .

Take Delaplane Cellars , a family winery owned by Jim and Betsy Dolphin that boasts panoramic views of the Northern Virginia mountains in a spacious , contemporary setting . At Delaplane , the wine is tasty and the amenities do n't stop at the views : The homemade sausage is excellent and the Dolphins also serve generous portions of olive oil and freshly ground pepper for dipping . On weekends , Delaplane pairs tastings with live jazz .

Wines at Delaplane Cellars include crisp whites like Chardonnay and Viognier and complex red wines that include Melange Rouge , William 's Gap Reserve , and Cabernet Franc .

`` All of our wines are made from authentic Virginia grapes , '' according to Delaplane 's website . `` Our goal is to craft delicious single vineyard wines . ''

It must be working .

On a recent visit to Delaplane Cellars , the large tasting room was crowded and every table overlooking the mountains was filled . I overheard several people talking about how much they enjoyed the wine , and a couple next to me bought six bottles immediately after their tasting . Do n't leave without trying the Cabernet Franc with the homemade sausage ; it 's a real treat .

If you want to bring the kids along , consider Barrel Oak Winery , a family-friendly operation where you can take your own picnic lunch . The winery also offers complimentary juice boxes for children .

For red wines only , visit Boxwood Wineries in Middleburg , Virginia , a picturesque property owned by John Kent Cooke , the former owner of the NFL 's Washington Redskins . The winery features Merlot , Malbec , Cabernet Franc , Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon . Boxwood has received three Decanter Magazine World Wine Awards and has been featured in The Washington Post and Washingtonian Magazine .

But for customers seeking a personal touch , there 's an unexpected pleasure that comes with visiting Chateau O'Brien : The O'Briens .

Howard , a passionate wine expert from New York , and Debbie , a charming businesswoman from Alabama , both enjoy conversing with customers and keeping them smiling .

Debbie , who is extremely familiar with the art of wine-making , also prepares snack offerings such as ham and cheese croissants , fine cheese plates , fresh baguettes and gourmet chocolates to pair with wines that age two or three years in French oak barrels . On March 9 and 10 , the winery is hosting a St. Patrick 's weekend celebration with live Irish music and traditional Irish fare for $ 25 per person .

Since Chateau O'Brien opened in 2006 , the O'Briens are fast becoming known for their Tannat , a grape traditionally grown in Southern France and Uruguay . Since the Tannat flourishes in humid climates , Virginia is the perfect region to harvest the grape . O'Brien 's Tannat has won awards in New York and internationally .

`` We wait for the grapes to become ripe , not when it 's convenient to serve the wine , '' O'Brien said . `` It 's all about the fruit -- and patience . ''

Here 's a tip : Spend a few extra bucks -LRB- $ 35 per person -RRB- for the private tasting in Howard 's stone-covered cellar where he regales guests with stories from long ago summers and serves fine wine only sold in the private cellar . You wo n't regret it .

Wine country stays

Consider staying in Paris -- Paris , Virginia , that is . The Ashby Inn & Restaurant is only a 10-minute drive from Delaplane Cellars . It 's a great place to spend one night or a weekend after visiting Virginia 's wineries and driving through the countryside . The inn offers 10 charming rooms on three acres -- six rooms in the main house and four in the school house . The restaurant is open for breakfast , lunch and dinner . Take time out to rent a bike and pedal quietly around the peaceful grounds or drive 20 minutes to the nearest golf course .

For a more upscale hotel experience and a romantic getaway , try the Goodstone Inn & Restaurant in Middleburg . It 's a bit pricey , but for special occasions like birthdays , anniversaries or Valentine 's Day , you wo n't be disappointed .

The property sits on 265 acres of rolling pastures in the shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains . There are 18 rooms in six separate cottages . The rooms are beautiful and well-appointed , some with Jacuzzis . There 's also a common area downstairs , a full kitchen with utensils and refrigerators stocked with bottled water . Get a room on the top floors for better views . The restaurant serves great food for breakfast , lunch and dinner .

Take a stroll around the property , swim in the pool , and here 's a tip : Grab a bottle of wine and a blanket and pick your spot on the sprawling pasture at sunset . Watching the burnt-orange sun slowly dropping behind the mountains is a perfect end to a great day .
