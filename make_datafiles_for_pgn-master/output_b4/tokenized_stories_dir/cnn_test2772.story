-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kevin Chapman , the college graduate student who led the team that recently unearthed Civil War artifacts at the site of a Confederate prison in Georgia , recalls two visitors who came one day to watch one of the digs .

Doug Carter of Fayetteville , Georgia , and Nina Raeth of North Augusta , South Carolina , traveled in April to Magnolia Springs State Park , unaware of each other and the bond they shared .

Carter brought a `` fowling '' shotgun that belonged to his great-grandfather , Jesse Taliaferro Carter , who was a Confederate prison guard at Andersonville and Camp Lawton , site of Chapman 's work .

Raeth , a great-granddaughter of a Union prisoner who also was at Andersonville and Lawton , came out of curiosity .

`` It was kind of a magical day , '' said Chapman , a student at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro .

Since then , Carter and Raeth have become good friends , sharing research and family stories .

Jesse T. Carter was only 17 when he went off to war . After serving as a guard he was wounded in battle in South Carolina and ended the war at Columbus , Georgia . He died in 1924 .

Raeth 's ancestor , Sebastian Glamser , was a German immigrant who moved to Little Sandusky , Ohio , a few years before the Civil War . He served with the 37th Ohio , Company F.

`` Doug has been such a source of information for me , '' said Raeth , who grew up in Michigan .

Her great-grandfather was captured in Atlanta in July 1864 . After serving time in the prison camps , he was paroled in Virginia . He died in 1911 .

Part of the family lore is how Glamser tried to hang on while in prison .

One of his few possessions was a lice comb . `` He loaned it -LRB- to other prisoners -RRB- for a ration of food , '' Raeth said .

The descendants noted that both inmates and guards suffered late in the war .

`` They shared a deplorable condition , '' said Carter . `` They were both American soldiers . ''

Chapman , 36 , said the chance meeting amplified what an archaeological excavation is really about -- understanding the lives and circumstances of the people who left personal belongings behind .

`` It 's huge , '' Chapman said of the discovery of the stockade 's exact location and the first 200 artifacts .

`` This was a very scientific survey , '' said the Summerville , Georgia , native .

Chapman was the star of Wednesday 's formal announcement of the major find . Carter and Raeth also were on hand .

`` He realized he was on to something that was the work of a lifetime , '' said Mark Musaus , deputy regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , which recently hired Chapman to work part time as an archaeological technician .

Chapman and fellow Georgia Southern students used strings , posts and grid patterns to work a tree-covered site on the grounds of Bo Ginn National Fish Hatchery next to Magnolia Springs State Park near Millen . In addition to the low-tech equipment , which included shovels , they also employed high-tech ground-penetrating radar and LIDAR , a device that studies soil beneath vegetation .

Chapman and Sue M. Moore , an anthropology professor at the university , said they did n't expect to find artifacts . Their target was pinpointing the camp 's stockade .

Matt Luke , another student on the team , said technology one day will allow visitors to use devices to get a virtual look at artifacts and models of structures . For example , a visitor to the dig site could use a smart phone that would bring in GPS coordinates to show a model of the stockade wall .

So far , Chapman said , the students are unearthing many artifacts in clusters , indicating they may have been left in tents or shelters .

The discovery at Camp Lawton is expected to boost tourism in economically struggling Jenkins County as well as awareness of the anthropology program at Georgia Southern University , about a half hour south in Statesboro .

`` It gives us visibility if nothing else , '' said Moore . `` I 'm just ecstatic my students were involved . ''

Aptly , Chapman 's background has elements of the military and of corrections .

He served in the U.S. armed forces in Bosnia , learning the importance of the small things , like the bent picture frame he found at the Lawton site .

`` It reminds me of the things you left behind , '' he said .

He also works part time as a bail bondsman at Akins & Sasseen Bonding Co. in Statesboro and has worked at the Bulloch County Jail .

`` Prisoners have not changed much over time , '' Chapman said . `` They 've always improvised . ''
