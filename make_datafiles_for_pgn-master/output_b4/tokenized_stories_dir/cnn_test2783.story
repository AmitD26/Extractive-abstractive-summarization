New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man arrested in police probes following the apparent drug overdose death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to drug charges , and two co-defendants in the case had not-guilty pleas entered for them at their arraignment .

Robert Vineberg , 57 , who remains in jail after his bail was set Friday at nearly a quarter of a million dollars total , was arraigned on three counts of criminal possession of heroin . He pleaded not guilty to all charges , according to his attorney Edward Kratt .

Kratt filed a motion seeking judicial diversion through the drug diversion court , which is a part of the New York State Supreme Court . If the motion is accepted by the judge , Vineberg will be evaluated for drug treatment . This means the charges against Vineberg 's could eventually be dropped if the motion goes through and Vineberg is successful in treatment , Kratt told CNN .

Vineberg has been a heroin addict for `` quite a while , '' said his attorney .

They expect a decision regarding the motion on March 10 .

The judge entered a not-guilty plea for Juliana Luchkiw and Max Rosenblum , both 22 , who appeared in court Monday charged with one count of criminal possession of cocaine , according to Rosenblum 's attorney , Daniel Hochheiser .

The three were arrested earlier this month as police investigated drugs found in Philip Seymour Hoffman 's apartment . The Academy Award-winning actor was found dead February 2 of an apparent drug overdose . Investigators found close to 50 packets of what they believe to be heroin in the actor 's apartment .

Police immediately set out to track down Hoffman 's source for heroin . Vineberg , Luchkiw , and Rosenblum were arrested on February 4 after police raided a Manhattan apartment , recovering 350 small plastic bags of what is believed to be heroin with labels that match those found at Hoffman 's residence , according to officials .

Vineberg had Hoffman 's phone number stored in his phone , according to law enforcement .

Vineberg hopes to make bail this week , which is set at $ 40,000 cash and $ 200,000 bond , according to his attorney .
