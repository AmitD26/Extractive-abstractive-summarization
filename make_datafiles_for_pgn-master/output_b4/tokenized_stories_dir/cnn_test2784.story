Baghdad , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Iraqi government accused a manufacturer of supplying the country with some fake bomb detectors and said Tuesday it plans to sue the company .

However , government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said that three Iraqi investigations into the devices determined most of the bomb detectors are working , although some are fake and ineffective . He did not name the detectors in his statement or explain the investigations .

The alleged fakes have been removed from Iraqi streets and have been replaced by functioning ones , al-Dabbagh said . It was not immediately clear how many of such devices were replaced .

Those involved in contracting or importing those devices will be investigated , he said , and the government will sue the manufacturing company . He did not name the firm .

Earlier this year , the Iraqi government announced it would investigate the ADE651 after concerns surfaced the device was a hoax .

The handheld device is commonly used at checkpoints in Iraq and Afghanistan to detect explosives .

The British government has banned the ADE651 , made by British firm ATSC , from being exported .

The company declined to comment to CNN earlier this month , citing ongoing legal action . There was no immediate response to Iraq 's announcement Tuesday .

The firm 's Web site said it was under repair , and no one answered calls Tuesday to a phone number listed for the company .

Police have arrested and questioned Jim McCormick , managing director of ATSC , alleging suspicion of fraud .

Also this month , the Thai government said a similar device , the GT200 , failed rigorous tests carried out by scientists and the army in Thailand . The government said it was looking into the possibility of legal action against its manufacturer .

The device 's manufacturer , Britain-based Global Technical , disputed the tests ' results . It said the results were `` completely at odds with other tests carried out by independent bodies '' and with `` the experience of the large number of users of this product all over the world . ''

Both the ADE651 and GT200 use technology that some scientists dismiss as little more than a car antenna mounted on a plastic box designed to act much the way a dowsing rod is used to find water .
