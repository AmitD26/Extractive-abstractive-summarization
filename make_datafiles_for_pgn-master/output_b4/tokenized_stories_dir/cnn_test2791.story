-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of Africans have expressed their hopes that the next pope will be the first from their continent -- with a majority believing it would mean the Catholic Church becoming more conservative .

The survey of 20,000 people , conducted on mobile phones across 11 nations , also exposed big divisions among Africans about the future direction of the church , including faith , homosexuality and race .

`` An African pope will bring about more unity on the continent and confidence in Africans , '' said one woman from Zimbabwe , while a young Nigerian man polled said an African pope `` will eradicate immoralities , such as same-sex marriage . ''

CNN commissioned the survey , partnering with Jana.com , which has pioneered polling in developing countries with fast-growing mobile networks .

Jana , meaning ` people ' in Sanskrit , rewards participants in their mobile phone surveys with additional air time .

Mobile phone use has skyrocketed in Africa , climbing from 9.2 million subscribers in 2000 to more than 648 million subscribers in 2011 -- more users than the U.S. or the European Union , according to the World Bank .

More than 80 % of those surveyed believe their continent is ready for an African pope , but only 61 % thought the rest of the world was too .

Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana is viewed by Vatican observers as the top African contender , according to John Allen , CNN analyst and correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter .

Most respondents -LRB- 86 % -RRB- thought an African pope would increase support for Catholicism in Africa , while just over 50 % believed the church would become more conservative if that happened . On the other hand , 21 % thought that it would become less conservative .

`` It would help strengthen the faith and belief of all African Catholics , '' said one Ghanaian . `` They will feel a part of the church . ''

`` Will he stop the ongoing war in some African countries ? '' asked a Namibian responder .

`` He may be like the rest of them and just stay in the church ; anyway they do n't make any difference in Africa . ''

A Zimbabwean man surveyed also said he feared that an African pope would not be treated equally to other popes .

`` I think at first people might not accept him and it would take a long time for him to blend in , so his impact will not be that great . ''

Jana conducted the poll between 7-11 March 2013 with mobile phone users from Lesotho , Rwanda , Namibia , Tanzania , Zambia , Zimbabwe , Uganda , South Africa , Kenya , Ghana , and Nigeria .
