-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama should use the breathing space provided by the fiscal-cliff compromise to address some of the issues that he shelved during his last term . One of the most urgent is child farm labor . Perhaps the least protected , underpaid work force in American labor , children are often the go-to workers for farms looking to cut costs .

It 's easy to see why . The Department of Labor permits farms to pay employees under 20 as little as $ 4.25 per hour . -LRB- By comparison , the federal minimum wage is $ 7.25 . -RRB- And unlike their counterparts in retail and service , child farm laborers can legally work unlimited hours at any hour of day or night .

The numbers are hard to estimate , but between direct hiring , hiring through labor contractors , and off-the-books work beside parents or for cash , perhaps 400,000 children , some as young as 6 , weed and harvest for commercial farms . A Human Rights Watch 2010 study shows that children laboring for hire on farms routinely work more than 10 hours per day .

As if this were not bad enough , few labor safety regulations apply . Children 14 and older can work long hours at all but the most dangerous farm jobs without their parents ' consent , if they do not miss school . Children 12 and older can too , as long as their parents agree . Unlike teen retail and service workers , agricultural laborers 16 and older are permitted to operate hazardous machinery and to work even during school hours .

In addition , Human Rights Watch reports that child farm laborers are exposed to dangerous pesticides ; have inadequate access to water and bathrooms ; fall ill from heat stroke ; suffer sexual harassment ; experience repetitive-motion injuries ; rarely receive protective equipment like gloves and boots ; and usually earn less than the minimum wage . Sometimes they earn nothing .

Little is being done to guarantee their safety . In 2011 Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis proposed more stringent agricultural labor rules for children under 16 , but Obama scrapped them just eight months later .

Adoption of the new rules would be no guarantee of enforcement , however . According to the 2010 Human Rights Watch report , the Department of Labor employees were spread so thin that , despite widespread reports of infractions they found only 36 child labor violations and two child hazardous order violations in agriculture nationwide .

This lack of oversight has dire , sometimes fatal , consequences . Last July , for instance , 15-year-old Curvin Kropf , an employee at a small family farm near Deer Grove , Illinois , died when he fell off the piece of heavy farm equipment he was operating , and it crushed him . According to the Bureau County Republican , he was the fifth child in fewer than two years to die at work on Sauk Valley farms .

If this year follows trends , Curvin will be only one of at least 100 children below the age of 18 killed on American farms , not to mention the 23,000 who will be injured badly enough to require hospital admission . According to Center for Disease Control and Prevention statistics , agriculture is one of the most dangerous industries . It is the most dangerous for children , accounting for about half of child worker deaths annually .

The United States has a long tradition of training children in the craft of farming on family farms . At least 500,000 children help to work their families ' farms today .

Farm parents , their children , and the American Farm Bureau objected strenuously to the proposed new rules . Although children working on their parents ' farms would specifically have been exempted from them , it was partly in response to worries about government interference in families and loss of opportunities for children to learn agricultural skills that the Obama administration shelved them .

Whatever you think of family farms , however , many child agricultural workers do n't work for their parents or acquaintances . Despite exposure to all the hazards , these children never learn the craft of farming , nor do most of them have the legal right to the minimum wage . And until the economy stabilizes , the savings farms realize by hiring children makes it likely that even more of them will be subject to the dangers of farm work .

We have a responsibility for their safety . As one of the first acts of his new term , Obama should reopen the child agricultural labor proposal he shelved in spring of 2012 . Surely , farm labor standards for children can be strengthened without killing off 4-H or Future Farmers of America .

Second , the Department of Labor must institute age , wage , hour and safety regulations that meet the standards set by retail and service industry rules . Children in agriculture should not be exposed to more risks , longer hours , and lower wages at younger ages than children in other jobs .

Finally , the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration must allocate the funds necessary for meaningful enforcement of child labor violations . Unenforced rules wo n't protect the nearly million other children who work on farms .

Agriculture is a great American tradition . Let 's make sure it 's not one our children have to die for .
