Bangkok , Thailand -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A prominent Thai political activist was shot and wounded Wednesday , the day after the national government declared a state of emergency amid violence-plagued protests in Bangkok , a police official said .

Unidentified people in a pickup truck opened fire on Kwanchai Praipana , a local leader of the pro-government `` red shirt '' movement , outside his home in Udon Thani province in northeastern Thailand , said police official Col. Kovit Charionwattanasak .

His wounds are n't life-threatening , Kovit said .

Police suspect the shooting may be politically motivated , he said , but they have n't ruled out a connection to Kwanchai 's `` personal conflicts . ''

The attack is likely to fan tensions in Thailand 's political crisis . In Bangkok , demonstrations against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra have been hit by attacks with explosives in the past week that have killed one person and wounded dozens .

The violence , whose perpetrators have n't been identified , prompted authorities to impose the state of emergency , which went into effect Wednesday and lasts 60 days .

The emergency decree gives authorities the power to impose curfews , detain suspects without court permission , censor media and declare parts of the capital off-limits .

Political divide

The red shirts -- who draw their support from the populous , less affluent northeast of Thailand -- support Yingluck 's government . On the other side of the country 's political divide are the anti-government protesters , who are loosely allied with the opposition Democrat Party .

Since the protesters began their campaign against Yingluck 's government in November , at least nine people have died and hundreds have been wounded , according to authorities .

In a bid to resolve the crisis , Yingluck dissolved parliament last month and called for new elections to be held February 2 .

But the move has done little to appease protesters . They have called on Yingluck to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected `` people 's council , '' which would see through electoral and political changes .

They want the elections postponed , and the Democrat Party has said it will boycott the vote .

Protesters remain on streets

Thailand 's national security chief , Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathubut said the emergency decree had been considered because `` we are predicting that -LRB- the -RRB- situation might get more violent '' as the vote nears .

`` We are witnessing more gun shootings and bomb incidents on the streets of Bangkok , '' he said .

Thousands of protesters have remained on the streets ahead of the elections .

The latest round of demonstrations , which began last week , was aimed at shutting down Bangkok . They have succeeded in disrupting traffic at major intersections in the city , but their numbers have fallen significantly since the initial rallies .

Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , the older brother of Yingluck .

Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas . If he returns , he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction , which he says was politically motivated .

They say Yingluck is merely a puppet of Thaksin , a divisive figure who built his support on populist policies that pleased residents of the north and northeast . Yingluck has repeatedly denied her brother calls the shots in the government .

The protest movement in Bangkok began as an angry response to a botched attempt by Yingluck 's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for Thaksin 's return .

Thailand 's worst bout of civil unrest took place in 2010 , when the government -- run at the time by the Democrat Party -- ordered a crackdown on red shirt protesters , leaving about 90 people dead .
