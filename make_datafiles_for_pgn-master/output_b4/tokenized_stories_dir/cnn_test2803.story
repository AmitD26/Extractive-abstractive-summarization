-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A deputy stopped to help a motorist in Utah on Thursday , and the motorist allegedly shot him dead . Then he wounded two more deputies while running from the law .

That 's how Utah County Sheriff Jim Tracy described a high-speed , bullet-riddled rampage that went on for 50 miles across two counties , until officers were able to corner a suspect .

They critically wounded him in a shootout -- it was the fourth time the man opened fire while on the run , the sheriff said .

The slain officer was Sgt. Cory Wride , a deputy who had been on the force for 19 years . Tracy knew him well and thought highly of him , he told journalists at a news conference . Wride worked directly under him for three years .

`` He was a very helpful person , and that 's what he was doing , '' Tracy said , visibly moved . `` He was helping people when he stopped . ''

The wounded deputies were hospitalized and underwent operations . One is expected to recover ; the other is in critical condition in an intensive care unit .

The suspect , whom Tracy declined to name , is also expected to recover . He has a `` significant '' criminal history , Tracy said .

Ambush ?

Wride called in a `` motorist assist '' when he decided to pull off the road to aid what he thought was a disabled vehicle , Tracy said .

The suspect shot Wride , while he was still in his squad car , with what `` appears to be a high-powered rifle , '' Tracy said .

Then he fled the scene .

When other officers got the news , they took up positions at strategic posts to try to intercept the car on the run .

Tracy fears the suspect may have set up the situation on purpose as a roadside ambush .

`` He may have very well parked by the side of the road , hoping that some officer would stop behind him , '' he said .

Tragic chase

After the suspect fled , a deputy called in to say that he was pursuing him . Seconds later , the officer was shot in his vehicle , wounded in the head , Tracy said .

The suspect raced away but later wrecked the car he was driving .

He looked for a vehicle to carjack , approaching multiple people and cars , before finding one . He later crashed it , too , Tracy said .

Along the way , he continued shooting .

When deputies caught up with him , the man fired at them , critically wounding yet another deputy , the sheriff 's office said . The officers wounded the suspect in the gunfight and took him into custody .

The sheriff 's office plans to obtain a warrant to search the suspect 's home to try to establish a motive for the shooting rampage .

Tracy personally the broke news of Sgt. Wride 's killing to his family .

`` He was a good man , '' the sheriff said .

Wride leaves behind a wife and five children .
