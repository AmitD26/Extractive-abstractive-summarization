-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Many people have heard of the Slow Food movement -- the global organization founded in Italy to counter fast food and the `` fast life . ''

Its adherents favor gastronomic tradition and the calm , contemplative enjoyment of cuisine and life in general .

Now another idea is taking hold in the wake of Slow Food -- the quest for a quiet Italy .

It 's embodied in the establishment of a new Academy of Silence -LRB- Italian site only -RRB- , in Tuscany , which seeks to gather a list of the quietest hotels , towns and other places in Italy .

We 've collected 10 idyllic spots -- among the calmest , quietest and most powerfully relaxing in all Italy -- to suggest to the Academy as prime candidates for inclusion .

1 . Eremito Hotelito del Alma -LRB- Parrano , Umbria -RRB-

No TV , no phone , no mini-bar , no air-con .

Go to bed when it 's dark , wake up at dawn .

Candlelight only after sunset .

Phones to be used outside only .

This is also the first hotel in Italy with only single rooms -- so not the place for romance .

It still feels like the monastery it once was -- the monk 's cells have been converted into rooms -- except now there 's a spa , and great Umbrian food instead of bread and water .

There are even Gregorian chants -- listening to them makes lying in the heated rock pool all the more relaxing .

During the day , there 's little to do except explore the surrounding 3,000 hectares of national reserve .

Or practice doing nothing .

Eremito Hotelito del Alma , Localitá Tarina , 2 ; +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 76 389 1010 ; rooms from $ 208

2 . Stargazing from the Rocca D'Orcia Tower -LRB- Siena , Tuscany -RRB-

A single , stone medieval tower sits atop a wooded hill , overhanging a precipice .

From this superb lookout , you 'd once have been able to spot enemies approaching from miles around across the Val d'Orcia valley .

Now it 's open to the public -- a noble family fell on hard times and sold it to the state .

Surrounding it are just a few stone houses and cobbled streets .

Maybe the odd cat .

On clear nights , standing atop the tower , thick star clusters illuminate hills , vineyards and Renaissance-era dwellings .

If Tuscany has anywhere more quiet and calm , someone 's keeping silent about it .

La Rocchetta -LRB- Via della Chiesa , 8 ; +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 55 228 0413 ; rooms from $ 40 -RRB- is a B&B in the middle of the hamlet , right under the tower .

The Osteria Perillá -LRB- Borgo Maestro , 72 ; +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 577 887 263 ; dishes from $ 20 -RRB- serves traditional meals such as bean soup and pici , typical handmade pasta .

3 . Segesta ruins -LRB- Trapani , Sicily -RRB-

It 's much easier to be transported to ancient times when you 're contemplating ruins in virtual solitude .

Segesta 's ruins are superb and all the better without the crowds at the Valley of Temples elsewhere in Sicily .

Legend says Segesta was built by Achilles ' companion , the Greek warrior Aeneas , on returning home after burning Troy .

There 's a temple , theater and sanctuary .

Set in a remote part of Sicily , surrounded by fields , the archaeological site is nonetheless well-kept .

It 's way off the traditional tourist route and one of the least visited ancient sites in Italy .

Baglio Segesta -LRB- Italian site only ; Contrada Pispisa ; +39 348 883 0124 ; rooms from $ 54 -RRB- is a typical Sicilian rural estate close to the site .

4 . The Gardens of Ninfa -LRB- Norma-Latium , Lazio -RRB-

Eden , if it existed , quite possibly looked like this .

There are cascades of multicolored plants , spouting fountains and rich bird life .

Running water is the only sound , and the odd tweet and whirr of wings .

Once a hellish , malaria-infested backwater , the Ninfa Gardens were turned into a 105-hectare oasis in the early 20th century by the Caetani Princes .

The Ninfa -LRB- `` Nymph '' -RRB- River cuts through the space , which includes rare ruins of an entire medieval town .

Norma on the Lepini Hills , overlooking the Pontine Valley and the sea , is the closest city .

Hotel Villa del Cardinale -LRB- Via dei Colli 44 , Norma ; +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 773 354 611 ; rooms from $ 38 -RRB- has a well regarded restaurant with Latium specialties .

5 . Stagnone Lagoon -LRB- Marsala , Sicily -RRB-

Separating you from the open sea -- the Mediterranean -- is an archipelago of small islands dotted with ancient windmills .

On the lagoon in a boat , you hold a glass of sweet Marsala wine .

In the background , there 's an orange-pink sunset .

The only sounds come from things stirring in the hot breeze and low waves rocking the boat .

The sunset aperitif served out here on the water by a tour company -LRB- Italian site only -RRB- comes with what 's almost a dinner : 12 types of Sicilian finger foods -- it 's tempting to stuff yourself at the first dish .

The boat takes you out when the sun starts to set , anchors in the middle of the lagoon and brings you back when you 've had enough of the quiet .

Hotel picks in Marsala include New Hotel Palace -LRB- Via Lungomare Mediterraneo 57 ; +39 092 371 9492 ; rooms from $ 108 -RRB- , close to the harbor .

Restaurant La Corte dei Mangioni -LRB- Via Giovanni Bovio 28 ; +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 923 951 939 ; from $ 20 -RRB- serves traditional Sicilian cuisine .

6 . Linosa -LRB- Pelagie Islands -RRB-

Stuck in the Mediterranean halfway between Sicily and Tunisia , this tiny volcanic atoll is off most travelers ' radar .

People who do make it out here cluster on the noisier sister island of Lampedusa .

But to silence seekers , Linosa is bliss .

Ultimate silence can be found hiking up the extinct crater of Monte Vulcano .

At the summit , a panorama of black rocks dotted with fluorescent green cacti and prickly pears stretches to the sea .

This is the kingdom of a special kind of silence -- sea silence .

A single road circles Linosa .

There are a few , low-rise traditional dwellings and a bar that makes great slushies when it 's hot .

On the beach of La Pozzolana , you might be lucky enough to find sea turtles from the island 's animal hospital being released into the sea .

Linosa has few hotels . Linoikos -LRB- Via Vittorio Alfieri , +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 92 272 212 ; rooms from $ 45 -RRB- has modern , brightly colored rooms and serves fish bought direct from island fishermen .

7 . Civita di Bagnoreggio -LRB- Viterbo , Lazio -RRB-

Here you find `` the silence of a dying city . ''

That 's how the citizens of Civita di Bagnoreggio describe it .

The town sits atop a high , narrow plateau of crumbling rock formed from compressed volcanic ash .

Each year , it slips a little further over the edge .

The population has dwindled over the past century to little more than around 10 hardy hangers on .

It 's quiet .

The original bridge to the town collapsed , replaced by a dizzying metal catwalk .

Once within the town , you can only get around on foot -- cars threaten further erosion .

Writers and yoga practitioners are drawn here for the calm that prevails -- strange , given that catastrophe seems just around the corner .

Or over the edge .

Corte della Maestá -LRB- Via della Provvidenza ; +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 335 879 3077 ; rooms from $ 330 -RRB- is a small villa inside the hamlet .

Alma Civita -LRB- Via della Provvidenza , +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 76 179 2415 from $ 162 -RRB- serves guests traditional recipes .

8 . Porcini mushroom hunting -LRB- Frignano Park , Emilia-Romagna -RRB-

The deep mountain silence of the rugged Apennines , Italy 's smaller Alps , is what 's on offer here .

Solitary valleys are dotted with stone structures the Celts erected during their invasion in the 4th century BC .

Wild porcini mushrooms , one of the great delicacies of Italian cuisine , are part of the allure .

For a $ 20 ticket from park authorities -LRB- Italian site only ; +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 536 72134 -RRB- you can go on a porcini hunt and pick as many you can find .

There 's a magical ambiance in the forest -- a local legend describes `` the ghost of clouds . ''

If that 's not a silent image , what is ?

La Capanna dei Celti -LRB- Doccia di Fiumalbo ; +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 5367 4444 ; rooms from $ 60 -RRB- , set at 1,400 meters , has the feel of a cozy mountain hut .

The menu served to guests includes strong-flavored dishes such as wild boar .

9 . Alicudi -LRB- Aeolian Islands -RRB-

The farthest and wildest of the Aeolian Islands , Alicudi offers a no-frills , zero sound pollution break amid turquoise waters , pebble beaches and prickly pears .

`` Donkey taxis '' are the main means of transportation across the island 's 10,000 steps and 25 kilometers of ancient pathways -- you 'll hear no roaring engines .

And there are no banks -- you 'll need cash -- only one tiny supermarket and a newsstand .

Casa Ibiscus Resort -LRB- Via Roma , +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 3409 207 605 ; stays from $ 1,800 -RRB- is an Aeolian-style villa with a seafront terrace rented on a weekly base .

Spaghetti with caper cream is a top dish at Restaurant Ericusa , part of Hotel Ericusa -LRB- Via Perciato ; +39 0909 889 902 -RRB- .

10 . Mt. Soratte -LRB- near Rome -RRB-

You need n't go too far from possibly the noisiest place in Italy , Rome , to find silence .

A sacred hill to the ancient Romans , the `` sleeping giant '' of Mt. Soratte spikes up from the Tiber Valley an hour from the capital .

Hiking routes wind through a dense forest gouged with rock chasms .

You might find wild boar footprints beneath you and hear hawks ' cries above .

The so-called Hermit Path leads to the highest peak , where there 's an ancient stone shrine .

Here 's where Pope St. Sylvester I is said to have miraculously cured Emperor Constantine of leprosy .

For a moment , given the purity of the air and the heavenly view , you can believe it .

The Panta Rei rural estate -LRB- Localitá Ponticello , Sant ` Oreste ; +39 076 1578 728 ; rooms from $ 54 -RRB- overlooks the promontory .

Al Campanile -LRB- Italian site only ; Via Filippo Leoni 8 ; +39 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 76 157 9950 -RRB- , in the hillside town of Sant ` Oreste , serves recommended local cuisine .
