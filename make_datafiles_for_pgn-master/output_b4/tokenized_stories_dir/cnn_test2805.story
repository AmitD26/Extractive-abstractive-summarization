-LRB- Travel + Leisure -RRB- -- When studying up for a trip to the Holy Land , you might come across this warning : Whatever you do , do n't take a bear to the beach .

Feeding pigeons is illegal in Venice , Italy , and could earn you a fine .

Americans expect to experience some difference in laws when they travel the world , but some laws we found just sounded insane . In France , it 's illegal to name a pig Napoleon . In Florida , single women ca n't parachute on Sundays . And in England , you may urinate anywhere in public , including inside a policeman 's helmet , providing that you 're also pregnant .

Granted , most of us can rest easy on the plane ride to our destinations knowing that we wo n't run afoul of such rules . Plus , many reported laws are just urban legends , and in other cases , anomalies on the books that no one has the time or interest to enforce . -LRB- `` People here do n't keep bears ! '' an exasperated Israeli spokeswoman told us . `` Why would they take one to the beach ? '' -RRB-

But other laws -- such as keeping your headlights on at all times while driving in Denmark -- are in equal parts surprising and real . Get caught , and the resulting fine could run about $ 100 -LRB- and the entire EU may adopt the law -RRB- . See a Travel + Leisure slideshow of the world 's strangest laws

While some laws seem ridiculous at first blush , they often carry their own logic . Pigeon-feeding is not tolerated -LRB- and fine-worthy -RRB- in Venice , because the winged troublemakers -- and really , their droppings -- wreak havoc on the city 's old , vulnerable buildings . Singapore is infamous for its tough laws against chewing gum and graffiti -LRB- remember the 18-year-old American who got caned in the 1990s ? -RRB- . In the Singaporeans ' defense , the gum laws -- which have relaxed a bit -- were originally enacted to fight what authorities saw as rampant gum-wad littering . Even so , do n't even think about leaving a public toilet un-flushed . It could cost you $ 100 .

What should you do if you do break a law , crazy or otherwise , while on vacation ? Dick Atkins is a Philadelphia attorney who operates an international legal hotline , helping American travelers who have run afoul of the law in other countries . `` It 's always best to try to get an attorney involved , '' he says . Ignoring the issue could result in problems if you make a return visit to that country .

Atkins says he commonly deals with college kids who have taken too many liberties with other countries ' lower drinking ages , or unsuspecting tourists who get arrested for trying to take home souvenirs -LRB- such as old rugs -RRB- that end up being antiquities . He says such problems raise the argument for buying travel insurance , or even buying travel assistance packages , which can offer legal help abroad . -LRB- To price varying packages , check out US Travel Insurance Association . -RRB-

Of course , most Americans do n't bother with travel insurance . In that case , you can contact the American embassy or consulate for a list of local attorneys . Or you can handle the problem on your own . Robert Siciliano recently stayed at a Mexican resort , and when he and his family rented a car , they were almost immediately stopped by police and accused of swerving dangerously on the road . -LRB- Siciliano says he was merely driving around fallen palm braches and coconuts following the previous day 's Category 2 hurricane . -RRB-

`` They started to arrest me because they said all tickets were to be paid at the police station , '' Siciliano says . But when he asked if he could pay the ticket on the spot , the cops agreed . Siciliano handed them a $ 100 bill and they let him go . He immediately returned the car . `` Total rental car time , 20 minutes . Cost , $ 155 , '' he said . `` Not spending a second in a Mexican jail , priceless . ''
