PENSACOLA , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man police believe organized the slaying of a Florida couple earlier this month told authorities he knew the victims and received financial support from them for a martial arts studio , according to court documents released Monday .

Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr. , 35 , is one of seven people charged with murder in the July 9 killings .

Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr. , 35 , is one of seven people charged with murder in the July 9 deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings of Beulah , Florida .

An affidavit for a search warrant for Gonzalez 's van noted the connection between him and the couple , but gave no other details .

`` My understanding is , through speaking with the investigative agencies , that Mr. Gonzalez sought donations from a variety of community and business leaders and that perhaps Mr. Billings did not lend him money , but donated to this academy for children , '' Crystal Spencer , attorney for the Billings family , told CNN . `` It was a defense academy -- a self-defense academy for children . But the connection goes no further that we are aware of . ''

The Billingses , who were known for adopting special-needs children , were fatally shot during a home invasion robbery , according to police . Their bodies were found in their bedroom , said the court documents .

Gonzalez told police he owns a red Dodge cargo van similar to one seen on surveillance video leaving the Billings home on the day of the slayings , but he said it was not in operating condition , according to an affidavit seeking a search warrant on the van .

After a picture of the van seen at the crime scene was released to the media , a man contacted police to tell them it resembled a van he owned for a number of years and had recently sold to a woman named Terri Poff , the affidavit said . He provided pictures of the van , which appeared to match the one seen on the surveillance camera , including some of its unusual features , the documents said .

The man told police that Poff told him she was buying the van for her son , Leonard Gonzalez , according to the affidavit . Watch recap of the case and links between suspects ''

Authorities located the van at Gonzalez 's residence , and its vehicle identification number matched that provided by the previous owner , the documents said .

A search warrant document filed with the court shows that in a July 11 search of the van , police took carpet samples , seat covers , a piece of duct tape , paint samples , and containers of disinfectant wipes , garbage bags and soap pads , among other items , the document said .

Police previously have said robbery was a motive , but not the only motive .

Asked whether the slayings could have been a contracted hit , Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan told CNN , `` This gets back to motive and we want to assure the public that we have n't taken that or anything off the table . We 're looking for any reason , any motive for this to have happened , so yes , we are looking at a hit as a motive .

Morgan told CNN he wanted to talk to up to nine more people and planned to make at least one more arrest before he winds down the investigation in a few days . He did not provide further details , but said authorities planned to interview Gonzalez 's wife on Monday .

The Billingses had adopted 13 children , and each had two biological children , but three of the adopted children have died . Police said nine of the children were home at the time of the home invasion ; one of them managed to flee and seek help at a neighbor 's home .

Ashley Markham , one of the adult children from Byrd and Melanie Billings ' previous marriages , said she has decided to move into the home to take care of the children .

Markham told CNN that they are having work done on the home to make it safer before they move back in .

Additional documents released Monday from the Florida Department of Children and Families show a bizarre attempt by Byrd Billings to copyright the children 's names and request money from the department for their use .

A department attorney , Katie George , told the Pensacola News-Journal that every time the agency sent Billings a letter referencing the children by name , he would reply with an invoice demanding millions in copyright infringement . In one document released by the department , he demands $ 10 million in silver or federal reserve notes of equal value .

In a sharply worded letter of December 2005 , another department attorney , Richard Cserep , wrote to Billings , `` you reference a wide variety of law in connection with this claim '' for damages . `` This includes copyright violations , trademark violations , contract violations , admiralty and maritime law , libel and the Truth in Lending Act . At no time in any of your correspondence have you made a plain demand for damages under a clear and cognizable theory of liability . ''

A handwritten note on the letter says that no further correspondence was received from Billings after that letter .

A safe containing prescription medication , family documents and some jewelry was taken from the Billings home at the time of their slayings , authorities said . It was found in the back yard of Pamela Wiggins , an eighth suspect , who is charged with being an accessory after the fact . Wiggins is free on $ 10,000 bond .

Morgan said when the safe was found , it was buried with bricks on top in `` an obvious attempt to conceal '' it . Wiggins is a friend and landlord of one of the suspects . Attempts by CNN to reach her and her attorney have been unsuccessful .

One of the seven original suspects in the case , Donald Ray Stallworth , was arrested in Alabama . At a hearing Monday , Escambia County , Alabama , Judge Bert Rice withdrew an earlier $ 1 million bond and ordered Stallworth held without bail until Alabama Gov. Bob Riley signs an order to extradite him to Florida .

Surveillance video from the home shows two vehicles pulling up to the property and five masked people dressed in black entering the house . Authorities believe both drivers remained in the vehicles .

It appears the suspects did not believe they were under surveillance , Morgan said . The system , which was not disabled , was a `` gaping hole '' in a well-executed crime , he said .

While the investigation into the murders continues , Markham said her focus now is on helping the rest of her family through the tragedy . She said she told the children about their parents , adding that her mother had explained heaven to the kids as a wonderful place .

The kids were given balloons and told by writing messages on them , they would be able to talk to their parents since `` they were angels . ''
