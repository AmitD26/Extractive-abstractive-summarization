Rosberg , who won in Australia , has a four-point lead over Hamilton after four rounds of the 2014 season , which is being dominated by their all-conquering Mercedes team .

Alonso 's third was a rare bright spot in a difficult season for Ferrari , whose team boss Stefano Domenicali quit earlier this week , but it was a frustrating afternoon for Red Bull and defending four-time champion Sebastian Vettel .

The German had to give best to his rookie teammate Daniel Ricciardo in the battle for a distant fourth after initially running in second following a fine start .

Vettel also appeared to disregard team orders after being told to let Australia 's Ricciardo past .

`` Tough luck '' came the reply over race radio , but he did move over shortly afterwards .

`` We 've not had the start to the season we would have liked , but we are still in the fight , '' added the Spaniard .

Nico Hulkenberg was sixth for Force India , just holding off Finn Valtteri Bottas in his Williams .
