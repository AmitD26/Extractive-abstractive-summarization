-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The world 's eco-systems are at risk of `` rapid degradation and collapse '' according to a new United Nations report .

The third Global Biodiversity Outlook -LRB- GBO-3 -RRB- published by the Convention on Biological Diversity -LRB- CBD -RRB- warns that unless `` swift , radical and creative action '' is taken `` massive further loss is increasingly likely . ''

Ahmed Djoghlaf , executive secretary of the CBD said in a statement : `` The news is not good . We continue to lose biodiversity at a rate never before seen in history . ''

The U.N. warns several eco-systems including the Amazon rainforest , freshwater lakes and rivers and coral reefs are approaching a `` tipping point '' which , if reached , may see them never recover .

The report says that no government has completely met biodiversity targets that were first set out in 2002 -- the year of the first GBO report .

Executive Director of the U.N. Environmental Program Achim Steiner said there were key economic reasons why governments had failed in this task .

`` Many economies remain blind to the huge value of the diversity of animals , plants and other life-forms and their role in healthy and functioning eco-systems , '' Steiner said in a statement .

Although many countries are beginning to factor in `` natural capital , '' Steiner said that this needs `` rapid and sustained scaling-up . ''

Despite increases in the size of protected land and coastal areas , biodiversity trends reported in the GBO-3 are almost entirely negative .

Vertebrate species fell by nearly one third between 1970 and 2006 , natural habitats are in decline , genetic diversity of crops is falling and sixty breeds of livestock have become extinct since 2000 .

Nick Nuttall , a U.N. Environmental Program spokesman , said the cost of eco-systems degradation is huge .

`` In terms of land-use change , it 's thought that the annual financial loss of services eco-systems provide -- water , storing carbon and soil stabilization -- is about € 50 billion -LRB- $ 64 billion -RRB- a year , '' Nuttall told CNN .

`` If this continues we may well see by 2050 a cumulative loss of what you might call land-based natural capital of around € 95 trillion -LRB- $ 121 trillion -RRB- , '' he said .

`` If we start putting these figures on the table , then governments might actually wake up to this . We 've had a financial crisis . We 've also got a natural resource scarcity crisis looming fast . ''

The GBO-3 is a landmark study in what is the U.N. 's International Year of Biodiversity and will play a key role in guiding the negotiations between world governments at the U.N. Biodiversity Summit in Nagoya , Japan in October 2010 .

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged governments to give biodiversity a `` higher priority in all areas of decision making and in all economic sectors '' and called for a `` new vision for biological diversity . ''

The CBD -- an international treaty designed to sustain diversity of life on Earth -- was set up at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 .
