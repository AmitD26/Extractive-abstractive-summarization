-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a sea of uncertainty , two bits of good news emerged Wednesday .

The Australian ship Ocean Shield picked up fresh signals that officials hope are locator beacons from the data recorders of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 .

The ship had first picked up the underwater pulses Saturday . But then , for the next three days , nothing .

On Tuesday , the ship once again reacquired the signals . That 's four signals in the same broad area : two on Saturday ; two on Tuesday .

`` I believe we are searching in the right area but we need to visually identify wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370 , '' Houston said .

The second piece of good news ? Authorities analyzed the signals picked up Saturday and determined they were not of

natural origin and was likely sourced from specific electronic equipment .

`` They believe the signals to be consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder , '' Houston said .

Signals getting weaker

Wednesday is Day 33 in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , which went missing March 8 . It was carrying 239 people .

Authorities have n't given up trying . Instead , they are pinning their hopes on the so-pings .

But time is not on their side .

The batteries powering the flight recorders ' locator beacons are certified to be working for 30 days . Stored in a plane 's tail , they are designed to begin sending off distinct , high-pitched signals as soon as they come in contact with water .

`` The signals are getting weaker . Which means we 're either moving away from the search area or the pinger batteries are dying , '' Houston said .

The first signal , at 4:45 p.m. Perth Time on Saturday , lasted 2 hours 20 minutes .

The second , at 9:27 p.m. Saturday , lasted 13 minutes .

The third signal was picked up Tuesday at 4:27 p.m. . That lasted 5 minutes 32 seconds .

The fourth , at 10:17 p.m. Tuesday , was 7 minutes long .

`` It 's certainly encouraging that more signals have been detected , '' Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby told CNN .

`` There is still much work to do , however . ''

Four reasons to believe ; six reasons to doubt

Discovery of possible ` locator beacon ' pulses gives hope

Wednesday 's search includes up to 11 military planes , four civilian aircraft as well as 14 ships -- three of which , Australia 's Ocean Shield further north and the British HMS Echo and Chinese Haixun 01 to the south -- will be focusing underwater .

All told , everyone involved will be scouring a 29,000-square-mile zone centered about 1,400 miles northwest of Perth , according to Australia 's Joint Agency Coordination Centre . That 's large and challenging , but still pales in comparison to the once nearly 3 million miles , at sea and on land , the searchers were scouring for signs of the lost aircraft a few weeks ago .

Kevin McEvoy , a New Zealand air force commodore involved in the effort , noted that authorities once `` did n't even know which haystack '' to look in for the aircraft .

`` I think we have got a much clearer picture around the areas that we need to concentrate on , '' McEvoy told CNN 's Erin Burnett from Auckland .

Authorities greatly shrank that area after analyzing satellite data to determine Flight 370 had set off from Kuala Lumpur toward Beijing , turned around to go back over the Malay Peninsula , then ended up in the southern Indian Ocean .

Why ? No one really knows .

The best chance to answer that question may rest wherever the plane -- and its so-called black boxes , with their trove of information about the plane and its movements -- now resides .

Search planes dispatched day after day looking for evidence of the missing airliner -- a floating wing , a seat cushion , anything -- thus far have come up empty .

The latest , greatest hopes have come from crews listening underwater for signs of Flight 370 .

The first such possible breakthrough came last Friday and Saturday , when a Chinese ship detected pulses that may have been from the plane . No more have been heard since .

According to McEvoy , `` the main focus '' centers around the site of Saturday 's discovery from Australia 's Ocean Shield . It used more advanced detection gear than that aboard the Chinese vessel and was found some 375 miles away , leading Houston to believe they are separate signals .

The first signal , detected by a towed pinger locator , persisted for more than two hours ; a second went on for about 13 minutes .

Tuesday afternoon , it lasted about 5 minutes and 32 seconds . Tuesday night , about seven minutes .

Beyond the dwindling battery life , there 's all the ocean to contend with : The Ocean Shield signals were in water about 2.6 miles deep , meaning a number of things could literally get in the way of or otherwise disrupt the pulses .

Searchers ' intent not to roil the waters any further is why air and seaborne traffic in that find area is being limited , and why there is no rush to put in underwater drones to take photos .

`` The better the Ocean Shield can define the area the easier it will be for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle to subsequently search for aircraft wreckage , '' Houston said .

Bear in mind with the Air France disaster , it took the underwater vehicle 20 days to get to the wreckage . ''

What happens after the Malaysian plane 's pingers die ?

And it 's not as if , if more pulses are detected , they 'll lead down in a straight line to the flight recorders . As is , the pings that were heard could have emanated from anywhere within a 5-mile radius , said Mary Schiavo , a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation .

Finding more signals could narrow the search area . Without them , authorities could then start the painstaking process of using side-scanning sonar to try to find the aircraft on the ocean 's bottom .

Meanwhile , the air search continues . As McEvoy explained , this area is `` slightly different '' than that being probed for pings because it is focused on surface debris , which would have shifted over the past few weeks -- thanks in part to a cyclone packing winds in excess of 160 mph that pushed through two weeks ago .

So far , none of the aircraft that have been sent out has found anything . And even if it is narrowed , Wednesday 's air search area is still roughly the size of South Carolina .

As Wing Cmdr. Andy Scott of New Zealand stated : `` It 's a large task that 's still ahead of us . ''

Next steps in underwater search

Pings without wreckage ` befuddling '

The absence of wreckage near these detected signals leaves some skeptical , worried that the Chinese and Australian ship 's finds could be yet another false lead in an investigation that 's been full of them .

Acknowledging `` a very high-speed vertical impact '' could explain the lack of aircraft remnants , CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said there 's reason to be cautious .

`` It 's either the most extraordinary event , or those pings were n't real , '' O'Brien said . `` It 's somewhat befuddling . ''

Sarah Bajc , the partner of American passenger Philip Wood , is n't convinced about anything . She told CNN 's Erin Burnett she thinks the plane was hijacked . Whether that proves true , one thing she wo n't believe are the Malaysian officials heading the investigation .

`` All of us pretty well agree that until there 's the bulk of the plane , the bulk of the bodies discovered , and a black box intact , we wo n't believe that it 's final evidence , '' Bajc said early Wednesday from Beijing . '' ... I do n't think the authorities have given us much confidence of their investigative skills so far . ''

The lack of clarity makes it hard to `` grieve properly and ... move on , '' -- something that she 's not yet willing to do .

`` I want to fight to find him , in whatever form that ends up being , '' said Bajc , who is coordinating with other passengers ' kin to press for answers . `` And I think most of the families feel the same way . ''

Until they get answers , women and men like Steve Wang -- whose mother was on the Malaysia Airlines plane -- are clinging to hope while trying to hold themselves together .

`` We 're just going through so many kinds of emotion , '' said Wang . '' ... Desperate , sad and helpless -- something like that . Everything . ''
