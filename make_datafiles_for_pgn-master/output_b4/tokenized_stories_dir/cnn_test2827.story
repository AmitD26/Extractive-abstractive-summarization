The floods have affected a series of states , including Bayelsa and Benue .

In Bayelsa state , an official said the area 's terrain has intensified the effects of the downpour .

`` It is like Florida ... swampy with a lot of sea water mixed with fresh water because we are close to rivers and the Atlantic -LRB- ocean -RRB- , '' said Tam Alazigha , the chief economic adviser for the state .

`` A lot of people have been displaced . Snakes , crocodiles and hippos have been displaced and are ending up in people 's homes . Everyone has been displaced . ''

Alazigha said more rain is forecast and authorities are evacuating residents to shelters that have been set up in schools located on higher ground .

`` The bad part is ... there is no relief yet , '' he said .

State officials are working to enhance drainage around the buldging rivers , according to the adviser .

`` Our main goals are to help settle the displaced people and improve on the drainage , '' he said . `` Our hope is that when the drainage gets better and the waters subside , we can deploy more resources to see how much we can save . ''

Alazigha said the amount of rain was unexpected .

`` It took us by surprise , '' he said . `` We need help from those agencies that are out there that usually help out in situations like these . All hands are on deck , but it is quite a challenge . ''

In the state of Benue , more than 25 , 000 people were displaced after a local river overflowed , the National Emergency Management Agency said .

Nigeria 's rainy season occurs between May and October . Torrential rains are especially hard on communities in rural areas , where drainage is inadequate or nonexistent .

Last month , authorities urged residents living along River Niger to move to higher ground . The evacuation order affected the states of Niger , Kogi , Kwara , Kebbi , Anambra and Delta .
