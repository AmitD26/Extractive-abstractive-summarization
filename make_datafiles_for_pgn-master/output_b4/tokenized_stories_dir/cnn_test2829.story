FORT MYERS , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three men were charged Saturday with felony first-degree murder in the shooting death of NFL player Sean Taylor , a death police say was unplanned .

Eric Rivera Jr. , 17 ; Venjah K. Hunte , 20 ; and Charles Kendrick Lee Wardlow , 18 , each faces charges of felony first-degree murder , burglary with a firearm and home invasion robbery while armed , according to court documents .

The charge of felony first-degree murder can be applied if someone is killed , even accidentally , during certain violent felony crimes .

Rivera appeared in a courtroom in Fort Myers , Florida , while Hunte and Wardlow appeared via video phone from jail .

A fourth suspect , Jason Scott Mitchell , 19 , was processed too late to appear in court , officials said . He is to be in court Sunday , and he faces the same charges as the other three .

Taylor , 24 , a safety for the Washington Redskins , died Tuesday , a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary at his Miami home .

The four suspects could be moved to Miami -- where the charges are based -- as soon as Sunday for a first-appearance hearing , said John Evans , Wardlow 's lawyer .

Police have more than one confession in the case , according to Robert Parker , director of the Miami-Dade Police Department .

Rivera 's attorney , Wilbur Smith , said Saturday he `` had been led to believe '' that his client confessed , but was n't sure after speaking to Rivera .

Asked about news reports alleging Rivera was the shooter , Smith said that he was aware of the stories , but that he had `` not talked enough to Eric to find that out . ''

`` The brief probable cause statement that we received did not indicate who was the shooter , '' he said .

Smith described his client as `` stunned . '' Asked whether he showed any remorse , Smith said , `` Oh yeah , you could see that in his eyes . ''

Evans said that despite a court affidavit alleging that his client confessed , he has not seen `` a transcript or heard any audio ... about any confession from any of the four people who are currently charged . ''

The four men were expecting to find an unoccupied home , `` so murder or shooting someone was not their initial motive , '' Parker said .

`` They were certainly not looking to go there and kill anyone , '' he said . `` Their obvious motive was to go there and steal the contents of the house . ''

`` The key to solving this case was citizens ' tips , '' he said .

The men knew Taylor lived at the house , said Parker , who added that additional arrests were possible .

A police official told CNN that officers are investigating whether one or more of the suspects knew members of Taylor 's family .

At 1:45 a.m. Monday , Taylor 's girlfriend , Jackie Garcia , called 911 and said someone had been shot .

Authorities have said she told police she was hiding under the bedding during the attack .

Garcia did not see what happened and could not provide a suspect description , Parker told reporters Wednesday .

Police said that Garcia and Taylor were awakened by noise in the living room , and that Taylor got up and locked the bedroom door . The door was kicked in and two shots were fired , one striking Taylor in the leg .

Garcia tried to call 911 , and failing that , used her cell phone instead , police said . There was no evidence the line had been cut , Parker said Wednesday .

A break-in was also reported eight days earlier , Miami-Dade police said .

A police report said someone forced a window open and left a kitchen knife on a bed . Several drawers and a bedroom safe were searched during the break-in , according to the report .

Taylor was home unexpectedly because of an injury , his former attorney , Richard Sharpstein , told reporters Tuesday . `` I think he was surprised , or they were surprised to find him there , '' he said .

Taylor spent four years with the Washington Redskins , but had been out with a sprained right knee . He did not play in Sunday 's game against Tampa Bay .

Taylor was a first-round pick in the 2004 draft , according to his team 's Web site .

He played at the University of Miami , where he was an All-American in 2003 , and was also a high school standout in the city . Dubbing him `` the prototype NFL free safety , '' the Redskins credited Taylor 's team-leading tackling prowess .

He was regarded as one of the hardest-hitting players in the league . During his brief career , Taylor recorded 306 tackles -LRB- 248 solo -RRB- , two sacks and 12 interceptions . E-mail to a friend
