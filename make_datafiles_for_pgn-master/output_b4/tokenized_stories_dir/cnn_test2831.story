-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Silence is golden . Or at least that was the plan .

Indie band Vulfpeck hatched a scheme to earn a big payout from Spotify . But they 'd have to be clever ; the music streaming service pays artists less than a penny a play .

So , here 's what Vulfpeck did . The band uploaded a 10-song album called `` Sleepify '' and asked their fans to stream the album on repeat while they slept , hoping to multiply the royalty rate exponentially .

There was even some incentive . The band was going to use the money to pay for a free concert tour and go to the cities that streamed the album the most .

Every track is completely silent -- no music at all -- and only about half a minute long . According to the Spotify 's payment plan , each song needs to be listened to for at least 30 seconds to count as an official listen .

Cha-ching ! Fans came up big .

Vulfpeck racked up about $ 20,000 , according to reports . At the half-a-cent per play rate the band says it gets from the service , that 's 4 million plays .

But not so fast , Spotify told the band : The album violated its terms of content .

And `` Sleepify '' was gone .

When contacted , Spotify 's Graham James had little to say .

`` Sorry . Not commenting on this one , '' he told CNN .

There 's no word on whether Vulfpeck will get paid .

Such a setback might deter other bands .

But not Vulfpeck . It bounced back with a new three-track album called `` Official Statement . ''

On the first track , '' #Hurt , '' Keyboardist Jack Stratton spills his guts about the situation .

`` The gist of it was that , while they enjoyed ` Sleepify ' and thought it was funny and clever , that it violated their terms of content , '' he said .

`` So I do n't know what 's going to happen with it -- it 's very uncertain at the moment . And in light of that uncertainly I want to take 30 seconds silence to ponder the uncertainty . ''

That ushers in the second track , '' #Reflect '' -- 31 seconds of silence .

Sound familiar ?

Track three is a 32-second instrumental called `` Parted Sea -LRB- Strong Pesach -RRB- . ''

Can lightning strike twice ? We 'll see .

But for a repeat , Vulfpeck fans will have to hit repeat , again and again and again ... .
