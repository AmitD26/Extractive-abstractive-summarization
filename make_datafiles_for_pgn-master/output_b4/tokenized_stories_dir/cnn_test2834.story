-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama announced that 300 companies -- including Apple , Wal-Mart and others -- have signed a pledge to help the long-term unemployed by making sure they do n't have barriers in their hiring practices .

This is good news , but it wo n't solve the problem . The best we can hope for is that the companies now will make special efforts to seek out and employ those who have suffered long-term joblessness .

That 's a nice start , but feel-good gestures wo n't cut it when there are almost 4 million Americans who have been out of work for more than six months . That 's a big number . What 's disconcerting is that the current long-term unemployment is more serious than in previous economic downturns . Data from previous business cycles show people suffering from long-run joblessness at worst accounted for about 20 % to 25 % of the unemployed . In recent months , that percentage has jumped to nearly 40 % -- an all-time record !

Indeed , America is beginning to look like Europe . It used to be that long-term unemployment in the U.S. was only a fraction of Europe 's , but the latest data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that the United States has caught up to many of Europe 's welfare states .

That 's not a race we want to be part of , much less win .

So what 's the solution ?

There 's no silver bullet , but economic growth is the single most important key . All forms of unemployment get worse when the economy is weak . But when the economy is booming , the job market gets better for everybody -- including those who have been unemployed for long periods .

Unfortunately , economic growth has n't proven easy . The recession may have ended officially in the summer of 2009 , but we 're still suffering through a sluggish economic cycle . Recent improvements in the overall employment rate are in large part the result of people dropping out of the labor force , and the problem of long-run unemployment has barely budged .

To boost employment , we need the kind of strong growth America enjoyed during the Reagan and Clinton years , when millions of new jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell dramatically . To get there , we need a return to the types of free-market policies we got under Reagan and Clinton : a lower burden of government spending and less intervention from Washington .

Unfortunately , we 've been moving in the exact opposite direction . Under both Presidents Bush and Obama , the size and scope of government has expanded , and the United States -- which had the world 's third-most free-market economy when Bill Clinton left office -- has now dropped to 17th in the Economic Freedom of the World rankings .

We also need to make sure the unemployed do n't get lured into long-term dependency . One glaring example of misguided big-government policy is the argument to endlessly extend unemployment benefits . That sounds compassionate , but according to economists such policies discourage the unemployed from aggressively seeking new jobs .

There is also persuasive evidence that employers are reluctant to hire people -LRB- regardless of any `` pledges '' they may sign -RRB- who have been out of work for lengthy periods , which makes the President 's preferred approach of more unemployment benefits akin to an overprotective parent who hinders a child 's development .

Moreover , Obama 's proposed hike in the minimum wage would actually counteract any good his pledge would do . Why ? Increasing the minimum wage is the equivalent of sawing off the bottom rungs on the economic ladder . Simply stated , businesses create jobs when they think a new employee will help the bottom line . Artificially raising the cost of workers -- particularly those with marginal skills -- is a recipe for creating more unemployment .

The president 's effort to get companies on board with hiring the long-term unemployed should be applauded , but he should n't for one second think that it will solve the problem . In fact , too many of his other proposals would serve only to exacerbate the problem the long-term unemployed are facing . Instead , Obama should take a page out of the Reagan and Clinton presidencies and take action to get to the root of unemployment : economic growth .
