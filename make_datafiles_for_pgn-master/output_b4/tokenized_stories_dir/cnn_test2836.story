-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States clinched the first gold medal of Sochi 's Winter Olympics Saturday , but the Dutch dominated on ice and a joint record was claimed by Norway .

An upset opened the day 's events in Russia when Team U.S.A 's Sage Kotsenburg , 20 , scooped the first gold in men 's snowboard slopestyle . Kotsenburg tweeted his surprise at the win .

Kotsenburg 's winning score of 93.5 edged out silver medal winner Staale Sandbech , 20 , while Canadian Mark McMorris , also 20 , took bronze .

American Shaun White , the biggest name in snowboarding , withdrew from the competition before it began to focus on the men 's halfpipe next week . The double Olympic champion , who had been nursing a wrist injury , withdrew Wednesday just a day after admitting the course presented an `` intimidating '' challenge .

Saturday 's second gold was taken by Norway 's Marit Bjoergen in the women 's skiathlon . The 15 km course is split between a classic style for the first 7.5 km , then a final leg in freestyle .
