-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's the question Edin Dzeko is constantly asked .

`` You ask me again about war ... '' sighs the 28-year-old , rolling his eyes and smiling as he enjoys a rare moment of peace outside Bosnia-Herzegovina 's team hotel in the picturesque suburb of Ilidza .

Perhaps the line of questioning is understandable given that just a short drive away is Dzeko 's home city of Sarajevo , where the national hero lived throughout the Bosnian War which raged between 1992 and 1995 .

The war in Bosnia left tens of thousands dead , and hundreds of thousands displaced .

But just as the bullet holes which still riddle this land represent a gruesome past , Dzeko and his teammates have become symbols of a different more optimistic future .

For the first time in its short history , Bosnia is off to the World Cup .

`` I never thought I would be where I am now , '' Dzeko , who played a key role in Manchester City 's 2013-14 English Premier League title triumph , told CNN .

Dzeko 's early years were played out against the devastating backdrop of the consequences of a brutal internecine conflict .

`` I started to play football when I was about 10 , my father brought me to one school because there were more pitches where we could play . Everything was destroyed after the war . ''

In previous interviews Dzeko has spoken of how his family home was destroyed and he was forced to live in his grandparents ' house with 15 of his relatives .

His mother once inadvertently saved his life , calling him inside seconds before the land he was playing on was hit by bombs .

The siege of Sarajevo followed the break-up of the former Yugoslavia , with conflict erupting between the ethnic groups which make up Bosnia -- chiefly Bosnian Muslims , Croats and Serbs .

Modern-day Bosnia is an independent state , although still under international administration .

`` I was here all the time during the war and I know what it is , but I think we came out stronger , '' explains Dzeko .

`` We want to show the world that even if you go through some bad periods , you always have to think positive just to go forward .

`` Some people had a very hard life , we are still making positives and I think that 's amazing . ''

Amid the bombs and bullets , Dzeko forged an unlikely path to the top .

After signing his first professional contract in Bosnia , the young striker earned a move to Teplice in the Czech Republic before getting his big break with VFL Wolfsburg in the German Bundesliga .

He became one of the hottest properties in European football during a prolific spell which saw him score 67 Bundesliga goals in three-and-a-half seasons , with City winning the race for his signature after paying Wolfsburg a reported $ 45 million in January 2011 .

While Dzeko carries echoes of the fighting wherever he goes , other members of the Bosnia squad had a different experience .

Asmir Begovic and his family left Trebinje , 80 miles south of Sarajevo , and headed to Germany before immigrating to Canada .

Aged four when his family relocated , Begovic has no memories of the conflict which engulfed his homeland .

`` And it 's probably better so , '' the 26-year-old goalkeeper , who plays in England for Stoke City .

`` I mean it 's obviously very bad memories , very bad experiences for some of my other family members who have been around and stayed for the war .

`` I left when I was a boy , so I really do n't remember much from the past .

`` As I 've gotten older I 've educated myself a little on the situation and what happened , drawn on experiences from my family members and friends , who lived through it and it was just a very unpleasant experience as people can imagine .

`` For our quality of life as a family , just being able to be safe in a different country meant a lot to us . ''

Although Begovic 's life abroad has left its mark on his voice -- he speaks perfect English with a slight North American accent -- he insists his upbringing was distinctly Bosnian .

`` I 've always been very close to the country , '' he says . `` When the opportunity came it was a fantastic thing for myself and my family to do , I could n't wait to put on a Bosnia shirt and I have n't really looked back since . ''

Neither has Bosnia 's national football team .

Since an inauspicious first official international match in November 1995 -- a 2-0 reverse away to Albania -- `` The Dragons '' have gone from strength to strength .

Bids to qualify for the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 European Championships fell agonizingly short , with Portugal ending the team 's hopes at the playoff stage of both qualification competitions .

But , on October 15 , 2013 in the Lithuanian capital city of Vilnius , a goal from striker Vedad Ibisevic sealed a 1-0 win for Safet Susic 's Bosnia and passage to Brazil 2014 .

Cue wild celebrations on the streets of Sarajevo , with the team flying home to be greeted by 50,000 ecstatic Bosnian football fans .

`` I am proud of this team that we achieved some great things , that we did some things that nobody could do it before us , '' said Dzeko .

`` When you see 50,000 there waiting for you , then you know you did something good . ''

`` We 've learned from our past , we 've learned from our failures and I think we 've definitely grown as a team and we 've been able to overcome that final hurdle now , '' added Begovic .

`` To receive such an ovation and such a reception from our people , being able to celebrate with them is what qualifying and being able to qualify for major tournaments is all about .

`` It 's something we have all accomplished together . ''

Now Rio de Janeiro 's iconic Maracana Stadium awaits .

At the arena first built for the 1950 World Cup and lavishly redeveloped for Brazil 's second hosting of the tournament , Bosnia will take its bow against a Lionel Messi-led Argentina .

African Cup of Nations winners Nigeria and Iran are the other two teams which make up a tough Group F.

`` I 'm very much looking forward to it , '' says Begovic , who will be trying to keep out four-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Messi .

`` That 's what football is all about , being able to work your whole life to get to a World Cup and then playing against one of the biggest football countries in the world in the opening game .

`` Obviously we 're massive underdogs , so we 've got nothing to lose in that game , we can go there with an open mind and see how we can beat them .

`` It 's going to be a huge challenge , but I believe in the quality of our team and we can cause Argentina problems . ''

With players like Begovic and Dzeko , not to mention Roma playmaker Miralem Pjanic , Bosnia have players capable of upsetting the odds .

And in Dzeko , they also have a leader who is determined to show how far his country has come in the last 20 years .

`` I love this country , I love my country , '' he said .

`` I am very happy that I am born here and I am very happy that I know that I will always , always come back here .

`` I think we all just ca n't wait for this World Cup to start . ''
