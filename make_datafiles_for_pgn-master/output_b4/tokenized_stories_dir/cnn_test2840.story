Nairobi , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rescue teams searched Tuesday for seven people thought to have survived after three military helicopters came down on the side of Kenya 's highest mountain , in a remote area that is home to leopards and rhinoceros .

Two of the helicopters crashed and the third crash-landed on Mount Kenya Sunday as they were on their way to join a peacekeeping mission in Somalia .

Lt. Gen. Edward Katumba Wamala , Uganda 's commander of army land forces , said Tuesday that 21 people had been accounted for and the search continues for seven more .

Ugandan military helicopters go missing

One of the aircraft could be seen burned out on the side of Mount Kenya , said Gen. J.J. Odongo , Uganda 's defense minister . However , the military can neither confirm nor deny any deaths at the moment , he said .

The passengers in the helicopter which crash-landed were found and rescued Monday after the pilot issued a distress call .

Kenyan military officer Brig. Francis Ogola said the sites where the other two helicopters crashed have now been found and that military and police aircraft are carrying out a search for the presumed survivors .

`` The fate of the occupants remains unknown , '' Ogola said . However , the team at one of the sites found `` no dead bodies , '' but rather `` items ... arranged in a matter that suggest that they have evacuated from that location and they are somewhere in the mountain . ''

This is cause for `` good hope '' that the soldiers and airmen will be found , Ogola said .

Conditions on the mountainside may be tough , however .

The survivors will have to contend with rugged terrain and altitude . Mount Kenya is the second-highest peak on the African continent , after Kilimanjaro , at just over 17,000 feet , according to UNESCO .

According to the Mount Kenya park service and UNESCO , elephants , rhinos , giant forest hogs and leopards are among the creatures that live in the area . The mountain sides are riven by steep valleys and the vegetation is alpine higher up , changing to bamboo further down the slopes , UNESCO says .

Odongo said the crashes were an `` accident '' and that the helicopters were in `` good condition . ''

Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has appointed a panel to investigate the cause of the accidents , which will be headed by the president 's younger brother , Gen. Caleb Akandwanaho , Odongo said .

However , Odongo said the cause was turbulence due to `` bad weather . ''

Only one helicopter in the group of four made it to their next scheduled stop in Garissa , Kenya , where they were due to refuel .

The helicopters were part of the first deployment of air support for the African Union Mission in Somalia in Mogadishu , where Ugandan , Burundian and other African Union forces are fighting Al-Shabaab , an al Qaeda-linked group .

Odongo said the Ugandan government and army would reassess their capacity to continue with the deployment of military air power to AMISOM following the crashes .

It had taken Uganda more than three months to prepare for the deployment , he added , with all crew undergoing U.N. training .

The aircraft left Nanyuki , in Kenya 's Rift Valley , after originally being dispatched last week from Entebbe , Uganda .

Ugandan army spokesman Col. Felix Kulayigye said that one helicopter pilot then made a distress call saying he had made an emergency landing in the mountains .

The pilot and crew of that helicopter were rescued and have been taken safely to Nanyuki Air Force Base , he said .

Al-Shabaab , which has battled Somalia 's weak transitional government since 2007 , controls much of southern Somalia and is active around the capital city of Mogadishu . The United States listed it as a terror organization in 2008 .

Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for suicide bombings that killed more than 70 people in Uganda in 2010 and has threatened attacks against U.S. , Kenyan and Burundian interests in the region .
