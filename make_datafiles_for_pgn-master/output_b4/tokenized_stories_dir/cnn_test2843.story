Columbus , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Huey helicopter came in from the west , the `` pop , pop , pop '' of its blades announcing its arrival . It made a sharp right-hand turn and flared to a landing in the grassy area . The ragtag troop of 10 passengers awaiting its arrival looked far from Army issue , dressed in Aloha shirts , T-shirts , blue jeans , shorts and ball caps . They ducked their heads beneath the blades of the spinning rotor as they made their way to the copter from a protected area off to its front .

But Army Special Forces Capt. Homer Haracourt , a four-tour veteran of Vietnam , needed help . He was paralyzed from the waist down , and to make this flight , he 'd need the assistance of others .

The Army copter 's crew obliged , six of them gathering to lift Haracourt into the outside seat on right side of the chopper , the crew chief strapping him in to the canvas seat so he would n't fall out the open door . Haracourt beamed as his helpers retreated . The copter fidgeted a bit as the pilot applied power .

The skids left the ground , and after a short rotation to the right , Huey 354 sped away on one of more than a dozen hops it would fly this day , one of countless such hops it had flown since it was put into service in Vietnam more than 40 years ago .

This is a story of heroes , both mechanical and flesh and blood . None of them will call themselves that , the Huey because , well , it ca n't . The men who fly it and fly on it this March afternoon because they 're way too humble for any bombast . But I 'm the witness . I 've seen what these guys do , and I 'm declaring them heroes .

The flight crew on this March Saturday are from the nonprofit Army Aviation Heritage Foundation in Hampton , Georgia . They volunteer countless hours to restore and maintain Army helicopters from the Vietnam era and then take them to air shows across the country where you can fly on them . Yes , you can fly with heroes .

They are guys like Ralph Kahlan , the pilot of Huey 354 , carrying Haracourt this Saturday morning at the Thunder in the Valley airshow in Columbus , Georgia . Kahlan , 65 , is the assistant dean of the Georgia State University College of Business these days . But he 's a veteran of two tours in Vietnam , first as an infantry officer and then as a Huey pilot . He knows what the Huey meant from above and below .

`` It was a love-hate relationship as an infantry officer in Vietnam , '' he said . They dropped troops into tough spots but were there to get them out .

`` Swore at 'em when they left , could n't wait for them to show up , '' he said .

That was a lot of swearing and cheering in Vietnam . More than 9,400 Hueys were built , according to the foundation . More than 2,000 flew in the war , in God knows how many missions . Watch any news footage from the time , and you 'll probably see the Huey , ferrying troops to and from the field , their door gunners firing away at treelines to protect the GIs . The Huey was there at the end too , making flights from the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon as it was overrun in 1975 .

Huey 354 was in the fight . The aircraft giving rides in Georgia this Saturday in March flew 1,417 combat hours in Vietnam . Ask the Army Av guys , and they 'll show you the hole in the floor at the left rear . Patched over now , it 's where an enemy round passed through during combat in 1971 .

After that damage , Pat Derry probably flew Huey 354 . The Rockford , Illinois , native and Army Aviation Heritage Foundation member is a businessman now . In Vietnam , he was the maintenance test pilot for his unit , nicknamed `` The Comancheros . '' That meant before any copter could go on a mission after repairs or servicing , Derry took it up to make sure it worked .

`` That 's why I knew I flew 354 , because I flew every helicopter once every couple of months , '' he said .

You can see the unit 's logo on the front of Huey 354 today .

Derry , who flew under the call sign `` Comanchero 2 1/2 '' in Vietnam , does n't fly copters these days . But he stopped by the foundation 's hangar in suburban Atlanta a while back to reconnect with the Huey .

`` I did n't get emotional about sitting in it or anything , but it was just kind of a neat deal , '' Derry said . `` Forty to 45 years later , to be able to sit in something that was that big a deal as part of your life is kind of cool . ''

Back in Columbus , Haracourt is on the ground after a 10-minute hop in Huey 354 . The crew that got him on the aircraft has repeated the procedure , transferring the 75-year-old as gently as possible from helicopter to his motorized wheelchair . But there 's a hitch ; the chair ca n't seem to navigate the grassy ground where Kahlan has set down the Huey . The crews will have to carry chair and passenger to the tarmac . There are no complaints from Haracourt .

`` I 'm not bitter , '' he said . `` I signed up for the Army . ''

So what did he do in Vietnam ? Behind him , his daughter , 56-year-old Rosemary Haracourt , shakes her head .

`` I do n't talk about that . Never have , '' the former Army captain said .

What he will tell you is what these Huey rides mean to him : `` Everything ! ''

And that means if you come to Columbus next March , you could fly with this hero .

`` The good Lord willing , I 'll be back next year ; yes , I will , '' he said .
