-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A juror in the George Zimmerman trial says she feels the man who killed Trayvon Martin `` got away with murder . ''

`` George Zimmerman got away with murder , but you ca n't get away from God . And at the end of the day , he 's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with , '' Juror B29 told ABC , according to an article posted on the network 's website Thursday . '' -LRB- But -RRB- the law could n't prove it . ''

The juror , who used only her first name of Maddy out of concerns for her safety , told ABC that she and others on the panel felt Zimmerman was guilty , but that was n't enough .

`` You ca n't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty , '' she said . `` But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence . ''

Thursday night , Martin 's mother said she was devastated after hearing the juror 's comments .

`` It is devastating for my family to hear the comments from juror B29 , comments which we already knew in our hearts to be true . That George Zimmerman literally got away with murder , '' Sybrina Fulton said in a written statement . `` This new information challenges our nation once again to do everything we can to make sure that this never happens to another child . ''

Maddy is the second juror to speak about the high-profile case since the six-person , all-female jury acquitted Zimmerman earlier this month .

She and other jurors also have identified themselves by their numbers from the jury pool .

Opinion : What if both were white ?

Last week the woman known as Juror B37 told CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 '' that Zimmerman `` did n't do anything unlawful '' and was `` justified '' in shooting 17-year-old Martin last year .

Zimmerman has been out of the public eye since the jury found him not guilty of second degree murder on July 13 . His parents told ABC News last week that their family has received an `` enormous amount of death threats . ''

He fatally shot Martin in the Sanford , Florida , neighborhood where Zimmerman and Martin 's father lived in February 2012 . Zimmerman , who is Hispanic , had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person , and he said he shot Martin in self-defense .

The case became a flash point in debates over racial profiling , and thousands attended vigils across the country over the weekend , decrying the verdict .

Maddy , 36 , is Puerto Rican and a mother of eight children , ABC said . She was the only minority to deliberate in the case . She told ABC that the case was never about race to her .

At the beginning of deliberations , she told ABC , she wanted to convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder . But she realized on the second day of deliberations that there was n't enough proof to convict him of murder or the lesser charge of manslaughter .

`` I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury . I fought to the end , '' she said , according to ABC .

Juror B37 told CNN that the jury was initially split -- three and three along the line of guilt . Juror B37 was among those who believed Zimmerman was not guilty from the start .

She stressed that she and the other jurors took their responsibility seriously .

`` I do n't want people to think that we did n't think about this , and we did n't care about Trayvon Martin , because we did . We 're very sad that it happened to him , '' she said .

Juror B29 told ABC that the decision is still weighing heavily on her , and she thinks she owes Martin 's parents an apology .

`` It 's hard for me to sleep , it 's hard for me to eat because I feel I was forcefully included in Trayvon Martin 's death , '' she told ABC . `` And as I carry him on my back , I 'm hurting as much -LRB- as -RRB- Trayvon Martin 's mother because there 's no way that any mother should feel that pain . ''
