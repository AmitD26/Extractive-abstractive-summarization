-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Don Sterling 's punishment for his racist remarks was swift and severe .

It may also be good for business , according to several experts .

The owner of the Los Angeles Clippers was slapped with a lifetime ban by the commissioner of the National Basketball Association on Tuesday .

The blow came after tapes were leaked of him telling his girlfriend he did n't approve of her posting pictures of herself online with black people , adding that he did n't want her bringing them to games .

Sterling admits that he made the comments , NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in announcing that he planned to fine Sterling $ 2.5 million and force him to sell his team .

On the recording , Sterling 's girlfriend V. Stiviano pushes back , asking Sterling if he realizes that his players are black . -LRB- Through her lawyer , she denied leaking the tape to the media , but said the recording was genuine . -RRB-

Stiviano has a point . More than three-quarters of pro basketball players are black , according to a 2013 report by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida .

Perhaps equally important , basketball fans are disproportionately black , research shows -- which means that racist remarks could hurt the sport 's bottom line .

Some 45 % of television audiences for basketball are black , according to 2013 Nielsen research .

That 's much higher than for other major U.S. sports . About 15 % of NFL fans , 9 % of baseball fans and 3 % of hockey fans are black , Nielsen research shows . The country as a whole is just over 13 % black , the U.S. Census Bureau says .

`` There is a significant market segment of African-Americans who identify with the NBA and NBA players , '' said Simon Chadwick , a professor of sports business strategy and marketing at Coventry University in England .

And it 's not just about the fans turning their back on a sport , he said .

Sponsors were also beginning to distance themselves from the Clippers .

The auto company CarMax and the airline VirginAmerica both announced they were ending sponsorship of the team , as did State Farm Insurance , the second-largest NBA advertiser , according to Nielsen .

CarMax specifically took a stance against racism in its statement Monday cutting off its sponsorship .

`` CarMax finds the statements attributed to the Clippers ' owner completely unacceptable . These views directly conflict with CarMax 's culture of respect for all individuals . While we have been a proud Clippers sponsor for nine years and support the team , fans and community , these statements necessitate that CarMax end its sponsorship , '' the company said .

And it could have gotten much worse , sports marketing expert Robert Tuchman said .

`` It would have destroyed sponsorship not only with the Clippers , but with the NBA . There is no way any of these major brands would be associated with a league where this is one of the owners , '' said Tuchman , the president of Goviva .

That 's what prompted the league to act , he said .

`` The owners are n't going to do anything until it hits their bottom line , as much as they dislike '' the kind of comments Sterling made .

Chadwick calls this `` market-driven morality . ''

`` It 's not like reading the Bible , '' he said . `` Essentially corporations are looking at markets , looking at their consumers , and if being associated with a racist , a sexist , a dog fighter is bad business , they increasingly are making commercial decisions on that basis . ''

`` Commercial partners had already expressed their willingness to bail . Adam Silver did what he thought was right for the fans , for the customers , but also for the commercial partnerships that were in place , '' said Chadwick .

`` Market-driven morality '' is much more advanced in North America than elsewhere in the world , he argued , contrasting the reaction to Sterling 's comments with European soccer 's failure to stamp out racist abuse of players by fans .

The same weekend that Don Sterling 's remarks became public , a banana was thrown at Barcelona soccer star Dani Alves . The racist insult is thought to compare black players to monkeys .

Alves made a joke of it , picking up the banana and eating it , and a Twitter campaign sprang up in his support , led by his teammate , Brazilian soccer star Neymar .

But there was no top-down response from Spain 's La Liga or world football 's governing body , FIFA .

FIFA 's long-time head , Sepp Blatter , has been accused by critics of not taking racism seriously enough .

He suggested in 2011 that racist incidents should be resolved with a handshake , and last year argued against punishing teams for racist behavior by their fans .

`` Can we bring an end to violence or racism by docking points or relegating a team ? Or would such measures lead people to come to games to get the match abandoned , '' Blatter said in a speech in April 2013 at a meeting of the company Early Warning System , with which FIFA works to fight against match-fixing .

`` We should do all we can but there 's a risk that if we have matches replayed or if we punish clubs on the sporting front , it will open the door to hooligan groups who will come to deliberately cause trouble . ''

Blatter tweeted support for Adam Silver and the NBA on Wednesday .

But the NBA 's response to Sterling could put pressure on him to act more decisively , Chadwick said .

`` With the World Cup coming up , it really commits Blatter to taking action , '' he said of the global soccer tournament that starts in Brazil in June . `` Sepp Blatter could do this . However , I do n't think it 's just a moral decision , it 's a business decision too . ''
