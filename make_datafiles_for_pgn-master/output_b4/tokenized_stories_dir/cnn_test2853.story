`` I 'm looking to become well-rounded as a producer , director , screenwriter and actor , '' Prince Jackson told ET 's Brooke Anderson , who coached him on interviewing techniques .

Michael Jackson 's sister La Toya was `` very instrumental '' in setting up the job , a source close to her told CNN .

`` Prince came to her and asked for her help in starting his career , '' said the source , who was not authorized to talk to the media .

La Toya , who owns an entertainment company , `` was like an onset mom ! '' during the shoot , the source said . `` She was so caring , making sure he looked great , going over his script with him , and just -LRB- being -RRB- there for him 1000 % , coaching him for each day he worked . ''
