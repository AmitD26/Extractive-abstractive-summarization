-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The former cop who killed his wife and tried to cover it up by burning down their house was sentenced Monday to life in prison with the possibility of parole .

Judge Larry Solomon 's sentencing decision comes nearly two months after a Kansas jury convicted Brett Seacat of first-degree murder for killing his wife , Vashti Seacat .

`` You have n't admitted guilt . You have n't admitted responsibility , and you did n't this morning even express remorse that Vashti 's no longer on this earth , '' Solomon said . `` One of the victim 's family asked me to show you no mercy , and I do n't intend to show you any mercy . You did n't show Vashti any mercy on April 30 , 2011 . ''

Under the judge 's sentence -- the maximum allowable under Kansas law -- Seacat must spend 31 years and three months behind bars before he 's eligible for parole .

Cop accused of killing wife : ` She just seemed ... sad , upset '

At Monday 's hearing , Vashti Seacat 's family members asked the judge to give the maximum sentence and condemned the man who murdered her .

Brett Seacat maintained his innocence , accused the judge of conspiring to convict him and said the jurors were going to hell for their decision .

`` I teach about crimes , '' Seacat said . `` I know what covers up crimes and what does n't . I know that a bullet hole has never been covered up by a fire . I know that a murder has never been concealed by means of fire . I would n't have lit a fire to try to cover this up . ''

His attorneys said they planned to appeal the judge 's decision .

Prosecution undercuts handwriting expert

In June , a jury deliberated for six hours before deciding Seacat 's fate .

During her closing argument , prosecutor Amy Hanley said Seacat was full of uncontrollable rage because his wife had filed for divorce and was kicking him out their house .

`` He was like a burning fuse , '' said Hanley . `` That 's why he was reckless . ''

Throughout the trial , Seacat maintained his innocence . Defense attorney Roger Falk said that Vashti Seacat killed herself because she was depressed due to a side effect of her medication .

At Monday 's sentencing , Solomon said Seacat 's guilt was `` overwhelming . ''

`` Evidence to support your defense of suicide was totally unbelievable and totally unsupported by any credible evidence , '' he said .
