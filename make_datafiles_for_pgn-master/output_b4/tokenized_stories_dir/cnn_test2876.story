-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's going to take two to three weeks for thoroughbred California Chrome to heal from a nasty injury to his hoof , his trainer Art Sherman said Sunday .

`` He 's got a lot of talent , '' Sherman said of the colt that was the favorite for the Belmont Stakes but was denied his shot at becoming the first Triple Crown in 36 years . Tonalist was victorious Saturday at the storied race in Elmont , New York . California Chrome finished in a dead heat for fourth with Wicked Strong .

Sherman said the colt 's injury occurred during `` the first jump . ''

`` He just needs a little time off , '' Sherman said , explaining that the injury is `` superficial '' and not `` deep . '' Sherman assured that California Chrome will not be in any pain as his injury is treated in part with a special bandage , and his recuperation will involve some `` pasture time . ''

As to what went wrong for a horse who many thought would win Saturday , Sherman alluded to the amount of racing California Chrome did leading up to the Belmont Stakes .

The colt , which brought in $ 3.5 million this year , ran his third Triple Crown race in five weeks .

Eleven horses competed in the Belmont Stakes .

Sherman suggested Sunday that , as with any athlete , rest is just as pivotal as racing and training .

`` I think you need a little more time between races , '' he said .

Jockey Victor Espinoza seemed optimistic that Chrome would recover . `` Thank you to everyone for your support on this journey , you are awesome ! I hope California Chrome gets better soon , '' he tweeted Saturday evening .

California Chrome 's owner Steve Coburn was incensed Saturday that none of the top three finishers had raced in both the Derby and Preakness , the two prerequisites to the Triple Crown .

Those horse owners took `` the coward 's way out , '' Coburn blasted .

Coburn did n't ease off his comments Sunday .

On ABC , he was asked whether he regretted his rant .

`` Not only no , but hell no , '' Coburn answered . `` I do not regret it one bit . It 's the truth . ''

He was asked if he thought the rules should change so that horses should have to participate in the other two races to run at Belmont .

`` Yes I do , I mean think of it this way . OK , it says Triple Crown . You nominate your horse for the Triple Crown -- that means three . The Triple Crown trophy has three points on it . So when you earn enough points to be in the Kentucky Derby , those 20 horses that start in the Kentucky Derby should be the only 20 allowed to run in the Preakness and the Belmont , for the Triple Crown . ''

At a news conference , Sherman was asked what he thought of Coburn 's comments at the race .

Coburn was in `` the heat of the moment , '' he said . `` Sometimes your emotions get in front of you . ''
