-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Teenagers looking to buy cigarettes in New York may have to look elsewhere if a city council proposal is approved and signed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg . The proposal would raise the legal age to buy any form of tobacco from 18 to 21 . But will it be effective in limiting smoking among young people ?

Approximately 90 % of smokers have already started smoking by age 18 , according to the Surgeon General .

`` Of every three young smokers , only one will quit , and one of the remaining smokers will die from tobacco-related causes , '' according to the Surgeon General 's 2012 report , `` Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults . ''

The key is to `` try to reduce the number of young people who ever try a cigarette , '' said Dr. Michael Steinberg , director of the Tobacco Dependence Program at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , New Jersey .

Steinberg is the co-author of a commentary published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine that looks at the pros and cons of the New York proposal . Critics say small businesses will suffer , and the city will lose tax revenue . Others say the proposed law will be hard to enforce and will impinge upon individual rights .

But Steinberg argues teens need help to avoid picking up the habit .

`` I think a 21-year-old is much more likely , based on their maturity and life experiences , to be able to make an informed rational decision about a behavior that might affect the rest of their life than , say , an 18-year-old , '' Steinberg said .

He said that an 18-year-old is not necessarily thinking about the risks associated with smoking .

`` Cigarettes and tobacco contain some of the most addictive chemicals in our society , '' said Steinberg . `` Smoking a cigarette delivers more nicotine more efficiently to your brain than if you were to inject nicotine intravenously . ''

Tobacco study finds ` urgent need ' for policy change

The New York proposal was introduced in April by Dr. Thomas A. Farley , the city 's health commissioner , and Christine C. Quinn , City Council speaker and a mayoral candidate . A vote on the proposal is expected to take place this fall , according to a spokesperson from the City Council 's office .

Federal law prohibits the sale of tobacco to people under the age of 18 . Alaska , Alabama , Utah and New Jersey require people to be 19 .

Officials in New York estimate that raising the purchasing age to 21 will cut tobacco use by 55 % among 18 - to 20-year-olds and lead to a 67 % drop among teens aged 14 to 17 years .

Steinberg knows that limiting access to tobacco is not the only strategy for reducing youth smoking , but it 's a start .

`` It 's not going to fix the problem in and of itself , '' said Steinberg . `` You also need educational programs . ''

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , a panel of health care experts , now recommends that primary care physicians offer patients interventions , education and counseling to prevent tobacco use among children and adolescents .

Their reasoning ? If teens never light up , they may never get hooked .
