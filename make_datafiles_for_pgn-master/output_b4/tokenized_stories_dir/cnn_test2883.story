-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A nasty collision during a kickoff in 1997 left Kevin Turner seeing stars .

The former Philadelphia Eagles fullback , who spent eight seasons battering through defensive lines in the National Football League , said the hit left him wondering where he was .

Still , the team 's medical staff looked him over and eventually sent him back out to play , he said .

`` The doctor looked in my eyes , '' Turner recalled in a statement delivered by his attorney in response to questions from CNN . `` He then told me to remember these words , either four or five simple , basic words . ''

But the task proved daunting .

`` It was the weirdest thing ever and most frustrating because at the time I was clamoring to get back into the game , '' said Turner . `` I was really trying so hard . And I remember it being just the most frustrating thing ever . ''

By the second half , he 'd remembered .

`` I went back in the game after halftime and played the rest of the game , '' he added in the statement to CNN .

A little over a decade later , the former Eagle is battling the debilitating effects of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , often known as ALS or Lou Gehrig 's disease .

He said his doctors have told him that `` there 's no cure , you 're going to die within two to 10 years , and get your affairs in order . ''

Since the diagnosis , Turner has lost most of the use of his hands and arms . He 's also agreed to submit his brain to scientific study following his death .

Whether Turner 's disease , and those like it , can be linked to the consequences of repeated head trauma is the subject of growing research and the focus of mounting litigation against the NFL .

Turner is one of hundreds of former NFL players and their families currently suing the league for alleged negligence , claiming that it did n't do enough to mitigate the risks despite what many say is an inherently dangerous sport .

His attorney , Stephen F. Rosenthal -- whose Miami-based firm represents 137 other players and their families who 've filed a class-action suit against the league -- said Turner has likely suffered from undiagnosed concussions . He accused the league of deliberately withholding information deemed critical to player safety .

`` At no time did the NFL inform Plaintiff Turner that he risked severe and permanent brain damage by returning to play too soon after sustaining a concussion , '' the lawsuit states . `` The NFL 's failure was a substantial cause of his current injuries . ''

Stars such as former quarterback Jim McMahon , as well as running backs Jamal Lewis and Dorsey Levens , have filed similar lawsuits in states across the country .

Attorneys representing Lewis and Levens accuse the league of having used a `` hand-picked committee of physicians '' to misrepresent evidence of the effects of head trauma , particularly concussions .

`` We do believe the NFL knew and had that available information with them for many years now , '' said attorney Mike McGlamry .

The league denies the claims and released a statement saying it `` has long made player safety a priority and continues to take steps to protect players and to advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions . ''

`` The NFL has never misled players with respect to the risks associated with playing football , '' the statement added . `` Any suggestion to the contrary has no merit . ''

A spokesman for the Philadelphia Eagles , regarding Turner 's allegations , referred CNN to the league 's statement .

On Sunday , the NFL is expected to air a multimillion-dollar commercial during the Super Bowl that details the history of the league and emphasizes player health and safety .

The league has in recent years also made strides to strengthen rules that govern on-the-field conduct while adding sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- to more independently evaluate injured players .

In 2005 , the league banned the practice of tackling a player by using his shoulder pads , a move commonly referred to as a `` horse-collar '' tackle , after concluding it commonly resulted in injury .

It also strengthened a 1979 rule prohibiting players from using their helmets to butt , or `` spear , '' players during a tackle -- a rule that critics often complained had lacked enforcement .

Players like Steelers ' linebacker James Harrison have since been dealt hefty and repeated fines for helmet-first tackles .

Critics , meanwhile , say the league should have made the changes years ago and have called for more protections .

Part of the issue , noted a former Atlanta Falcons linebacker , is a sports culture that largely encourages behavior out-of-step with the recognized risks of head trauma .

It 's exacerbated when coaches , even at the high school level , say '' ` Oh , you just got your bell rung . Get back out there and play , ' '' noted Coy Wire . That attitude , he added , can contribute to the risks of long-term brain damage .

A recent study conducted at Boston University 's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy found evidence of a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- a dementia-like brain disease -- had been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former NFL players . Their cases shared a common thread -- repeated concussions , sub-concussive blows to the head , or both , according to the study .

Many of those named in the recent claims , meanwhile , describe a range of common symptoms that include headaches , sleeplessness and dementia . But whether the league can be proven liable for alleged mistreatment of players , who often acknowledge the risks and likely also suffered head trauma during their high school and collegiate years , is expected to be the source of a drawn-out legal battle involving a growing number of plaintiffs .

Still , family and friends close to the players are often left to deal with the gritty aftermath of day-to-day living once the bright lights of prime time fades .

Teresa Foley , the wife of former New York Jets quarterback Glenn Foley , who is named in the class-action lawsuit , said she 'd like to organize a support group .

`` We 're all going through the same thing , '' said Teresa Foley . `` It 'd be great for all of us to be able to just sit down and talk together . ''

She says her husband , a 41-year-old New Jersey native selected in 1994 by the Jets , has faced bouts of depression and severe memory loss since his retirement from the league more than a decade ago .

`` I sent him to the supermarket a couple of months ago with a list of a few things , '' said Teresa Foley . `` He went with the list . But he forgot what he had to get , and also forgot that he had a list . ''

The former quarterback returned home empty-handed .

`` It 's getting scary , '' she said . `` We had a conversation last night and he does n't even remember it today .

`` I just want some place where my husband can go to get help . ''

Part of the claim , the former players ' attorneys say , would be used to establish a fund for former players .

Earlier this week , a panel of judges ruled that mounting claims against the league -- including class-action lawsuits filed in New York , New Jersey , Florida , Georgia and California -- will be consolidated in a federal court in Philadelphia .
