-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Regis Philbin asked David Letterman about the difficult decision to return to the air less than a week after 9/11 , the `` Late Show '' host said , `` I remember not wanting to go back , not feeling ready to go back , but knowing we had to go back . And you know -- my concerns were minimal compared to people who really suffered . ''

Philbin , sitting in for Piers Morgan , in his return to hosting after leaving `` Regis and Kelly '' gets Letterman to open up about fatherhood , politics , his career , his friendship with the late Johnny Carson and more .

Letterman 's `` Late Show '' guests on September 17 , 2001 , were Philbin and Dan Rather , and his completely joke-free monologue was solemnly delivered from behind his desk rather than the usual center stage . Letterman praised New York firefighters , police officers and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani . Of those who carried out the attacks , he said : `` We were told that they were zealots fueled by religious fervor , and if you live to be a thousand years old , will that make any sense to you ? ''

When Philbin asked Letterman to take him back to the beginning of his career , Letterman recalled falling behind in college until the semester he took a public speaking course at Ball State University in Muncie , Indiana . He referred to the class as a `` lifeline '' that made him realize he `` might be able to turn this into doing something . ''

Letterman graduated from Ball State in 1969 and six years later went to California to try to make it as a writer . He found success quickly , he told Philbin , `` not because of me . It was just in those days ... if you wanted to go to California and become a comic or get involved in comedy , writing , performing , whatever , the blueprint for that was laid out in front of you every night on ` The Tonight Show . ' ''

The show 's host , Carson , often plugged comedians ' appearances at the Comedy Store , and Letterman saw the famed Hollywood comedy club as `` an instant connection . ''

Three years later , in 1978 , Letterman appeared on `` The Tonight Show . ''

On that appearance , Carson predicted great success for the young comedian , and Letterman , watching the old `` Tonight Show '' clip , told Philbin , `` That breaks my heart -- to see Johnny again . ''

Letterman recalled Carson 's early influence on him .

`` He was , I think , the biggest star in television . And I was just a kid who has followed ... the beacon of his light coming out of Burbank . ''

Letterman called Carson 's friendship `` a tremendous blessing '' and said he made a point of telling him the way he felt . Letterman recalled the last time he saw Carson .

`` The way life is , '' Letterman said , `` you do n't know that that will be the last time , but it turned out to be the last time , and it could n't have been a lovelier evening . And I cherish that because it was unusual . It was not going to happen under any other circumstances . And it was my wife , myself , Johnny and his wife on Johnny 's yacht that he had anchored in the Hudson .

`` And it was a Friday evening and we sailed off just before sunset and went up the Hudson , up under the George Washington Bridge , which is lovely , turned around , now the sun is setting . We go out to the Statue of Liberty and see that at night , as the sky is darkening . And then you turn around and we headed up the East River , and you see the lower tip of Manhattan , and it was a sight and an experience . ... You never get to see New York like that . ''

Carson passed away in 2005 .

Letterman has hosted `` Late Show With David Letterman '' on CBS for nearly 19 years . Before then , he hosted `` Late Night With David Letterman '' on NBC for 11 years .

One staple of both shows -- the `` Top Ten '' list -- is still going strong .

`` It was a cheap , easy way to refill a category and get some laughs most nights , '' Letterman said . When Philbin asked if coming up with the lists was `` a chore , '' the `` Late Show '' host joked , `` Not for me . ... I 'm not even in the building . I 'm an old man with a facial . ''

Letterman also said that his favorite guests -- besides Philbin , of course -- were `` people who really come and do a great job for us . '' He counted Tom Hanks , Bill Murray , Brian Williams , Tom Brokaw and Don Rickles among the `` handful of people who are really , really strong . ''

When Philbin brought up the fact that , in the past , talk-show hosts have avoided politics so as not to alienate their audiences , Letterman said , `` I have been guilty of appearing to be playing partisan politics . However , I 'd just like to say that for the record , I am a registered independent . ''

Letterman insisted the material drives his jokes , and noted that `` no president that I am aware of got hammered harder than Bill -- President Bill Clinton -- over the Monica Lewinsky situation . We beat up on him . We still use him as a reference , and then we were desperate . We thought , ` Well , this was so easy ' -- and then we got George Bush . ''

Letterman said that while he may appear to have a political agenda , it 's simply a matter of who 's easier to poke fun at .

`` If a guy drops his dog or a guy straps his dog to the roof of a car or if a guy gets a shoe thrown at him , well , this is where the material is going to be , '' Letterman said .

Philbin also asked Letterman about fatherhood . The comedian 's son , Harry , is 8 .

`` Life is no longer solely about you , '' Letterman said . `` It 's about him . ''

Philbin asked if Harry knew what his dad did for a living .

`` No , '' the comedian joked , `` he thinks I have a job in a metal shop . ''

Letterman said he and his son took up skiing four years ago and very much enjoy the sport . Harry also loves animals , Letterman told Philbin , and likes to visit his father at work when `` Late Show '' does its `` Stupid Pet Tricks '' segment or has zookeeper Jack Hanna as a guest .

When Philbin asked whether Harry was a `` mama 's boy '' or a `` daddy 's boy , '' Letterman answered , `` He 's a mama 's boy , for sure . ''

What 's great about being the 65-year-old father of an 8-year-old ?

`` I 'm old enough now where if I see trouble down the road , I 'll probably be dead by then , and it will be his stepfather 's problem . ''
