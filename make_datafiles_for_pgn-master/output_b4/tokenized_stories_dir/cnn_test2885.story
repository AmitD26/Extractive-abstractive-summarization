-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The prospect of competing in the 2012 London Olympics left British rower Mohamed Sbihi with a big dilemma .

As a practicing Muslim , Sbihi , who has Moroccan family , should be starting his month-long Ramadan fast on July 21 , abstaining from food and water during daylight hours .

But it clashes with what should be the pinnacle of his career so far when he competes in the British men 's eight at the Olympics on home water .

A compromise was needed .

`` My faith is really important to me , '' Sbihi said in an interview with CNN 's Human to Hero series . `` I make sure I say the first verse of the Koran before every single race , whether it be out loud or in my head .

`` I spoke to my family here , spoke to my family back home in Morocco , and at the end of the day I 'm making the right decision for me , and that 's to postpone my fast . ''

It is n't only his faith that will inspire him . The devoted Arsenal football fan will also turn to music to fire him up before he races .

`` I like to listen to quite violent hip-hop rap kinda of stuff before I get on the water , '' he said . `` I do listen to one song : Eminem feat . Lil Wayne -- No Love . ''

Football fan

Born in Britain to an English mother and Moroccan father , Sbihi had one sport on his mind when he was 15 -- and it was n't rowing .

Sbihi -- nicknamed `` Moe '' by his friends -- spent as much time as possible on the football pitch , but the visit of British rowing 's talent identification scouts to his school in Surbiton persuaded him to try a different pursuit .

`` I was n't really for the idea ... I just wanted to play football , '' he said . `` The coach that was testing at the time saw me and said , ` Make sure that boy is there . ' I had the raw parameters to be a really successful rower . ''

That same year , he won Under-15 gold at the British indoor championships and he went on to win bronze in the men 's four at the Under-23 World Championships .

Hitting the heights

Now the 24-year-old is preparing to compete in his first Olympics -- and he should n't be too hard to spot .

At six foot eight inches -LRB- 2.03 meters -RRB- , Sbihi is the tallest member of the British eight -- although his physique is not unusual in rowing .

`` If I was n't a rower , I 'd love to be a basketball player . I love basketball , I love watching it , '' he said .

`` And basketball you kind of fit in . It 's the same thing with rowing , you just sit here and everyone is tall . And you 're like , ` Is this the land of the giants ? ' ''

Size matters

Being the biggest member of a crew is not necessarily an advantage , Sbihi says , so keeping his weight down is crucial .

`` When it comes to summer racing I 'm the biggest guy -- I can also easily be the heaviest guy . By me being lighter , and keeping the same power , it would be beneficial to the crew . ''

Gold target

Sbihi moved up to the eight crew in 2010 , having raced in the pair and the four at youth level , and Britain looks set to renew its rivalry with Germany at the Games .

The British eight finished second behind the dominant Germans at the 2010 and 2011 World Championships .

However , Sbihi is n't interested in collecting another silver medal .

`` I 'm in this to win , '' he said . `` I only want one thing and that is an Olympic medal . I went four years not winning anything and if I just win that gold medal ... I 'll be happy . My legacy would be that gold medal . ''

Britain 's rowing legends

If he does win gold , Sbihi will follow in the footsteps of some of the biggest names in British rowing .

Steve Redgrave won titles at five successive Olympics , while Matthew Pinsent won four in a row and James Cracknell won gold in the coxless four in 2000 and 2004 .

`` Pincent , Cracknell and Redgrave they were able to do that for 20 years , 16 years and 12 years , '' Sbihi says .

`` That 's pretty impressive . It 's unimaginable for me to be able to try to better Redgrave . ''
