WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When you see people at the office using such Internet sites as Facebook and MySpace , you might suspect those workers are slacking off .

A social-networking site for the world of spying officially launches for the U.S. intelligence community this month .

But that 's not the case at the CIA , the FBI and the National Security Agency , where bosses are encouraging their staff members to use a new social-networking site designed for the super-secret world of spying .

`` It 's every bit Facebook and YouTube for spies , but it 's much , much more , '' said Michael Wertheimer , assistant deputy director of national intelligence for analysis .

The program is called A-Space , and it 's a social-networking site for analysts within the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies .

Instead of posting thoughts about the new Avenged Sevenfold album or Jessica Alba movie , CIA analysts could use A-Space to share information and opinion about al Qaeda movements in the Middle East or Russian naval maneuvers in the Black Sea .

The new A-Space site has been undergoing testing for months and launches officially for the nation 's entire intelligence community September 22 .

`` It 's a place where not only spies can meet but share data they 've never been able to share before , '' Wertheimer said . `` This is going to give them for the first time a chance to think out loud , think in public amongst their peers , under the protection of an A-Space umbrella . ''

Wertheimer demonstrated the program to CNN to show how analysts will use it to collaborate .

`` One perfect example is if Osama bin Laden comes out with a new video . How is that video obtained ? Where are the very sensitive secret sources we may have to put into a context that 's not apparent to the rest of the world ? '' Wertheimer asked .

`` In the past , whoever captured that video or captured information about the video kept it in-house . It 's highly classified , because it has so very short a shelf life . That information is considered critical to our understanding . ''

The goal of A-Space , like intelligence analysis in general , is to protect the United States by assessing all the information available to the spy agencies . Missing crucial data can have enormous implications , such as an FBI agent who sent an e-mail before September 11 , 2001 , warning of people learning to fly airplanes but not learning to land them .

`` There was the question , ` Was that a dot that failed to connect ? ' Well , that person did this via e-mail , '' Wertheimer said . `` A-Space is the kind of place where you can log that observation and know that your fellow analysts can see that . ''

Even though Facebook , MySpace and other social-networking sites that inspired A-Space are predominantly the domain of young people , there apparently is no such generational divide on A-Space .

`` We have found that participation in A-Space crosses every conceivable age line and experience line . People are excited , no matter what age group , '' Wertheimer said .

Of course , the material on A-Space is highly classified , so it wo n't be available for the public . Only intelligence personnel with the proper security clearance , and a reason to be examining particular information , can access the site . The creators of A-Space do not want it to be used by some future double agent such as Jonathan Pollard or Robert Hanssen to steal America 's 21st-century secrets .

`` We 're building -LSB- a -RSB- mechanism to alert that behavior . We call that , for lack of a better term , the MasterCard , where someone is using their credit card in a way they 've never used it before , and it alerts so that maybe that credit card has been stolen , '' Wertheimer said . `` Same thing here . We 're going to actually do patterns on the way people use A-Space . ''

Yes , analysts can collect friends on A-Space the way people can on Facebook . But nobody outside the intelligence community will ever know -- because they 're secret .
