WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On April 20 , President Obama challenged his Cabinet to cut $ 100 million in spending over the next 90 days .

White House spokesman Robert Gibbs says a report on Cabinet spending cuts will be released `` in coming days . ''

The deadline came -- and went -- without a report from the White House on whether or not that promise was fulfilled .

Asked about the spending cuts , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Monday that information still was being compiled .

`` Those are being reviewed now , and we 'll release something in the coming days , '' Gibbs told the daily White House briefing .

At time the challenge was announced , critics said $ 100 million in savings was a small amount on the context of the federal budget .

`` Any amount of savings is obviously welcome , '' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , said in April . `` But -LSB- $ 100 million is -RSB- about the average amount we 'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year . ''

In April , Gibbs insisted that ordinary Americans nevertheless would appreciate the savings effort .

`` Only in Washington , D.C. , is $ 100 million not a lot of money , '' Gibbs said .

The issue is a sensitive one for Obama at a time of fierce Republican criticism about increased government spending for the economic stimulus plan .

Republicans also oppose health care reform proposals by Democrats that would cost $ 1 trillion or more over the next 10 years .

Obama is pushing for fast congressional action on a health care overhaul .
