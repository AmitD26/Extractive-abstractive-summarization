WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- About 100 people , including students majoring in homeland security and criminal justice , were arrested Tuesday in an undercover drug sting at San Diego State University , officials said .

Officials say the evidence seized includes 50 pounds of marijuana , four pounds of cocaine and 350 ecstasy pills .

Among those arrested , 75 were students , one of them a criminal justice major charged with possession of guns and cocaine , authorities said . One student allegedly dealing cocaine was a month short of obtaining a master 's degree in homeland security at the California school and worked under campus police as a student community service officer .

Campus police initiated the investigation about a year ago , after a student 's fatal overdose in May 2007 , university President Steve Weber said . About five months ago , as the investigation evolved , campus police sought and received help from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .

There was a second overdose death in February at a fraternity house .

`` If proven guilty , these individuals have preyed on students and have ruined hundreds of lives , '' Weber said . In addition to facing criminal charges , the students have been suspended from school and evicted from campus housing , he said .

Twenty-one people who are not students were arrested recently on a variety of drug charges , officials said .

Damon Mosler , chief of the narcotics division for the San Diego County District Attorney 's Office , was surprised by what he described as the dealers ' openness about what they were doing .

`` They were n't picky about who they sold to , '' he said , alleging that undercover officers would simply call them and say , '' ` Hey , I heard you deal . Will you sell to me ? '

`` And they did . ''

Officials say the evidence seized as part of Operation Sudden Fall includes four pounds of cocaine , 50 pounds of marijuana and 350 ecstasy pills . Authorities also took one shotgun , three semiautomatic pistols and $ 60,000 .

In all , authorities confiscated more than $ 100,000 worth of drugs , Mosler said . Bags of marijuana weighing four or five pounds would sell for $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 , he said , and a kilogram of cocaine would sell for about $ 17,000 .

Before going to Las Vegas for the weekend , fraternity members involved in the sale of drugs sent text messages to their customers saying , `` We 're going to close out our inventory '' and inviting them to `` buy the cocaine at discounted prices , '' Mosler said .

After the weekend , they sent another text message saying they were back and ready to do business , Mosler said .

Search warrants were carried out last week on suspects ' houses off campus , and search warrants were served Tuesday at on-campus housing .

Mosler described the students as `` mid-level distributors '' who were selling more than a person might buy for personal use .

He identified Phi Kappa Psi and Theta Chi as the two fraternities involved . In the latter case , firearms were found in the house , he said .

The firearms included semiautomatic 9 mm or .40-caliber handguns and a rifle , Mosler said .

He said the students face charges that include possession for sale and sale of cocaine , ecstasy and marijuana .

DEA agents infiltrated several student drug distribution cells and made more than 130 drug purchases and seizures , a news release said .

Authorities said they infiltrated seven campus fraternities and found that in some , most of the students were aware of drug dealing by fraternity brothers .
