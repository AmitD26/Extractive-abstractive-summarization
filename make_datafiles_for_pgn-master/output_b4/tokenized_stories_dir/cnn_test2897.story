-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bagpipes are n't a sound one readily associates with Greece .

Yet along with the menacingly slow beat of a drum , they 're the soundtrack of one of the country 's more unusual historic tours .

A small group , illuminated by gas lanterns , is standing at the foot of a medieval moat at the entrance to one of Europe 's best-preserved medieval cities and a UNESCO World Heritage site -- the Old Town in Rhodes .

A guide dressed as one of the Knights of Saint John is leading the tour , dredging up some of the island 's more sinister history , including how Sultan Suleiman the Great used fallen bodies from his own army to cross the moat during the 1522 Siege of Rhodes .

Experiencing the ` new ' Greece

Perhaps even more surreal than this somewhat kitsch historical re-enactment is the fact that it was conceived by one of the island 's most exclusive resorts : Lindian Village -LRB- Rhodes ; +30 22440 35900 ; rooms from $ 213 ; Medieval Mystery Tour $ 203 per person -RRB- .

This year , the property launched a series of unique offerings under the heading `` Experience Greece . ''

Other excursions include a fishing expedition on a caique -LRB- a traditional wooden fishing boat -RRB- , beauty treatments performed with natural Greek products -LRB- yogurt , honey and lemon -RRB- and wine tastings from small vineyards in the surrounding Dodecanese islands .

Mariza Sviriadis , the hotel 's managing director , says the idea came to her during the six-year economic crisis that brought much of the country to its knees .

`` The whole of Greece , it was like a small war , '' she tells CNN .

While many properties on the island reacted by pushing out all-inclusive packages -- essentially keeping tourists indoors and away from local businesses in dire need of cash -- Sviriadis decided to take the opposite approach .

She launched `` Experience Greece '' to get guests out of the hotel , and to promote sites that , though deserving , had remained under the radar for far too long .

`` I wanted to show that there was more to Greece than that , and more to Greece than feta cheese , '' she says .

`` The crisis forced us to change the way we were thinking , and to get creative . Before , we could be a bit arrogant . Now , we have to be the best . ''

Nothing to lose

Sviriadis is n't alone .

Throughout Greece , the recession is changing tourist offerings , giving them a new slant .

`` The crisis is the best thing that happened to me , '' says Tina Kyriakis , founder of Alternative Athens -LRB- +30 6948 405 242 ; tours from $ 60 per person -RRB- .

Kyriakis worked in marketing for a multinational corporation before she was laid off in 2010 .

Two years later , she launched her own tourism company .

Like Sviriadis , she noticed that tour offerings in Athens had been stuck in a rut .

`` I looked around at what existed in Athens in terms of tourism and it was all very standard , very stereotypical , all ` ancient Athens ' , '' she says .

`` There is so much more to Athens than just the ancient part .

`` It 's a very complicated city and you have to get under its skin to understand it and appreciate it . So that was the concept . ''

In addition to its quirky walking tours -LRB- among the most popular are a graffiti tour and a guided walk through the `` enchanted forests '' outside the city -RRB- , the company pairs visitors with Athenian gourmets , who host four-course supper clubs in their apartments .

She now hosts two tours a day , attracting up to 25 visitors at a time .

If it were n't for Greece 's economic slump , she says she might never have found the courage to start the venture .

`` It was the kick in the butt I needed . I could either go back to the corporate world , which does n't have a future in Greece any more , or I could do this .

`` So I just jumped in and did it , because there was nothing I could lose . ''

Beyond the package vacation

There are many regions in Greece that package tour operators miss , regions that are only recently starting to find their voice .

The island of Milos is a case in point .

Sure , it 's home to Phylakopi , a bronze-aged settlement that lays claim to being one of Europe 's oldest cities .

It also possesses a history of mineral extraction that would set any geologist 's heart aflutter and is where the Venus de Milo was uncovered .

Yet it has been largely overlooked by tour operators , low-cost airlines and visitors alike .

`` We 're not that kind of destination . We have small family-run hotels that focus on service and quality rather than volume , '' says Antonis Mallis , who runs boutique travel agency Travel Me to Milos -LRB- +30 22870 41008 ; packages from $ 40 per person per day -RRB- .

`` We do n't have hotels where you can go in and sell , sell , sell .

`` That 's why tour operators do n't like us that much . We 're a headache .

Mallis started his company in 2011 after leaving a lucrative position at an insurance company to return to his home island .

`` The majority said , ` are you crazy ? You 're leaving a very good , well-paying job for something like this ? ' ''

Mallis recognized that Milos had a lot to offer travelers : ancient thermal baths , underwater caves , an old pirate lair , third-century catacombs decorated with Christian murals .

He also recognized that no one was talking up the island 's assets , or making them accessible .

`` It 's easy to go online and get a cheap room . It 's not easy to get in-depth knowledge of a destination .

`` If someone contacts us , we can tell them where to go , or which way the wind is blowing that day . ''

Mallis supplies more than weather updates .

His specialty is archeology and geological tours , which highlight some of the island 's incredible scenery .

He 's also teamed up with other vendors on the island to offer a range of sailing and hiking expeditions .

He recently introduced cooking lessons that showcase the island 's local cheese and produce .

`` As a young boy , I 'd remember seeing the odd , small German group walking around the island , but that was it . Now , we have something more organized , we 're reaching more markets , and we 're seeing progress , '' he says .
