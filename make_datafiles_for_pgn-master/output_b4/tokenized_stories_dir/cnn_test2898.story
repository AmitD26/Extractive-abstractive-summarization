Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The trigger of China 's biggest political scandal in a generation , Wang Lijun was once a feared police chief whose crime fighting exploits inspired a TV series .

He is now serving a 15-year prison sentence after being found guilty in September 2012 of abuse of power , defection and bribe taking .

Wang 's fall from grace began in early February of that year when he arrived at the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu in southwestern China in an apparent asylum attempt .

During a frenzied 24 hours , he reportedly revealed to U.S. officials a jaw-dropping tale of corruption and murder in the nearby municipality of Chongqing involving his boss and the city 's mayor , Bo Xilai .

Bo , a charismatic and popular leader , was a contender for a top position in the Communist Party .

Wang was later collected by central government authorities , and city officials said he had gone on medical leave following `` immense mental stress . ''

The dramatic events unleashed by Wang threatened to derail the once-in-a-decade leadership transition at the end of 18th Communist Party Congress .

However , before the November 2012 Congress , officials charged Bo 's wife , Gu Kailai , and a family aide with `` intentional homicide . '' After a two-day trial in August of the same year , she was found guilty of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood , once a friend of the Bo family . Gu was given a suspended death sentence , the aide was sentenced to nine years in jail .

The following month Bo was expelled from the Communist Party and relieved of his duty . In July 2013 , state media said he had been indicted for bribery , corruption and abuse of power .

Timeline : Bo Xilai 's fall from grace

Wang 's rise to prominence

Wang was born in a remote corner of Inner Mongolia and spent two years as a `` rusticated youth '' during the Cultural Revolution in the 1970s .

He first crossed paths with Bo in the northeastern province of Liaoning where he had worked his way up the region 's public security bureau and Bo was governor .

After Bo was promoted to the top job in Chongqing in 2007 , Wang followed him and was assigned to lead his crime-fighting program .

Under Wang , the `` da hei '' -LRB- literally translated as `` smash black '' -RRB- campaign reportedly caught nearly 3,000 criminal groups and detained thousands of suspects . It also led to the execution of notorious figures in the city 's underworld .

The crackdown , along with economic reforms in the city of more than 30 million , helped burnish the political credentials of Bo , who aspired for a spot in the Party 's Standing Committee of the Politburo , a nine-member body that effectively rules China .

Allegations of torture

Wang 's heavy-handed , crime-busting methods were decried as brutal by critics .

At the height of the campaign , Beijing-based lawyer Li Zhuang defended an alleged gang member and discovered police torture during interrogation .

`` For eight days and eight nights , my client was repeatedly hung from the ceiling , '' Li recalled in an interview with CNN .

`` He eventually soiled himself . His interrogators ordered him to remove the feces on the floor with his bare hands and use his shorts to wipe it clean . Then they hung him up naked . ''

As he tried to expose the interrogators ' crimes , Li said , he was detained , tortured and promptly sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison under the direct order of Wang for `` fabricating evidence and inciting witnesses . ''

Wang was also known for his unconventional working style and according to the Chongqing Commercial News , once worked as a taxi driver to gauge public opinion on local security and police issues .

The most hated figure ?

Wang 's two-day trial took place in Chengdu in September 2012 .

He faced four charges -- bending the law for selfish ends , defection , abuse of power and bribe taking .

Some observers said his15-year jail term appeared lenient given that bribe-taking can carry the death penalty in China , depending on the amount involved and the gravity of the case .

Prosecutors said that Wang knew that Gu was involved in the murder of Heywood but covered up for her .

They added that Wang used illegal surveillance measures , forged documents and accepted massive bribes to secure benefits for other individuals .

Political observers have said that Wang , not Bo , `` is probably the most hated '' figure in the eyes of the Beijing leadership for attempting to defect .
