-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The New Zealand political party founded by German Internet tycoon Kim Dotcom has joined forces with a firebrand Maori activist , in what is being described as one of the world 's most unlikely political marriages of convenience .

`` It 's a very unusual alliance ... It 's like Mark Zuckerberg getting into alliance with Fidel Castro , '' political scientist Bryce Edwards , of the University of Otago , told CNN . `` The individuals involved are larger than life and dynamic people , but their ideological backgrounds are pretty disparate . ''

The Internet-Mana Party alliance between Dotcom 's Internet Party and the left-wing , indigenous-focused Mana Party was announced by Mana 's leader , the controversial Maori nationalist MP Hone Harawira .

`` It 's completely new ground , but politics is about the art of the possible and I 'm looking forward to what we can achieve , '' Harawira , seated next to the Internet Party 's chief executive Vikram Kumar , told reporters .

Dotcom , the controversial founder of the shuttered file-sharing site Megaupload , can not personally run for office as he is not a citizen of his adopted home of New Zealand .

The wealthy Web entrepreneur , who is battling extradition to the U.S. on criminal digital piracy charges , launched his party in January , with a pledge to focus on Internet privacy and government surveillance , and to make politics exciting .

Critics , including New Zealand Prime Minister John Key , have described Dotcom 's political activities as part of an attempt to protect himself against U.S. extradition efforts .

But Harawira said the issue of whether Mana would support Dotcom 's efforts to remain in New Zealand had `` not even come up once '' in discussions . `` It 's not a matter on the table at all . ''

` Gaming the system '

Bryce said the alliance represented an attempt by the two political minnows `` to game the electoral system and help each other get their politicians into parliament '' at the general elections in September .

Under New Zealand 's proportional voting system , a party must win either an electorate seat or at least 5 % of the nationwide vote to get into parliament -- a situation that hindered new parties , said Edwards , because potential supporters feared their vote would be wasted .

But if Harawira retained his electorate seat , it would remove the need for the party to cross the 5 % threshold , and both parties could expect their share of the national vote to count towards a representative share of seats in the 120-member parliament .

Edwards said he tipped the buzz around the alliance could see it fare well in the September vote . `` New Zealanders like to see outsiders having a go , '' he said . `` The sum of the whole is going to be greater than the two parts . ''

Odd couple

The two parties make strange bedfellows , apparently sharing little common ground beyond their opposition to the current center-right National government .

`` On the two issues these parties are principally known for , Internet freedom and Maori nationalism , there does n't seem to be any crossover whatsoever , '' said Edwards . `` They 're quite different versions of anti-establishment . One 's an urban , middle-class , tech version , the other 's more traditional left-wing , almost anti-capitalist . ''

Harawira , the son of a veteran Maori radical , has a long history of strident Maori activism and is seen as a figure of the far-left .

He has been a polarizing presence in parliament since he was elected in a seat reserved for Maori voters in 2005 , criticized for remarks perceived as racist against white New Zealanders , and for calling for an opposition leader to be shot .

He eventually split with the Maori Party in 2011 over their support of the government . His new party , Mana , was established primarily as a vehicle to represent the interests of indigenous New Zealanders but also attracted support from non-Maori left-wing activists .

Dotcom 's political tendencies are less well-known . He has previously made a NZ$ 50,000 -LRB- $ 42,792 -RRB- donation to a right-wing New Zealand politician at the opposite end of the political spectrum to Mana , but the yet-to-be announced leader of the Internet Party , who will be named on Thursday , is somebody Harawira says he can work with .

Internet Party chief executive Kumar said the two parties would retain their separate policies , and acknowledged his party was providing the bulk of the financial backing to the alliance .

` Big mistake '

Harawira 's decision to team with Dotcom 's party has already drawn criticism .

One of the Mana Party 's founding members , the left-wing activist and former lawmaker Sue Bradford , quit the party over the move , which she labeled a `` big mistake . ''

`` Sucking up to a German millionaire is not in my future , '' she told reporters . `` There 's no way I can continue to be in a party where we are all really just the political plaything of a millionaire Internet mogul . ''

Harawira 's former party has also attacked the move , with Maori Party co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell telling CNN affiliate TVNZ that `` utilizing Maori seats to drag in somebody who is questionable about their knowledge about things Maori ... it 's not on . ''
