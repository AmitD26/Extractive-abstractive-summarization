-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Dunn will have to wait another day -- at least -- to learn his fate .

He is charged with first-degree murder in the November 2012 death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis , one of four black teenagers who were in an SUV shot by Dunn -- who is white -- in violence that flared from an argument over loud music .

The Jacksonsville , Florida , jury in Dunn 's case deliberated all day Friday , only to send a message to the judge shortly before 7 p.m. that they had `` reached a wall for the evening . '' In other words , for the second straight day they had n't reached a decision .

With that , Judge Russell Healey gave them the OK to head back to their hotel so that they could return for deliberations around 9 a.m. Saturday .

`` This is one admirable group , '' Healey told the court shortly before dismissing the jury . `` They are clearly taking this thing as seriously as they should . And I could n't be more proud of them for how hard they are working . ''

This announcement capped a relatively uneventful day Friday , after what had been an emotional and eventful trial .

The closest thing to news came shortly before 5 p.m. , when Judge Healey answered a question from the jury : Is it possible to not reach a verdict on one count and reach a verdict on other counts ?

To which Healey responded : Yes .

Prosecutors contend that Dunn 's firing into the SUV equates to an act of murder . In addition to that count , Dunn also has been charged with three counts of attempted murder . If found guilty , he faces up to life in prison .

A `` comprehensive public safety plan '' has been established ahead of a verdict in the case , according to the Duval County joint information center handling the Dunn trial .

`` All contingencies have been planned for , '' the Duval County statement said . `` We will not discuss the specifics of any security plan . We will continue to protect the rights of those who choose to peaceably demonstrate . ''

Trial draws comparisons to another Florida case

The Dunn case has drawn parallels to the trial of George Zimmerman in the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin , which like the current trial had racial overtones and claims of self-defense .

Dunn defense attorney Cory Strolla told CNN 's Chris Cuomo on Friday that the Zimmerman and Dunn cases are n't so similar in his mind .

There was a physical confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin , and police gave Zimmerman the benefit of the doubt about defending himself , Strolla said .

`` My client did not wait to become that victim ; my client did not wait to either get assaulted by a weapon or have someone potentially pull a trigger , '' he said .

Unlike the Zimmerman case , police rushed to charge Dunn with murder , the defense attorney said .

`` They already made up their mind before they even had the evidence basically looked at and put together , '' he said .

Even though a weapon was never found , Strolla maintains the youths could have had one . Dunn felt threatened and acted to defend himself , he said .

`` Now , does it sound irrational ? Of course it sounds irrational . But have you ever been in that situation ? '' Strolla said .

Jurors on Thursday asked to see surveillance video from the gas station where Dunn shot Davis .

The video contains 20 minutes of footage from multiple angles , though a shorter version showing only one angle was slated to be shown in court .

In closing arguments Wednesday , prosecutors said inconsistencies between Dunn 's words and actions undermined his assertion he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot the teen .

His attorney countered the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his client was guilty . He pleaded with jurors to find Dunn not guilty .

In testimony Tuesday , Dunn said he fired in self-defense after the teen threatened him with a gun .

`` My intent was to stop the attack , not necessarily end a life , '' he said . `` It just worked out that way . ''

Defendant says he was ` crazy with grief '

` There was no gun '

But Assistant State Attorney Erin Wolfson said Wednesday that Dunn 's claims do n't add up .

She noted that Dunn fired 10 shots at the SUV , three of them while the car was fleeing .

He never took cover -- but instead opened his car door -- even though he would later tell detectives he had seen a weapon , she said .

`` There was no gun , '' Wolfson told jurors .

In addition , she said , he did not tell his fiancee , Rhonda Rouer , that he had seen a weapon until more than a month later .

Dunn also left the scene of the shooting , went back to a hotel where they were staying and walked his dog , she said .

And he returned the next day to his house -- more than two hours away -- all without calling 911 , Wolfson said .

Opinion : Did Florida shooter make his case on the stand ?

` Rap crap '

Dunn has testified he described the music to his fiancee as `` rap crap . ''

In the parking lot , as the music blared , `` his blood started to boil ; he did n't like the music that was coming out of the car next to him ; he got angrier and angrier , '' Wolfson said .

Dunn rolled down his window and asked the youths to turn it down , which they did , but then turned it back up , Wolfson said .

`` He got angry at the fact that a 17-year-old kid decided not to listen to him , '' she said , adding that Dunn then pulled a 9 mm gun out of his glove box and shot `` systematically and methodically '' at the SUV . `` Nobody denied that Jordan was talking back . But this defendant took it upon himself to silence Jordan Davis forever . ''

Dunn testified Tuesday that he saw Davis reach down and pick something up , and that he saw about `` 4 inches of a barrel '' from a 12 - or 20-gauge shotgun above the window .

Opinion : Florida shooter saw black , thought ` threat '

` You 're not going to kill me '

He muttered aloud to himself , '' ` You 're not going to kill me , you son of a bitch , ' '' as he opened the glove compartment , grabbed his pistol , dropped the holster at his feet , chambered a round and began firing , he said .

Nine of the 10 rounds hit the car , and three of them struck Davis , one of them cutting through his liver , his lung and his aorta .

Wolfson rejected Dunn 's assertion he had been trying to de-escalate the situation and he feared for his life .

Strolla , the defense attorney , noted that no witnesses had accused Dunn of using any hate words and testified that his client had just come from a wedding , where his ex-wife said he had appeared to be in a good mood .

Strolla noted that the SUV departed the gas station after the shooting and was gone for three minutes before it returned , enough time for the youths to have dumped a gun .

Detectives did not search the area for days after the shooting , he said .

The court has decided not to release the identifications of the jurors , fearing they could be the subject of threats , but a court document shows the jury is made up of four white females , two black females , four white males , an Asian female and a Hispanic male , plus four alternates .
