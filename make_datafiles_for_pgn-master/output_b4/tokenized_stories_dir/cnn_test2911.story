-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When players get their hands on `` Grand Theft Auto V '' on Tuesday , the gaming world will get another titillating dose of the sex and violence that has come to define the series in the eyes of millions -- many of whom have never played it .

Early reviews of the game confirm a checklist of activities from any good criminal 's daily planner : bong hits and lap dances , torture and tasers . They also herald the return of what The New York Times called `` the most immersive spectacle in interactive entertainment . ''

And in a world that 's learned to take `` Call of Duty '' and Quentin Tarantino in stride , it 's a combination some predict could result in the most lucrative entertainment launch in history .

`` GTA is easily one of the biggest game releases of the year , '' said Steve Butts , editor-in-chief of games and entertainment site IGN.com . `` The previous game is still one of the biggest entertainment launches of all time , and there 's no reason to think GTA V will be any different . ''

Launched in 1997 , the `` Grand Theft Auto '' series is one of the most successful in video-game history , selling more than 125 million units . Along the way , the series has transcended the gaming world to become a cultural phenomenon through its rare mix of popularity and controversy . Samuel L. Jackson , Dennis Hopper , Ricky Gervais , Peter Fonda and Debbie Harry are among the voice actors who have lent their talents to the series .

Flipping the script on the typical good-versus-evil story , gamers play `` Grand Theft Auto '' titles as criminals -- from two-bit hoodlums trying to work their way up the ranks of organized crime to seasoned , rough customers hell-bent on revenge for wrongs done to them by other crooks .

Much of the franchise 's appeal is its status as an `` open world '' game . While most video games , even those with story lines attached , keep the player busy on a predetermined course of action , open-world games allow greater freedom to explore .

And while games with some open-world elements date back to the video arcades of the '80s , none had ever combined as many as the `` Grand Theft '' series , creating an immersive experience for players of its 10 titles and numerous expansion packs .

Want to work out ? Hit a night club ? Get a job ? Change the radio station on your car stereo ? All are possibilities .

But there 's no denying that , for some players , the ability to do very nefarious things in that open universe has also been a draw .

The game 's big breakout among players , as well as critics , came in 2001 with `` Grand Theft Auto III . ''

Perhaps the most notorious discovery in that version , set in a New York-like `` Liberty City , '' was the player 's ability to hire a prostitute , have -LRB- offscreen -RRB- sex with her , kill her and then steal her money .

The now-defunct GameSpy named `` GTA III '' both `` Game of the Year '' and `` Most Offensive Game of the Year . ''

`` I think this is a technically marvelous game that at the same time is absolutely reprehensible ... , '' the site 's most-offensive `` honor '' read . `` It 's a game that rewards you for killing innocent people by the dozen . In Grand Theft Auto 3 , I can hijack a car , kill the driver , run someone down on the street , commit drive-by shootings , and score points for doing all of it .

`` In some scripted sequences , I 'm tasked to kill people at random . In one , the identities of the victims do n't even matter . The goal is merely to kill a certain amount of people within the allotted time . There are no significant penalties for offing bystanders . ''

The game was briefly banned in Australia and a modified version was later released . Other bans , protests and even lawsuits would follow . But IGN 's Butts says that 's not why the games have endured .

`` The more salacious content definitely gets headlines -- and undoubtedly resonates with some members of the audience -- but the real appeal of GTA has always been in its open-ended world , '' he said . `` Here 's a game where you exist in a simulation of a real city , a sort of real-world sandbox , where you can play golf , race cars , jump out of airplanes , fly blimps and loads of other activities .

`` While those activities , by themselves , are fun , the real joy is in seeing the way the world responds to your actions and decisions . The combat and driving are obviously significant draws for some players , but they 're not what most set GTA apart . ''

Controversies over violent video games feel almost as old as video games themselves , dating back to the 1980s . Perhaps that 's why the din leading up to the release of `` GTA V '' has n't been so loud .

Which is not to say controversy has gone away . As recently as last month , authorities in Lousiana said an 8-year-old had been playing `` Grand Theft Auto IV '' before he shot and killed his elderly caregiver . -LRB- Age 8 , it 's worth mentioning , is far too young to be playing the game according to its `` M for Mature '' rating . -RRB-

The sheriff 's office implied the child 's activities in a violent virtual world might have led to the killing .

But Butts and others see a cultural shift that 's taking the edge off of complaints .

`` I will say that the drift of modern society normalizes subjects that the previous generations would have found objectionable , '' he said . `` Creators in all media intentionally shock sensibilities either to make a point or simply to get noticed .

`` Games exist within a larger context , particularly with regard to violence . Violence in games is just an expression of the presence of violence in all of our media and in society at large . ''

And for his part as an avid gamer , Butts welcomes anyone offended by popular titles such as `` Grand Theft Auto '' to speak up .

`` I do n't know that I think the protests will stop -LRB- and -RRB- frankly , I do n't think they should , '' he said . `` Games are an increasingly important part of our culture , and we all have a responsibility to find a more appropriate , inclusive context to debate what is and is n't appropriate entertainment for certain audiences .
