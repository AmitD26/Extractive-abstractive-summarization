-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What 's going on in Ferguson ? It 's been nine days since Michael Brown was killed , and his family is still waiting for information from investigators about what happened to their young man .

Eyewitnesses and cell phone videos recount the minutes after his death -- before Brown lay dead for five hours , uncovered in the street -- but the state ca n't provide the family with any information ?

No state autopsy reports . No witness statements . No grand jury indictment . No nothing . There 's something seriously wrong here .

Imagine having to conduct an autopsy on your son while his body lies in a funeral home so you can know how he died before you bury him .

The Ferguson Police Department was implicated in racial profiling in a 2013 Attorney General of Missouri report , so how can anyone possibly think they would want to investigate one of their own in a shooting ? The FBI should have been on hand from the beginning .

While the National Guard is deploying to Ferguson , I implore local law enforcement to deploy common sense -- withdraw from the investigation .

State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson , appointed to coordinate security operations , has been a tremendously important presence in the community and now we need the same on the prosecutorial side . The attorney general should immediately appoint a special prosecutor working jointly with the Justice Department .

The community needs this .

The first and `` very preliminary '' autopsy results have just been released , and they paint a very grim picture of how Michael Brown died : He was shot at least six times , including twice in the head , according to acclaimed pathologist Dr. Michael M. Baden , who conducted the autopsy at the request of Michael Brown 's family . -LRB- Let that sink in , the family had to hire a private pathologist to get answers . -RRB-

At least one of the bullets appear to have entered and exited several times , shattering Brown 's right eye , traveling through his face , leaving through the jawbone and re-entering through his collarbone , said Baden . The final shot was apparently the fatal one , which hit Brown on the top of the head .

With 50 years of experience -LRB- he has conducted some 20,000 autopsies -RRB- , Baden spoke with calming authority about his findings ; he said that the state medical examiner was a trusted colleague who would likely make very similar findings . But since Baden did not have access to Michael Brown 's clothing -LRB- to examine gun powder residue -RRB- , or X-rays , or witness statements , or toxicology reports -LRB- and I ca n't help but wonder why he was n't given access to this -RRB- , he could not respond to the calls for justice in Ferguson .

He said that Brown was shot from anywhere between one foot and 30 feet away . He said bullet wounds to Brown 's arms could have been sustained by Brown putting his hands up or making a defensive gesture by crossing his arms . From where I sit , six bullets pumped into an unarmed kid in broad daylight is excessive force .

But that only moves us slightly closer to truth . The eyewitness ' accounts vary so widely -- and eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable , often refuted by the scientific evidence produced at trial . At least one witness , Piaget Crenshaw , told CNN that it `` looked as if '' the officer tried to pull Brown into the car , then was `` chasing after the boy '' until Brown turned around and was shot .

But others say Brown was shot in the back .

At the moment , the case hinges on the accounts of two conflicting witnesses : Dorian Johnson and Officer Darren Wilson .

Johnson was walking with Brown when the shooting occurred and gave this account , reported by MSNBC :

Johnson said a police officer approached as he and Brown were walking in the middle of the street and told them to use the sidewalk . They complied , and the officer began to drive away , but then threw his car into reverse and came back alongside the teens , nearly hitting them .

Johnson said he heard Wilson say something like `` What 'd you say ? '' before trying to open his car door and slamming it into Brown . Then , Johnson said , the officer reached out and grabbed Brown by the neck with his left hand . The two men struggled briefly , and then Wilson , still in his car , shot Brown once , Johnson said .

Johnson said that he and Brown `` took off running together , '' but Brown was shot a second time `` striking him in the back , '' he said . After the second shot , Brown turned around , putting his hands in the air and saying , `` I do n't have a gun . Stop shooting ! '' according to Johnson . He said that Wilson then approached Brown and fired several more shots until he `` crumbled into a fetal position . ''

As the news conference for the autopsy was taking place , a caller to a St. Louis radio station , who identified herself only as `` Josie , '' told listeners she knew Wilson 's side of the story . Here is a summary of what she said :

He says the boys were walking in the street , Wilson rolled the window down and told them to get out of street .

Wilson may have called for backup when he pulled over .

He heard the call for the strong armed robbery and saw the teens carrying something that might have been cigars .

He pulled over and when he tried to get out of the car , twice he was pushed back into the car by Michael Brown . Brown then punched him in the face and Wilson reached for his gun .

Brown grabbed the gun and at one point had the gun pushed again Wilson 's hip so Wilson pushed the gun away and the gun went off .

Brown and his friend ran and Wilson got out of the car and pursued . He told them to freeze and Brown and his friend turned around .

Brown started to taunt him , then bum rushed Wilson , coming at him full speed . Wilson started shooting .

Wilson said the final shot was in the forehead and Brown fell two or three feet in front of the officer .

A source with detailed knowledge of the investigation into the shooting told CNN that `` this account is accurate . ''

Where witness accounts differ , an autopsy can provide certainty , as it will allow us to recreate the crime scene and -- with certainty -- know how far apart the men where , what Brown was doing when he was shot and whether he ever had his hand on Wilson 's gun .

There was one important question that Baden could answer for certain . Michael 's mother wanted to know whether her son had suffered when he died . Baden assured her that the bullet to the head had rendered him unconscious and in his opinion `` he had not suffered . ''

I hope the local authorities recuse themselves from the investigation and turn it over to a special prosecutor with the attorney general . And for crying out loud , hurry up and complete the three autopsies , the investigation and the grand jury proceedings .

What Ferguson and Michael Brown 's family need right now are answers , and until we have them , there will be nothing but more heartbreak , chaos and uncertainty .
