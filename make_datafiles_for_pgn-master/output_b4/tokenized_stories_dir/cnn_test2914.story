-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The same Obama administration that is under fire from critics for allegedly leaking classified information has used a 1917 law to target suspected leakers in twice as many cases as all previous presidential administrations combined .

Under Obama , the Justice Department has prosecuted six cases under the Espionage Act in recent years ; federal prosecutors had used the law in three cases before Obama took office .

`` They 've been very tough on these issues , '' said Jeffrey Toobin , senior legal analyst for CNN . `` I think Democratic administrations feel especially obligated to prove that they can be as tough as Republicans on law enforcement . That was true during Clinton , and it 's true now , perhaps even excessively . ''

Congressional leaders call for halt to ` cascade of leaks '

Toobin said he believes the prosecutions are `` mildly excessive , '' but `` I think it 's par for the course . I think it 's reflective of a very tough law-enforcement culture that spans the parties . '' In a post-9 / 11 world , perhaps administration officials feel the stakes of leaking are higher , he said .

The issue of leaking classified information has been thrust into the national spotlight this week .

Several leading members of Congress argue that the Obama administration has not done enough to prevent leaks about a puported cyberwarfare program against Iran , the administration 's efforts to expand its drone program and Obama 's personal involvement in `` kill lists '' of militants in Yemen and Pakistan .

Some Republicans , including Sen. John McCain of Arizona , Obama 's opponent in the 2008 presidential race , say the White House must be knowingly involved in the recent leaks . They allege that the White House has leaked information to paint the president as a strong commander in chief , a sensitive election-year allegation that the White House has strongly denied .

The fact that the Obama administration has aggressively used the Espionage Act surprised people such as Steven Aftergood , director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists . He said the uptick in prosecutions was `` not what anybody expected . ''

He said he believes there are several reasons why `` there 's something new and different going on . ''

`` The aggressive pursuit of leaks is extraordinary and unprecedented , '' he said . `` Why is it happening ? I think there are probably multiple reasons . Those include the fact that it is probably easier to identify the source of leaks today than it was a couple of decades ago because there are more tracks of communications -- electronic communications , e-mail and phone records -- that are accessible to investigators than there were in the past . ''

Another reason could be a backlash stemming from the `` wholesale disclosures of classified information by WikiLeaks , '' he said . The disclosures , he noted , `` crossed so many different policy boundaries , they shocked and horrified government officials ... the tolerance for such leaks , to the extent there was any before , has gone away . ''

An additional factor is political pressure on the administration from Congress to stop the leaks , he said .

Analysts : ` The ship of state always leaks '

`` Nobody is saying , ` You 're overreacting . Back off . There are too many prosecutions . ' That is not the message coming from Congress , '' Aftergood said . `` Instead , congressional leaders of both parties are saying , ` We want more prosecutions and fewer leaks . ' ''

`` That is not my position , '' he said . `` I think Espionage Act prosecutions are , in most cases , inappropriate responses to the disclosures . ''

Passed after America entered World War I , the act is basically the only law prohibiting such leaks , Aftergood said .

`` There are a couple of other lesser statutes that sometimes are invoked , such as misappropriating government property , that are more of a stretch , but there is no law that says you may not disclose any classified information under any circumstances , '' he said .

`` And the Espionage Act is the closest fit . It does n't mean they are being accused of espionage , but this statute is being applied to fit the facts of these cases . And the courts have said , when challenged that that 's permissible . ''

However , he said , the prosecutions do n't mean Obama has abandoned his pledge to provide the most transparent administration in history .

`` If that seems like a contradiction , it 's only on the surface , '' he said . `` The administration never pledged not to enforce classification rules or to invite defiance of limits on disclosure of classified information . ''

It is true , however , that the law has only been used recently to prosecute low - and mid-level employees .

`` That 's one of the problems with leak prosecution in general , '' Toobin said . `` High government officials feel no compunction about leaking , and the rare times anyone is prosecuted , it 's usually someone at a low level . ''

`` And also , I react to this as a journalist -- an interchange of information and ideas between government and the news media is indispensable to a functioning democracy , and if you start scaring sources with the possibility of years in prison , the loser is not going to be the news media -- it 's going to be the public , '' he said .

White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that Obama `` has demonstrated his commitment to transparency through the variety of steps he has taken , unprecedented in American presidential administration history .

`` But he is also president and commander in chief , and he will not countenance the leaking of classified information that can harm our men and women in uniform , harm Americans who work on our national security , harm counterterrorism operations , '' Carney said .

Aftergood said the prosecutions of lower-level officials reflect `` one of the basic incongruities '' in the law .

`` Is it only the Army privates and the mid-level bureaucrats who are leaking ? Is it never White House officials or senior agency officials ? Judging by the government 's prosecution record , you 'd think that senior officials never leak , because they 're never being prosecuted , and we know that 's not true , '' he said . `` What appears to be a pattern of selective prosecution is another aspect of the unfairness of the way these statutes are being enforced . ''

The government , he said , has several tools at its disposal to respond to leaks , including revocation of security clearances , terminations and other administrative penalties and fines .

`` A felony prosecution for disclosure of information to the media ought to be the response in only the most egregious and damning cases , '' Aftergood said . `` Instead , it seems to be the first response , even in the mildest or most questionable cases , like that of Thomas Drake . ''

Drake , a former National Security Agency official , was indicted in 2010 on 10 counts of willful retention of national defense information , obstruction of justice and making false statements . Prosecutors accused him of leaking information to a reporter .

But prosecutors decided they could not pursue the charges after a federal judge ruled classified information would have to be presented in open court . Drake pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of exceeding his authorized use of an agency computer after authorities dropped the most serious charges -- including some under the Espionage Act -- against him . He was sentenced to a year of probation in July .

Drake 's attorneys said the case did not involve `` the handling or mishandling of classified information . Rather , it relates to Mr. Drake 's decision to communicate with a Baltimore Sun reporter about his belief that NSA was engaged in waste , fraud and abuse . ''

Other cases include that of former CIA officer John Kiriakou , who pleaded not guilty in April to charges he gave classified information to reporters and lied to a CIA review board about material in a book he wrote ; and Bradley Manning , the Army intelligence analyst suspected of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified military and State Department documents while serving in Iraq , many of which ended up on the WikiLeaks site .

Also , there 's Shamai Leibowitz , a former FBI contract linguist who pleaded guilty to providing classified documents to the host of an Internet blog , who then published information on the blog . Leibowitz was sentenced to 20 months in prison in 2010 .

Aftergood said he believes authorities should take into account whether the leak resulted in damage .

`` There 's too much passion at work here , too much zeal and not enough judgment , '' he said .
