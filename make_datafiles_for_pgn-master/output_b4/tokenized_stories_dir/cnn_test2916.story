-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Do n't ask Justin Bieber about Selena Gomez . It 's a touchy subject .

In fact , Bieber appeared reluctant to answer any questions from an attorney for a photographer who accuses Bieber of ordering a bodyguard to attack him last summer .

Several video clips of the deposition , which a Miami judge ordered in the photographer 's lawsuit against Bieber , were posted Monday on the celebrity news website TMZ . The release comes just days after another Miami judge released video of Bieber giving a urine sample in jail after an arrest on a driving under the influence charge in January .

In video from the deposition , Bieber primped and winked to the camera at times , but he was a hostile witness for most of the four hours of questioning by Miami lawyer Mark DiCowden , who represents photographer Jeffrey Binion .

Bieber 's attorney objected when DiCowden asked if he ever dated Gomez . Bieber had a long-term relationship with Gomez , which included many encounters with the paparazzi .

`` Sounds like you 're trying to harass him , '' his lawyer said .

DiCowden followed up by asking Bieber , 20 , if he had `` ever discussed his feelings about paparazzi with Gomez ? ''

`` Do n't ask me about her again , '' Bieber answered . He wagged a finger at the lawyer , repeating at least six times , `` Do n't ask me about her again . ''

At times Bieber closed his eyes , appearing to tune out the lawyer . `` I do n't have to listen to anything you have to say , '' Bieber told DiCowden .

He compared the lawyer to journalist Katie Couric . `` It seems like a '60 Minutes ' interview , '' Bieber said .

Evidence of Bieber 's reluctance also came when he was asked if he knew `` an entertainer by the name of Usher . ''

`` Yeah , Usher , that sounds familiar , '' Bieber answered . He later acknowledged Usher was a close friend , but he downplayed the singer 's role in his career .

`` Is n't it true that Usher was instrumental in starting your career ? '' DiCowden asked .

`` I was found on YouTube , '' Bieber replied . `` I think that I was detrimental to my own career . ''

After prompting from his attorney , Bieber revised his answer to say `` instrumental '' -- not `` detrimental . ''

Bieber may have been too quick to respond when DiCowden asked him if he had a perscription for the sedative Xanax .

`` No , sir , '' Bieber replied .

`` Give me a chance to object , ok , '' his lawyer then whispered to Bieber .

A toxicology report released by Miami Beach police said Xanax was present in Bieber 's system when he was arrested on a DUI charge in January .

Bieber 's combativeness extended toward the court reporter who was transcribing his answers . When she remarked she could not hear Bieber 's whispered answer to a question , he replied , '' ` Yes ' and ` no ' are f--king pretty different . ''

Lawyers for each side did not immediately respond to CNN request for comment .

Bieber is likely to get more experience dealing with lawyers ' questions in the coming months .

He faces the DUI charge that could go to a trial in Miami as well as an assault charge in Toronto . A Los Angeles prosecutor also is close to a decision in a possible vandalism case over an alleged egg attack on the mansion of a Bieber neighbor in Calabasas , California .
