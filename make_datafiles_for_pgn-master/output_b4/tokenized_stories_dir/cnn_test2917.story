Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two blasts went off Wednesday as the governor of Helmand province was headed to Kandahar to take part in the funeral for President Hamid Karzai 's half-brother .

The remotely-detonated mine explosions in Kandahar 's Maivand district wounded two soldiers but the Helmand governor , Mohammad Gulab Mangal , was unhurt , his office said .

Ahmed Wali Karzai , the Kandahar provincial council chief , was killed Tuesday by a guard during a gathering at his house a day earlier .

He was laid to rest Wednesday , with the president in attendance , said Hashim Watanwal , a Kandahar lawmaker .

Saidkhan Khakrezwal , a member of the Kandahar provincial council , told CNN he and others were with Karzai when a guard named Sardar Mohammad came into the room and asked to talk to him .

The guard then `` takes Wali to another room and shoots him with a pistol that he had in his hand , '' Khakrezwal said . The shooter was shot dead by other guards .

Sardar Mohammad was a trusted man who had worked as a guard for Karzai for eight years , Khakrezwal said . He was also a commander for a police post where there were about 30 policemen .

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting , saying that the guard accused of shooting him was working for them .

Karzai suffered bullet wounds to his head and chest , said Mohammad Dawood Farhad , the head of Kandahar Hospital .

`` My brother Ahmad Wali Karzai was killed today , '' said the Afghan president in a previously scheduled news conference with visiting French President Nicolas Sarkozy .

`` The Afghanistan people have suffered a lot . Every Afghan family has suffered . I hope one day these sufferings end . ''

Ahmed Wali Karzai , who has been dogged by drug dealing and corruption accusations , had been the subject of WikiLeaks cables leaked last year .

Without being prompted , he discussed the accusations with a senior U.S. diplomat , according to one of the cables . He said that the claims are part of a campaign to discredit him and offered suggestions on how to stop drug dealing .

`` He is willing to take a polygraph anytime , anywhere to prove his innocence , '' the cable said .

`` He suggested that the coalition pay mullahs to preach against heroin , which would reduce demand for poppy cultivation . ''

A U.S. official who authored another cable wrote that even though he must be engaged as head of Kandahar 's provincial council , `` he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker . ''

He said Karzai 's `` reputation for shady dealings '' should be considered when he recommends `` costly infrastructure projects .

The official said dealing with people like Ahmed Wali Karzai represents a major challenge in Afghanistan : Fighting corruption and building support for government when government officials are corrupt themselves .

Karzai `` appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities , and that the coalition views many of his activities as malign , particularly relating to his influence over the police , '' the author of the first cable said .
