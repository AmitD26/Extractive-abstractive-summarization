-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- iPhone screens are about to get a lot bigger , if a new report is to be believed .

Suppliers in China are about to start work on two new iPhones , according to an article from Bloomberg . The phones will have display screens that are 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches across , when measured diagonally -- a major leap from the 4-inch displays on the iPhone 5S and 5C .

Such a move would appear to be an effort to keep up with the competition . Rival smartphones , most notably those from Samsung , have been packing ever-larger displays in recent years . If these rumors are true , the bigger iPhone would nearly match the screen size of Samsung 's massive Galaxy Note 3 , with its pocket-busting , 5.7-inch `` phablet '' display .

The Korean company 's flagship Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch display , the new HTC One M8 has a 5-inch screen and the recently announced Amazon Fire phone checks in at 4.7 inches .

The Bloomberg report says the new iPhones will ship to retailers `` around September '' and be more rounded and thinner than previous models . That would be consistent with launch patterns from Apple , which for the past several years has announced new iPhones in early fall .

If the report is true , this would mark the second consecutive year Apple has released two phones .

Last year , Apple borrowed from the playbook of Samsung and other competitors by releasing the high-end iPhone 5S and the cheaper , more colorful 5C model . Almost a year later , the plastic iPhone 5C sells for as low as $ 99 with a wireless contract . For the previous six years , Apple had offered only a single , iconic phone even as competitors rolled out phones with many sizes , shapes and prices .

The new iPhones may also be part of a one-two punch from Apple , which has been under pressure to innovate and which has promised new products in 2014 .

Reports have said a long-awaited Apple smartwatch is also coming this fall . A Reuters report says the watch will have a 2.5-inch screen and be `` slightly rectangular . ''
