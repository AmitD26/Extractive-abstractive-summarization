-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Threatening an airline on Twitter is a terrible idea .

An airline such as American Airlines -- which was attacked by terrorists on September 11 , 2001 , and lost two planes filled with passengers and crew -- is likely to take your public threats seriously .

It might even get you arrested , as was the case of the 14-year-old Dutch girl who recently wrote , '' @AmericanAir hello my name 's Ibrahim and I 'm from Afghanistan . I 'm part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I 'm gon na do something really big bye . '' -LRB- The teen was arrested Monday afternoon . -RRB-

Foolishness -- at home or abroad -- rarely yields great results . So please stop doing stupid stuff while traveling . Just stop it .

You 're making the rest of us polite , culture-seeking , nature-loving and happy-to-practice-our-Spanish -LRB- or French or Arabic -RRB- tourists look bad . And you could end up in jail . Here are a few stupid examples of things you should n't do :

Do n't knock over ancient rocks . Never mind that the Boy Scout leaders who knocked over rocks dating back millions of years in Utah 's Goblin Valley State Park should have known better . Our nation 's national and state parks are not anyone 's private playground .

Please respect them and leave the ancient wonders intact for everyone to enjoy . -LRB- In March , Utah resident Glenn Taylor pleaded guilty to criminal mischief and another Utah man , David Hall , pleaded guilty to attempted criminal mischief . Both men received a year of probation and fines . -RRB-

Do n't parade around naked in inappropriate places . Peruvian officials are getting annoyed by naked tourists converging on Machu Picchu .

`` There are places in the world that people can get naked , but not all places are -LRB- appropriate -RRB- for getting undressed , '' Alfredo Mormontoy Atayupanqui , director of archaeological resources for Peru 's Ministry of Culture , told CNN .

Perhaps a 15th century Inca treasure and World Heritage Site is n't one of those places . Park rules printed on the back of your admission ticket warn against being nude in public , Mormontoy says . Security around the site is being increased , and we have the naked visitors to thank for it .

Please do n't disrobe , unless it 's allowed by local custom ! -LRB- See Nice , France , for topless beaches . -RRB-

Do n't write on sacred monuments . Not all of the badly behaving travelers are Americans . Last year , a 15-year-old Chinese tourist defaced a stone sculpture in the 3,500-year-old Luxor Temple with graffiti . The teen carved `` Ding Jinhao was here '' in Chinese on a sculpture . The graffiti was photographed by another Chinese tourist and posted online .

When his graffiti went viral , and he was tracked down , his parents apologized in a China Daily report , promising they were taking responsibility for what their son had done .

Do n't climb them either . Visitors to the pyramids at Giza , Egypt , are n't supposed to climb them . Russian photographer Vadim Makhorov and a group of his friends , in search of glorious photos , apparently did n't think the rules applied to them .

While Makhorov apologized for climbing the pyramids , he 's made a habit of climbing tall structures . He 's since scaled the world 's second-tallest building , the unfinished Shanghai Tower in China .

Do n't pack guns in your carry on . If you 've got one , remember to ask yourself : `` Where 's my gun ? '' Some people actually forget where their guns are located until the Transportation Security Administration finds them . The TSA confiscated 1,813 guns at the airport last year , and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport came in first place with 111 guns seized .

If you meant to have your gun in your carry-on bag , know there are legal ways to transport weapons -- but not the way you did it . Many hunters do it properly all the time , and TSA and U.S. Customs officials know how to clear your weapons safely .
