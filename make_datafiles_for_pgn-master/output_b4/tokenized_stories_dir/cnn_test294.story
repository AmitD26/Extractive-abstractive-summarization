Antrim , Northern Ireland -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A judge Friday granted police in Northern Ireland permission to hold and question Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams for another two days , authorities said .

Adams surrendered himself for questioning Wednesday evening in connection with the 1972 abduction and killing of a mother of 10 by the Irish Republican Army .

Under UK law , the police would have had to release him from Antrim police station Friday evening if a court had n't granted the extension .

Adams has long denied having any role in the death of Jean McConville , a widow who was reportedly killed by the IRA because the group believed she was a spy for the British army .

His arrest threatens the fragile peace in Northern Ireland , a peace Adams is in part credited with bringing about after decades of sectarian tensions .

Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness said Thursday in Belfast that Adams ' arrest was unnecessary , unjustified and politically motivated .

He said that he had seen the `` dark side '' of Northern Ireland policing `` flex its muscles in the course of the past couple of days '' and that the arrest was a '' ` deliberate attempt to influence the elections that are due to take place in three weeks ' time . ''

McGuinness said he was confident that Adams would be able to rejoin election campaigning shortly and would `` continue to lead our party in a very positive way . ''

The head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland insisted that the police would `` conduct a thorough and professional investigation into the murder of Jean McConville , '' according to a statement from the force Thursday .

`` This will be subject to the full rigors of scrutiny provided in the criminal justice system , '' the statement said .

McConville 's family welcomed news of Adams ' arrest .

Her daughter , Helen McKendry , said , `` I can only do like everyone else in my case and hope that he will be brought to a court of law and be charged with my mother 's murder , so my family can get truth and justice for my mother . ''

In a statement released shortly before Adams surrendered himself for questioning Wednesday , the 65-year-old vehemently denied any involvement in the killing .

`` I believe that the killing of Jean McConville and the secret burial of her body was wrong and a grievous injustice , '' Adams said in the statement posted on his party website . `` Malicious allegations have been made against me . I reject these . ''

The questioning of Adams was not unexpected . Adams said he told authorities last month that he was willing to meet with investigators .

`` While I have never disassociated myself from the IRA and I never will , I am innocent in the abduction , killing or burial of Mrs. McConville , '' Adams said .

Long associated with the IRA , once considered the armed wing of Sinn Fein , Adams is a prominent Catholic politician who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland . Today , Sinn Fein is Ireland 's second-largest opposition party .

A number of other people have been arrested and questioned in connection with the investigation into McConville 's abduction and killing .

One man has been charged with aiding and abetting the crime . He denies wrongdoing .

The IRA admitted in 1999 to killing a number of people who have become known as `` The Disappeared , '' those who vanished during the so-called Troubles , a 30-year conflict between Protestant loyalists who wanted to stay part of the United Kingdom and and Catholic nationalists who wanted to see the north united with Ireland .

Among the victims was McConville , 37 , whose remains were found partially buried on a beach in County Louth in 2003 . She died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head .
