-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There 's more to Election Day than just the presidential campaign . The polarization of the parties has led directly to the divided and dysfunctional Congress we 've seen over the past two years , leading to the lowest congressional approval ratings in recent history .

No matter who wins the presidency , we need to see more principled problem-solving centrists elected from both parties .

That 's why I 'm continuing my pre-election CNN.com column tradition of listing some of the most standout centrist Senate and House candidates on the ballot this year .

Centrism is one of most misunderstood and maligned political identities in our polarized hyper-partisan environment . Its advocates have been hunted into near-extinction on Capitol Hill by party-first conformists , angry ideologues and special interests .

Politics : Key races to watch -- Senate , House and Governor

But a look over this list shows a deeper philosophic consistency beyond party labels -- a commitment to generational responsibility and individual liberty that can be fairly described as fiscally conservative but socially liberal .

Most of all , there is a common commitment to working together across party lines to solve problems rather than holding out for ideologically pure solutions . For a more detailed defense of the legitimacy of this political perspective , David Brooks gave a typically eloquent explanation of the centrist political leader as a craftsman in a must-read column .

The 10 standout centrist candidates on this list are independents , Republicans and Democrats who all recognize that hyper-partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from solving the serious problems we face .

That 's why we need them in the next Congress -- to break the fever of division and dysfunction , define the common ground that exists on the urgent issues we face and then build on them . Their success in the 2012 election would be a healthy step forward for the nation .

2012 ballot initiatives : Voter-run or special interest-hijacked ?

Angus King

This independent 's Senate campaign in Maine is the biggest nonpresidential race in the nation for many independent voters -- a gutsy challenge to the two parties that looks like it will prove successful . King has described himself as `` too fiscally conservative for the Democrats and too socially liberal for the Republicans -- like 75 % of the American people . ''

He proved his effectiveness in two terms as a popular independent governor of Maine in the 1990s . Now he is the odds-on favorite to succeed retiring centrist Republican Olympia Snowe in the Senate . If the Senate is closely divided , he could be the deciding vote .
King has told me about his vision to bring together a coalition of senators in the vital center to break gridlock .

`` What if two or three other people like me around the country were elected who said : ` I do n't care about the parties -- I just want to solve the problems ... We 're going start talking to each other in a grown-up and civil way . '' Here 's hoping .

Bob Kerrey

The Medal of Honor winner , Nebraska governor , senator , presidential candidate and college president would return to Washington as an elder statesman committed to building bipartisan coalitions . He is one of the most respected and best liked political leaders of recent decades .

His opponent , social conservative state senator Deb Fischer , rode to victory in the Republican primary thanks to endorsements by the likes of Sarah Palin and Jim DeMint .

`` Somebody has to go back there and change Congress . Somebody has to stand the middle ground , '' Kerrey says . `` I want to be the person that makes that change happen . '' This election is close in a center-right state , and former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel 's endorsement of Democrat Kerrey on Thursday provided another boost . Having Kerrey back in the senate would be a win not just for the people of Nebraska , but for the entire country .

Heather Wilson

A former congresswoman , Air Force officer and Rhodes Scholar , the New Mexico Republican would be an excellent addition to the U.S. Senate and the Republican conference . She won more than 40 % of the Hispanic vote in each of her six congressional races . But with the polarization of the Hispanic population over neighboring Arizona 's immigration laws , New Mexico has moved from bellwether swing state to the Democratic column .

So , Wilson is flying against stiff headwinds . But she 's a big-tent , pro-life Republican -- fiscally conservative , centrist on social issues and strong on defense -- with a demonstrated ability to win over independent voters . Her biggest problem is the rightward drift of the GOP and the consequent alienation of the Hispanic vote in a presidential year . But she would make a great senator that New Mexico would be proud of for decades to come .

Joe Donnelly

The Indiana Democrat is running to replace centrist Republican statesman Dick Lugar in the Senate against the tea party-backed Republican nominee Richard Mourdock .

A three-term Congressman with a decidedly centrist record , Donnelly has been arguing that Mourdock is too extreme for Indiana -- with plenty of help from Mourdock himself . From Mourdock 's saying that bipartisanship `` ought to consist of Democrats coming to the Republican point of view , '' to slamming centrists in the Senate by arguing that `` the time for collegiality is past ... it 's time for confrontation , '' to his now infamous comments that pregnancies that result from rape are `` God 's will , '' Mourdock has managed to find himself losing a Senate race in a state that Mitt Romney is winning easily .

Hoosiers do n't seem to want an embarrassing advocate of extremism in the Senate . They 'd do better with Donnelly .

Linda Lingle

It takes an impressive person to win Hawaii 's governorship as a Republican , but former Maui Mayor Linda Lingle managed to distinguish herself as a successful and popular leader during her two terms , while breaking down barriers as the first woman and first Jewish governor of the Aloha State .

Running in a presidential election cycle with Hawaii-born Barack Obama on the ballot is no picnic for a Republican , but Lingle has overcome long odds before -- she won reelection as governor by the largest margin in Hawaii 's history . She 's developed an impressive record as a decisive leader , combining fiscal responsibility with a big-tent approach on social issues . She would be a refreshing centrist Republican voice in the U.S. Senate .

Tim Kaine

It 's a tight Senate race between two former Virginia governors -- centrist Democrat Tim Kaine and conservative Republican George Allen -- to see who will succeed Jim Webb in the Senate . Kaine is the kind of solid Third Way Democrat who has proven he can win statewide in the Old Dominion state , like his predecessor Mark Warner , who currently serves in the Senate and has been a leader of the Gang of Six negotiations to find a bipartisan deal on the deficit and the debt .

Kaine -- a former DNC Chair - is not as nonpartisan as many centrists , but he is a classic DLC Blue Dog of the kind we have seen almost hunted into extinction on Capital Hill . His election would send a welcome signal about that tradition 's persistence and further commitment to the kind of thoughtful bipartisan cooperation we need to see in the Senate .

Scott Brown

When Scott Brown won the special election to succeed Ted Kennedy in the Senate , it was seen as a tea party victory predicated upon his opposition to Obama 's health care reform . But as senator , Brown has developed a decidedly centrist voting record -- being recognized by the National Journal voting records as having a 55 % conservative and 45 % liberal composite record , placing him squarely in the center of the Senate .

He has tried to rekindle the Ed Brooke Massachusetts moderate tradition and is locked in a tough race against Elizabeth Warren , who has developed a strong following for her fearless work in the wake of the fiscal crisis .

But Brown 's record can not and should not be ignored -- and if he loses this Senate seat in the headwinds of the likely Obama landslide in his home state of Massachusetts , we could see Brown back in the Senate or serve as governor sometime in the future .

Jim Graves

To many moderates , Michele Bachmann is the symbol of everything that 's wrong with our divided and dysfunctional congress . She 's quick to call opponents anti-American and weave unhinged conspiracy theories into policy debates . But she 's never had a serious candidate campaign against her until now .

Jim Graves is a 58-year-old , self-made Minnesota businessman and grandfather of seven , still married to his high-school sweetheart . And he 's got Bachmann on defense in her reelection effort .

`` My policy approach transcends political lines , '' Graves told me in an interview for DailyBeast , `` I 'm a centrist , a libertarian when it comes to social issues . I do n't think government should be involved with personal lives . I really believe in separation of church and state . Bachmann wants to blur those lines -- she would -LRB- replace -RRB- our democracy with a theocracy , '' he says . `` She epitomizes everything that 's wrong with Congress and this country -- a lack of civility , a lack of bipartisan or nonpartisan approach to problem solving . ''

Richard Tisei

A Republican running for Congress in Massachusetts this year might be dismissed as a political suicide mission , but Richard Tisei is an exception in every sense . He 's running a strong race against an uninspiring and ineffective liberal incumbent John Tierney in a state where registered independents outnumber Democrats or Republicans .

Tisei is popular state legislator and a self-described `` live and let live ' Republican -- who applies the principles of individual liberty and individual responsibility consistently in his political philosophy -- get government out of the bedroom and out of the boardroom . He is also , perhaps not incidentally , openly gay . But Tisei 's constituents have come to see him as a strong advocate of fiscal responsibility and limited government , a libertarian New England Republican in the mold of Bill Weld rather than Mitt Romney .

Richard Hanna

This upstate New York Republican congressman is an independent thinker who does not let party loyalty get in the way of his common sense approach to solving problems . The longtime businessman and community leader does not mince words or shy away from condemning impractical extremes on both sides . He told the Syracuse Post-Standard , `` I 'm frustrated by how much we -- I mean the Republican Party -- are willing to give deferential treatment to our extremes in this moment in history . ... If all people do is go down there and join a team , and the team is invested in winning and you have something that looks very similar to the shirts and the skins , there 's not a lot of value there . ''

That 's the kind of principled independence , and commitment to governing in the national interest , that we need to see more of in the next Congress .
