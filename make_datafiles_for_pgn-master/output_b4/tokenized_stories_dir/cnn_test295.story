-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho , the only coach to win European football 's top three leagues , has told CNN in an exclusive interview that his remarkable track record of success and very public profile has had a devastating impact on his personal life .

After winning league titles with Chelsea , Inter , Real as well as Porto in his homeland , Mourinho says it has got to the stage where even his 12-year-old son is taunted when he plays a football match .

`` I hate my social life , '' Mourinho told CNN . `` I hate not to be a normal father who goes with his son to the son 's football match and being there with the other 20 fathers there watching the game .

`` I 'm at a football match of kids and I have to be there . The people have to come for photos ; the people have to come for autographs ; the people have to come to insult me ; the people have to go behind the goal of my kid and insult my kid of 12 . ''

As well as his uncanny ability to guide teams to trophy after trophy , Mourinho 's very public profile has also been accompanied by an ability to attract headlines -- sometimes unwanted -- where his media conference theatrics have journalists drooling over his every utterance .

At times the Portuguese coach , who is courted by numerous sponsors , has also tarnished his reputation -- no more so than in last season 's altercation with the now Barcelona manager Tito Vilanova , when Mourinho poked his opponent in the eye .

`` I think it 's quite normal because people think they know me , but they do n't , '' added Mourinho , who is bidding to become the first coach to win the Champions League with three different clubs following his triumphs with Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010 .

`` People know the manager , especially the manager during 90 minutes . And during 90 minutes , I 'm not there to have fun .

`` Fun is a consequence . I 'm there to do my job , I 'm there to win . I 'm there with my team to try to win . I 'm there and I live the game , I live the match as if it was the last match of my career .

`` So people look at me and they see what they see . After that , in press conferences , it 's the other place where people know me .

`` In press conferences , there is still a match to play . Before the match , press conference is pre-match and after the match , press conference is post-match , but it 's a match . ''

But Mourinho insisted he was a very different person one from the portrayed by the media .

`` People do n't know me as a friend , as a family man , as a manager inside of my group , the relationship I have with the people that work in the club .

`` So I do n't complain and say people are wrong , people are looking at me with the wrong eye . No , these people see what they see . ''

And despite the cost to his personal life , Mourinho insisted he wanted to be a coach for at least another two decades .

`` So , you know , I would love to be with my family in the street as a normal person and I ca n't , so I am a completely different person in my private life , '' added Mourinho , who will turn 50 in January .

`` I keep to myself , I keep to the people that are close to me and one day when my career finishes , I hope that I will still have a few years to be a normal person because I want to finish my career at 70 or 75 . ''

After guiding Porto to the European Cup in 2004 , Mourinho moved to England and managed Chelsea , who won two English Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006 under the Portuguese coach and he has often spoken of his desire to return to England .

There has plenty of speculation he will replace Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United as the 70-year-old Scotsman approaches the twilight of his managerial career .

The two men enjoy a close relationship away from football -- they both share a love of fine wine -- with Mourinho affectionately referring to the United manager as ` The Boss ' .

`` I call him the boss because he 's the boss of the coaches and I hope that when I go back to English football he still manages Manchester United .

`` I do n't think about that , especially as I have a four-year contract with Real , I sign it and when I sign it , I sign it because I wanted to be in Real Madrid at this period of my career and I do n't think in another club .

`` I just say openly that for many reasons that after Real Madrid , Inter , Italy , Spain , Chelsea , England , Porto , Portugal , that after this project , the next step will be England for many reasons but when I do n't know .

`` I do n't have an idea and I am so happy to be in this moment as manager of the best club in the world . ''

Mourinho retains a home in London and was keen to emphasize he is still on friendly terms with Chelsea 's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich , revealing that the Russian had played a key role in recently allowing Blues midfielder Michael Essien to make a loan move to Madrid before the end of the August transfer window .

`` We are in touch a lot , and the last example is Michael Essien was going to another club and when I did -LRB- gestures to telephone call -RRB- ` please leave it to your friend ' he left to his friend , '' said the Real coach .

`` We have a great relationship in fact . ''
