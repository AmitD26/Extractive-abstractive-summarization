-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You probably heard the story . It is , after all , so last week .

A wealthy banker goes out to lunch with a colleague . The banker disdainfully leaves a 1 % tip on a $ 133 bill with the message , `` Get a real job . '' The colleague , who runs a blog called `` Future Ex-Banker , '' takes a picture of the receipt , which then goes viral -- first on Eater.com , then on Twitter and Facebook , soon everywhere -LRB- including CNN -RRB- .

It was a hoax , however , though it took a few days before the restaurant found proof the original receipt had been Photoshopped . By that time , despite some disclaimers along the way , the bill had become water-cooler gospel and left outrage in its wake .

So it goes on the Internet , where errors , mistakes and knee-jerk reactions can be let loose at the click of a button .

Sure , it 's been that way since your grandmother e-mailed you the story about the Nieman-Marcus chocolate-chip cookie recipe .

But in an increasingly connected world where social networking has made us all news sources , that means missteps and misinformation get issued -- and repeated -- more quickly than ever . Gabrielle Giffords is declared dead , Chris Brown lets fly with profane rants , and it all makes the rounds before anyone has time to think .

`` There 's never been such pressure to speak before one knows , '' says science writer James Gleick , who traced the increasing speed of society in his book `` Faster '' and the deluge of data in last year 's `` The Information . '' There 's always been a desire to gather and disseminate news , he points out , `` but never until now has it been global and instantaneous . ''

We want information , but more than that , we want it quickly -- and thanks to smartphones , which now comprise the majority of cell phones in the United States , we 're never far away from the latest bits of media . Moreover , with cellular companies promoting blazing `` 4G '' speeds and trying to expand their networks , it 's harder and harder to be out of touch -- and easier and easier to give in to the twitch of the clicker finger .

And accuracy ? Speed rules , baby . Even when your phone attempts to helpfully AutoCorrect a hastily written text , the result is as often mocked as appreciated .

So much for patience . We want the world to listen , and we want it now .

`` Everyone now has a global platform on which they can shout their opinions and voice their beliefs , '' says Frank Farley , a psychology professor at Temple University and former president of the American Psychological Association . But people have n't become more cautious about putting words out there , he adds -- even if they 're wrong .

`` There 's an old economic principle , that bad money drives out good , '' he says . `` One thing that worries me is that bad information is driving out good . ''

Me first !

Of course , the desire to be first , even at the risk of being wrong , is nothing new . But social networks and real-time Internet portability have combined to spawn errors and reactions at an increasingly breakneck pace , particularly on Twitter , which -- with its brevity and scope -- makes it easy to disseminate clickbacks and comebacks in 140 characters or fewer .

Many errors are minor . Actor LeVar Burton , mistaking Twitter 's private and public spheres , accidentally released his phone number to the entire Twitterverse , then backtracked with a joke . Celebrity rumors roar through all the time , causing quick kerfuffles as they 're checked and then dismissed .

Others , however , are more dramatic . Last month controversial hip-hop singer Chris Brown posted a defiant message after the Grammys -- a tweet that did n't go over well . Soon afterward , Brown -LRB- or his handlers -RRB- deleted all evidence of his Twitter tantrum , but not before bloggers had grabbed screen shots of the offending missives .

Several news services initially tweeted that Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords had died in the Tucson shootings last year . When Giffords was confirmed to be alive , some deleted their early posts .

Actor Ashton Kutcher , who has close to 10 million Twitter followers , tweeted a protest of Penn State coach Joe Paterno 's firing -- before realizing why Paterno was being let go . Kutcher later apologized , deleted his earlier messages and finally put his Twitter account under the control of his publicists .

Wrong or right , speed is exciting , says Gleick .

`` The fact is , we love this fast pace . We 're exhilarated by it , '' he says . `` We 're happy to be able to reach in a pocket and press a button or speak to our device and instantaneously get an answer to a question -- even if we know that the answer is not 100 % reliable . ''

And being first -LRB- or , to many Internet commenters , `` First ! '' -RRB- is even better : the `` primacy effect , '' it 's called in psychology . We tend to remember the first items in a series more than later entries .

With speed of the essence , some websites have built a following by trafficking in rumors and uncertainties . In tech , of course , there are any number of sites devoted to all things Apple , which seize on the smallest bits of information , then watch as the unconfirmed reports get picked up by larger tech sites until they go mainstream .

The sociologist Erving Goffman observed that people have `` front-stage '' and `` backstage '' presentations of themselves -- the former a polished form intended for public consumption , the latter raw and unedited . `` I think there 's more and more of the backstage leaking into day-to-day conversation , '' says Ron Bishop , a pop culture professor at Drexel University .

That 's not necessarily a bad thing . For corporations such as Apple , an outburst of rumors certainly creates -LRB- or maintains -RRB- interest . The availability of smartphones encourages citizen journalism . And the ability to post quickly means that misinformation can also be corrected quickly , often after the Twitterverse flags an error .

Truthyness

The flip side , however , plays off Farley 's concern that bad information will drive out good .

`` You can do a fast correction , but it hardly ever has the value of the original , '' he points out .

Social networks are also useful in spreading propaganda and disinformation , observes Filippo Menczer , a professor of informatics at Indiana University . It 's the latest twist on unwittingly forwarding viruses via e-mail .

Menczer , who directs IU 's Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research , has helped develop Truthy , a system to analyze Twitter posts that he was inspired to set up after the 2010 Massachusetts special senate election . An activist group created several fake Twitter accounts and put out misleading claims about one candidate ; thousands of followers retweeted the information . Though Twitter quickly disabled the accounts , the information was spread widely enough to rank highly in Google results .

Truthy attempts to find out who 's responsible for the initial message , how it has been spread and determine if the message is true . There are some tip-offs , Menczer observes , such as if the initial message comes from a now-inactive account or one with a suspicious name . -LRB- In the case of the 1 % receipt , the `` Future Ex-Banker 's '' blog was inactive by the time other sites started sniffing around , though it was thought that he was remaining anonymous for less suspicious reasons . -RRB-

Americans may associate such disinformation campaigns with domestic politics , but they have also taken root overseas , Menczer adds . As social media has become a key tool in quickly spreading the word about meetings and protests -- such as the world saw during the Arab Spring -- it can also be used against such efforts . During Russia 's current election campaign , for example , fake accounts posted inaccurate information , making it very difficult for protesters to coordinate through social media , he says .

Given the rush of information on the Web -- and that ever-itchy clicker finger -- the best strategy may be a little self-control , says Temple 's Farley .

Though , he adds , it 's not easy , particularly with a generation that has come of age with the latest technologies and thinks nothing of not thinking .

`` In this world of hyper-stimulation , how do you develop kids who are reflective , who can think before they act ? '' he says . `` That 's going to be extremely important going forward , because there 's so much opportunity for stimulation . ''

Better to take a breath , have the facts straight -- or risk adding to the flood of error . It 's a truism that certainly predates the Internet .

`` A lie can travel halfway ` round the world while the truth is putting on its shoes , '' Mark Twain once said .

Hmm . Or did he ?
