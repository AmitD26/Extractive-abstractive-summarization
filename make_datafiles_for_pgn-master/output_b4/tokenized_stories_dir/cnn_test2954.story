-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In 2003 , Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage . At that time , 60 % of Americans opposed the idea and the move provoked an immediate backlash . In the next year , 12 states passed constitutional amendments outlawing same-sex marriage . Eventually 30 states , including traditionally liberal California , passed such measures .

But since then there has been an astounding transformation of public opinion and legal thinking . Support for gay and lesbian civil rights , starting from a much lower base than support for racial and gender equality , has risen with stunning speed . Between 2003 and 2013 , the proportion of Americans supporting same-sex marriage rose 21 points nationwide , from 32 % to 53 % , writes Robert P. Jones in The Atlantic .

Even in the socially conservative South , support more than doubled , increasing from 22 % to 48 % . By contrast , in 1978 , 11 years after the Supreme Court struck down laws prohibiting interracial marriage , only 36 % of Americans supported such unions .

This rapid and massive change in public attitudes toward same-sex marriage undercuts the argument that `` judicial activism '' has frustrated the will of the American people . But the legal tide has certainly turned as well . In the past year and a half , 42 separate court rulings have upheld marriage rights for gays and lesbians .

Because of this month 's Supreme Court decision not to hear appeals of such rulings , 24 states and the District of Columbia now permit same-sex marriage . Today more than 50 % of Americans live in places where it is legal for gays and lesbians to wed. . That will soon rise to 60 % , because the Supreme Court 's actions affect six other states in the judicial circuits overseen by the same appellate courts .

Many factors have contributed to these changes in public and legal opinion . One is the increased visibility of gays and lesbians across the culture , as more come out of the closet . Three-quarters of Americans now say they have a relative , friend or co-worker who is gay and millions have become used to sympathetic gay and lesbian characters on television and to openly gay talk-show hosts and entertainers . It is harder to deny rights to people who are no longer faceless `` others . ''

Another factor in the rapid acceptance of marriage equality is the success the civil rights and feminist movements have had in establishing social equality as a moral and ethical principle . Fifty years ago , when the Civil Rights Bill was introduced in Congress , congressional opponents openly vowed to resist anything that might `` bring about social equality . ''

No public figure would say that today . Even politicians who oppose measures to protect the rights of minorities , women or gays and lesbians now frame their opposition as a defense of equality against `` special privileges . '' So when advocates for social change can claim their goal is a simple matter of equity , they have an advantage they lacked in the 1960s and even the 1970s , when substantial numbers of Americans were still willing to admit to opposing gender and racial equality .

A third factor behind changing public opinion has been the growing tendency to treat freedom of choice in marriage as a basic right . This was not the case historically . Before the late 1960s , a majority of states had laws prohibiting marriage of whites to blacks , Asians or Filipinos .

Twelve states forbade `` drunks '' or `` mental defectives '' from marrying . Several states denied marriage to any person with tuberculosis . Prisoners had no right to marry , and employers were legally entitled to refuse to hire a woman who was married , or to fire her if she married after getting the job .

But in 1967 , invalidating anti-miscegenation laws , and in 1987 , ruling that prisoners could not be denied marriage rights , the Supreme Court ruled that states could not prohibit marriages just because they disapproved of the partnership . Once it became a violation of individual rights to prevent prisoners , inter-racial couples , flight attendants , and female teachers from marrying , gays and lesbians could argue that they , too , should have the right to marry a partner of their choice .

Ironically , the most important factor in persuading many Americans to support same-sex marriage may have been the dramatic changes heterosexuals have made in their own marriages .

For thousands of years , marriage was defined as the union of two individuals who had different and unequal rights and responsibilities based on their gender .

Until the late 1970s , husbands -- but not wives -- were legally obliged to support their families , while wives -- but not husbands -- were legally obliged to perform services -LRB- including providing sex -RRB- in the home . This is why the legal definition of rape was a man 's forcible intercourse with a woman not his wife . It is also why a husband could sue for the loss of companionship , affection and sex -LRB- when the actions of another deprived him of the relationship benefits he was due -RRB- , but a wife , who was not legally entitled to such services , could not .

In the past 30 years , however , as Americans have rejected such rigid gender roles , the courts have redefined marriage as a union of two individuals who have equal rights and responsibilities , and who can organize their marital division of labor on the basis of personal inclinations rather than pre-assigned gender roles .

As late as 1977 , two-thirds of Americans believed that the man should be `` the achiever outside the home '' and the woman should take `` care of the home and family . '' Today 62 % of all Americans prefer a marriage where husband and wife share breadwinning , child care , and homemaking . The more that heterosexual couples organize their own marriages without regard to gender roles , the less reasonable they find it to deny marriage to two people who happen to be the same biological sex .
