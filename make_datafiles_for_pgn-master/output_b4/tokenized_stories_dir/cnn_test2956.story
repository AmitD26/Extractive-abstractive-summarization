-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sometimes I think the media live in a time warp . There 's so much talk about Hillary Clinton and the expanding/shrinking/expanding field of possible Republican candidates , you 'd think we 're in the middle of an Olympics ratings battle .

The media focus on 2016 is like a `` Rocky Horror Picture Show , '' without Rocky . It 's really an obsession that is not only misguided but also does a disservice both to voters and candidates .

The two-year out speculation track record is pretty bad .

Yes , Clinton is dynamic . Even her most rabid detractors must admit that . But her dynamism is not a guarantee victory . Her nomination is not inevitable .

She knows upfront the toll campaigning demands and what being president exacts . As George Harrison said about being a Beatle , you have to give your nervous system .

If Clinton decides to run , she has to do so knowing it is a commitment that may last 11 years . She 's 66 . -LRB- Joe Biden , 71 , and Mike Huckabee , 58 , also have to consider their age . -RRB-

It 's not just how old a person might be at the end of her , or his , term . The question is , will one have the energy and will power to finish the job ? We age better and healthier , but being president is aging like nothing else .

Clinton 's understudy waits in the wings

Does Clinton want to make a time commitment that could amount to the rest of her life ?

Another factor surely affecting Clinton 's decision is her legacy . Despite repeated attempts by Republicans , she remains very popular . In a 2013 Gallup Poll she was named the woman people most admired . A presidential run would risk that popularity -- and the legacy she 's built as a senator and secretary of state -LRB- not to mention former first lady -RRB- . Of course , she could also leverage that popularity to lead our nation in a great new direction .

Potential candidates may also weigh on her mind . Who else might run if she does n't ? If the rest of the field looks weak , she might feel a sense of duty to her party and her country . If there are strong `` next generation '' candidates , she may be content , perhaps glad , to work for their success .

The point is that there are factors that may induce Hillary Clinton not to run , and nobody will know what will influence her decision -- until she decides .

Speculation about Republican candidates is even sketchier . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , who only a few weeks ago seemed the prime-time contender , now appears on the ropes . Other prominent Republicans have also taken their hits recently -- understandable , given the current fighting among the factions . So , who knows ?

I can make one prediction safely : Going through the list of who 's up and who 's down until the nomination -LRB- s -RRB- is -LRB- are -RRB- secured will make any roller coaster ride seem like a walk in the park .

I 've got a name for the media 's obsession with potential 2016 nominees , or really any idle speculation without substance -- talking-head-vacuum syndrome .

Instead of acting like junior high gossips though , the media might try focusing on real issues that are current and important . There are lots of them out there . I 'll focus on one example .

Two years ago saw a breakthrough for women officeholders . I 've written about this before : There are now 20 women senators . One of the big questions in 2014 is : Can Democrats retain control of the Senate ?

`` Conventional wisdom '' held that it would be tough . But the game is changing , thanks to a couple of dynamic women candidates . In Georgia , which has been a Deep South Republican stronghold -- since 2010 , they 've held every statewide office -- Michelle Nunn , daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn , stands a good chance of becoming another woman senator -- and a Democratic one .

Parsing Biden 's words : If Hillary runs , he wo n't

She is leading or tied with all her opponents in the polls . She has the advantages of a famous name in Georgia , a middle-of-the road message and lots of campaign discipline . Her father was known for his bipartisanship and reaching across the aisle -- and she 's already following in his footsteps .

And although Georgia is staunchly conservative , the state 's demographics are shifting , with more African-Americans returning and the immigrant population growing .

Then there 's the race in Kentucky , where Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes holds a lead of 4 percentage points over Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell . McConnell is arguably the most powerful Republican in the Senate , and if his seat -- if a seat in Kentucky is up for grabs -- the dynamics of the Senate need to be re-examined .

Trust me , if those two women win their seats , the ripple effect will become a tidal wave . And there are other races where women have raised the stakes . Wendy Davis ' bid to be governor of Texas has drawn national attention and already reframed several of the issues in that state .

My point is that we 're more than 1,000 days away from the inauguration of the next president , and there 's a lot going on now that needs more attention from the media . This year could become a breakthrough for women in American politics . Let 's give that the coverage it deserves .

The 2016 election can wait .
