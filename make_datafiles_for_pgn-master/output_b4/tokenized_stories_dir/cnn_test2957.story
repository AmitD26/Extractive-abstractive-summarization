-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 15-year-old Massachusetts boy accused of raping and killing his high school math teacher admitted to the crime , according to a search warrant affidavit released Monday .

Philip Chism was indicted Friday on an additional count of aggravated rape in connection with the death of Colleen Ritzer , 24 , on October 22 in the girls ' bathroom of Danvers High School . He will be arraigned on the new count on Thursday .

Chism pleaded not guilty in December to murder , aggravated rape and robbery charges stemming from the killing of the popular teacher . Police said a box cutter Chism had taken to school was the murder weapon .

The affidavit , released Monday , said that after being booked in connection with the crime , Chism `` admitted to murdering '' his teacher . Chism , in the presence of his mother , Diana Chism , waived his Miranda rights .

The affidavit also said Chism may have sought to `` memorialize '' the crime by photographing or videotaping parts of it with his cell phone , which was later destroyed in what investigators said was an attempt to hide incriminating evidence .

The Essex County district attorney 's office said Friday that it presented a grand jury with additional evidence . The new youthful offender indictment alleges that Chism forcibly had sexual intercourse with the victim .

`` Aggravated rape is charged when there is serious bodily harm and/or when the rape was committed during the commission of another felonious and assaultive crime , '' the district attorney 's office said in a statement .

Denise Regan , Chism 's public defender , could not be reached for comment .

Chism , who is being held without bail , is set to appear January 30 in Salem Superior Court for a pre-trial conference .

According to a police affidavit , a ninth-grade student told investigators that Chism became visibly upset when Ritzer spoke after class on the day of the crime about his home state of Tennessee .

When Ritzer noticed that Chism was upset , she changed the subject , said the unidentified student , who described Chism as `` talking to himself . ''

The affidavit includes testimony from witnesses as well as a school video surveillance timeline showing Chism and Ritzer in the same area of the school during the teacher 's final moments .

In the video , Ritzer appears to enter a second-floor girls ' restroom -- apparently , a faculty restroom was occupied -- and Chism , wearing gloves and red sweatshirt with the hood pulled over his head , appears to enter the restroom about a minute later , according to the affidavit .

Shortly after , a female student enters the bathroom and then quickly walks out , according to the court papers . She told investigators she saw the back of a person who appeared to be changing clothes ; the person 's rear was exposed , with clothes piled on the floor .

The video shows Chism leaving the restroom , returning later with a recycling barrel , and again leaving the restroom pulling the barrel -- this time with a black mask on his forehead , the court papers say . He pulls the barrel outside the building and toward the student parking lot . Investigators said the video shows what appear to be blood stains near the bathroom and on Chism 's pants .

Court papers detail horrifying final moments of teacher 's life

After Chism 's mother reported him missing on the evening of October 22 , police had his cell company `` ping '' the location of his phone . The phone was found to be in the vicinity of the Hollywood Hits Theater , where investigators learned the teen had purchased a movie ticket and then left .

The affidavit said that , when Chism was spotted by a police officer the next day , he was carrying a knife ; a search of his backpack turned up a bloodstained box cutter . Asked where the blood came from , Chism allegedly responded , `` The girl . '' He was also allegedly carrying credit cards and driver 's licenses belonging to Ritzer , as well as a pair of woman 's underwear .

The armed robbery indictment alleges that Chism robbed Ritzer of credit cards , an iPhone and her underwear .

Police discovered Ritzer 's body in a wooded area near the school , covered with leaves and debris in an apparent attempt to conceal it , the court papers said . Her throat was slit .
