-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- They are known as the hippies of the ape kingdom , a peaceful and affectionate species that is more interested in making love than killing each other .

One of the world 's rarest apes , bonobos are close cousins of chimpanzees and share 98.7 % of human DNA . But unlike their ape relatives -- and humans -- bonobos shy away from engaging in vicious conflicts . Instead , they share food , groom each other and use a variety of sexual activities to build relationships , promote social bonding and strengthen alliances .

It is , then , an ironic twist that the very existence of this affable species has come under threat by decades of war and deforestation in one of Africa 's most troubled parts .

Found only in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the bonobos inhabit the country 's lowland rainforests along the south bank of the Congo River .

In recent months , tensions erupted once again in the vast country as rebels launched a major attack in the violence-riddled eastern part of the DRC . Although the bonobo habitat is located several hundred miles away from the epicenter of the crisis , conservationists say that the country 's instability over the years has made it almost impossible to study bonobos and find out where they are or determine how many are left .

At the same time , the expansion of the commercial bushmeat trade -- the selling of wild animal meat , such as that of the endangered bonobo -- threatens the survival of the apes even further .

`` The decade of war in the late 1990s resulted in extensive population displacement , military/rebel movements and a greater availability of firearms and ammunition , which contributed to increased hunting of wildlife , including bonobos , '' says Dominique Morel , of Friends of Bonobos , a group supporting Lola Ya Bonobo , the world 's first and only sanctuary for the endangered species .

Born of necessity from the increasing threat of the bushmeat trade , Lola Ya Bonobo was founded in the mid-1990s by Claudine Andre , a Belgian-born conservationist who was working at the time as a volunteer in Kinshasa 's zoo .

It was there that Andre , who moved with her veterinarian father to Congo at the age of three , saw a bonobo for the first time -- an encounter that was destined to change her life forever .

Andre , a mother of five , fell in love with the bonobos and started to rescue them one by one by taking them home with her . But soon she found herself needing a bigger space as the number of bonobos she took under her wing started to grow . The Congolese government eventually stepped in to help set up a more permanent home that would become Lola Ya Bonobo .

The sanctuary , which is located just outside Kinshasa in some 30 hectares of primary forest , is today home to at least 65 bonobos , many of which are young orphans that have been either rescued from the wild or brought in after hunters killed their parents .

`` Bushmeat never stops , '' says Andre . `` We have no solution and we receive more and more orphans every year . ''

An important part of the sanctuary 's work is rehabilitating injured bonobos from the forest and , hopefully , one day returning them to the wild .

`` Conservation asks us to make a test for reintroduction in the wild , '' says Andre . `` So we make this experience two times already since 2009 , a group of bonobos from here , returned to the wild . And for them it was a success because after two-three months , they are home . ''

The sanctuary also aims to educate the public about bonobos . Staff at Lola Ya Bonobo say that some 40,000 people come through its doors each year , including tourists and local schoolchildren , as well as graduate students conducting research on everything from bonobo behaviour to the evolution of the human brain .

Conservationists say stability in the DRC is essential to ensure that bonobo conservation programs are not jeopardized .

`` Advocating for wildlife conservation is always a battle in a country as poor as the DRC , '' says Morel . `` In times of crisis , when the security and basic needs of civilian populations are often not assured , it becomes even more challenging . If eco-guards and staff have to be evacuated from certain areas for their own safety , equipment , infrastructure and sometimes animals suffer .

`` Only with peace and stability can long-term investments in wildlife conservation -- research , conservation education , community-based habitat protection and eco-tourism -- be successfully implemented . ''
