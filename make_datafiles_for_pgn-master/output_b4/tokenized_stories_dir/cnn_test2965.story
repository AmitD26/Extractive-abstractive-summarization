-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- That 's it . Starting today the next guy to text me and ask me on a date will be deleted from my cell phone -- permanently .

Want to make plans for the weekend ?

Wondering how my day was ?

Need to discuss our relationship ?

Call me .

Save texting for simple stuff : Let 's meet at 8 p.m. ? Do you like sushi ? Or even , you looked so hot last night ! When it comes to texting , the KISS rule applies -- Keep It Simple Stupid .

Now of course , there are times when a `` U & I R DUN '' text may be in order . But that rule is only acceptable if you 've gone out once or twice and had an awful experience . Dumping or even divorcing someone via text message is just cowardice . It 's a punk move but it happens quite often and not just among teens , as pop star Katy Perry tells us in the July issue of Vogue magazine .

`` He 's a very smart man , and I was in love with him when I married him , '' Perry says , of her ex-husband Russell Brand . `` Let 's just say I have n't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31 , 2011 . ''

It 's best to say good riddance to a loser like Brand . Because while it may be cute for teenagers to text their sweetheart all day and night , that is really no way for intelligent , confident adults to communicate .

`` People can hide themselves in a text message , '' warns Bela Gandhi , founder of Smart Dating Academy in Chicago .

`` When you talk to someone on the phone that 's when their true personality starts to shine . Hearing someone 's voice tells you if they are positive or negative , or enthusiastic about life . The voice conversation is very important . It keeps people from hiding . The phone is a screener . ''

How technology has changed romance

As a happily single woman , I am shocked at how many professional , attractive and otherwise intelligent men have no idea how to hold communicate effectively by phone or face to face .

Real communication often takes courage . It 's not easy to drop our defenses and reveal our insecurities to one another , especially if we 've gotten our feelings hurt a few times . But developing your emotional intelligence is a critical ingredient in all healthy adult relationships .

A short text in the middle of the day to let someone know you are thinking of them is a sweet gesture . But if you imagine that sending a daily barrage of texts , such as `` driving to work , heading to lunch , or just left a meeting '' is a romantic way to show you are thinking of your partner , think again .

Or texting in the middle of the night . I once dated a 50-something guy who thought it was romantic to send me a `` good morning '' text at 4:30 a.m. Good grief . When the chime on my phone jolted me awake , I panicked : `` Someone must have died , '' I thought . Why else would anyone text me at this hour ? Bad move .

`` Texting is not the place for anything serious . Never handle something over text that should be handled in person or over the phone . This just shows that you are a weakling who deserves a good slapping . Swallow your fear , and pick up the phone . '' says relationship expert Michael Masters , author of `` TextAppeal -- For Guys ! The Ultimate Texting Guide . ''

Do n't get me wrong , no one has time to be on the phone all day every day , but I can guarantee you that if the woman you 're dating would rather text you than call , the relationship is over .

Also , it 's best to avoid needy `` Crack Texting . '' `` This is hands-down the number one mistake people make , '' says Masters . Texting is best used as a slowly developing conversation . And the benefit of texting is that you actually have time to think before you blast off an inappropriate message . I like Masters ' rule : `` The hotter the person is , the less you should be texting them . Do n't be needy . ''

The lost art of offline dating

I get it . I love technology and I text , tweet , tumblr , pin , and share on Facebook with a passion . Social networking is an integral part of my life . But when it comes to romance , women still need to hear your voice or look you in the eye when we 're talking .

'' -LSB- Research shows -RSB- that about 93 % of how we make our first impressions of people within 30 seconds of meeting them is nonverbal communication -- body language , voice tone , personal appearance ... '' Gandhi reminds us . `` And relying on texting to build a relationship is a recipe for miscommunication , and premature intimacy . ''

Do n't let technology turn you into a coward who is afraid of real conversation , or sharing yourself in any meaningful way . Do n't be a Russell Brand . If you have more virtual friends on Facebook than you do in reality , it 's time to reevaluate your life . Get out there make a few actual friends , in person .

Dating is easy . It 's risky . But it is not nearly as complicated as many people make out -- as long as you actually like yourself first and are basically satisfied with your own life .

I admit there is one date text I always will answer : `` Want to go to the Knicks game tonight ? '' Now that message just might be the start of a beautiful relationship .
