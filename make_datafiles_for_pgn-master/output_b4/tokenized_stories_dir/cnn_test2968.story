-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The spectacular rise of Jeremy Lin , the first Asian-American to achieve basketball stardom , has been utterly thrilling to witness . We 've watched with pride as he 's broken through stereotypes to prove that an Asian-American can play alongside -- and beat -- the best in the NBA . And we 've been gratified by the way Lin 's story has been embraced by the American public , with fans of all races cheering him on . But we 've also been reminded of the ugliness with which Asians have often been depicted in American culture .

After Lin 's 38-point performance against the Los Angeles Lakers on February 10 , Fox Sports columnist Jason Whitlock tweeted an offensive joke about Lin that played off stereotypes of Asians ' lack of masculinity . Boxer Floyd Mayweather has asserted that `` all the hype '' around Lin is just `` because he 's Asian . '' And after New Orleans snapped the Knicks ' Lin-led seven-game winning streak , ESPN posted a story with a headline that was an obvious anti-Chinese slur .

Mayweather : ` Lin hype is based on race not talent '

Stereotypes of Asians have been a staple of American popular culture since the 19th century , from newspaper cartoons of menacing , bucktoothed Chinese to film characters like the evil Dr. Fu Manchu and the bowing , pidgin-speaking Charlie Chan .

In contemporary America , Asians -- when they appear at all -- are generally depicted as comical foreigners with `` ching-chong '' accents , from exchange student Long Duk Dong -LRB- `` What 's happening , hot stuff ? '' -RRB- in `` Sixteen Candles '' to Han Lee , the stereotyped Korean restaurant owner in CBS 's hit comedy `` 2 Broke Girls . ''

American culture tells us , in short , that Lin should n't exist . Every time he drives to the basket , he upends stereotypes of Asians as short , weak and nerdy . Every time he talks to the media , he dispels the idea that all Asian-Americans are like foreigners speaking broken English .

Throughout his career , Lin has endured racist taunts from opponents and fans . And he 's been overlooked repeatedly . After a spectacular high school career , no college offered him a scholarship . After he starred at Harvard , no NBA team drafted him . He was dropped by Golden State and Houston before landing on the Knicks ' bench , and only got his shot when his team got desperate .

Is the ` Linsanity ' hype caused by race ?

Even as `` Linsanity '' gripped the nation , commentators and fellow players continued to play down Lin 's talents . From the declarations that Lin was a `` fluke '' and a `` flash in the pan '' to Kobe Bryant 's grudging comment that Lin was `` a testament to perseverance and hard work , '' the message was clear : Asian-Americans do n't really belong on the basketball court . We 've heard again and again that `` no one knew '' how good Lin was , but let 's get real . Lin was overlooked because when people looked at him , they saw a stereotype , not a basketball star .

As Lin led the Knicks to victory after victory , I watched with giddy excitement , but also a sense of worry : What would happen when the inevitable loss came ? Would the resentment captured in Mayweather 's tweet rear its head ? Sure enough , the night the Knicks lost to the Hornets , there was the offensive headline from ESPN . I imagine that many Asian-Americans got the same sinking feeling as I did : Here is the moment where the media will turn on Lin , bringing back the racist stereotypes that have been held at bay by Lin 's winning streak .

To my surprise , something else happened . ESPN quickly apologized , then announced that it had fired the author of the headline and suspended an anchor who had used the same phrase on the air . This was remarkable , because although certain kinds of racist attacks against African-Americans in the media have become unacceptable , anti-Asian rhetoric typically goes unpunished . Asian-Americans have become accustomed to having our protests against media stereotypes shrugged off and ignored . But on this one , ESPN took quick action .

Ex-ESPN writer says slur was ` honest mistake '

Phil Yu , of the popular blog Angry Asian Man , wrote about this `` Jeremy Lin Effect . '' Slurs and stereotypes that would previously have been used with impunity were getting a good , hard look , and a major media outlet responded to Asian-American critics with a swiftness that would have been unimaginable a few weeks ago .

We should n't romanticize this : ESPN knows that Lin is the biggest story in sports right now , and it ca n't afford to alienate or offend those hungry for their daily dose of Lin . But perhaps that 's precisely the point . Lin has become so big that simply by being himself -- an Asian-American , comfortable in his own skin , playing basketball brilliantly on the world 's biggest stage and enjoying himself as he does it -- he may be revolutionizing our culture . The Jeremy Lin Effect wo n't end racism , but it does mean that Asian-Americans will never be seen the same way again .
