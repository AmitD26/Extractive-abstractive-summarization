-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The private forensic pathologist who conducted an autopsy on Drew Peterson 's third wife affirmed the official findings that ruled the death a homicide , a copy of the autopsy report shows .

Drew Peterson , a former police sergeant from Bolingbrook , Illinois , is charged with killing his ex-wife .

The report , obtained by CNN legal analyst Lisa Bloom , was written by noted pathologist Dr. Michael Baden . He conducted a third autopsy on the body of Kathleen Savio at the request of Savio 's family in November 2007 .

Peterson , a former Bolingbrook , Illinois , police sergeant , pleaded not guilty May 22 to a charge of first-degree murder in Savio 's 2004 death .

The initial autopsy report concluded that she died as the result of an accidental drowning .

Savio was found in the bathtub in her home with a bloody gash on the back of her head ; at the time she and Peterson were going through a bitter divorce . Watch HLN 's Jane Velez Mitchell on the case ''

But investigators took another look at the case after Peterson was named as a suspect in the October 28 , 2007 , disappearance of his fourth wife , Stacy Peterson .

Savio 's body was exhumed on November 13 , 2007 , and state pathologist Dr. Larry Blum performed a second autopsy . Three days later , Baden conducted another autopsy on behalf of Savio 's family .

Baden 's report cited Blum 's findings of a 1-inch blunt-force laceration on the back of her head , five scraping abrasions and six blunt-force black-and-blue bruises on her extremities , abdomen and buttock .

Baden also noted that even though the body was partially decomposed , `` bruises and contusions caused by blunt force injuries shortly before death '' were still visible on the right breast , the upper right thigh and the abdomen .

The severity of those injuries , Baden said in his report , indicated a struggle . See a timeline of the case ''

`` It is my opinion , to a reasonable degree of medical certainty , that the drowning of Ms. Savio ... should be properly classified as a homicide , '' the pathologist concluded .

The Will County , Illinois , prosecutor announced in February 2008 that the findings of the second autopsy , conducted by Blum , provided the basis to classify the case as a homicide .

Peterson has denied any wrongdoing in the disappearance of his fourth wife , Stacy , who was 23 when she was last seen .

The former police sergeant remains in jail , awaiting trial on the first-degree murder charge in Savio 's death .
