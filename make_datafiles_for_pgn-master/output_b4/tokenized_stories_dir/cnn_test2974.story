Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama 's poll numbers are nothing to brag about , but there 's little evidence he has suffered so far this year a `` Katrina moment '' that caused his predecessor 's numbers to plummet .

A new CNN/ORC International survey indicates that public opinion of the President has barely budged in the wake of new challenges that Obama has faced this year .

According to the poll , which was released Wednesday , the President 's approval rating among Americans stands at 42 % . That 's not great , but it 's basically unchanged since March .

Only 42 % believe that Obama can manage the government effectively . Again , nothing to celebrate , but it 's virtually unchanged from the 43 % who felt that way in March .

`` When Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005 , the biggest impact on attitudes toward George W. Bush came in the number who said that he could manage the government effectively . That number dropped 10 points , and no other personal quality measured at that time changed as much , '' said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland . `` Using that as a definition of a ` Katrina moment , ' it looks like Obama has not experienced a similar drop in the summer of 2014 , in part because his numbers already took that hit last year and have stabilized since then . ''

The survey indicates there have been one-to-two point changes -LRB- which are within the poll 's sampling error -RRB- in the number of Americans who say that Obama is a strong leader , that he shares their values and that he cares about people .

`` Once again , those numbers are not good news for the White House , but the clear indication is that the President 's problems pre-date the current immigration crisis along the Mexican border or anything else that has happened this summer , and that those problems have not made things significantly worse for the President , '' Holland added .

Obama drop started last year

Obama 's numbers edged down during the late spring and summer of 2013 following controversies over the Edward Snowden intelligence leaks and congressional investigations into the IRS ' alleged targeting of conservative political groups . Then came October and the politically charged botched rollout of the website for Obamacare , his signature domestic policy achievement .

Coupled with legislative setbacks , many pundits labeled 2013 the worst year of Obama 's presidency . And for the first time since taking over at the White House in 2009 , a majority of the public surveyed disapproved of his job performance .

Obama 's approval ratings slightly rebounded earlier this year before edging down to their current standing in the low 40s in most national public opinion polling .

The release of the new CNN poll comes after the crisis along the southern border dominated headlines for weeks . Prior to that controversy , the scandal rocking the Department of Veterans Affairs was in the media spotlight .

The President is also facing two pressing international challenges : the bloody fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas , and the shooting down of a Malaysian airliner over a part of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists . Prior to these two international flashpoints , Obama was dealing with the increased bloodshed in Iraq , the ongoing civil war in Syria , as well as the controversial swapping of five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay for the release of a U.S. soldier held captive in Afghanistan .

The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International from July 18-20 , with 1,012 adult Americans questioned by telephone . The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points .
