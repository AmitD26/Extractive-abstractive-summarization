-LRB- Budget Travel -RRB- -- You can never have enough time in the Grand Canyon -- after all , it 's a billion-plus years in the making . We help you get the most of your stay whether you 've got a week , a weekend or just a few hours .

1 . The drive by , South Rim

For all its stature as an American icon , the Grand Canyon belongs to the world , too . On any given day , the South Rim may be the country 's most diverse place , an international village with a population that changes by the hour -- Buddhist monks in saffron robes and Mennonite women in black bonnets , busloads of grand-touring Germans and giggling Japanese teens moving and texting in packs , even a Scotsman playing bagpipes for an audience of hikers and curious ravens on a promontory .

Where to start : Grand Canyon Visitor Center . A short walk to Mather Point , the newly renovated center shows a free , 20-minute orientation film twice an hour in its new auditorium . nps.gov / grca .

Where to stay : Bright Angel Lodge . Less than a hundred feet from the rim , this National Landmark is celebrated for its history -- and its ice-cream fountain . grandcanyonlodges.com , rooms from $ 81 , ice-cream $ 2.65 .

Do n't miss : Even the quickie canyon visitor must do one thing : hike below the rim on Bright Angel Trail . That 's because as the mile-plus trail drops , it redefines the space . Cliffs that appeared insignificant tower above the trail ; woodlands thin out to scrubbier , desert-like vegetation .

2 . The long weekend , North Rim

A five-hour drive from the nearest major airport , the North Rim attracts the sort of visitors inclined to linger . They pause a little longer at the lookouts . They store up on provisions for a hike , and along the route , they 'll see ecosystems change as if they 'd walked from Canada to Mexico , and the rocks on view age more than a billion years . It 's a trip through space and time .

Where to start : North Rim Visitor Center . Get tips from a park ranger , visit the bookstore and take in interpretive programs . nps.gov / grca .

Where to stay : Grand Canyon Lodge . The only lodge within the North Rim , it features cabins with stunning views and simpler motel rooms with private baths . Rooms from $ 116 .

Where to eat : Grand Canyon Cookout . Experience slow-cooked brisket , roasted chicken and an evening of country music under the stars . Adults $ 35 , children 6-15 $ 22 , June 1-September 30 .

What to do : Mule Trips . Guided rides from an hour-long trip along the rim to a half-day excursion descending 2,300 feet down into the Supai Tunnel . nps.gov / grca , one-hour trip $ 40 , half-day $ 75 , ages 7 and older .

Do n't miss : The North Kaibab Trail stretches 14 miles and is the only maintained trail that leads to the Colorado River .

3 . The full week , North and South rims

After a few days of a week-long trip , something happens . A moment comes when the canyon ceases to be an icon and finally becomes real . In a world where the instantaneous is n't fast enough , the Grand Canyon measures time not in billionths of seconds but in billions of years . You ca n't tweet the Grand Canyon . The panoramas keep changing , and with every mile , the canyon becomes a living place , not an extra-wide postcard .

Where to stay/eat : El Tovar . The dining room is built of pine and native stone , the veranda views are spectacular , and Teddy Roosevelt himself slept here . grandcanyonlodges.com , rooms from $ 178 -LRB- kids under 16 stay free -RRB- , wild salmon $ 24 .

Where to go : All-Star Grand Canyon Tours . Guided excursions , from a short , no-sweat option in an SUV to longer backpacking hikes . allstargrandcanyontours.com , adults from $ 120 , kids 4-15 $ 90 , toddlers 3 and under $ 55 .

Do n't miss : The most compelling reason for a week in the canyon is to visit both rims . At nearly 9,000 feet , the North Rim sits more than 1,000 feet higher than the South . The extra elevation reverses the familiar perspective and puts you closer to the epic temples and plateaus . Suddenly , amazingly , the Grand Canyon feels new again .
