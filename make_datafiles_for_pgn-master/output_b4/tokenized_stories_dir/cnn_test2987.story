-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Not too long ago , students had to craft an essay if they wanted to win a scholarship . Now , they just can craft a tweet .

The Kentucky Fried Chicken Foundation is asking eligible high school seniors to tweet a photo that illustrates their commitment to education and enriching their communities . The KFC Colonel 's Scholars winner , announced December 15 , will receive up to $ 5,000 per year to pursue a bachelor 's degree at a public university in his or her home state .

KFC started the Twitter contest last year as a way of reinvigorating its scholarship program for the social media age . The competition saw over 2,800 applicants , with the winning tweet coming from California high school senior Amanda Russell : '' #KFCScholar Hey Colonel ! Your scholarship 's the secret ingredient missing from my recipe for success ! Got the grades , drive , just need cash ! ''

Other organizations , perhaps weary of wading through applicants ' lengthy essays , also are offering eager students ways to turn a 140-character message into money for college . Last summer Scholarships.com awarded a `` Short and Tweet '' $ 1,000 cash prize and Amazon Kindle e-readers to three students who tweeted winning answers to questions like , `` What would an extra $ 1,000 for college mean to you ? ''

`` No lengthy essay , no pile of paperwork -- just your thoughts , in real time , '' promised the contest 's website . `` To enter , simply log on to Twitter ... ''

In place of an essay , the University of Iowa 's Tippie College of Business offered a full $ 38,000 scholarship to its MBA program for the best tweet from a prospective student . `` That 's right , it 's a 140-character application that pays $ 271 per letter , '' said the school 's website .

Why a tweet ? Jodi Schafer , the University of Iowa 's director of MBA admissions and financial aid , told USA Today that application essays were `` becoming unoriginal . '' She said `` we 're hoping that incorporating social media in the process will help bring back some of that creativity . '' Applicants were encouraged to include in their tweet links to blogs , videos or Facebook accounts .

The college plans to bring back the tweeting scholarship next year to international applicants .

Competitions like these are done more for marketing purposes than finding qualified candidates , said Sree Sreenivasan , a digital-media professor who teaches classes on Twitter at Columbia Journalism School . He cited a scholarship sponsored by Dr. Pepper that was awarded to a girl who threw the most football passes into a giant Dr. Pepper can at the SEC Championship game .

`` How is that better or worse than Twitter ? '' he asked . Sreenivasan believes these scholarships get buzz because they are `` marketing to the extreme . '' He said he would not be surprised to see more competitions like this in the future , because marketers are very imitative .

This year 's KFC scholarship competition explores students ' creativity in a different way by asking them to tweet a picture instead of just a snippet of text . The ideal image should capture their high school experiences and collegiate dreams . KFC Public Relations Manager Rick Maynard says snapping pictures and sharing them online comes naturally to this generation of students , and the scholarship is a new way to connect with social-networking teens .

`` The Colonel was a lifelong learner , reinventing himself at the age of 65 when he turned a $ 105 Social Security check into what would become a global chicken chain . He would have been thrilled to see how KFC continues to adapt to fit the changing consumer landscape , '' Maynard said .

Maynard said KFC is watching for new technological trends to help the company decide what to do for next year 's competition . In the meantime , students may submit photos until December 13 , and the winner will be named around December 15 .
