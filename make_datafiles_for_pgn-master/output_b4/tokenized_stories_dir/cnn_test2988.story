Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Amanda Bynes ' claim that a microchip implanted in her brain made her tweet bad things about her father could be key evidence in keeping the actress in a mental facility , according to experts .

Bynes , 28 , was admitted to a Pasadena , California , facility on an involuntary emergency psychiatric hold Friday , but a probable cause hearing must be held this week if her doctors want to keep her there .

Her admission to Las Encinas Hospital came hours after Bynes posted a series of tweets alleging her father verbally , physically and sexually abused her . However , she disavowed responsibility for the accusations in a tweet a short time later : `` My dad never did any of those things The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he 's the one that ordered them to microchip me . ''

Bynes then boarded a flight from New York to Los Angeles , where she told reporters at the airport that she was there to file a lawsuit against her parents .

While she was told that a limo driver was taking her to a lawyer 's office in Pasadena before going to a West Hollywood hotel , she was instead driven to the hospital -- which resembles an office park -- where her parents ' lawyer was waiting for her .

`` In a perfect world , one would be honest about getting a person into a psychiatric hospital , but from her past behavior we have seen that Amanda Bynes avoids psychiatric hospitals at all cost because she does n't believe that she 's sick , '' Dr. Carole Lieberman , a Los Angeles psychiatrist who has followed Bynes ' story , told CNN on Sunday .

If the psychiatrists at Las Encinas Hospital decide to extend Bynes ' involuntary treatment beyond the initial 72 hours allowed for evaluation under California 's `` 5150 '' law , they must convince a mental health referee that she is `` a danger to self , to others or is gravely disabled , '' Lieberman said .

There does not have to be any expressed desire to kill herself , but the doctors need to show evidence that her behavior was so dangerous that it `` presented a risk to herself , if not others , '' Lieberman said .

One reason for keeping psychiatric patients on an involuntary hold is if they are `` having auditory hallucinations '' or they are `` responding to internal stimuli , '' according to guidelines on the Los Angeles County Superior Court website .

Unless Bynes volunteers to stay in treatment , the doctors must make their case , according to attorney Wendy Patrick . `` They ca n't just make up evidence . It has to be true and observable . The hearing is not just a rubber stamp . ''

The ups and downs of Amanda Bynes

Her tweet about a microchip forcing her to write negative things about her father would not be the only potential evidence , based on her very public history of odd behavior and several criminal charges .

Bynes was arrested on a DUI charge in Sherman Oaks , California , last month . Her arrest report noted a `` disheveled appearance . ''

Her last several days in New York included an incident at a clothing store in which security officers accused her of shoplifting . She was let go after signing a `` no-trespass agreement , '' TMZ reported .

Bynes was charged with a hit-and-run in 2012 , hospitalized for treatment last year after a psychological evaluation and put on probation after a DUI earlier this year .

And she was arrested after allegedly tossing drug paraphernalia out of the window of her New York apartment in May 2013 .

This is the second time Bynes has been placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold . The previous instance came in July 2013 after she was `` involved in a disturbance in a residential neighborhood '' in Thousand Oaks , California . She eventually entered an inpatient psychiatric facility and was later released into her parents ' custody .

The latest episodes of odd behavior come a year after her parents told CNN their daughter was `` making great strides towards recovery '' from mental illness .

She enrolled into the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles at the start of 2014 , but she dropped out in the summer .

Bynes ' parents will not be allowed to attend the administrative hearing , which would be held at the hospital , unless their daughter invites them , according to court guidelines . They have not publicly indicated if they will ask a judge to give them legal control of their daughter under a conservatorship .

Lieberman said if Bynes is returned to a conservatorship under her parents , as was done last year , they need to work with a psychiatrist to `` work out the family dysfunction . ''

People magazine reported in 2012 that Bynes tried to emancipate herself while still a minor , though she never moved out entirely .
