-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man accused of setting a fire in an air traffic control center , causing the shutdown of operations at Chicago O'Hare International and nearby Midway Airport , sent a private Facebook message to a relative just before he started the blaze , the FBI says in an affidavit .

`` Take a hard look in the mirror , I have , '' the message said , according to the affidavit . `` And this is why I am about to take out ZAU -LSB- the three-letter identification for the control center -RSB- and my life . ... So I 'm gon na smoke this blunt and move on , take care everyone . ''

Then , 36-year-old Brian Howard apparently started the fire in the control center basement , the affidavit said . When firefighters arrived , they found him lying on the floor and slicing his throat with a knife , the affidavit said .

The FBI charged Howard , a resident of Naperville , Illinois , with one count of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities , a felony . Howard was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries .

The fire started at about 5:40 a.m. Friday and caused the evacuation of the air traffic control center in Aurora , Illinois , which controls flights in several Midwest states .

Airlines at O'Hare canceled 1,550 flights and 470 at Midway , the Chicago Department of Aviation said at 8:45 p.m. Friday . Southwest Airlines suspended all fights for the day at Midway and Milwaukee 's General Mitchell International Airport .

The ripple effect caused the cancellation of flights at airports across the nation . Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport had 70 cancellations on Friday , compared to seven on Thursday , according to Flightaware , a flight-tracking website . LaGuardia Airport in New York City had 56 on Friday and 10 on Thursday .

By Friday afternoon , flights to the Chicago airports had resumed at a `` reduced rate , '' authorities said . The effect of the fire on Saturday 's flight activity has not been determined and it was not clear when the center would reopen .

Faced transfer to Hawaii

Howard had worked eight years in the center but faced a transfer to Hawaii , the FBI says in an affidavit . The documents do n't specify his job title but said he worked in `` telecommunications matters . ''

The FBI said Howard arrived at the control center a little after 5 a.m. dragging a `` hard-sided roller board suitcase '' into the basement , where he usually worked . He allegedly sent the Facebook message about 30 minutes after arriving and the recipient notified police .

At 5:42 a.m. somebody in the control center called 911 about a fire , the affidavit said . First responders found smoke in the air , blood on the floor , exposed cables , burned towels , a gasoline can , a lighter and a knife on the floor , the affidavit said .

One paramedic saw some feet sticking out from under a table and found a shirtless Howard `` in the process of actively slicing his throat with another knife , '' the affidavit said . Howard , the affidavit said , told the paramedics to `` leave me alone . ''

Police obtained search warrants for Howard 's home and found `` legal documents that had been laid out in a staged manner , in an attempt to make them easier to find , '' the affidavit said . The affidavit did n't describe the documents .

No court date has been set for Howard . If convicted , Howard faces a possible sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $ 250,000 .

CNN affiliate WLS reported that Howard was a machinist mate in the Navy from 1996 to 2000 with nothing unusual about his military record . He had a few traffic citations in 2007 , but nothing serious , WLS said .

`` He seemed like an everyday , normal kind of guy to me , '' neighbor Colin McGrath told WLS .

Travelers are frustrated

When the two Chicago airports shut down , controllers at other airports helped manage traffic to and from Chicago .

O'Hare last year handled 883,000 takeoffs and landings , ranking it as the second-busiest airport on the planet , according to Airports Council International .

Travelers stood in long lines inside the O'Hare terminal trying to rearrange flight plans . They described a frustrating scene to CNN reporters .

`` There 's chaos mixed with outrage , '' said Bernard Thompson of Washington , D.C. , who needs to be home by Sunday for a speaking engagement .

Thompson said that after his flight was canceled , the airline told him the next flight with an open seat would leave Monday . He booked a flight with another airline , only to discover the first airline could n't locate his luggage .

`` I 'll get there but it 's a question of whether I 'll have my luggage with me , '' he said .

The fire ruined travel plans at other airports .

Des Moines International Airport reported 19 cancellations on Friday , according to Flightaware , including the flight that would have carried Chelsea and Bill Wright to New York City .

`` We boarded our dogs and our kids are here and we got babysitters for them so it 's messing everything up , '' Chelsea Wright told CNN affiliate KCCI .

Other control centers pitch in to help

In a typical backup plan for a disabled FAA center , the FAA could assign air traffic control authority to FAA centers in other cities , such as Indianapolis , Cleveland , Minneapolis or Kansas City .

Doug Church , a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association union , said air traffic controllers braced for a tough day . `` Indianapolis Center is one of the major facilities bearing the brunt of the extra workload today due to the Chicago Center situation , '' Church said .

O'Hare is a main hub for United Airlines and other major carriers , with flights headed to international destinations . When controllers stop flights scheduled to fly to O'Hare , it has the potential to trigger a line of falling air traffic dominoes that will ruin travel plans for countless would-be passengers .

Illustrating the point , the flight tracking website FlightRadar24.com showed no aircraft flying in an area stretching from eastern Iowa to central Michigan .

Smoke at FAA facility stopped flights in May

Friday 's flight stoppages come four months after smoke at an FAA radar facility in Elgin , Illinois , prompted flight cancellations and delays at O'Hare and Midway .

In that May 13 incident , most flights in and out of O'Hare were delayed by an average of an hour or more , and more than 600 flights were canceled , the Chicago Department of Aviation said . Some 75 flights were canceled at Midway .

The smoke in that May incident was caused by a faulty motor in an air conditioning system , the FAA said at the time .
