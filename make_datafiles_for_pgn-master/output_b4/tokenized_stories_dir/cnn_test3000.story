-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Managing Ebola demands as much of our diligence in infection control practice as SARS did . And though Ebola may , in theory , be less contagious than the airborne SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses , it is spread through direct contact with infected body fluids or organs and has been demonstrably and tragically more fatal .

The SARS experience in Canada , though harrowing at the time , has helped us better prepare . In 2003 , 224 people in Toronto were diagnosed with SARS , and 38 people died . SARS , which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome , had originated in China and became a worldwide epidemic .

No longer are highly infectious diseases a world away . We have become more sensitive about just how global any infectious disease can be , and that it 's easy enough to `` import '' a disease .

SARS also reminded us that many infections may be spread and acquired by patients , visitors and staff in health care settings .

After SARS , that sensitivity translated into planning and implementation for the eventuality that a patient with another infectious disease may present at our door .

We are ready with protocols in place , in particular for adequate screening with the travel history of new patients , providing health care providers with personal protective equipment and ongoing training in its appropriate use , and ensuring rigorous environmental cleaning practices for all patient care areas .

We regularly engage our health care providers on the critical importance of knowing how to appropriately put on and remove personal protective equipment .

We have the advantage of learning from experiences in West Africa . Many of the centers that have been set up for dealing with Ebola patients there now use a buddy system to help ensure that everyone puts on and takes off personal protective equipment in the safest way possible , and we are going to be implementing that policy here .

The SARS experience also increased our emphasis on proper hand hygiene . One can not just rely on the barriers like personal protective equipment . We need to also rely on the important and fundamental practice of cleaning one 's hands . Proper hand hygiene includes washing with soap and water , or use of an alcohol-based hand wash rub , before and after each patient contact .

We and other facilities across the country conduct regular audits for hand hygiene compliance .

Planning and implementation require resources and expertise , and there is no question that after SARS , nationally and federally , our government acknowledged and addressed the need to strengthen our public health services .

Hospitals were given additional resources to ensure they had appropriate infection prevention and control infrastructure , including adequate isolation facilities across the country .

Hospital accreditation standards and guidelines were also substantially bolstered to ensure adequate attention to infection prevention and control . More policies were developed to address these kinds of wide-impact infectious diseases scenarios .

SARS also taught us the importance of communication , consistent messages , and accountability for dealing with these types of wide-impact events , and of making everyone aware -- both internally to patients and staff , and externally to the community served by the hospital -- of the situation and what measures were being implemented . Today , our lines of communication are much more open .

We began a planning process months ago in collaboration with public health agencies for the eventuality that an Ebola patient may present at our hospital . It is not an eventuality we look forward to , but given the lessons we have learned , we are better informed and prepared .
