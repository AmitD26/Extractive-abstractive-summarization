-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Orange is the new snack -- that 's the case in Ukraine anyway after one of the country 's top football players donated 20 tons of tangerines to local children .

Darijo Srna , who plays for Donetsk-based Shakhtar , made the gesture which allowed for the fruit from his hometown of Metkovic in Croatia , which is renowned for the fruit , to arrive in Ukraine .

`` As a child , back in Croatia , I also went through a period when I needed help , '' Srna told the club 's official website .

`` It is very important that there are people who support you in difficult situations . Donbass and Donetsk gave me a lot . And these citrus fruit is just a small gift that I can give back . ''

Donetsk has been besieged by fighting with the club 's Donbass Arena suffering damage from shelling .

In April 2014 , pro-Russian activists took control of government buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine .

This season , Shakhtar has been forced to play its home league games in Kiev , the capital city , while it has hosted Champions League fixtures in Lviv .

`` I am missing it a lot , '' Srna said of Donetsk .

`` Every day I read and watch the news . After each game I tell the guys that all the goals we score , all our victories are our gift to Donbass , to Donetsk , to the fans of Shakhtar , who currently have a tough time . ''

Srna , 32 , who grew up during the Balkans war , says he hopes the arrival of the tangerines , each with their own greeting card , will help bring some solace to those in the region .

`` I respect Donetsk a lot , '' he said .

`` This is my city . The city in which I have been supported for 11 years , owing to which I matured both as a footballer and individual .

`` I do it not for someone to say : `` Well done , Darijo ! '' This is from the heart and soul . I 'll try to support all those who need it , '' he added .
