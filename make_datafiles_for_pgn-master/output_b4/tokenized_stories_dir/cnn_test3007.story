Gaza City -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The latest attempt at a cease-fire in Gaza disintegrated Friday before it ever really took hold amid accusations that Palestinian militants killed two Israeli soldiers and captured one .

Blaming Hamas and its militant allies for the attack on the soldiers , Israel resumed shelling of what have been described as militant strongholds in Gaza .

The announced 72-hour humanitarian cease-fire between Israel and Hamas did n't even last two hours , by some accounts .

The pause appears to have eroded after about 90 minutes in Rafah , a city in southern Gaza , with the attack on Israeli soldiers . The soldiers were working to destroy a tunnel built by militants to breach Israel 's border when a militant emerged from it and detonated a suicide bomb , Israeli military Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .

Around that time , Palestinian sources told CNN they could hear shelling in the area . The Gaza Health Ministry said an Israeli attack on Rafah killed at least 62 people and wounded 350 .

Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan denied the group had captured a soldier .

`` It 's clear that the capture of the soldier is an Israeli story ; there 's nothing from the resistance saying there was a capture , '' he told CNN .

The Israel Defense Forces told a different version , saying its troops in Rafah were attacked in a `` brutal incident '' that required them to defend themselves . At the same time , rockets were fired from Gaza into southern Israel , Mark Regev , spokesman for Israel 's Prime Minister , told CNN .

The IDF identified the soldier as 2nd Lt. Hadar Goldin .

By late Friday , there was no claim of responsibility for the capture of the soldier .

But there was speculation about his fate took a turn after the militant group , the al Qassam Brigades , announced it lost contact with a group of its fighters in the Rafah area -- the same area where Goldin was reportedly taken .

In a statement posted on the brigade 's website , the group says it assumes that all of the fighters were killed in an Israeli airstrike , including possibly a soldier that Israel claims was captured . The statement stopped short of definitively saying the soldier was captured , using the phrasing `` assuming he was captured by the fighters . ''

Future cease-fire ?

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the attack on the Israeli soldiers `` an outrageous violation of the cease-fire . ''

It was a sentiment echoed by U.S. President Barack Obama , who told reporters that he was holding Hamas responsible .

`` I want to make sure they are listening . If they are serious about a cease-fire , that soldier needs to be unconditionally released , '' Obama told reporters in Washington .

He went on to say that when Hamas signs on to a cease-fire , the group is saying it 's in control of the Palestinian factions .

`` I think it 's going to be very hard to put a cease-fire back together again , if Israelis and the international community ca n't be confident that Hamas '' will honor it , Obama said .

At the same time , the President called the issue of the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza `` heartbreaking . ''

While Obama said Israel has the right to protect itself , he said the United States has been `` clear that innocent civilians in Gaza caught in the crossfire have to weigh on our conscience , and we have to do more to protect them . ''

With the conflict in its fourth week , more than 1,600 Palestinians have been killed , according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza . Of the casualties , the United Nations has estimated between 70 % and 80 % are civilians .

Since Israel began Operation Protective Edge against Hamas on July 8 , three civilians have been killed in Israel . Sixty-one Israeli soldiers have been killed during the hostilities , the IDF has said .

In an overwhelming bipartisan vote , 395-8 , the House on Friday gave final congressional approval for another $ 225 million to support Israel 's Iron Dome missile defense system . The Senate passed the measure earlier Friday .

Who 's behind the attack ?

If the attack on the soldiers in Rafah is corroborated , it would be a violation by Gaza militants of the cease-fire that had been in place , said Robert Serry , U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process . The violation would be `` condemned in the strongest terms , '' he said .

However , the office of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon clarified that the `` U.N. has no independent means to verify exactly what happened . ''

The narrative emerging from Washington was that Hamas used the cease-fire as cover to attack the soldiers in the tunnel . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken used this same language in remarks Friday . Earnest called the turn of events `` rather barbaric . ''

But the military wing of Hamas disputes that . According to the al Qassam Brigades , they carried out an attack on Israeli troops before the cease-fire took effect . In a statement , the group mentions that Israeli soldiers were killed as a result of the battle , but does not mention the capture of a soldier .

A second Hamas spokesman said Israel broke the Friday cease-fire before and after the hiatus by advancing its forces near civilian areas in Rafah and by occupying civilian homes to use as sniper positions .

1 killed in West Bank protest

Before the cease-fire plan was announced , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said Israeli troops would continue destroying Hamas ' network of tunnels that run under the border into Israel with or without a truce .

Hamdan , the Hamas spokesman , said that this part of the truce was not communicated to his group . He said Hamas ' understanding was that there would be no military activity at all .

A U.N. spokesman said it was very clear the Israeli 's would continue destroying the tunnels .

`` Perhaps some will deny that now , '' said Jeffery Feltman , undersecretary-general for public affairs . `` But , yes , it was very clear in the diplomacy being done yesterday . ... The Israelis never ceased saying that . ''

What is Hamas ' endgame in Gaza ?

What is Israel 's endgame in Gaza ?

The conflict has caused outrage around the world , including in the Palestinian West Bank , where thousands protested on Friday . One Palestinian was killed in Tulkarem during clashes with the Israeli military , Palestinian paramedics told CNN .

The Arab world has been accused of being silent on the Gaza conflict , but Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah on Friday released a statement condemning the violence .

Palestinians `` are being subjected to mass massacres and crimes against humanity without any humane or moral grounds to the point that terrorism has taken different forms , '' King Abdullah said . `` Especially the state sponsored terrorism which is the most dangerous form . ''

Hamas has said it wants an end to Israel 's blockade on Gaza , which restricts the movement of goods and people . It also wants the release of prisoners detained by the Israelis .

Israel , meanwhile , says it is aiming for the demilitarization of Hamas-controlled Gaza , removing the threat that militant weapons pose to Israeli civilians .
