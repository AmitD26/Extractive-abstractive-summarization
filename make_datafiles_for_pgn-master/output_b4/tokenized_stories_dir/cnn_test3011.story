-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What 's on tap for you and your partner this Valentine 's Day ? A romantic dinner , a box of chocolates , maybe a bouquet of roses ?

While all those gestures are thoughtful , the results of a new survey led by sex and relationships researcher Kristen Mark and the experts at Good in Bed suggest that most couples have something a little more intimate in mind .

In fact , nearly 85 % of men and women report that sex is an important part of Valentine 's Day , and 50 % say that they 'll be disappointed if they do n't get lucky on the 14th .

`` Valentine 's Day is second only to New Year 's Eve in the most celebrated holidays worldwide , '' explains Mark . `` Yet only a small amount of scientific literature has been dedicated to the attitudes , perceptions and participation in Valentine 's Day celebrations . ''

To learn more about the way both couples and single people feel about the holiday , Mark and her colleagues polled more than 2,000 men and women between age 18 and 70 , 66 % of whom were in long-term committed relationships .

`` The results , '' says Mark , `` give us insight into specific plans and expectations around this holiday . ''

The overwhelming majority of men and women are expecting sex . Here 's how to make intimacy the centerpiece of your relationship this Valentine 's Day .

Start outside the bedroom . Our survey found that 65 % of respondents plan on being affectionate on February 14 -- and affection does n't always have to be sexual .

Build anticipation before the big day -LRB- and night -RRB- by exchanging a few sexy texts or e-mails with your partner . Steal a kiss or two . You can also foster intimacy by giving him or her a really long hug : Research shows that hugging each other for at least 20 to 30 seconds can trigger the flow of oxytocin , the so-called feel-good `` cuddle hormone '' .

Make an effort . Great sex does n't always just happen . Sometimes , it takes a little planning , especially if -- like many Americans -- you 've been in a bit of a sex rut .

Do some prep work by turning your bedroom into a love nest : Make the bed -LRB- with new , or at least clean , sheets -RRB- , tidy up , light a candle or two , and queue up a sexy playlist on your iPod . If you do go out to dinner , do n't overindulge , and hit the sack early so you 're not too tired for intimacy .

Think outside the chocolate box . While flowers , chocolate and lingerie still top the list in gifts , 30 % of people plan on a more specifically sex-oriented gift on Valentine 's Day , says Mark .

These days , sensual presents and sex toys are as close as your local drugstore and can often be found right next to the condoms . If you 're in the market for a higher-end present , consider a new vibrating toy that charges in your laptop 's USB port .

Or gift your partner an anthology of erotica , and read a few stories together .

Get creative . According to the survey , 55 % of both men and women are open to trying something new sexually , just because it 's Valentine 's Day .

Take this opportunity to talk with your partner about stepping outside your comfort zones a bit . Maybe you want to experiment with role-playing , or watch an erotic movie together , or try a new position .

Feeling shy ? Take a tip from psychoanalyst Suzanne Iasenza , who suggests couples create a `` sexual menu '' that features a variety of sensual activities -- anything from watching the sunset together to giving each other erotic massages to acting out a fantasy . You can write up your menus independently and then share them on the big night .

Redefine intimacy . Valentine 's Day should be about celebrating love , but you do n't have to be in a romantic relationship to enjoy it .

Resist the urge to be impulsive , like 40 % of survey participants who say they would hook up with someone sexually just because of the holiday .

`` I advise some of my clients feeling anxious about the holiday to get together with people they love , like close friends or family members , with whom they have formed positive and supportive relationships , '' advises psychotherapist Allison M. Lloyds . That could mean dinner with friends , visiting your parents , or , if you 're a single mom or dad , celebrating with your kids .

Valentine 's Day is a great opportunity to get closer to the one you love . Use it to jumpstart your relationship , but remember : You do n't need a reason to celebrate love and intimacy every day of the year .
