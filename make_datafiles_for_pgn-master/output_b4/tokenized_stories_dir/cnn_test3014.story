Kyle Seitz , 36 , turned himself in at Ridgefield police headquarters on Tuesday afternoon , according to a statement from Capt. Jeff Kreitz .

After being processed , Seitz was released on a written promise to appear in Danbury Superior Court on Wednesday morning , Kreitz said .

The death of Benjamin Seitz was ruled a homicide in August .

On July 7 , Seitz was supposed to drop his son off at day care , but the dropoff never occurred , his wife , Lindsey Rogers-Seitz told CNN in July .

Seitz drove to work and at the end of the day he went to pick Benjamin up at day care , only to realize he was not there , authorities said .

When Seitz realized his son was in the car , he rushed the child to the hospital , but Benjamin had died .

The cause of the boy 's death was hyperthermia due to environmental exposure , according to the state medical examiner .

Neither Seitz nor his attorney immediately responded immediately to CNN 's requests for comment Tuesday .

The Connecticut death came a month after a similar incident in suburban Atlanta garnered national headlines .

In the latter instance , a grand jury ended up indicting Justin Ross Harris on eight counts , including malice murder and two counts of felony murder , over the death of his 22-month-old son , Cooper . Through his attorneys , Harris has claimed that he forgot to drop off the boy at daycare and mistakenly left him in his 2011 Hyundai Tucson on a day when the temperature topped 92 degrees .

At least 30 children have died this year for the same reason . Over the past decade , the group figures , there have been at least 388 children who have died of vehicular heatstroke .
