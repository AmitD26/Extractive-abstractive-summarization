Most girls who engage in compensated dating do n't view themselves as prostitutes , a social worker says .

HONG KONG , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- She does n't want to be identified , except by her nickname `` Sze , '' and she has a secret past . Her father does n't know what she did as a 16-year-old , and she hopes he never finds out . But Sze , now 19 , wants young girls to hear her story so they never make the same mistake .

`` My first customer was an ordinary man in his 40s . We skipped the dinner part and went straight to the guest house for sex , '' Sze recalled . `` Actually , I was a bit scared , but I knew this was the only way I could get money . This customer was n't bad , though . We just had sex , he paid , and then he left . I thought this was easy money , and that 's why I continued doing this kind of thing . ''

For a year and a half , Sze was part of a growing social phenomenon among teens in Hong Kong called `` compensated dating , '' a practice in which a young woman agrees to go on a date with a man for a fee . More often than not , the date involves sex .

Sze said she started compensated dating because many of her classmates at an all-girls school were doing it . She says she became jealous when she saw the designer clothes , bags and cosmetics they bought with the money they earned through compensated dating . Sze wanted the same for herself , so her classmates introduced her to Internet chat forums where she met male customers . Watch young women describe why they do it ''

The practice can have deadly consequences . Last year , a 16-year-old Hong Kong girl was killed in a gruesome murder after she went to a 24-year-old man 's apartment for a compensated date . The man , Ting Kai-Tai , killed the teenager , dismembered her body and flushed the remains down the toilet . A jury convicted him of murder and sentenced him to life in prison .

Sze told CNN she knew a compensated date could go horribly wrong . She would set ground rules with clients on the phone first . She charged them $ 350 for a date and clarified how many times she would have sex with them .

She said sometimes the customers would stray from the rules , asking for more sex or refusing to wear a condom .

`` Sometimes , I did feel shame . I kept asking myself why I had to do this kind of thing to make money . But the feeling did n't stay long . I would relax when I wanted to buy something . I just thought I could always quit after a short time or whenever I wanted , '' Sze said .

Most girls who engage in compensated dating do n't view themselves as prostitutes , said social worker Chiu Tak-Choi .

`` For the girls , they do n't think so because they think they can quit anytime . The girls -- even though they post their details on the Internet -- they think they can quit . Even if they encounter the guys , if he is not good-looking , she can quit and say ` I do n't do it . ' They think they have a lot of power to control whether they do it or not , so they think of it very differently from prostitution . ''

Chiu , the social worker , is currently working with about 20 girls who are trying to leave the world of compensated dating . It is hard to quantify how big the problem is in Hong Kong because the business is conducted under the radar , he said .

Chiu believes the problem is getting worse because his caseload has doubled in the past two years .

Prostitution is illegal in Hong Kong , and legal experts say that compensated dating is a form of prostitution . `` The law prohibits soliciting for immoral purpose , '' said Stephen Hung , a criminal litigator with Pang , Wan & Choi . `` When a court looks at sentencing , the greater the age difference , the more serious it -LRB- the sentence -RRB- is . ''

Why do young girls get involved in compensated dating ? The reasons vary from an unstable home life to a desire for material goods , Chiu said .

One 14-year-old girl told him she started compensated dating when she lost her cell phone . She said her parents would n't buy her a new one , so she thought she could earn some fast money with paid sex . She had her eye on an expensive cell phone . When the money from the first compensated date did n't cover the cost for the new phone , she went on a second paid date .

Girls involved in compensated dating do n't necessarily come from poor families , Chiu said . They are from all levels of socioeconomic classes , he said . Improved family communication is one solution to preventing girls from becoming involved in compensated dating , Chiu said .

`` The family has to do its part . I think caring for children is very important . Whenever they have problems , they can ask someone for help . ''

Sze said she was saved by a social worker who stepped in on her behalf . After a pregnancy scare and a number of unpredictable customers , Sze said her self-esteem plummeted . The social worker helped her get back on track .

`` She helped me understand that making money respectably is actually not that hard in Hong Kong . I finally realized that it was wrong to make money by selling my body . It just was n't worth it . ''

Sze now works at a hair salon to earn a living . She has tried to talk her old friends out of compensated dating , but they are not listening , she said .

`` They felt annoyed when I talked to them about this . I 'm now reluctant to get in touch with them . They just tell me they 're different . Maybe they have more serious family problems or some other burdens . I know I ca n't control their thinking , so I just stopped trying to help them . ''
