-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- My dad told me real men do n't hit women .

He believed that because men were physically stronger and mentally tougher , men had the obligation to shield women from harm .

I did n't buy the mentally tougher part , but I did embrace the idea that men were born with a kind of wonderful genetic code that made it impossible for them to pummel any woman , least of all a woman they cherished .

I believed this all the way through grade school and high school . I believed it until my college boyfriend , in a jealous rage , threw me against the wall and knocked me out .

It only happened once , but I remember how it felt . I always thought I was a physically strong woman , but I could not defend myself against a man who outweighed me by 70 pounds .

Which brings me to star running back Ray Rice .

When video emerged of the Baltimore Ravens player dragging his unconscious fiancÃ © e from an elevator , I thought the whole world would be horrified . I thought the National Football League would come down hard on Rice .

Rice indicted on assault charge

I was wrong .

Rice will sit out two games and pay a fine . It reportedly will cost the multimillionaire athlete $ 529,411.24 .

The Ravens ' head coach , John Harbaugh , summed it up this way on ESPN :

`` It 's not a big deal . It 's just part of the process . We said from the beginning that the circumstances would determine the consequences . There are consequences when you make a mistake like that . I stand behind Ray . He 's a heck of a guy . He 's done everything right since . He makes a mistake . He 's going to have to pay a consequence . '' -LRB- In May , Rice pleaded not guilty to one count of third-degree aggravated assault and was accepted into a pretrial program for first offenders . -RRB-

Plus , come on ! The guy went to counseling and married his victim , for goodness sake .

Say what ?

In a wonderfully headlined post , `` The NFL Thinks Smoking Weed Is Eight Times Worse Than Beating a Woman Unconscious , '' the website sports.mic contrasted Rice 's situation with that of Josh Gordon , a wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns , who `` is facing a 16-game suspension ... for testing positive for marijuana ... ''

Actually this strange kind of `` justice '' meted out by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell does n't bother me as much as what the Ravens posted on their Twitter feed . According to whoever tweets for the Ravens , Janay Rice herself `` deeply regrets the role she played the night of the incident . ''

Perhaps the new Mrs. Rice really does feel that way , but the Ravens ' `` helpful '' tweet is as tone deaf as John Harbaugh 's Rice `` made a mistake/he 's a heck of a guy '' comment .

Ayonna Johnson , director of legal services for the Women 's Resource Center to End Domestic Violence , says , `` When it comes to ... professional sports , unfortunately we 're still in a male-dominant society . '' A girlfriend or a wife , she says , `` has to bend themselves down , bend herself lower , and make her partner and her love interest shine a little brighter . ''

Even when her manly , wealthy , successful husband is clearly wrong .

Put more bluntly , take the blame , Honey , you probably deserved it .

I do n't say that lightly . After my boyfriend knocked me out , I expected my friends to rally around me . Most did not . `` He 's such a nice guy , '' they told me in disbelief . `` You must have made him really mad . You say some mean stuff . He really loves you . ''

ESPN 's Stephen Smith played the role of my callous former friends on his show , `` First Take . '' He assured his audience that , PERSONALLY , `` as a man raised by women , '' he knows full well there 's never an `` excuse to put your hands on a woman , '' except , that is , when you must .

Smith blathered , `` We also have to make sure that we learn as much as we can about elements of provocation . ''

In other words , Ladies , do n't provoke your man or he 'll deck you .

Smith 's colleague -- and my new hero -- Michelle Beadle tweeted , `` I 'm thinking about wearing a miniskirt this weekend ... I 'd hate to think what I 'd be asking for by doing so . ''

Smith tried to apologize , but the damage was done . Perhaps the NFL will try to apologize too , but again , the damage is done .

So , Mr. Goodell , a few facts for you to ponder for the future : According to safehorizon.org , one in four women will experience domestic violence during her lifetime . One-third of female homicide victims are killed by their current or former partner .

According to the Coalition Against Domestic Violence , boys who witness domestic abuse are twice as likely to abuse their own partners and children when they become adults .

It 's why I thank God every day I married a man whose father was as old-fashioned as mine . Gordon Snyder taught his sons a slightly different version , though . Gordy said , `` A man who hits a woman never hits a man . ''

Are you listening , Mr. Goodell ?
