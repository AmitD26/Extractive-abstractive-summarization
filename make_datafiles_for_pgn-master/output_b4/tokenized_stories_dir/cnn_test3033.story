Describing it as a `` day that has been a long time coming , '' President Barack Obama made modern history Monday by announcing the creation of a monument to honor the late labor and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez .

The Cesar E. Chavez National Monument becomes the 398th unit in the National Park Service system , and the first honoring a Latino born later than the 1700s , the Park Service told CNN .

It 's no coincidence the move comes less than a month before Election Day , as the president maintains a strong lead among Latinos . A big turnout among Latino supporters in states where the race is close could help Obama win re-election against GOP challenger Mitt Romney .

Opinion : Obama hits a foul by honoring Cesar Chavez

The president spoke at a ceremony in Keene , California , on land known as Nuestra Senora Reina de la Paz , where , from the 1970s until the early '90s , Chavez lived and led his farm worker movement .

Decades ago , Obama said , when Chavez began his farm worker movement , `` no one seemed to care about the invisible farm workers who picked the nation 's food -- bent down in the beating sun , living in poverty , cheated by growers , abandoned in old age , unable to demand even the most basic rights . ''

`` Cesar cared , '' the president said . `` In his own peaceful and eloquent way he made other people care too . '' Chavez 's organized labor marches and other protests , including a boycott of table grapes , led to `` some of the first farm worker contracts in history , '' Obama said . `` Let us honor his memory , but most importantly let us live up to his example . ''

Chavez 's movement `` was sustained by a generation of organizers who stood up and spoke out and urged others to do the same , '' Obama said .

Chavez , Obama said , believed that `` when someone who works 12 hours a day in the fields can earn enough to put food on the table -- maybe save up enough to buy a home -- that lifts up our entire economy . ''

Obama acknowledged that there 's still `` more work to do '' and `` the recession we 're fighting our way back from is still taking a toll -- especially in Latino communities which already faced high unemployment and poverty rates . ''

Earlier Monday , the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda , a coalition of 30 Latino organizations , lauded the move .

Chavez , who died in 1993 , embodied the principle `` that individuals can accomplish more as a community than they ever could on their own , '' said Hector E. Sanchez , executive director of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement , in a statement put out by the leadership agenda .

The monument includes 120 acres , National Park Service spokesman David Barna said .

Obama 's order puts property under federal protection that includes a visitor 's center , the United Farm Workers ' legal aid offices , Chavez 's home with his wife , Helen , a memorial garden containing his grave , and other buildings , the White House said .

Barna said no sculpture is planned .

The monument , in the Tehachapi Mountains , is the fourth designated by Obama under the Antiquities Act .

Obama 's decision to set aside the land as a national monument also sends a political message to environmentalists -- a key group of voters , as many strongly supported him in 2008 .

The League of Conservation Voters , which endorsed Obama in 2008 and for his current White House run , has not always been happy with the president 's environmental record . As debate raged in 2011 over air quality regulations and proposed construction of a transcontinental oil pipeline , LCV President Gene Karpinski said the administration had been `` caving '' to industry .

LCV spokesman Jeff Gohringer said Monday that establishing the Chavez monument stands as `` further proof of President Obama 's commitment to our special places across the country and we hope he continues to use that authority . ''

César Chávez an inspiration to president 's campaign slogan and movements

The Chavez family donated certain properties to the federal government so that the monument could be created .

Beginning Tuesday , the Park Service will take steps to prepare it as an official site , Barna said .

It will become `` one of those places that everyone should visit , '' he said , `` part of our shared cultural heritage . ''

The land includes property that was once Chavez 's home , which was added to the National Register of Historic Places last year . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar called him `` one of the heroes of the 20th century . ''

Paul F. Chavez , president of the Cesar Chavez Foundation , said at the time , `` For my father , La Paz was a personal refuge from bitter struggles in agricultural valleys and big cities , a spiritual harbor where he recharged batteries , drew fresh inspiration and prepared for the battles ahead . It was a place where many dedicated people spent years of their lives working with Cesar Chavez for social justice , inspiring generations of Americans from all walks of life who never worked on a farm to social and political activism . ''

Ruben Navarrette , a CNN.com contributor , wrote a column last year noting that many sites around the country are named for Chavez , and suggesting that that `` campaign '' may have run its course .

Still , he wrote , Chavez `` was a great American who helped bring fairness and dignity to the fields and the workers who toil there . Before Chavez and the union came along , there were no collective bargaining rights for farm workers , no toilets or clean drinking water in the fields , and little public awareness about pesticides and other dangers that workers must endure to put fruits and vegetables on our table . He helped change all that . ''
