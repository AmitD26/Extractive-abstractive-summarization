-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jenna McCorkell has spent her career dancing on a knife edge .

Upon the razor-slim width of her ice skates hinges more than just success or failure at the top end of the sport .

Every year that skating travels further , every leap seemingly more intricate than the last , but one thing remains the same -- the unforgiving surface on which they perform .

`` How the sport of ice skating is evolving , it 's insane , '' McCorkell , an 11-time British champion from Northern Ireland , told CNN 's Human to Hero series .

`` You 're seeing a lot more injuries , a lot more accidents with the tricky things we 're being pushed to make our bodies do .

`` You 've got to take off , jump up , turn around three times in the air in a split second . You 've got to be perfectly straight to make sure you 've got that landing on one foot .

`` It 's not even on one foot -- it 's on a tiny blade of a few millimeters .

`` You have n't got much leeway to be out of balance . It does take an incredible amount of strength , balance and coordination to be able to perform those jumps . ''

Things were n't quite as daring when McCorkell 's obsession with figure skating began .

A newspaper article that featured a little girl in a sparkly dress clutching a shiny trophy had her pestering her parents for an introduction to the ice .

`` They took me over to the ice rink and I started my first lessons . I just did n't stop from there , '' she explains .

`` I was a nightmare . I wanted to do every public session , every club hour , everything . I was addicted from the start . ''

Three years later , she became the youngest skater to ever make the Great Britain team , aged just 10 .

Seventeen years after that , after 11 national championship titles , she is preparing to put the brakes on her skating career .

But not before she competes at next month 's Winter Olympics in Sochi , aiming to banish the memories of her performance in Vancouver four years previously .

And yet , despite an ocean of time having passed since that first enchanting step onto the ice , there is still an element of that thrill present whenever she competes .

`` The first time I ever performed , I remember being so excited . I remember I just could n't wait to get my dress on , '' she recalls .

`` It changes a lot as you get older but it 's always fun to compete when you 're at such a young age -- you 've got no worries , no pressure and no stress . You 're just so excited , bouncing to get on the ice .

`` You go through a lot of different emotions and changes throughout the years -- some good , some bad . ''

All those early memories certainly filter into the former category .

Her prodigious rise after first picking up her skates culminated in that unprecedented inclusion in the Great Britain squad for someone so young .

McCorkell has enjoyed success on the international stage , winning gold medals at several prestigious events , and finishing in the top 10 at two European Championships .

But it is on her own territory that she is peerless -- last year 's British title success was her eighth in a row .

`` Winning 11 titles is quite something , '' she said of her epic run .

`` Somebody asked me how does it feel and I said , ` Old ! ' After 11 years of being British champion , it 's quite an achievement and I 'm really , really proud of it and proud of everyone that has supported me .

`` You start to learn to cope with the fact that more and more is expected of you . I think the motivation to continue comes from wanting it more and more for myself . ''

There is an epic beauty about figure skating that resonates with the public .

The effortless grace of competitors performing to music has produced iconic moments in the sport , sparked by a flawless sequence at the 1984 Winter Olympics .

Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean 's pairs routine in Sarajevo enchanted the public and judges alike , securing the British pair a perfect score from the judges -- a feat that had never been done before .

It wo n't happen in the future either , after a change in the judging system on the back of a controversial ruling at the 2002 Winter Olympics .

Russian pair Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze took gold in the mixed pairs despite many believing Canada 's Jamie SalÃ © and David Pelletier should have triumphed .

The new code means each skater gets a base value for every move they perform in a routine , based on its difficulty , even if they fall while doing it .

That means a skater who has fallen can still score higher than a competitor who has skated cleanly .

Consequently , routines are become more audacious , and some skaters are now pushing the boundaries by attempting quadruple axels -- four aerial revolutions on a jump .

`` I love skating because on the ice you just feel free , '' McCorkell says . `` You 're never at your limit .

`` You can always try more -- there are so many goals , so much more you can do with the sport developing like it is , with the new judging system .

`` It 's more difficult for people like me who 've been in the sport a long time to adapt to new things because our bodies are not like the fresh 15-year-olds who 've been brought up in the new judging system .

`` So that 's something that 's quite difficult . For the older generation , I think it 's getting quite exciting , especially in the men 's events -- it 's getting crazy with the quad jumps .

`` Before , it was unbelievable if they did one quad and now you 've got guys , maybe five or six guys , doing three different quads in a program so it 's quite exciting . ''

Looming large on the horizon is the pinnacle of any figure skating career -- the Winter Olympics .

McCorkell made her first appearance at Vancouver 2010 , and though she says her memories will last a lifetime , a disappointing 29th placing will also linger .

`` It was an amazing experience I 'll never forget , '' she says . `` Walking out at the opening ceremony , the feeling was just overwhelming .

`` That 's something nobody can ever take away from you -- no matter what those results are , you always have those memories .

`` In Vancouver , I did n't have my best skate . It was probably my worst performance in the previous four years and I have no explanation as to why . It was just one of those days .

`` It just did n't happen , so I think that it can always be better than that and I think I 'm in a better place mentally now than I was then so hopefully it will all be OK .

`` I 'm pretty excited about Sochi now . It 's getting closer and closer .

`` The training is starting to pay off in the competitions so my results have been gradually increasing through the season and I hope that will continue and I hope I skate my best there for myself . ''

A strong performance in Sochi would represent a fitting finale to a distinguished and illustrious career that will officially end in March .

`` After Sochi , I 'll go to the world championships in Japan and then I 'll retire , that 'll be my last competitive season , '' McCorkell added .

`` I think after so long , I 've achieved more than I could ever have dreamed of and I hope to have a good end to the season and then that 'll be me -- done . ''
