Halloween can be extra scary for kids with food allergies .

Chocolate is frightening if you 're allergic to milk , and a candy bar with nuts can be deadly . With eggs , soy and wheat also common allergies in kids , according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , finding treats without tricks can be a challenge on Halloween night .

That 's why the Food Allergy Research & Education organization wants Halloween lovers to go teal this holiday .

Their Teal Pumpkin Project encourages people to place a teal-painted pumpkin outside their door if they 're offering non-foods treats , such as small toys , stickers and crayons . A flyer can also be printed from the website .

The idea is taking off online . Food Allergy Research & Education 's first Facebook post about the Teal Pumpkin Project , reached 2.7 million people in less than 72 hours , the organization reported . Posts about the project have been shared a combined 31,000 times . This year marks the first time the idea has been promoted nationally .

`` The Teal Pumpkin Project is an easy way to make a big impact in your community . Food allergies can be life-threatening , and they affect 1 in 13 children in the United States . We are thrilled to see so many people embracing the Teal Pumpkin Project as a way to ensure kids with food allergies can enjoy a safe , fun Halloween experience just like their friends , '' says Veronica LaFemina , spokeswoman for Food Allergy Research & Education .

LaFemina says they are already starting to see photos of children with paintbrushes and teal pumpkins on doorsteps via Instagram and other social media channels . Families who are managing other diseases for which candy presents a problem , such as diabetes and celiac disease , have also shown support .

If you do n't want to purchase non-food items , it is helpful to separate allergy-free candy from candy that may trigger an allergic reaction if you 're handing out goodies on October 31 . Cross-contamination is a concern , as many food allergies require only a small amount of the allergen to trigger a reaction .

No tricks this Halloween , just allergy-friendly treats

Tips for parents

Parents should also use extra caution when checking Halloween candy if their child has an allergy .

`` Checking labels becomes very pivotal because during the holidays , including Halloween , when the manufacturers make those mini small-sized candies and they 're often mass-produced on shared equipment , '' says Mireille Schwartz , the founder and CEO of the Bay Area Allergy Advisory Board . `` Candy that 's safe other times of the year might not be safe during Halloween . ''

Carrying an epinephrine auto-injector , which treats all anaphylaxis , is also a good safety measure . Schwartz recommends checking to see if the medication is up-to-date before leaving the house , as auto-injectors typically expire within one year .

And while enjoying treats while walking door-to-door is a highlight of Halloween , it 's best if parents make sure their child avoids the sweets until they can be inspected at home .

For younger children , Schwartz adds , `` You do n't want to bring up the larger , darker side of things . You just want to say you 're going to check the candy to make sure it 's safe . ''
