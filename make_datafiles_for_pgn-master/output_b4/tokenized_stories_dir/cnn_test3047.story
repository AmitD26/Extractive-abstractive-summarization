Online delivery services have a checkered history at best . But Uber , the app-oriented car service , is giving it another go .

The company , which lets app users hook up with nearby drivers for hire , has announced Uber Rush , which promises to let `` your packages travel like a VIP . ''

Being tested only in Manhattan , it 's a lot like a typical courier service . First , users summon up a vehicular courier -LRB- the company 's reportedly adding bike and foot messengers to its fleet -RRB- . Next , the app quotes them a price . And then the courier hauls an item or items from Point A to Point B .

The service does n't allow users to order items , such as lunch , and have them delivered . It 's just for transporting items already in their possession .

Rush is now an option on the existing Uber app in areas where it is available .

During the initial dotcom boom of the late '90s and early 2000s , several online delivery services tried , and failed , to catch on .

Kozmo.com is a classic story from the dotcom bubble burst . The website , which promised to deliver items such as DVDs , food and Starbucks coffee within one hour , raised $ 250 million in capital , launched in 1998 and was out of business by 2001 .

Webvan , an online grocery-delivery service , went bottom-up the same year , in what some have called the biggest dotcom flop in history .

But the emergence of mobile technology has some Web players reconsidering the quick-delivery model . Ebay Now promises delivery of good from local stores in less than two hours for a $ 5 fee . The Postmates app similarly offers food and other goods delivered for prices starting at $ 5 .

Prices for Uber Rush appear to be higher -LRB- $ 20 - $ 25 -RRB- , more in line with what New York City couriers typically charge . Uber 's model is to take 20 % of whatever price their drivers charge .

Uber uses drivers who have applied to participate and who have passed background checks and other vetting to ensure they are properly licensed and insured . They must be at least 23 .

The company says it will expand Rush to other areas of New York if it succeeds in its initial test phase .
