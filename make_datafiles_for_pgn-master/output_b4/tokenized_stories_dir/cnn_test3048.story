In the age of personalization , a Finnish company is bringing 3D technology to the world of bespoke men 's footwear .

Inside the London store of the Left Shoe Company -- just one of seven locations around the world -- a space-age platform sits among scaling shelves decked with beautifully made , traditional men 's shoes .

Next , customers are invited to sport a pair of bright yellow and green socks and stand on the Sci-Fi-like scanner as it produces a virtual 3D picture capturing the volume of their feet .

After selecting the model and style from the store 's catalogue , the shoes are made by traditional craftsmen in Portugal and delivered to the customer anywhere in the world in up to 6 weeks .

Bespoke 3D innovation

What 's more -- shoppers looking to purchase another pair of shoes can easily order them online thanks to their 3D foot-scan stored in the company 's digital archives .

`` It enables me to stay in contact with customers all over the world , '' says Christian Haugaard , director of the London store . `` They may have visited the store once in their entire lives , but they can shop with us forever . ''

The simplicity for the customer is also an added bonus , explains Hauggard : `` It allows you to shop online and know exactly what you 're going to get , whereas if you go to other e-commerce sites you may have to buy two or three sizes and return two of them . It does n't make a lot of economic sense . ''

The digital scan gives shoppers a custom fit made in seconds at virtually no cost allowing them to skip the made-to-wear tradition of having a wooden model made of their feet -- an expensive and time consuming process .

In turn , the savings is passed on to the customer . The Left Shoe Company 's footwear costs around $ 640 , about half of what a traditional shoemaker might charge .

Luxury embraces digital

By combining a tech-savvy business model with old-school artistan tradition , the Finnish company is making bespoke craftsmanship accessible to a customer that craves authenticity in the digital era .

`` It 's a sector that does n't really embrace change and that includes technology and e-commerce , '' says Allegra Perry , a senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald . But , she says , across the board , technology is becoming an increasingly big feature in the luxury goods sector .

CEO Erkan Fere says that using technology to streamline a traditional business model has as many advantages for the business as it does for the customer .

The benefit of made-to-measure footwear , he says , is that it involves minimum waste . `` We make the shoes one by one when an individual customer orders them . If we do n't sell many of a certain style , it does n't matter . ''

He 's convinced that tradition with a tech twist will catch on : `` We have adopted this technology early , but I have no doubt that other companies will catch up quickly . ''

And the demand for bespoke is growing , says Paul Alger , head of the UK Fashion and Textile Council : `` For many years consumers have been rather passive about what they 'll buy , but now there 's a whole generation of new consumers that say ` I will buy less , but I will buy better . ' ''

There is still an important place for bespoke in this world of ready-to-wear , says Haugaard . `` We had a gentleman in the other day and he ordered one shoe in a size 9 and one in a size 7 . Where else would you go ? The only alternative is to buy two pairs of shoes . ''

A majority of the population , he points out , have different sized feet and , by bringing together high-technology and traditional craftsmanship , the Left Shoe Company is making high-end , made-to-measure shoes a more attainable dream .
