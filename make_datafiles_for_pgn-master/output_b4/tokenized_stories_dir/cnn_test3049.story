It started with a chance conversation between a doctor and a nurse several years ago . But that brief encounter may end up exposing what could be one of the largest Medicare frauds in U.S. history .

Dr. Alon Vainer , a medical director at dialysis clinics in Georgia , was discussing clinic procedures with one of the nurses , Daniel Barbir . The two men say they saw something they believed was very wrong : expensive medicine , and lots of it , was being tossed in the trash . And the clinic workers were being told to do it , the two men say .

`` When we sat down and started talking about it and getting into details , we actually realized exactly what was going on , '' Vainer said .

The alleged waste was being carried out on a massive scale and , the nurse and the doctor said , they knew why almost immediately . They claim it was a way for their company , DaVita Inc. , to defraud the government , overbill Medicare and Medicaid and make a fortune .

`` We 're talking in the hundreds of millions , easily , '' Vainer said . `` The profit this company raked from those two schemes , only from those two drugs , was hundreds of millions of dollars . ''

The allegations of massive fraud have implications for all Americans . The alleged fraud would have involved Medicare and Medicaid patients , whose medicine is paid for by U.S. taxpayers .

Vainer and Barbir said the alleged fraud schemes they discovered were going on at the company 's clinics all across the country -- at the time , about 2003 through 2010 , more than 1,800 -- with tens of thousands of patients . It was enormous , they claim , and Vanier said it was all a deliberate strategy coordinated by the company .

`` It was just a scheme in order to fraudulently increase and maximize and boost the Medicare revenue , Medicare payment , so therefore fraudulently increase their revenue , '' he said .

DaVita Inc. , based in downtown Denver , is one of the nation 's largest dialysis companies . The name means `` Giving Life '' in Italian . The company just moved into a brand new $ 101 million office tower , complete with fountains , gardens and even a suspended ski gondola inside for private meetings .

DaVita has grown in the past couple of years and now runs roughly 2,000 dialysis clinics across the country , which has added up to a $ 7 billion business . The dialysis empire is run by CEO Kent Thiry , who dresses like one of the Three Musketeers , has adopted a company slogan of ` One for all and all for one ' and in company staff meetings leads his employees , who he calls villagers , in cheers of `` DaVita ! ''

Thiry is reportedly paid an estimated $ 15 million a year , according to the Wall Street Journal , which has called him the best compensated CEO in Colorado .

Most of DaVita 's revenue comes from a single source : taxpayers . More than two-thirds of DaVita 's revenue comes from Medicare and Medicaid payments .

If Vainer and Barbir 's allegations are true , the company threw away hundreds of millions of dollars of medicine , and taxpayers paid for it . And , if true , the alleged fraud schemes could represent one of the largest Medicare frauds in U.S. history .

Vanier explained to CNN how DaVita instructed its nurses to administer a 100-milligram dose of the iron drug Venofor .

`` For example , if a patient requires this dose once per week , you 'd administer 100 milligrams , waste nothing and charge Medicare for 100 milligrams , '' he said .

`` But what DaVita did , instead of charge -LRB- for -RRB- one vial , they give 50 milligrams of this vial -LRB- and -RRB- put the residual into the trash . '' he said . With another vial , he said , the company would give 25 milligrams to a patient and put the rest in the trash , then repeat it with yet another vial , when one vial could have been given without waste .

The more vials DaVita used , the more the company was able to bill the government , the men say . Vainer and Barbir claim they tried to call attention to the massive waste and tried to get it stopped . But instead , they say , they were basically told to stop causing trouble and to continue following the company 's protocols .

`` That 's what upset me the most , '' Barbir said . `` and that 's when I went to Dr. Vainer . I said , ` Dr. Vainer , I ca n't do that . ' ''

Barbir says he quit his job and left the clinic rather than continue where fraud was going on . Vainer claims the company punished him for speaking up .

`` Of course , once they found out , they did not renew my medical directorship or my practice , '' Vainer claimed . `` We are a three-physician practice , and it was a significant loss of revenue . ''

Today , both men have filed a whistleblower lawsuit under the U.S. False Claims Act on behalf of the U.S. government , charging DaVita with massive Medicare fraud . They stand to make millions if DaVita is found guilty .

DaVita 's CEO would n't talk , but the company 's attorney Kim Rivera did . When asked about the plaintiffs ' allegation that DaVita had come up with so-called schemes to throw away drugs and maximize profits , Rivera said : `` Well that 's just wrong . If you look at the facts of the case , first of all , the doctors make the dosing decisions ... . When you look at what the practices were -- decisions being made by doctors , based on what was in the best interest of their patients . And they took into account a variety of things .

`` You ca n't just look at one issue . You have to look at things like infection control , what the patient 's going to do , how the patient 's going to do with particular doses . And so , during that entire time what we did , what the doctors did , was appropriate . ''

But other companies , including DaVita 's main competitor , used smaller vials and smaller combinations at times , limiting what was thrown away .

DaVita reiterated its decisions to throw away medicine were for `` sound clinical reasons '' and `` never to increase wastage . ''

Plaintiffs ' attorneys Lin Wood and Marlan Wilbanks , who claim DaVita made as much as $ 800 million over-billing the government , say that DaVita 's defense wo n't hold up in court .

`` It 's not just the taxpayers that are the victims here , it 's the health care system , '' Wood said .

`` It does n't take a graduate degree to understand what 's going on here , '' Wilbanks said . `` This is just dishonesty . ''

DaVita denies that and vows to fight the case in court . But earlier this year , while denying it did anything wrong , DaVita settled a similar case in Texas for $ 55 million .

Pat Burns , with the watchdog group `` Taxpayers Against Fraud , '' says the bigger problem is that even if a company gets caught cheating the government , the company executives never seem to face any punishment . Fines are paid and business continues as usual .

`` The way it 's set up right now , if the fraud is not caught , then taxpayers foot the bill , Burns said . `` If the fraud is caught , stockholders foot the bill . ''

Burns and others have been arguing for much harsher treatment when companies are found guilty of defrauding the federal government . He points to record billion-dollar fines , particularly in the pharmaceutical business , that are paid , but executives do n't get punished and the companies continue to do business with the government .

In fact , one of DaVita 's defenses to CNN is that the federal government itself declined to charge the company with wrongdoing , even after reviewing the fraud allegations .

`` The government has come in and thoroughly investigated what the allegations are , and in both cases the government decided to drop it and move on , '' Rivera said .

Federal prosecutors in Georgia declined to intervene in the case but stated in a letter that decision `` should not be construed as a statement about the merits of the case . ''

The short-staffed U.S. Department of Justice declines to join lawsuits all the time , instead allowing private citizens who hire private lawyers to essentially prosecute for the government , Burns said .

`` The U.S. Department of Justice simply does n't have the people , '' Burns said . `` It should have the people . I think we all would agree to that . It simply does n't . ''

Which brings us back to the original meeting of one doctor and one nurse who now stand to make millions if these allegations of fraud are proven true .

The biggest winners , though , in their lawsuit could be taxpayers . The U.S. government will recover the bulk of whatever they win . They and others like them are essentially the U.S. taxpayers ' deputies in the fight against health care fraud . Asked if they are surprised that they have to defend the U.S. taxpayer , Barbir said simply , `` I 'm not surprised . It 's not easy to come forward and stand up and tell the truth , but it 's the right thing to do . ''

The case is set for trial later next year .
