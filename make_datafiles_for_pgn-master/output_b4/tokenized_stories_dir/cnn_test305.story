-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eastern North Carolina cleaned up Saturday from powerful tornadoes that damaged about 200 homes and knocked out power to thousands of customers .

Meanwhile , much of the central United States is bracing for even more severe weather in the form of tornadoes , damaging winds and hail .

Multiple twisters touched down in an area east of Greenville , North Carolina , to Beaufort County , on Friday evening , the National Weather Service reported .

A tornado that struck Whichards Beach in Beaufort County injured 16 people and damaged or destroyed 150-200 homes , reported the Pasquotank-Camden Emergency Management , quoting the National Weather Service .

The twister was rated an EF-3 , with winds estimated at 150 mph . Emergency management official said that ended the streak of days without an EF-3 tornado at 158 days .

John Pack , spokesman for the Beaufort County Emergency Management , estimated more than 200 homes in that county sustained major damage , and at one point at least 2,500 homes did n't have power .

He told CNN that staffers at the National Weather Service , county volunteer fire crews and more than 100 electrical crews were working to assist residents .

In Pasquotank County , three tornadoes touched down , destroying 13 homes and causing major damage to 17 homes , the Pasquotank-Camden Emergency Management said . The weather service said those were EF-2 and EF-1 twisters .

NC Dominion Power reported 3,100 customers losing power in Pasquotank County . Elizabeth City Public Utilities said approximately 4,000 city customers lost power .

In nearby Perquimans County , the story was similar .

A spokesman for that county 's emergency management agency , Tom Ponte , told CNN a preliminary assessment showed the storm damaged 38 homes and left about 1,770 residents without power .

According to Ponte , the county is opening a shelter for residents displaced by the storm and roads are being cleared by the county fire department , with assistance from the North Carolina Department of Forestry .

The National Weather Service 's Storm Prediction Center , which monitors severe weather across the United States , said severe weather will move over other parts of the United States over the next three days . That 's all due to a storm that 's moving eastward from the Rockies .

CNN meteorologist Matt Daniels predicts a slight risk of severe storms Saturday evening from central Texas into southeast South Dakota . This may include damaging winds and large hail , but does not rule out a few tornadoes .

On Sunday , most of Arkansas and neighboring areas -- including Shreveport , Louisiana , and Springfield , Missouri -- face the highest chance of severe weather , though states as far north as North Dakota , and southeast to Georgia , also could be in harm 's way .

The SPC said it may upgrade Sunday 's threat level from moderate to `` high risk . '' This would be the first `` high risk '' threat this year -- a warning that is typically issued only a few times a year .

The danger zone shifts farther east on Monday , with Memphis , Tennessee , and Tupelo , Mississippi , among the cities most likely to get hit .

There is also a slight risk of storms stretching into the Midwest , north Georgia and the western Carolinas . These storms could produce damaging winds , large hail and tornadoes -LRB- some could be strong -RRB- throughout the day .

And yet more severe weather looms for Tuesday .

The Storm Prediction Center notes that these threats come in a year that has been -- so far -- one of the quietest for tornadoes in U.S. history . Already , the country has set a record for going the longest into a new year without a tornado fatality .
