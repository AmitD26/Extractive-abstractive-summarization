On Friday , a military jury decided U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales will get life in prison without parole for killing 16 Afghan villagers .

Yet victims left behind -- some bearing physical scars , others with emotional ones from seeing their kin indiscriminately , brutally gunned down -- say that , with that sentence , they do n't feel they got justice .

Friday 's decision was not entirely unexpected . In June Bales ' pleaded guilty to more than 30 criminal charges , including 16 premeditated murder counts , spared himself from the prospect of a death sentence . He also pleaded guilty to charges related to illicit steroid and alcohol use .

But it still remained up to a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel to decide whether Bales should be eligible for parole .

They decided Friday he is not , according to Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield with Joint Base Lewis-McChord . That means the 39-year-old will spend the rest of his life in a military prison .

That 's not punishment enough for Haji Wazir . Now 40 , Wazir was inside his home in the Panjwai district of Afghanistan 's southern Kandahar province in the pre-dawn hours of March 11 , 2012 , when Bales barged in .

What followed was a nightmare , ending with bloodied , limp and in some instances scorched bodies .

`` We wanted this murderer to be executed , but we did n't get our wish , '' Wazir said through an interpreter Friday from the Washington state U.S. Army base where the sentence was handed down .

The sentence was not just , he added , before appealing to the U.S public to put themselves in his shoes .

`` I 'm asking the average American right here : If somebody jumps into your house in the middle of the night and kills 11 members of your family and tries to burn them , what punishment would you be passing on that person ? ''

Wazir and his family were n't the only ones torn on that horrific morning some 18 months ago .

Bales slipped away from Camp Belambay , the remote outpost where he was stationed , and into one village , where he began shooting at civilians . After that , he returned to the base , reloaded and went out again to target another village .

He left a trail of blood and gore in both villages , with nine children among the dead . Witnesses claimed that the U.S. soldier dragged some bodies of his victims ' outside and set them ablaze .

The horror ended when Bales returned , once again , to Camp Belambay and turned himself in .

In the subsequent hours and days , some spoke highly about Bales , such as attorney Emma Scanlan who described him as a `` devoted husband , father and dedicated member of the armed service . ''

Yet in Afghanistan and around the world , the massacre quickly spurred outrage .

The Taliban vowed to retaliate `` by killing and beheading Americans anywhere in the country . '' Afghan President Hamid Karzai suggested , after meeting with villagers who 'd seen the carnage and wanted Bales to be tried there to `` heal our broken hearts , '' that the incident had put U.S.-Afghan relations at a breaking point .

`` It is by all means the end of the rope here , '' Karzai said then . `` The end of the rope that nobody can afford such luxuries anymore . ''

Bales was identified as the culprit days later and eventually put in solitary confinement at the U.S. military prison in Fort Leavenworth , Kansas .

The military announced last December that Bales faced a court-martial .

The Army soldier spoke at this week 's sentencing , calling what he 'd done `` an act of cowardice . ''

`` I hid behind a mask of Bravado , '' Bales said , according to a tweet from court from Drew Mikkelsen of CNN Seattle affiliate KING . Also admitting he 'd taken steroids and drank sporadically , the soldier apologized to his victims .

`` I am responsible , '' he said .

Because of him , some in Afghanistan are still suffering the consequences .

Haji Mohammad Naim saw Bales come into his southwest Afghanistan home around 2 a.m. and kill women there , as well as some of his children . Bullets struck him in the neck and the face .

That incident and others in which U.S. soldiers have killed civilians -- including another of Naim 's sons , in a separate incident , he says -- have disgraced American forces in the eyes of many Afghans . Children in his village used to run toward U.S. troops , Naim said ; now , they `` run away and try to hide . ''

If America is to improve its image , there must be accountability , he said . And if Washington wants to help rebuild Afghanistan , `` try to send the right people , not maniacs and psychos like -LRB- Bales -RRB- . ''

Still , even if the U.S. governments acts differently , some pain and suffering ca n't be undone .

Recalling tears shed by Bales ' mother during the legal proceedings , Naim said , `` But at least she can go and visit him .

`` What about us ? '' he asked rhetorically . `` Our family members are actually 6 feet under , and there 's no way that we can visit them at all .

`` They 're gone . ''
