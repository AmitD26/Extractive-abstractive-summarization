Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A hacker 's invasion of dozens of celebrity iCloud accounts , leading to the embarrassing leaking of nude photos , has lessons for us all . Here are five things you should know about what happened .

Who 's been hacked ?

There 's a list of 100 celebrity women -- and one man -- whose photos were supposedly downloaded and stolen by a hacker . It includes A-listers , notably Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence , and D-listers whose names you may not recognize . Many of them only found out they were victims because of media reports naming them , but others -- such as Lawrence -- found out when social networks exploded with buzz about nude photos being distributed online .

Lawrence and two others , actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead and model-actress Kate Upton , almost immediately confirmed the images were of them . Several others -- including singer Ariana Grande , gymnast McKayla Maroney and singer-actress Victoria Justice -- said photos supposed to be of them were fakes .

Justice later tweeted that she did , in fact , suffer `` a serious violation of privacy , '' with real photos leaked .

While Rihanna is on the list , it might have been a waste of a hacker 's energy , because the singer is known for frequently sharing revealing photos of herself on Twitter and Instagram .

Being on the hacked celebrity list does n't mean the hackers actually found any racy photos . Actress-singer Keke Palmer , 21 , was on the list , but has never taken or kept nude photos on her phone or elsewhere , her mother said . The former Nickelodeon star , now playing Cinderella on Broadway , was taught early in her career about the dangers , she said .

Others reportedly hacked include : Aubrey Plaza , Avril Lavigne , Cat Deeley , Farrah Abraham , Gabrielle Union , Hayden Panettiere , Hope Solo , Hillary Duff , Jenny McCarthy , Kate Bosworth , Kim Kardashian , Kirsten Dunst , Mary Kate Olsen , Meagan Good , Sarah Schneider , Selena Gomez , Teresa Palmer , Vanessa Hudgens and Winona Ryder .

The one male on the list is actor Dave Franco , but to the disappointment of some female fans , no nude photos of Franco have emerged .

Why would celebrities have nude photos of themselves on their cell phones ?

There may not be one answer for this , but distance from love interests could be a major factor . Actors spend months away from spouses and lovers while making movies . Musicians tour the world for months . Sexting can become a substitute for intimacy when a relationship goes long distance .

Of course , some bathroom mirror selfies may be snapped and kept as a way to measure progress on a diet or to assess the need for a tummy tuck or update with the plastic surgeon .

Other celebs , however , have enjoyed career boosts when supposedly inadvertent leaks of nude photos or videos have gone viral . Ask Kim Kardashian about that . Her career highlight was as Paris Hilton 's personal assistant before the world discovered her sex tape .

Another way nude photos might find their way onto a celebrity 's cell phone is just plain naivetÃ © . Maybe they do n't realize images on their iPhones are automatically backed up by iCloud , or perhaps they thought iCloud was a safe place for their data .

How did the hacking happen ?

The hacker apparently took advantage of a security flaw in Apple 's online backup service , iCloud . Many online services lock someone out after several unsuccessful attempts to log in , but not Apple 's `` Find My iPhone '' app and iCloud . That has been changed by Apple in the aftermath of the nude celebrity photo scandal . But with unlimited guesses , a computer program can generate and test thousands of potential passwords until an account is entered . It is called a `` brute force '' attack .

The tendency of many people to choose weak passwords and to use the same password for each service helped . Once a celebrity 's `` Find My iPhone '' app password is discovered , the same password often can access iCloud . People might never know their accounts have been compromised .

Another thing makes the famous more vulnerable . Wikipedia and many other websites provide biographical information that can help a hacker guess passwords or answers to security questions .

Nearly a decade ago , Paris Hilton 's Sidekick cell phone was accessed when a hacker guessed her password was Tinkerbell , the name of her famous teacup chihuahua .

Apple said on Tuesday that the company 's core computer systems , which house all its users ' data , were not hacked . `` Certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names , passwords and security questions , a practice that has become all too common on the Internet , '' Apple said .

How can you safeguard against hackers ?

Learn from the woes of your role models , the celebrities .

Choose strong , hard-to-guess passwords . Long but easy to remember pass phrases that include numbers are suggested . Have variations for different email accounts , bank accounts and apps . If one is hacked , it does not compromise your entire virtual world .

Many services , including Apple 's , offer the option of two-factor authentication . After you enter your permanent password , you are asked for a second temporary password or number that is automatically generated and sent to you in a text message .

A hacker would not have been able to access those celebrity photos unless he or she also had the celebrity 's cell phone .

Another safeguard is to be aware that even when you delete a photo or video from your iPhone , it is possibly backed up by iCloud . The service allows you to access images on all your devices , but it also keeps those you might think are deleted .

Actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead tweeted that the photos of her that were leaked were `` deleted long ago . ''

What penalty could the hacker pay ?

A stiff prison sentence is the short answer .

Jennifer Lawrence 's representatives said investigators have been contacted and `` will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence . ''

The FBI 's Los Angeles office confirmed Monday that it was investigating the hacking . `` The FBI is aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusionsÂ and the unlawful release of material involving high-profile individuals , and is addressing the matter , '' the agency 's spokeswoman said .

The same office caught a Florida man who hacked celebrity email accounts in 2011 . Christopher Chaney , whose targets included actresses Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis and singer Christina Aguilera , was charged with accessing protected computers without authorization , damaging protected computers , wiretapping and aggravated identity theft .

Chaney is serving a 10-year federal prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2012 .

The hackers arrested in the Paris Hilton case , including a teenager , got jail time , too .
