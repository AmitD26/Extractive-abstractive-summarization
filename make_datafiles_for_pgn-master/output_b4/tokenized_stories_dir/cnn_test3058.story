Iran started suspending high levels of uranium enrichment Monday as an interim deal struck with six world powers went into effect , state media reported , making way for more talks and fewer sanctions .

All of its voluntary moves will be completed by Monday evening , Iran 's nuclear spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi told state-run news agency IRNA .

The United States and European Union announced that they were suspending certain sanctions for six months as part of the deal .

`` In reciprocation for Iran 's concrete actions , the United States and its P5 +1 partners -- the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Russia , and China -- as well as the European Union will today follow through on our commitment to begin to provide the modest relief agreed to with Iran , '' said White House spokesman Jay Carney . `` At the same time , we will continue our aggressive enforcement of the sanctions measures that will remain in place throughout this six-month period . ''

Iran stopped enrichment of uranium to the 20 % purity level and disconnected cascades of centrifuges enriching uranium in Natanz , a top nuclear official told state-run Press TV .

A centrifuge is a mechanism used to enrich uranium .

`` From now on , the centrifuges which were used for producing 20 % enriched uranium will be used for enriching uranium to the 5 % purity level , '' said Mohammad Amiri , a director in the nation 's nuclear agency .

International inspectors were present when Iran started implementing the historic deal , Press TV said .

The action is part of a six-month interim agreement that gives Iran and the other countries more time to negotiate a permanent solution .

Iran struck the deal on November 24 in exchange for lighter sanctions .

Tehran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful , civilian energy purposes , despite concerns from the West that it 's a guise for working toward a nuclear weapons program .

Nuclear power plants use uranium that is enriched to 5 % as fuel to generate electricity .

As part of the agreement , Iran must eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium , dismantle some infrastructure that makes enrichment possible , and allow broader and more intrusive inspections of its programs .

The six nations and the European Union are reviewing a report by the U.N. watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , which provided details of the nuclear activities on the first day of the deal , according to the U.S. State Department .

`` This is an important day in our pursuit of ensuring that Iran has an exclusively peaceful nuclear program , '' said Catherine Ashton , the European Union foreign policy chief .

She said she 's optimistic a new round of negotiations could come soon .

`` Depending on how things work out today , I hope that we will start talks in the next few weeks , '' Ashton said .

If all conditions are met , Iran will get sanctions relief totaling about $ 7 billion , including access to $ 4.2 billion in frozen assets , during the six months the interim deal is in effect .

`` The psychological effects of the lifting of sanctions will create a new atmosphere in the country , '' said Iran 's Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi , according to IRNA .

For years , Iran and Western powers have left negotiating tables in disagreement , frustration and open animosity .

The diplomatic tone changed last year when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was elected .

And the deal appeared to be on the right track Monday .

As part of the deal , Iran was required to dilute its stockpile of uranium that had been enriched to 20 % .

While uranium is n't bomb-grade until it 's enriched to 90 % purity , `` once you 're at 20 % , you 're about 80 % of the way there , '' said Mark Hibbs , a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .

The deal also mandates Iran halt all enrichment above 5 % and dismantle the technical equipment required to do that .

World leaders applauded the interim deal after years of a stalemate .

`` For the first time in nearly a decade , we have halted the progress of the Iranian nuclear program , '' U.S. President Barack Obama said when the deal was announced in November .
