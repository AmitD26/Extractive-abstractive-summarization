-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Well , that 's one way to crowdsource .

`` Parks and Recreation '' star Aziz Ansari tweeted Sunday that he was bored on a flight , and what followed had all of the makings of a Hollywood movie .

The comic questioned why there has never been a film about a haunted plane : `` Would n't that be dope ? '' He then started tweeting ideas and a script for a project he dubbed `` Ghost Plane . ''

Quicker than you could say `` I 'll make you a star , '' #GhostPlane took off .

`` Dude . For real . Is any studios into GHOST PLANE ? I can make it cheap . It 's all one location . Just the plane , '' Ansari tweeted .

The idea goes like this , according to Ansari 's tweets : `` Open on Indian guy RAJ -LRB- Aziz Ansari -RRB- saying bye to his parents . He gets on the plane . But this plane is actually a GHOST PLANE . #GhostPlane . ''

`` Raj uses the plane washroom pre-takeoff . He sees a face in the mirror . ` This might be a ghost ' he thinks ... #GhostPlane , '' the actor added .

Do n't even worry about casting . There 's a role for Jennifer Lawrence as `` Flight attendant Anne '' and fellow Academy Award winner Tom Hanks as `` The Captain . '' But our favorite character might be embodied in this tweet : `` A mysterious man in a hoodie : ` If you want to stop the dolls . You need my help . ' He lifts the hood : ITS LIAM NEESON AS HIMSELF ! #GhostPlane . ''

Because of course it 's Liam freaking Neeson .

Fans were really into it . On person tweeted , `` Now I ca n't sleep because @azizansari is telling the most magnificent story #GhostPlane '' while another said , `` A studio needs to pick up @azizansari 's #GhostPlane IMMEDIATELY . If not we 'll just make a kickstarter . It 'll be cheap . ''

We will have to wait to see how it all pans out .

Ansari said , `` Sorry everyone . #GhostPlane is on pause . I just got home and have to be up early to shoot Parks . I 'll try to finish this sometime . ''

What a cliffhanger .
