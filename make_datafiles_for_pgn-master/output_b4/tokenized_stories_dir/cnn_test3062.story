President Barack Obama 's aggressive new proposal to dramatically limit carbon pollution is a policy priority that he hopes will help shape his legacy .

But a policy step that Obama considers good for the country and his presidency may be bad for certain Democrats in tight election battles this year .

Democrats ' flight

Some of the toughest fights this campaign season are taking place in red or purple states where jobs and the economy are in a constant tug of war against the environment .

They are also the states where Obama 's plan to limit carbon emission from power plants will have its greatest impact .

Obama 's big environmental move : Demanding power plants cut carbon

Obama 's proposal aims to reduce carbon pollution by 30 % by 2030 , but the Chamber of Commerce put out a study last week saying it will cost $ 50 billion and eliminate nearly 225,000 jobs .

Republicans are framing it as a job killer and electricity bill hiker , putting some Democrats in a tough position in an uneven economy .

`` As he seeks to secure his legacy , Obama is finally getting his ` war on coal , ' '' the Republican National Committee wrote in a statement slamming the proposal .

Coal power plants , the greatest polluters , are expected to be the most impacted by the new rules , if they 're finalized .

Some Democrats from conservative coal-producing states quickly and sharply broke from the President .

Kentucky produces the third-most coal in the country but has seen a reduction in coal jobs and production . A high-profile Senate race there has come down to who loves coal more .

Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes , who is running to unseat Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , put out a strong statement opposing Obama 's move .

`` President Obama 's new EPA rule is more proof that Washington is n't working for Kentucky , '' Grimes said in a statement . `` When I 'm in the U.S. Senate , I will fiercely oppose the President 's attack on Kentucky 's coal industry because protecting our jobs will be my number one priority . ''

She is also actively attacking the President , running ads worth `` six figures '' in Kentucky newspapers that say `` President Obama and Washington do n't get it . ''

Her opposition is aggressive but it did n't stop McConnell for connecting Grimes to the President and fellow Democrats .

`` Alison Lundergan Grimes was recruited by President Obama , who said he would ` bankrupt ' the coal industry , and Harry Reid , who said ` coal makes us sick . ' And she is being funded by liberals nationwide who know that a vote for her is a vote to ensure further implementation of their anti-coal agenda in the U.S. Senate , '' McConnell 's spokeswoman Allison Moore said in a statement .

In West Virginia , which produces the second most coal , Democratic candidate for Senate Natalie Tennant also opposes the new rules .

`` I will stand up to President Obama , -LRB- EPA Administrator -RRB- Gina McCarthy , and anyone else who tries to undermine our coal jobs , '' Tennant said in a statement .

West Virginia Rep. Nick Rahall , who is in a tough race to retain his seat , put out a statement announcing that he is introducing legislation to block Obama 's proposal .

The new effort could also play out in Louisiana , where Sen. Mary Landrieu , chairman of the Senate Energy Committee , is in a tough reelection campaign .

Landrieu has been a major defender of fossil fuel-based energy industries as oil , natural gas and some coal are integral to her state 's economy .

She straddled the issue carefully on Monday by saying that carbon emissions should be reduced but with the input of Congress and not through the Environmental Protection Agency .

And giving an olive branch to the powerful energy industry , she also praised it for reducing carbon . She did not praise the President .

`` Congress should set the terms , goals and time frame . Greater use of natural gas and stronger efficiency measures adopted by the industry have already helped us reduce carbon emissions to their lowest levels in 20 years , '' Landrieu said .

Her Republican opponent , Rep. Bill Cassidy slammed Landrieu . His spokesperson , John Cummins , said she has done little to stop regulations that `` tie down Louisiana 's energy economy in an effort to promote a radical climate change agenda . ''

In North Carolina , another red state , Republican Thom Tillis called his opponent , Democratic incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan , `` a rubber-stamp for Obama 's anti-energy policies . ''

Hagan said in a statement that she would push for changes in the plan , which will be subject to public comment .

`` I 'm talking to business leaders and energy experts in North Carolina about what this proposed rule will mean for our state and our economy . I want to make sure that the proposal does enough to recognize the progress we 've made reducing carbon emissions and promoting renewable energy , '' she said .

In Montana , Democratic Sen. John Walsh 's statement underscores the difficulty of this issue in conservative states . He issued no position , instead saying he `` will be listening to Montanans '' to determine if the rule is one they can accept .

Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas was also noncommittal . He said he had `` concerns '' but would wait to hear what the people of his state thought .

The issue is likely to come up in races in Pennsylvania , Virginia and Alaska as well . All produce coal but also lean conservative and have constituencies that are turned off by greater government regulation .

But Bill Burton , a former Obama spokesman , said division among Democrats is expected , especially in campaign season .

`` You 're going to have instances where Democrats are going to not be perfectly aligned with the President 's message , but that does n't mean the President 's policy is not the right one , '' he said .

The Republican Party is taking advantage , launching robocalls connecting candidates to Obama 's `` radical energy plan '' in Virginia , Louisiana , Colorado and Alaska .

Obama 's fight

Before his administration announced the planned change , Obama held a conference call with members of the House and Senate in an attempt to shore up support and enthusiasm , indicating that this would be a political landmine for some Democrats in tough races .

But addressing the issue of climate change has been at the forefront of his legislative wish list . Up until now , he has n't done much , hitting a number of roadblocks along the way .

Since failing to pass cap and trade legislation to limit carbon emissions through the Democratic-led Senate in 2010 , Obama has struggled with Congress .

He has been saddled with a struggling economy and several foreign policy crises , effectively putting climate change on the back burner .

Inaction of his own initiative has also limited Obama 's influence on the issue .

He has repeatedly put off a decision to kill or approve the Keystone XL pipeline , which is still unresolved and has upset everyone with a stake or position on the issue .

The appointment of John Podesta as the President 's counselor earlier this year to revive a struggling White House was also a signal that Obama was going to try again to address environmental pollution .

Podesta , who was chief of staff for former President Bill Clinton , has focused on progressive energy and environmental issues , authoring a book in 2008 that is heavy on the issues .

These proposed rules on power plants are being billed as the most aggressive effort to combat pollution and climate change in decades , and Burton says this is a legacy issue for Obama .

`` Nothing has been done on this scale as it relates to combating climate change and it will absolutely be an important part of the President 's legacy , '' he said . -LRB- Burton also does work for the environmental group the League of Conservation Voters -RRB- .

Democrats ' plight

Democrats who support the proposal will be backed by billionaire Tom Steyer , who has pledged to financially assist nearly a dozen candidates who support climate change proposals .

Not among those candidates are Democrats who are opposing Obama 's new rule , including Grimes , Landrieu and Pryor .

Steyer praised the President 's initiative and blamed Congress for not addressing the issue .

`` This Congress has failed in its most basic responsibility to protect the health and welfare of the American people from this grave threat , '' he said , indicating his support for candidates who will do more to address the issue in the future .

And Burton says Republicans will be the ones to suffer politically for being `` saddled by the notion that climate denial is salable in 2014 . ''
