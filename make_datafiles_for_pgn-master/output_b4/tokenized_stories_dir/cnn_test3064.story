Former wrestler and Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura has some harsh words for the armed forces this Veterans Day : If given the option today , he 'd opt out of military service .

`` I hate to say it , but no , I would be a conscientious objector today , '' the Navy special forces veteran said in a video posted Tuesday . `` I do n't believe that the military fights for our freedom . ''

`` They give them all the ra ra at the stadiums , and they cheer 'em on , '' said Ventura , who served as a Reform Party governor of the North Star state from 1999 to 2003 . `` But when the veterans come home , we pretty much forget about them . They 're old news . They 're yesterday 's garbage . And it 's time to move on to the next war . ''

He pointed to the fallout from the Vietnam War as an example of these attitudes -- and he predicted that veterans from more modern wars would experience the same thing .

`` There gon na come back to parades , but it 's gon na end about right there , '' he said .

Ventura did say , however , that he is n't anti-veteran . After all , he is one himself , having served in the U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team member during the Vietnam War .

`` You can hate the war and not hate the vet . The veteran is a pawn . They have to do it . They are not given a choice , '' he said . `` Our vets are honorable people ... I bear no grudge . ''

In particular , Ventura took issue with the large dollar amount pinned to foreign wars , arguing that `` international corporations '' are the ones who `` truly run our country today . ''

`` That 's why wars are fought -- so the profiteers of war can make money , '' Ventura said , pointing to the large portion of the annual budget that goes toward national security and defense .

`` If we were n't involved in these wars , we would have more freedom , '' he said .

The video appears on the website of Voices of Liberty , a group led by former Republican congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul . It lobbies against `` unjustified wars , unconstitutional surveillance , -LSB- and -RSB- extrajudicial drone assassinations , '' according to its website .

Ventura no longer holds public office . But he 's stayed politically active and he hosts a show on the digital television network Ora TV called `` Off The Grid . ''
