The Israel Security Agency released the identities of two suspects in the kidnapping of three teenage boys from Jewish settlements in the West Bank two weeks ago .

`` The Israel Security Agency established less than a day after the kidnapping ... that Hamas was believed to be behind the June 12 abduction , the ISA said in a statement Thursday

`` Hamas activists from Hebron , '' Marwan Kawasmeh , 29 , and Amar Abu-Isa , 32 , were behind the abductions , the intelligence agency said .

Both men have been arrested by Israeli security forces before , according to an ISA news release . Kawasmeh served a 10-month prison sentence .

`` In his most recent investigation , in 2010 , -LRB- Kawasmeh -RRB- admitted to having been recruited to the Hamas military wing in the Hebron area in 2009 , '' ISA said . Abu-Isa was detained several times between 2005 and 2007 .

Lt. Col. Peter Lerner of the Israel Defense Forces said Thursday that both men have `` a history of terrorist activity '' and both were `` suspects immediately after the kidnapping . ''

The three teenagers , Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frenkel , both 16 , and Eyal Yifrach , 19 , were last seen around Gush Etzion , on the Israeli side of the West Bank barrier late on June 12 or early on June 13 , according to the IDF .

After the release of the suspects ' identities , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded with a comment directed at Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .

`` I now expect President Abbas ... to break his pact with the Hamas terrorist organization that kidnaps children and calls for the destruction of Israel . ''

Previously Abbas had condemned the kidnappings and called on all sides to refrain from violence , according to an Israeli newspaper report earlier this month .

Netanyahu blamed Hamas for the kidnappings almost immediately . A Hamas spokesman said in the days after the abductions that Netanyahu 's comments attributing blame were `` stupid and baseless . ''

Israeli security forces have conducted an extensive search for the teens . Within days after the teens ' disappearance , Israeli soldiers had detained more than 150 Palestinian suspects . The military said Hamas leaders and operatives were among the suspects .

As the search for the two suspects continues , the IDF and ISA said Thursday several other suspects are also being questioned `` for their personal involvement of the attack . ''
