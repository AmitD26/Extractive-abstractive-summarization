A two-shot swing on the final hole of the final women 's major of the season saw South Korean teenager Hyo-Joo Kim clinch a remarkable victory in the Evian Championship at the expense of Karrie Webb of Australia Sunday .

Webb chasing an eighth career major , but first since 2006 , was one ahead going into the 18th hole , but took three shots from the edge of the green for a bogey five , missing her final effort from 12 feet .

By contrast , the 19-year-old Kim , playing her first major , showed no sign of nerves as he rolled home a 15-foot birdie putt to finish on 11-under 273 .

It left her a shot clear and the third youngest winner of a major behind U.S. pair Morgan Pressel and Lexi Thompson .

Speaking through an interpreter , Kim admitted : `` I was flying like a bird . ''

Webb , who would have become the first player to win six different majors , with the Evian Championship a recent addition to the roster , said she had misjudged her first effort from the edge of the green .

`` It was a rush of adrenaline with the belly wedge and the putt was faster than I thought . It was a very poor putt and I knew I had to make it for a play-off .

`` I had a lot of good shots and hit every green bar the second hole and it 's obviously disappointing , but I gave myself a good chance . ''

Kim , who stunned the golf world with her opening 10-under 61 in France , closed with a final round of 68 to clinch the 350,000-euro first prize -LRB- $ 487,500 -RRB- .

She has the added bonus of winning her full playing rights to next season 's LPGA Tour without having to qualify .

Webb also shot a 68 for 10-under with two more South Koreans , Jang Ha-Na -LRB- 66 -RRB- and Hur Mi Jung -LRB- 68 -RRB- tied for third on nine-under .

To complete its domination , another Korean Choi Na Yeon , was fifth on eight-under after a fine closing 67 .

Kim first came to attention at the 2012 Evian Masters -- the last event before it became a major -- finishing fourth as an amateur that year .

In 2013 she was Rookie of the Year on the Korean Tour and has already won three times this season .

U.S. star Michelle Wie had to pull out of the first round with a hand injury , but had some consolation by sealing the inaugural Annika -LRB- Sorenstam -RRB- Major Award .

It is for the player who has won at least one major and has the best overall record .

Wie claimed her first major at the U.S.Women 's Open champion and was runner-up to Thompson in the Kraft Nabisco Championship .
