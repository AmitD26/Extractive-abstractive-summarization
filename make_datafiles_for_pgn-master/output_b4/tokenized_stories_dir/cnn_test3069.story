London -LRB- CNN -RRB- Amid massive global interest in the trial , appeal and retrial of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito , it has been easy to overlook their alleged victim , Meredith Kercher , who was found brutally murdered in the flat she shared with Knox in Italy in 2007 .

Knox and Sollecito were convicted of Kercher 's murder in 2009 but were acquitted and released from prison on appeal in 2011 . In March 2013 , Italy 's Supreme Court overturned the pair 's acquittals , saying that the jury did not consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered .

The case was sent to a retrial in Florence , which began in September 2013 and concluded in January 2014 with another conviction for murder for Knox and Sollecito . Italy 's high court met Wednesday to consider whether that latest verdict should be definitively upheld or sent back for another appeal .

At the time of the conviction , speaking in Florence , Kercher 's sister Stephanie said the family might never know exactly what happened on the night of her death .

`` I think we are still on the journey to the truth , '' she said . `` I think it may be the fact that we do n't ever really know what happened that night , which is obviously something we will have to come to terms with . ''

Lyle Kercher , Meredith 's brother , said : `` Nothing is going to bring Meredith back , nothing will take away the horror of what happened for her . ''

`` The best we can hope for is finally bringing this whole case to a conclusion , having a conviction , and everyone can move on with their lives . ''

A lawyer for Kercher 's family , Francesco Maresca , said in his closing remarks in December during the retrial that Kercher had been forgotten .

`` No one remembers Meredith , while the two defendants write books , speak to the media and earn money , '' Maresca said .

When Knox made the media rounds to promote her memoir in May 2013 , Kercher 's sister said the family was not interested in reading the book .

`` We are not interested in this book just like so many others about the case and we will not read it , '' Stephanie Kercher said in a statement . `` I have no doubts that on the other side there is a story of pain and loss and enormous mistrust but in the end it is also one of hope and the opportunity to live life . Something Meredith will never have and something we can never share with her . Meredith is the victim in this tragic case . ''

Despite the focus on Knox 's endless travails , Kercher 's family and friends remain determined to keep her memory alive .

`` I want people to remember Meredith for the good times she had in Perugia , not just the horrible ending , '' said Natalie Hayward , who got to know Kercher before her death .

`` She was very generous and open and had a very big heart . She was a very fulfilled human being . She was happy and talked about her family all the time . She had lived life to the full . That gives me a great deal of comfort . ''

Kercher was just 21 when she was killed in the villa she rented with Knox in the central Italian university town of Perugia . Her body was found semi-naked and her throat had been slashed .

Kercher was a third-year student at the University of Leeds focusing on European Studies when she got the chance to live in Perugia for a year to study European Politics and Italian .

She worked at Gatwick Airport , near her home in Coulsdon , a dormitory town south of London , to raise money for the trip .

Her father John told the Daily Telegraph : `` She fought so hard to get out there . There were quite a few setbacks but she was determined to go and kept persisting and eventually got what she wanted . ''

Her family later described how she was `` excited at the prospect of spending the year studying there to improve her language skills , make new friends and immerse herself in the culture . She was pursuing her dream . ''

She moved into a shared apartment with Knox but tensions mounted between the two young women , according to Hayward , who met Kercher in September 2007 .

Hayward told the Sunday Telegraph in 2011 that Kercher , known to her friends as `` Mez , '' became `` frustrated '' by Knox 's refusal to do cleaning and was unhappy that her flatmate kept a sex toy on open display in a bathroom cabinet .

Kercher , the youngest of four children , had a good sense of humor , according to her family , and `` a sense of the ridiculous . '' While growing up she was interested in poetry , gymnastics and ballet .

Her India-born mother Arline gave an interview to Italian television show Porta a Porta in September 2011 in which she described Meredith 's love of life .

She said her daughter was a `` very loving child , a very sweet girl . '' She said : `` She was always ready to help you . I will never , ever forget her . ''

Her father , a freelance journalist who wrote a book about his daughter -- `` Meredith '' -- described her as a `` beautiful , intelligent and caring girl whom everyone loved '' in a story for the Daily Mail newspaper , before the book 's release .

`` I hope our telling the world about the enchanting , generous , kind person that Meredith was can help those whose lives she touched , '' he wrote . `` I also hope this book might help to keep Meredith 's case in the spotlight , and , in some small way , to keep alive the hope that we might yet know the truth about her death . ''

John Kercher wrote about the moment he learned the British student killed in Perugia was his daughter . He 'd spoken to her the day before .

`` I drop the phone , '' he wrote in Britain 's Daily Mirror newspaper . `` I do n't believe it and think there must be a mistake . But I know it 's probably true . I ca n't cry . I 'm numb with shock . ''

He also told about hearing that some of Meredith 's friends planned to lay flowers at her old school after her death .

Expecting just a few , he and Arline arrived to find more than 70 people , some having come from around the country . `` It 's unbelievably touching , '' John Kercher recalled . A trust fund had been set up to support the Kercher family 's fight for justice .

`` Meredith is not only a terrible loss to her family and friends , she is also a huge loss to the world , '' he said .

Richard Ottaway , the member of parliament for Coulsden , was taken aback by Meredith 's funeral at Croydon Minster . `` It was packed and overflowing , '' he told CNN . `` It was quite clear Meredith was a popular girl ... so many friends there . It was the perhaps moving service I have ever been to . ''

The priest who took the service described how Meredith 's parents dealt with that emotionally charged day . `` They were very , very courageous , '' said Canon Colin Boswell , vicar of Croydon . `` They had great dignity and calm sort of dignity which they maintained right up until now . ''

The Kercher family , who were not in court Wednesday , have said that if Knox 's conviction is confirmed , they want authorities in the U.S. to extradite her to Italy , according to Britain 's Press Association . However , as it stands , it is uncertain whether this will happen .

Francesco Maresca , the Kercher family lawyer , said : `` The interest of the family is to arrive to the end of this trial . They want to be able to remember Meredith outside of the court room . ''
