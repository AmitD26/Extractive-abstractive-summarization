The doctor had come to my bedside that morning and told me that Phoenix had suffered through a difficult night . But that did n't remotely prepare me for what I now witnessed . Alarms were ringing , the numbers on his monitors plummeting . All the while , my beautiful boy lay there , apparently peaceful , as chaos surrounded him . What frightened me most was that nobody rushed to his side . This state of frenzy , it seemed , was the status quo for our boy , and it was only my husband , Adam , and I who were distraught .

Phoenix was just three days old . I had developed preeclampsia during my pregnancy and spent the last several weeks in the hospital , desperately trying to keep him inside and growing . Finally , at 27 weeks , my body decided that it could do no more . The doctors rushed me to the operating room , my frightened husband at my side , and delivered our tiny baby by Cesarean section . He was one pound , 12 ounces and just 12 inches long . Although he was very early and very small , I believed in him . I knew that he would thrive .

Now Adam and I sat at his bedside . After what felt like forever but was only a few minutes , the nurse approached us . She discussed some of Phoenix 's challenges and went to get his doctor . We waited , choking back fear and praying for a miracle .

When the doctor came in , she was calm and gentle . I can not remember her name or her face . But what I remember is this : She began to describe to us the difficulties that Phoenix had faced in the last eight hours , the hours during which I had slept peacefully , aided by pain medicine and a false sense of security . He had suffered an intra-ventricular hemorrhage , or IVH , which is bleeding in the ventricles of the brain . There are four types , or grades , of severity , the doctor said , and she began to explain the complications related to each type .

I remember , too , how time warped as she talked on and on about the types . It was like a trick they do in movies , clock hands racing while someone drones in slow motion . Each time she described a grade , I expected her to stop and tell us that this was the type of IVH that Phoenix had had . But she kept going . At last , she mentioned a grade 4 hemorrhage , and she swallowed hard around the words . Fleetingly , my heart ached for this doctor who had to deliver such news to us , who had to tell us about the permanent damage that this hemorrhage was causing our son .

When she was finally , mercifully finished telling us what Phoenix was up against , we just sat there in shock . She gently explained that we could take time to make some decisions about how we would like to proceed with treatment and left us with our son . In the quiet of the newborn intensive care unit , I could feel the sobs building inside me . `` Hurry , '' I begged my husband as he wheeled me back to my room .

Once there , we both collapsed , allowing ourselves to release the grief behind this closed door . It did n't seem possible that this baby could fail , not this little boy who had spent the last many weeks dancing joyfully on my bladder . Not the feisty guy who had such bursts of energy inside my belly each day . Not our son , whom we had named years in advance , after the power of being renewed by fire . And , yet , here we were .

As I was lying in my hospital bed in the weeks before Phoenix was born , I had often talked to him . I told him my fears about his health . I told him about my love for him . I cried many , many tears . One of my biggest fears , I told him , was that he would be born and spend hours being poked with needles and feeling nothing but anguish . While he still kicked inside me , I told him that if he needed to let go , if he was n't strong enough for this life , I could handle it . Especially if it meant that he could avoid being in pain . It was n't going to be that way .

Adam and I had never really discussed the worst possibilities for our son , but we had decided a while back that whatever happened , we would be the ones to decide how Phoenix 's care proceeded . Now was the time to face that decision .

While Phoenix still kicked inside me , I told him that if he needed to let go , if he was n't strong enough for this life , I could handle it . Especially if it meant that he could avoid being in pain .

What we both knew was that we loved this little boy more than anything we had ever known before . We discussed the diagnosis we had been given and what that would mean for his , and our , future . And I knew this : My greatest fear for Phoenix was right before me , coming true inside these walls where life-and-death choices were made every day .

The truth is , it did n't take long for Adam and me to decide that what we wanted was to keep our son comfortable . I thought of his tiny body in the incubator , respirator in place , blood-pressure cuff pumping , needles and catheters and scans and transfusions . It was not how we wanted him to live . What we wanted more than anything was for him to live the time that he had left knowing our touch , knowing our love , feeling that we were with him , no matter what .

We called the few people we could bear to speak with and shared the news . We cried and cried and tried to hold each other , though I was too sore from my own surgery and weeks of bed rest to move into any comfortable position in my husband 's arms . When we were calm , we went back to Phoenix 's bedside .

The doctor returned , and we told her that we did not want to continue his life support . We asked her if we could find a place to sit and rock him , a private place to say our good-byes and hold him tight . She did n't question our decision for one moment . She just ushered us to an empty room and told us that she was going to unhook the baby from his machinery .

When the nurse brought my baby back into the room , it was the hardest moment of my life . Harder than hearing his diagnosis . Harder than making the decision to stop treatment . Here he was , our sweet little peanut , without any of the lifesaving equipment that he needed to keep him alive . Still , he rested peacefully in his tiny blanket and hat .

When the nurse handed him to me for the first time , I fully realized how little , how light he really was . My husband and I held him and rocked him , petted him and cooed over him as all new parents do . The only difference being that our hello would also serve as a goodbye .

I will always treasure the minutes we spent together in that room . I willed my son to know that no matter how hard it was , I was right here . I would not leave his side . Most of those momentsâ € '' his final momentsâ € '' I keep inside my heart and have never shared with anyone . They belong to us , Phoenix and Adam and me .

The nurse stayed close by , and , eventually , she let us know that Phoenix had passed . His tiny , little spirit had flown from a body that could n't hold him . There was no sign from him , ever , in either life or death . Just peaceful release .

In the days and years since his death , I have turned it all over and over in my head . I no longer ask why . Things , bad things , happen to people every day . I have doubted our decision at times , but I know that those thoughts come from fear . In my heart of hearts , I know that we did the best thing we could for our child . And only with this distance can I see that , perhaps , he did the best he could for me , too .

By not listening to me and letting go before his birth , he gave me the gift of being his mother . And that is a gift I would never give up , no matter how much pain came along with the package .
