Four walls , a bed and a slop bowl . If prison represents physical confinement and a loss of every personal freedom , what does imprisonment of the mind feel like ?

`` Unbearable '' according to Marcus Urban , a German footballer who gave up his chosen profession -- his `` first love '' -- because of homophobia in the game .

In a sport infamous for macho bravado on the pitch and anti-gay chants in the terraces , Urban was battling an unspeakable shame .

A promising talent , Urban in his youth played alongside and against future German national team stars Robert Enke , Bernd Schneider and Thomas Linke .

`` To play soccer basically means to rejoice in life , '' Urban told CNN . `` I never stopped playing football . It has always been my first love and it will remain forever . ''

But , as is the case with so many first loves , Urban 's left him with a heartbreak which was almost too much to bear .

The young midfielder , born and raised in East Germany in the 1970s and 80s in the days before reunification with West Germany in 1990 , dreamed of representing his country -- but he was living an exhausting double life .

On the surface he was a rising football star , but beneath he was a man coming to terms with his homosexuality .

`` I hid 24 hours a day , I adjusted , '' explained Urban , who was terrified of being `` outed '' in a sport which today has just one openly gay professional player in Europe .

`` It was an almost unbearable pain , a great sacrifice , a painful price to pay to achieve my goal of becoming a professional footballer .

`` Constantly hearing gay used as a curse word like s ** t , made me think , ` Of course , I 'm s ** t. ' I spent 50 % of my energy trying to hide , so a maximum of 50 % of my energy was available for football . It was n't fair .

`` I kept thinking , ` I can not do this anymore , I do n't want to . What is going on ? ' Nobody was there to help me . ''

Urban 's love affair with football began in 1978 , when he joined East German club Motor Weimar at the age of seven before moving to Rot-Weiss Erfurt in 1984 .

He trained twice a day with his new team and looked capable of achieving his ambition of playing for the German national team , winning a youth championship with Rot-Weiss in 1985 .

His reputation was growing and he was called up to East Germany 's youth team in 1986 . Urban went on to make over 100 appearances for Rot-Weiss ' senior team in the German second division .

But rather than marking the start of his rise to the top of German football , Urban 's spell in Erfurt proved to be the peak of a career cut short by fear , insecurity and self-loathing .

`` By my early 20s I was burned out , '' he said .

`` I realized that if I became a professional footballer , I would suffer as a man . I chose freedom over a constructed prison .

`` Talent is not enough . You need the will , physical fitness , good luck and a tough mentality . But what if you hide 24 hours a day because you are gay ?

`` The fear and pain robbed me of my energy because I was constantly thinking of what to say , how to act so people might think I was heterosexual . ''

When it became clear he was in the twilight of his playing career , Urban finally summoned the courage to open up to one of his teammates following a switch to provincial club SC 1903 Weimar in 1991 .

`` I told only one player , in Weimar at the end of my career -- and precisely for this reason , '' said Urban . `` He found it interesting that I was gay , I was one of his best friends on the team . ''

Compared to other areas of society , the football profession is statistically lacking in openly gay players .

Former United States national team player Robbie Rogers recently announced he was gay on the same day he retired from the sport , while Sweden-based Anton Hysen is currently the only openly `` out '' player in Europe .

Justin Fashanu 's tragic story is the last time a top-flight player has been so open .

The Englishman committed suicide in 1998 , aged 37 -- just eight years after announcing that he was gay . He had become the first Â£ 1 million black player when he joined Nottingham Forest in 1981 .

Speaking at a sports forum in Berlin last September , German chancellor Angela Merkel urged gay players to feel confident enough to `` come out . ''

Her comments came following an article in a German magazine in which an anonymous gay Bundesliga player said the fear of added media attention was the reason why he had n't announced his sexuality .

German second division team FC St. Pauli placed itself on the front line of football 's battle with homophobia during a match with Paderborn .

Fans of the club , formerly run by openly gay president Corny Littmann , staged a demonstration against discrimination which included brightly-colored posters and a banner reading , `` Football is everything -- even gay . ''

Basketballer Jason Collins recently made history by becoming the first openly gay NBA player , while the NHL has drawn plaudits for its anti-homophobia work .

Fifteen years on from Fashanu 's suicide , with other sports such as rugby and basketball setting a precedent and with the NFL reportedly closer than ever to having a homosexual player , is the beautiful game ready for a high-profile gay star ?

`` Why not ? '' replied Urban . `` It is a great opportunity for the football world to show now that it is ready . Associations and clubs can come out as ` gay-friendly ' . Then players , officials , coaches , referees and so many others will follow .

`` The effects of outings gay footballers will go far beyond football . ''

After years of torment and secrecy , Urban 's coming out proved to be a turning point . With new-found confidence , he was able to pursue a life away from the football pitch .

Urban has told his story in the book `` Hidden Player : The story of a gay footballer , '' while he is also something of a life coach , consulting with organizations -- including football associations -- on issues of diversity and integration .

`` I was so glad to finally be myself and I finally knew what the years of torment had been about , '' he explained . `` With the energy and force of liberation I went on the front foot , on the offensive .

`` I work as a personal coach and diversity consultant . I work for organizations and I help them to appreciate the dimensions of age , ethnicity , gender , religion and even sexual orientations . ''

With a wealth of personal and professional expertise on the subject of `` coming out , '' Urban is in a unique position to offer advice to any player in a similar situation to the one he found himself in two decades ago .

According to Urban , former Wales international rugby player Gareth Thomas -- who told the world he was gay in 2009 -- has set out the perfect blueprint for others to follow .

`` He proceeded in stages , '' Urban said of Thomas . `` First he outed himself to his wife . Then he told his coach and then two players . After each step he received positive feedback .

`` He was told by everyone that he was still the same person . This enabled him to increase his self-esteem until it was big enough to go public . He then got exceptionally positive feedback . ''

An openly gay football star would be a turning point not just for the sport , declares Urban , but also for society as a whole .

Football , he suggests , stretches into areas where attitudes towards homosexuality have so far proved difficult to change .

`` Football is the only way to tackle this topic comprehensively , '' he said . `` Very many people are geared towards football role models on television .

`` If world soccer stars accepted their homosexuality , young people would question having to be so rough and macho .

`` The result would be a social change that goes far beyond football . ''

Urban is now comfortable with his sexuality , but he is not impervious to the homophobic barbs he often overhears in general conversation .

'' ` F **** , f **** t ' , any negative way of calling someone gay , '' replies Urban when asked which insults he hears . `` I was constantly affected by insults . Although it is not said to me directly it concerns me , even today . ''

`` But today , with more self-esteem and confidence , I look at homophobia from the perspective of a personal coaches and diversity consultant . Sometimes I have to laugh about it too , because it 's stupid and ridiculous . ''

Self-esteem and confidence have helped Urban to heal the wounds inflicted by his first love , football .

He is once more besotted with the sport , playing with and against gay-friendly teams from across the globe .

It might not be playing at a World Cup with the German national team , but Urban is now back on the pitch , this time with his head held high .

`` I really wanted to play for the men 's national team , '' reflected Urban . `` It makes me happy to have made something out of my experiences .

`` For years I could never play football in the stadium . I saw the grass and could not stand being a spectator rather than being down playing on the pitch . I had regrets , I was sad and angry .

`` After I came out I was so much more confident . I played football at university , in a team consisting predominantly of gay footballers against other gay teams from Paris , London or New York and Washington .

`` Today , I play at a club in Hamburg , accepted by everyone and my teammates are proud of me , I think . It is a great experience to play football and to feel free , pure happiness .

`` There are certainly more boring lives than mine . ''
