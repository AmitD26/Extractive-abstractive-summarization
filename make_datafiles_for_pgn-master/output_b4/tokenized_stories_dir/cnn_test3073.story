-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This World Cup is no protector of reputations .

Nor is it anything other than steadfast in its refusal to reveal any clear favorite to hoist the 20th incarnation of football 's prime feast .

Argentina certainly counts as one of a pool of nations capable of capturing glory , but its performances so far have shown a worrying brittleness .

Still , it just keeps on winning and can now look forward to a last eight clash with either the United States or Belgium .

The latest side to come close to toppling La Albiceleste was Switzerland , but just like Bosnia and Herzegovina , Iran and Nigeria before them , one moment of magic was all that separated the two in Tuesday 's penultimate last-16 clash .

With the contest a matter of seconds away from penalties , the decisive blow was conjured between two men who operate at opposite ends of Spain 's fiercest rivalry .

Lionel Messi , of Barcelona , drove deep into Swiss territory and swept the ball wide for Real Madrid 's Angel Di Maria , who stroked confidently into the corner .

Yet there was still more agony for Switzerland to endure .

With even its goalkeeper playing as a striker , a point-blank header from Blerim Dzemaili crashed against the post before squirming wide in the 122nd minute .

Argentina 's fevered reaction upon the final whistle underscored a palpable sense of relief that its bandwagon continues to edge closer to a first triumph since 1986 .

`` I was nervous towards the end because we could n't score and any mistake could have knocked us out , '' Argentina captain Messi told a press conference .

`` The minutes were passing by and we did n't want the match to go to penalties . We were suffering , but we had a special play , I passed to Angel and now we can celebrate . ''

With Switzerland keen to limit any slice of space for Argentina 's array of attacking talent to operate in , the opening stages of the game in Sao Paulo were predictably tight .

There was a glimpse of goal for Messi a little under the quarter hour mark but his stabbed cross-shot was pocketed by Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio .

Once the contest had settled into a pattern , Argentina 's failure to engage an powerful offensive arsenal afforded Switzerland a growing confidence which reflected in its play .

The game 's first gilt-edged opening arrived on 28 minutes , and it was one carved out by two players who operate in Germany 's Bundesliga .

Bayern Munich star Xherdan Shaqiri found midfielder Granit Xhaka , who plays for Borussia MÃ ¶ nchengladbach , with a pullback but his low , powerful drive was repelled by Sergio Romero .

Paris Saint-Germain star Ezequiel Lavezzi tested Benaglio from striker Gonzalo Higuain 's knockdown as Argentina looked to reassert its dominance .

Shaqiri was again the provider when a sharp counter attack released Josip Drmic in on goal .

With Romero caught in two minds whether to hunt down the through ball , the Bayer Leverkusen striker looked to take advantage with a chip but got the execution horribly wrong .

Argentina 's stopper continued to look uncertain after the interval as he spilled a Shaqiri free kick from range and had to scramble to prevent the ball from escaping his penalty area .

As the hour mark loomed Argentina rediscovered a glimmer of its attacking brio , with Switzerland forced to retreat further and further towards its own goal .

As red-shirted legs became heavy La Albiceleste pressed for the breakthrough and Benaglio was prompted into action when Marcos Rojo 's attempted cross crept towards the net .

Higuain then rose highest to power a header towards goal but Benaglio was alert to acrobatically divert the Napoli striker 's effort over the bar .

Perhaps inspired by the goal of the tournament so far -- James Rodriguez 's explosive volley in Colombia 's last-16 win over Uruguay -- Messi attempted his own , firing narrowly over the bar .

It looked as though Messi 's moment had arrived on 78 minutes as he picked up the ball on the edge of the box and jinked onto his wand of a left foot .

But just as the thousands of Argentina fans inside the stadium prepared to hail their saviour once more , Benaglio flung out his right hand to make a superb save and ensure the game remained goalless .

As Algeria had done the previous evening , Switzerland burrowed away with the prospect of an extra half an hour the prize at the end of a long , weary tunnel .

And despite a few nervous moments , when the right weight of pass or split second decision could have fashioned a late winner , the Swiss saw it through to the end of 90 minutes .

The extra half hour continued in the same vain , the Swiss content to soak up pressure in a congested final third and look for counter attacking opportunities .

Benaglio was called upon to save from a glancing header from Rodrigo Palacio while Messi was lucky to escape a booking after a tangle with Valon Behrami .

Di Maria , who enjoyed such a stellar end of season with European Champions League winners Real Madrid , cut a profligate figure through the game , but tested Benaglio with a stinging drive from range .

And his big moment would arrive , as so many of Argentina 's have , via the boots of Messi .

The three-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner drove towards a flagging Swiss defense before offloading to Di Maria , whose precise finish back across Benaglio found the far corner .

That sparked delirium among the hordes of traveling Argentina fans but its side 's leaky rearguard almost offered up another twist in the game 's dying stages .

With Benaglio installed as center forward , a succession of crosses flowed into Argentina 's penalty area .

From one , midfielder Blerim Dzemaili found himself unmarked and five yards from goal when the ball arrived at his eye level .

But his header cannoned off the post with Romero stranded and struck him once more , only for the ball to trickle wide of the upright .

Shaqiri then won a free kick right on the edge of the penalty area as nerves at both ends shredded yet further , but once the wall had repelled his effort the final whistle sounded .

Coach Alejandro Sabella stuck to the classic football adage of taking one game at a time . `` Our dream is only to work for the next match and try to move onto the semifinals , '' he said .

`` We do not look beyond that . To do so would be a mistake as we have already seen good teams like Spain , Uruguay , Italy and England have gone out . ''

Argentina limps on , but winning ugly wo n't matter a jot to its players or fans should a first World Cup in 24 years result from it .
