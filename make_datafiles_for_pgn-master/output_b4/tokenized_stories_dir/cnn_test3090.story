At least 40 people in northern Nigeria were killed Wednesday in two suicide blasts targeting a renowned Muslim cleric and an opposition politician , prompting a round-the-clock curfew to prevent chaos .

`` We have recorded two suicide blasts today in the city , which have killed 40 people , '' Kaduna State Police Commissioner Umar Shehu said of the blasts that also injured scores of people .

Twenty-five people were killed in the first blast , which targeted the motorcade of Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi , the revered leader of the Tijjaniyya Sufi order in Nigeria , after he left the finale of an annual Koranic conference .

The second blast occurred about two hours later and killed at least 15 people , officials said . It targeted Muhammadu Buhari , the former military ruler and opposition presidential candidate in the 2007 and 2011 elections .

Both targeted figures escaped unhurt .

Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan condemned the bombings and `` commiserates with all those who were injured in the twin bombings in this holy month of Ramadan , which defy the tenets of Islam , '' adviser Reuben Abati said .

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said America `` deplores today 's twin bombings in Kaduna , Nigeria , which targeted Shaykh Dahiru Usman Bauchi , one of the country 's most respected Muslim scholars , during the month of Ramadan . '' She added that reports cited how former head of state Buhari may have also been targeted .

Kaduna Gov. Mukhtar Ramalan Yero imposed a 24-hour curfew on the city of Kuduna `` to enable security agencies -LRB- to -RRB- restore normalcy , '' spokesman Ahmed Maiyaki said .
