Ovell Smith Krell has spent the better part of her 84 years wondering how her brother died at a Florida reform school in 1940 , and where he may be buried . Today , she appears to be one step closer to finding out .

Florida 's attorney general filed a petition on Tuesday asking a state court to approve the exhumation of an unknown number of bodies believed to be buried at the now-defunct school in the Florida panhandle town of Marianna .

`` The deaths that occurred at Dozier School for Boys in Marianna are cloaked in mystery , and the surviving family members deserve a thorough examination of the site , '' stated Attorney General Pam Bondi , who filed the petition on behalf of Jackson County 's medical examiner .

`` I am committed to doing everything within my power to support investigative efforts to help resolve unanswered questions and bring closure to the families who lost loved ones . ''

Krell -- who believes her brother , Owen , was buried on the school 's property -- says she 's overjoyed at the news .

`` We know they 're there and once they start digging , then maybe we can find remains and I hope one of them is my brother , '' she told CNN . `` I want his remains brought up , and if I get my brother I would be ecstatic . ''

Mystery surrounds graves at boys ' reform school

It 's unclear when the state court will rule on Bondi 's petition , although a decision could come in the next couple of weeks . If the exhumations are approved , the bodies would be examined at the University of South Florida at the direction of Jackson County 's medical examiner , Michael Hunter . Forensic investigators hope to start the process before the summer rainy season .

Researchers plan to use DNA from surviving family members to help identify the remains and return them to their relatives .

For years , stories and allegations of beatings , torture and murder have surrounded the century-old school . State authorities have said in the past that there were 31 burial sites at the school , and a 2009 state investigation found no wrongdoing in connection with those deaths .

Investigators now say there 's evidence that 98 boys died at the school , and some of them may be buried in the 50 graves that forensic investigators have recently found on school grounds .

In the wake of those findings , U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , asked the Department of Justice to investigate . Nelson called Bondi 's petition for exhumations `` a critical step forward to bring closure to the families . ''

The mystery surrounding the graves first made headlines in 2008 when Florida 's then-governor , Charlie Crist , ordered an investigation after a group of men , known as `` the White House Boys , '' came forward with stories of how they were beaten with leather straps by school administrators inside a small , white building on school property .

Robert Straley , who spent about 10 months at the school in the 1960s for allegedly stealing a car , said he was taken to the `` white house '' on his very first day .

`` I came out of there in shock , and when they hit you , you went down a foot into the bed , and so hard , I could n't believe . I did n't know what they were hitting you with , '' Straley said .

Former school administrator Troy Tidwell , a one-armed man who some former students accused of beating them , has said in a deposition that `` spankings '' took place at the school but denied anyone was ever beaten or killed .

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement 's 2009 report said most of the 31 boys buried in the school 's cemetery were killed in a 1914 fire at the facility , while others died in a 1918 flu outbreak .

At the time , the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys -- who it said died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents -- were buried , blaming poorly kept school records . FDLE closed the case due to the lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct , and no charges were filed .

Investigators say the records do not explain why the boys were buried on school property in the first place . The boys who attended the school were considered `` young offenders '' of state law and were placed in the school in order to be `` separated from older more vicious associates , '' according to the 2009 report citing the Florida Children 's Commission of 1953 .

Florida 's Department of Juvenile Justice closed the school in 2011 , blaming budget cuts .

Ovell Krell said her family was told that her brother Owen ran away from the reform school , got pneumonia , and died underneath a house in town .

`` They said that the body was so decomposed , you would n't be able to identify him ... they took him straight out to the school and buried him , '' she told CNN .

But Owen 's classmate told the family a different story , Krell said .

According to Krell , the boy said as he and Owen tried to escape , `` my brother was running out across a field , an open field , and there was three men shooting at him , with rifles . ''

`` I believe to this day that they shot my brother that night , and I think they probably killed him and brought him back to the school and buried him , '' she said .

Today , she simply wants to bring him home . She 's 84 now , and says she 's running out of time .

`` My mom never got a good night 's sleep the rest of her life after Owen went missing , '' she said . `` I 'd make sure he 's put with my mom and dad . It will probably be their first good night 's sleep in over 70 years . ''
