Early Monday , gunfire and rocket explosions that lasted for about an hour were heard near the presidential palace in the capital , Bissau , according to local media . Looting was later reported at the presidential palace .

Army spokesman Zamora Induta said an aide to the president was killed during the gunfire .

He added that the gunmen remained at-large and that a 10-member-commission will manage the army until a new chief of staff is named .

The army , he said , will remain neutral .

Gen. Tagme Na Waie , chief of Guinea-Bissau 's military , was killed in a bomb explosion in his office Sunday , according to local news reports . Five other high-ranking military officials were wounded , two of them critically .

After the attack , all local radio stations were ordered to immediately suspend their programs .

The United Nations said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed dismay over the killings .

`` The secretary-general strongly condemns these violent acts , which have occurred soon after successful legislative elections which paved the way for enhanced U.N. support to the country 's peace-building efforts , '' the statement said .

The tiny west African country , located between Guinea and Senegal , has a population of 1.5 million and is considered one of the five poorest countries in the world , according to the CIA Factbook .

The country has been in a near-constant state of political upheaval since independence from Portugal in 1974 .

In 1980 , Vieira became president after a military coup . He was accused of purging political rivals and suppressing dissent , but several coup attempts throughout the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him .

In 1994 , the country held its first free elections , and Vieira was elected president . He held the post for five years , until a military mutiny ousted him , and the country plunged into civil war .

Successor Kumba Yala took office in 2000 . He also was unseated in a military coup after three years .

Yala 's ouster paved the way for Vieira to run for office again . In 2005 , he was re-elected president , pledging to pursue economic development and national reconciliation .
