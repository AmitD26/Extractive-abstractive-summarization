-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a number that even astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is having a hard time wrapping his brilliant mind around .

His Christmas Day tweet commemorating the birthday of Isaac Newton was retweeted more than 69,000 times as of this writing , making it the most popular of his Twitter career so far -- and , arguably , his most controversial .

`` On this day long ago , a child was born who , by age 30 , would transform the world . Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec 25 , 1642 , '' the StarTalk host tweeted .

He followed it up with a nod to the commercialization of Christmas : `` Merry Christmas to all . A Pagan holiday -LRB- BC -RRB- becomes a Religious holiday -LRB- AD -RRB- . Which then becomes a Shopping holiday -LRB- USA -RRB- . '' By then , he was on a roll . Earlier in the day , he tweeted , `` QUESTION : This year , what do all the world 's Muslims and Jews call December 25th ? ANSWER : Thursday . ''

His comments drew criticism and name-calling from various corners of the internet . `` Overly reductive , deliberately cynical and unnecessarily provocative , '' one person said on Twitter .

Another accused him of `` trolling Christmas today to show you how smart he is . ''

Tyson 's response to the controversy ? `` Imagine a world in which we are all enlightened by objective truths rather than offended by them . ''

Later Friday , Tyson pondered `` My Most Retweeted Tweet '' in a Facebook post . He did not defend or disavow his comments . Instead , in true scientific form , he attempted to quantify their popularity compared to previous tweets .

`` My sense in this case is that the high rate of re-tweeting , is not to share my enthusiasm of this fact , but is driven by accusations that the tweet is somehow anti-Christian , '' he wrote . `` If a person actually wanted to express anti-Christian sentiment , my guess is that alerting people of Isaac Newton 's birthday would appear nowhere on the list . ''

According to his calculations , his average retweet rate falls between 2,500 and 3,500 . `` Fun '' tweets can reach 10,000 while `` boring tweets barely break 1,000 . '' The Newton Christmas Day tweet had surpassed 62,000 retweets by the time he posted his Facebook note on Friday . By Saturday evening , it had reached more than 69,000 .

`` I wonder if you are as astonished by this fact as I am , '' he wrote .

For example , he directly referenced Jesus in previous tweets that did not spread nearly as far . By way of example , he offered the following , which earned more than 13,000 retweets : `` Some claim the USA is a Christian nation , compelling me to wonder which assault rifle Jesus would choose : the AR-15 or AK-47 . ''

He also addressed criticism that according to the calendar in use during Newton 's time , his birthday would fall on January 4 , 1643 .

`` One last bit of historical fact . All of England was celebrating Christmas the day Newton was born . But the Gregorian Calendar -LRB- an awesomely accurate reckoning of Earth 's annual time -RRB- , introduced in 1584 by Pope Gregory , was not yet adopted in Great Britain . To do so required removing ten days from the calendar -- excess time that had accumulated over the previous 16 centuries from the mildly flawed Julian Calendar , introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 BC . These remnants of the turbulent schism between the Anglican and Catholic churches meant that Catholic Christendom was celebrating Christmas ten days earlier than anybody was in England . ''

Tyson closed his note with holiday wishes and a warning that he 'll be tweeting about Earth 's perihelion in the New Year .

`` Just a head 's up in case people want to avert their eyes over that one . ''
