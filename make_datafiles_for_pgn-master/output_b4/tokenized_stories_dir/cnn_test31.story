-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Spain remain on course to retain their European Championship crown after seeing off a lackluster France 2-0 in the third Euro 2012 quarterfinal at the Donbass Arena , Donetsk on Saturday .

Xabi Alonso celebrated his 100th appearance for his country with two goals in either half to seal a convincing win for the world champions .

`` There 's a lot of personal satisfaction in getting to 100 caps and of course getting on the scoresheet , '' Alonso said .

`` We are now in the semis and of course all the games at this stage are life and death . We did n't have that many chances but we had the match totally under control , '' he added .

Victory over France sets up a showdown with arch rivals Portugal next Wednesday .

With coach Vicente Del Bosque once again opting to pack the midfield and leave striker Fernando Torres on the bench , Spain quickly assumed control of the game .

It fell to Andres Iniesta to unlock the opposition defense in the 19th minute .

Barcelona 's midfield maestro threaded a pass through to Jordi Alba who jinked past a flailing Mathieu Debuchy before squaring a cross which Alonso headed home with power and accuracy .

For the remainder of the half , France offered little in reply .

Franck Ribery 's industry down the left came to nothing . Yohan Cabaye 's 31st minute free kick was turned over the bar by Iker Casillas and Karim Bezema 's shooting remained frustratingly errant .

Spain resumed the second half where they finished the first -- controlling the game at a canter with France chasing the game .

Debuchy went close with a header in the 60th minute , but France could n't capitalize on the few openings they created in the second period .

Coach Laurent Blanc sent on substitute 's Samir Nasri , Jeremy Menez and Olivier Giroud but it failed to turn the tide in favor of the three-time European champions .

Anthony Reveillere 's foul on substitute Pedro in the 90th minute handed Spain a late penalty and a chance to put the result beyond doubt .

Alonso stepped up to take the spot kick , sent goalkeeper Hugo Lloris the wrong way and keep Spain marching on in their bid to land a third consecutive major trophy .
