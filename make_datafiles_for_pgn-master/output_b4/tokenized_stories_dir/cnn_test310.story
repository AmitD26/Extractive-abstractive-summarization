-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seventeen Pakistani soldiers who were kidnapped last week are shown beheaded in a video released by the Taliban .

A senior Pakistani military official confirmed to CNN that the bodies shown in the video , their identifications flashed before the camera as evidence , indeed belonged to members of the Pakistani army and a Pakistani paramilitary force .

Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan provided the video , which restates the militants ' goals -- to sever Pakistan 's alliance with the United States and to bring sharia law to Pakistan .

The names of the dead are recited in the video .

`` We are not the enemies of Pakistan and its people . In fact , we are enemies of the infidels and the democratic system that has been imposed upon us , '' the video says .

The Pakistani military official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media , said the soldiers were kidnapped last Friday .

The soldiers were on a routine patrol in the Upper Dir district of Pakistan , near the Afghan border , when more than 100 militants who crossed the border from Afghanistan attacked , the official said .

Fifteen militants were killed in the fight , but the 17 soldiers were captured , he said .

The militants , who belong to the Pakistani Taliban and other groups , then crossed with their prisoners back to Afghanistan , the official said .

Militants based in Afghanistan have killed more than 100 Pakistani soldiers in cross-border attacks since 2010 , the official said .

`` It was very sad but it wo n't demoralize our troops , '' he said .

The official said that NATO and the Afghan government have `` badly failed '' at stopping militants from entering Pakistan .
