-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On a cold morning in February , 10 days after undergoing in vitro fertilization , Carolyn Savage lay in bed at her Ohio home waiting for the results of her pregnancy test .

Sean and Carolyn Savage with daughter Mary Kate -LRB- now 18 months -RRB- and sons Ryan , left , and Andrew .

Time was moving slowly . It was getting late and the call from the fertility clinic should have come by lunchtime .

`` We were waiting and waiting and the call seemed like it would never come , '' Savage said .

Finally , around 4 p.m. , Carolyn 's husband , Sean , got the call at work .

`` The doctor told me in one sentence , ` Carolyn is pregnant , but we transferred the wrong embryos , ' '' he said . `` I did n't even know that could physically happen . It was a total shock , totally beyond the realm of possibility . ''

In a tragic mix-up , the Savages say the fertility clinic where Carolyn underwent in vitro fertilization implanted another couple 's embryos into Carolyn 's uterus .

In essence , she had become an unwitting surrogate for another family .

After receiving the news , Sean hung up the phone and drove straight home to tell his wife in person .

`` He walked in and was as white as a sheet , '' Carolyn said . `` He told me , and I think he repeated himself two or three times , and I kept saying ` You 're joking . ' I kept yelling at him stop it but there was nothing on his face indicating a joke . '' Watch more on the Savages and their reaction to their situation ''

Incredulity turned to shock , and when that shock melted , so did the couple 's hope for having another child of their own . At the time , Carolyn was 39 and her chances of having a child naturally after this one were waning .

`` That was the beginning of a very treacherous and emotional journey for us , '' said Sean .

`` I do n't think I 've ever cried so much in my life , '' said Carolyn . `` It was such a nightmare and , in a way , I felt violated . ''

That nightmare was the tipping point on a pregnancy path marred by failed attempts and painful miscarriages .

Only the birth of the Savages ' first child was easy . Their second child , born almost three years later in 1997 , was 10 weeks premature after Carolyn developed life-threatening complications .

`` That was a scary time for us , '' said Carolyn . Yet after she recovered , the Savages consulted with a doctor and remained intent on pursuing future pregnancies .

It would prove exceedingly difficult . Carolyn and Sean tried on and off for 10 years to have another child before turning to IVF . Eventually , Carolyn became pregnant with the couple 's third child , resulting in another difficult pregnancy and premature birth . Their daughter is now a healthy 18-month-old .

With five embryos left over from IVF -- and despite the risks to Carolyn 's health -- the Savages , guided by their religious beliefs , refused to let the unused embryos at the clinic languish .

February 6 was when they thought they had three of their own embryos implanted by the fertility clinic .

Cases like these , while tragic , are exceedingly rare , said Dr. David Adamson , a reproductive endocrinologist and past president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine .

`` There are well in excess of 100,000 embryo transfers every year in this country , '' said Adamson . `` The fact that this happens once in several hundred thousand embryo transfers means the vast majority of the time , systems do protect from this taking place . ''

Groups like the ASRM have a series of strong protocol recommendations for in vitro procedures , such as accurately labeling embryos with the patient 's name and Social Security number , and color-coding samples uniquely to avoid confusion . These identification procedures are not legally mandated , but mistakes can occur if they are not followed , said Adamson . After learning about the mistake , the Savages made two decisions right away : They would not abort the baby , and when he was born , they would relinquish the baby to his DNA parents .

`` They did n't choose this path either , '' Carolyn Savage said of the DNA parents , who declined to speak with media . `` We knew if our embryo had been thawed and negligently put into another woman , we would expect that the child would be returned to us . ''

The Savages are not releasing the name of the clinic where they underwent the IVF procedure , but provided CNN with proof of their reproductive predicament , including results of amniocentesis , a genetic test , indicating the baby Carolyn is carrying is not theirs .

They have met with the baby 's DNA parents , and according to Carolyn the DNA-related mother of the child has come along for one doctor 's appointment .

`` We knew based on legal precedent that custody would be lost , and we agree with that precedent , '' said Carolyn , alluding to a similar case of errant IVF in 1999 in New York in which custody was awarded to the genetic parents .

The Savages are grimly aware that they will have to do the same thing soon . Carolyn is now 35 weeks pregnant and expecting to deliver within the next couple of weeks . It is a countdown fraught with mixed emotions .

`` As the process has gone along , it has been exceptionally difficult imagining this playing out , '' Sean Savage said .

`` There are so many ways to walk into that delivery room , '' Carolyn . `` We 're trying to mentally frame it instead of a loss -- it is a loss , I do n't want to say that it is n't -- but we 're trying to look at it as a gift we 're giving someone else . ''

The Savages say the five embryos they originally had cryogenically preserved at the clinic in Ohio are still unused and have been moved to another clinic in Atlanta , Georgia . They say doctors have advised against any more pregnancies for Carolyn , so they are working out terms with a gestational carrier , or surrogate , to carry some of those embryos for them .

Still , even if a surrogate can eventually help them expand their family , the Savages say that the memory of the child they gave up will always linger .

`` I know that tug will be there every day wondering if the baby 's happy , healthy and OK , '' said Carolyn .

`` We want him to know that it was n't that we did n't want him , but too many people wanted him , '' said Sean . `` We gave him up because it was the right thing to do . ''
