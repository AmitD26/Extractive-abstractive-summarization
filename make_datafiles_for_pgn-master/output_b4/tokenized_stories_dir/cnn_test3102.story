It could be the wedding video to end all wedding videos . There are not many newlyweds who can say they received a call from the President of the United States on their wedding day .

Granted , the President was calling to apologize after the bride and groom -- Natalie Heimel and Ed Mallue Jr. -- were forced to scramble to find an alternate location for their wedding , once they were informed by the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course at Marine Corps Base Hawaii that Obama wanted to play through the site of their nuptials .

`` Listen . Congratulations on your wedding . I feel terrible . Nobody told us , '' Obama told the couple in a video provided to CNN by the bride 's family .

`` If they had just mentioned that they were going to have a wedding on the 16th hole , we would have skipped the 16th hole , '' the President added .

`` I hope the wedding went OK anyway , '' he continued .

In the video , Heimel and Mallue can be seen all dressed up for their big day , hanging on Obama 's every word , and laughing as they carried on a conversation with the President that lasted several minutes .

The wedding was just fine , Mallue and Heimel reassured Obama , who was clearly embarrassed by the mix-up .

`` Thank you very much . It was a blessing in disguise , '' Mallue said .

`` We just went right above the 16th hole . So we were watching you golf , '' Heimel joked about their new wedding site .

Acknowledging he is far from an ace golfer , Obama quipped , `` That must have been kind of painful . ''

`` What did you shoot , Mr. President ? '' Mallue asked .

`` I shot an 84 . If I had skipped the 16th hole , I would have shot a 79 , '' Obama replied .

The conversation then turned to what sounded like an episode of the presidential dating game .

`` How long you been going out ? '' Obama asked .

The couple proceeded to tell Obama they have been dating since 2011 . The military couple , both captains , attended West Point , before moving to Germany where they met . They now live in Hawaii , which led to the President 's next question .

`` Now , the only question is where do you honeymoon when you live in Hawaii ? '' Obama joked .

`` We have n't figured that part out yet , '' Heimel joked .

`` Might be Fort Polk , Louisiana , '' Mallue quipped .

The couple then invited Obama to their reception . Fearing he might cause another wedding mishap , the President respectfully declined .

`` Everybody would have to be magged , '' Obama joked about his security needs . `` Sorry for the change of plans . But sounds like you guys are gon na have a great wedding and at least you will have a good story to tell . ''

`` Congratulations and thank you both for your service , '' Obama added at the end of the call .
