-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A strong storm system Wednesday brought rain and winds that shut down the Statue of Liberty and delayed flights for more than four hours at airports in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast .

Flight times were almost back to normal by late Wednesday .

The wind snapped a large lighted Christmas tree at the South Street Seaport a few blocks from the Brooklyn Bridge , CNN New York affiliate WABC reported . No injuries were reported .

The Statue of Liberty was forced to close at 2 p.m. because of inclement weather , the National Park Service said on Twitter . Weather permitting , the venue was expected to reopen Thursday

Heavy rain triggered flooding in some Eastern states a day after the system raked the Southeast .

`` The flooding is getting way worse '' near Austin , Pennsylvania , said CNN iReporter Marcia , who asked that only her first name be used . `` They are closing down roads . Some people have been evacuated . ... This is worse than the '72 flood , from what I am hearing . ''

The storm system brought flooding and snow to areas around Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , on Wednesday , slowing commuters and prompting some schools to open late , according to CNN affiliate WPXI .

CNN has confirmed that there is a state of emergency in Butler County , Pennsylvania , until at least Thursday morning because of the flooding due to storms from late Tuesday and Wednesday .

During much of the day , ground stops were in effect for New York 's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports because of low clouds and heavy rain , according to CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris .

Flight delays of more than four hours had been reported at the Newark , New Jersey , airport , and delays of more than an hour were reported at airports in Teterboro , New Jersey , and Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .

One person was killed and a second injured Wednesday when high winds caused a tree to fall on a car with two people in it in West Milford , New Jersey , according to the National Weather Service in Upton , New York .

Tracy Gill , another CNN iReporter , awoke to rising waters in Coudersport , Pennsylvania . Gill estimated the water to be about a foot deep and still rising . `` I was unable to leave to pick up my daughter from preschool . The road is pretty much gone , '' Gill said .

On Wednesday , the storm system set its sights on much of the Eastern Seaboard . Severe thunderstorms were possible from the Florida Panhandle north to Maryland , and flash flooding was possible from northern Georgia into Vermont and New Hampshire , according to the National Weather Service .

Also Wednesday , the National Weather Service confirmed that it was a tornado -- packing winds of 130 mph -- that tore through suburban Atlanta , Georgia , on Tuesday , damaging more than 50 homes and a business .

The structures were damaged in Buford , Georgia , in Gwinnett County , by an EF-2 tornado , said Steve Nelson , science and operations officer for the National Weather Service 's forecast office in Peachtree City , Georgia .

`` It was terrifying at the time , '' Edwin Pellicia , resident of a hard-hit Buford subdivision , told CNN affiliate WXIA . `` Now you 're just thankful to be alive . ... Today , you really appreciate the time that you have with family and having your life . ''

At least 56 homes and one business in the area were damaged by the tornado . Twelve of those homes suffered major damage . There were no reported injuries .

One person , a 54-year-old man , died in a traffic accident in Gwinnett County on Tuesday while the storms were moving through , according to the county 's police department . Strong winds associated with the storm apparently caused a tree to break in half and fall on the his vehicle , officials said in a statement .

In Atlanta on Tuesday , the system downed trees and power lines and snarled the afternoon commute , with roads in several areas closed because of flooding .

Video showed damaged roofs and trees in northern Gwinnett County , about 35 miles northeast of downtown Atlanta . A tornado warning had not been issued for the neighborhood where the damage occurred . Footage showed one home missing an exterior corner , with siding and insulation strewn about the area .

`` I was on my way home from work , and the parents were calling us to see if the kids were OK . I knew a tornado hit at Gravel Springs -LSB- Road -RSB- ; I did n't know it was going to be our house , '' resident Erin Birdsong told affiliate WSB .

`` I personally ran into the bathroom , '' resident Ortiz Edwards told affiliate WGCL . `` The whole subdivision is devastated . ''

Rescue crews conducted door-to-door searches to make sure everyone in the area was accounted for . Several families had to find a place to stay overnight , according to WGCL .

`` We 've got pillows and tennis shoes , change of clothes . ... Hopefully -LRB- we 'll -RRB- get back here tomorrow and start the cleanup process , '' resident Ashley Tremblay said .

Pellicia said the upcoming holiday season will be more meaningful to him because of the experience . `` It 's going to look different , but it 's going to mean a whole lot more , '' he told WXIA . In addition , several residents expressed gratitude that no one lost their life , adding that homes can be repaired .

Tornadoes during this time of year can be particularly dangerous because they are fast-moving and obscured by rain and darkness , according to Morris .

In Mississippi , state authorities dispatched emergency crews Tuesday to survey the damage after an onslaught of severe weather that injured at least 32 people , damaged property in 10 counties and cut power .

Four tornadoes classified as EF-2 hit the state , the National Weather Service forecast office in Jackson said Tuesday evening .

Two were in Yazoo County , one slammed Starkville , and the fourth touched down in Raleigh . An EF-2 twister -LRB- on the Enhanced Fujita Tornado Damage Scale -RRB- produces wind gusts , estimated by damage assessments , of 110 to 137 mph , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .

In Attala County , storms destroyed nine mobile homes , injured six people and left parts of the area without power , the service said .

A tornado touched down in Yazoo County on Monday night , causing damage to a courthouse in downtown Yazoo City and tossing debris in a wide area , according to an emergency management spokesman .

The twister touched down about 8:05 p.m. , according to the National Weather Service 's Jackson office .
