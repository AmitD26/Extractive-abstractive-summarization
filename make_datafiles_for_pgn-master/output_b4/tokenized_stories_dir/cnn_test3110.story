The U.S. Department of Labor recently announced that the unemployment rate fell to 8.2 % . That should have been a signal that jobs are coming back and that the economy is about to rebound . But , as many economists say , the numbers fell primarily because unemployed Americans have become so discouraged with trying to find a job that they 've simply quit looking .

Because nearly one-third of the American middle class , mostly families with children , have fallen into poverty or are one paycheck away from poverty , it is paramount that we dissect the root causes of this mass disenfranchisement within the American workforce . This was the motivation behind `` The Poverty Tour : A Call to Conscience , '' our 18-city bus tour that traveled across the country last year . It was designed to bring more attention to the plight of impoverished Americans .

These citizens do not fit the negative stereotypes and propaganda that we 've heard during the Republican presidential primary contests . The candidates who have vowed to cut government subsidies speak of the poor as if their constituents had been exempted from the millions who , despite their middle-class identification and aspirations , now fall beneath the established poverty line .

The people we met are n't lazy or eager to live off so-called government entitlements . We spoke with formerly middle-class parents who were thrust into poverty when one or both lost their salaries . We heard the stories of single mothers and fathers , military veterans and former high-wage employees desperately trying to re-enter a workforce that no longer pays living wages .

Joann Cotton , a 54-year-old Columbus , Mississippi , resident , was one of those faces of poverty we met on the tour . Unemployed for three years , Joann has gone from making `` $ 60,000 a year to less than $ 15,000 overnight . '' Her husband is disabled and dependent on medicines the couple can no longer afford . They rely on food stamps , which , Joann says , `` is depressing as hell . ''

Receiving government aid , however , has not been as depressing as her job search . Joann says she has applied for at least 300 jobs . Even though she can barely afford gas , she drives to the interviews only to learn that the employers want to hire younger candidates at low wages .

The experiences have taken a toll : `` I 've aged 10 years in the three years that I 've been looking for a job , '' Joann told us . `` I want to get a job so I can just relax and exhale ... but I ca n't . After a while you just give up . ''

Like Joann , millions of Americans are just giving up on the possibility of ever rejoining the workforce . These frustrations reflect a reality that is unraveling the American identity . One of the most fundamental dictates in achieving the `` American Dream '' has always been a good job that pays wages decent enough to care for our families , buy a car and a home , and live reasonably comfortable lives .

What has caused so many to quit looking for jobs and , by extension , abandon the American Dream ? We argue that a covenant has been broken with the American people . We live in a society where corporations put profits over people . We march to the beat of political leaders who have decided the richest 1 % of the people in this country deserve generous tax breaks and preferential treatment while most of the 99 % are forced to pay unbalanced shares of the tax burden and live on less and less .

Unemployment has been discussed in sound bites within the framework of the Great Recession . Reporters and pundits pontificate about the housing and home-lending fiasco , the collapse of Wall Street and the amount of construction , manufacturing and government jobs lost as a result of the market 's economic downturn .

Yet economists and politicians propose failed remedies based on rebuilding and rebooting systems that have already dashed the American Dream for many . Economist Peter Morici , for example , suggests dynamic job growth will be sparked by increasing domestic oil production , tackling the trade imbalance with China , relaxing regulations for big businesses and curbing health care mandates .

Not only do these efforts lack the innovation necessary to meet the demands of a burgeoning world economy , they also do nothing to change the nation 's capitalist equation that renders everyday Americans irrelevant .

`` Fair trade '' with China will not interrupt the transportation of construction , manufacturing and production jobs overseas in exchange for huge profits . Fat-cat executives running investment firms , banks , insurance , health care and pharmaceutical companies might like to curb health care mandates , but that approach certainly does n't address the needs of Americans looking for decent wages and affordable health care .

The Supreme Court 's regressive Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision in many ways validates a truism . The court basically ruled that corporations are people . And like all Americans , corporations have the free speech rights and can spend whatever they want on political ads without disclosing who they are or exposing their agendas . So , in a very real sense , corporations are people -- super-rich , self-serving people who can use their billions to influence elections at the expense of , well , real people .

Most major corporations are run by the Ã¼ber-rich -- the same people who shipped American jobs overseas , broke the backs of labor unions , pay a fraction of the salaries once paid for manufacturing jobs , turned full-time work into part-time positions , and snatched health care benefits away from employees . And many companies have even established `` unemployed need not apply '' policies . In other words , if you do n't have a job when it 's time to apply , you ca n't get the job .

When the `` need not apply '' story broke late last year , more than 6 million Americans had been out of work for six months or more .

Talk about kicking people when they 're down .

During our poverty tour last year , we met countless people caught in vicious cycles of looking for nonexistent jobs because their unemployment benefits were expiring or had run out , scraping change together for gas to go on interviews that may or may not pan out , and having to swap food stamps for cash to keep the lights or gas on in the house .

Frustrations are especially high among young people dealing with an 18 % unemployment rate -- a more than 60-year high . We attended a town hall meeting in Detroit during our poverty tour where parents complained of 25-year-olds who came of working age before the Great Recession who have never had a job in their lives . The newly launched #FixYoungAmerica campaign is centered around the fact that 20 % of young workers have been out of work for a year or longer , jobs are scarce , and the cumulative student loan debt is more than $ 1 trillion .

`` Our generation has been hit far worse than any other , '' said Scott Gerber , 28 , part of the group of young people who started the campaign . `` We represent the broken dream of America , and we ca n't let it continue . ''

That dream has been broken for youths and adults all over the country .

Many single mothers have stopped looking for work for the sake of their children 's health . Because of deficit budget cuts , states are either eliminating or tightening eligibility requirements for child care programs that used to serve the working poor . More cuts are on the way , but , for the moment , children of women on welfare have access to basic health care . But previously eligible low-wage-earning parents are now either denied assistance or their children are placed on interminable waiting lists . It has reached the point where struggling parents have to choose between a low-wage job and welfare so their children can receive basic medical attention .

A person can survive in the jungle for only so long before his or her spirit breaks . And the spirit of the American workforce is approaching a breaking point .

Today 's staggering unemployment is n't the stepchild of the Great Recession . It is the illegitimate offspring of a long-abided system that places the profits and concerns of big business and the mega-rich above the rest of us . The cancer of greed has spread throughout the body of America and surgery based on pre-recession strategies wo n't cure the disease .

The inconvenient truth is that America itself is in need of a transfusion of economic equity and radical reform . Everyday people must recognize that their lives matter just as much as the lives of the rich . A workplace rooted in fundamental fairness that provides decent living wage jobs will allow frustrated , unemployed workers like Joann Cotton to breathe again , and give them a chance to become revitalized contributing members of society . It 's time to resuscitate the American Dream .
