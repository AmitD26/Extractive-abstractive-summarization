-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Wanted by the Drug Enforcement Administration : Ebonics translators .

It might sound like a punch line , as `` Ebonics '' -- the common name for what linguists call African-American English -- has long been the butt of jokes , as well as the subject of controversy .

But the agency is serious about needing nine people to translate conversations picked up on wiretaps during investigations , Special Agent Michael Sanders said Tuesday . A solicitation was sent to contractors as part of a request to companies to provide hundreds of translators in 114 languages .

`` DEA 's position is , it 's a language form we have a need for , '' Sanders said . `` I think it 's a language form that DEA recognizes a need to have someone versed in to conduct investigations . ''

The translators , being hired in the agency 's Southeast Region -- which includes Atlanta , Georgia ; Washington ; New Orleans , Louisiana ; Miami , Florida ; and the Caribbean -- would listen to wiretaps , translate what was said and be able to testify in court if necessary , he said .

`` The concept is right and good , '' said Walt Wolfram , distinguished professor of English linguistics at North Carolina State University . `` Why would n't you want experts who can help you understand what people are communicating ? ''

`` On one level , it 's no different than someone from the Outer Banks of North Carolina who speaks a distinct brogue , '' he said . `` The problem is that even the term ` Ebonics ' is so controversial and politicized that it becomes sort of a free-for-all . ''

And Ebonics is no longer spoken only by African-Americans , Sanders said , referring to it as `` urban language '' or `` street language . '' He said he is aware of investigations in recent years in which it was spoken by African-Americans , Latinos and white people . `` It crosses over geographic , racial and ethnic backgrounds , '' he said .

'' -LSB- African-American English -RSB- is linguistic defiance being reinforced by hip-hop , '' said professor John Baugh , who leads the public relations committee of the Linguistic Society of America .

The DEA 's recruiting `` has it half right , '' Baugh said .

Although having translation help is a good law enforcement tool , Baugh said , the term `` Ebonics '' may be counterproductive because `` the social positions of speakers have been the object of ridicule . ''

The Washington University professor also is concerned about racial profiling resulting from assumptions made from a speaker 's dialect .

While the DEA wants to have the translators available , it may not need to call upon them , Sanders said . He did not know how much it would cost to have the translators available .

`` I ca n't say it 's spoken all the time , like Spanish and Vietnamese , '' Sanders said . `` But there are people trying to use this to evade detection '' while trafficking in drugs , he said .

Asked whether agency currently has agents who can translate Ebonics , Sanders said some who have worked on local police forces can help pick out words on wiretaps .

The term `` Ebonics '' -- a blend of `` ebony '' and `` phonics '' -- became known in 1996 , when the Oakland , California , Unified School District proposed using it in teaching English . After the school board came under fire , it voted to alter the plan , which recognized Ebonics as a distinct language .

The revised plan removed reference to Ebonics as `` genetically based '' and as the `` primary language '' of students . The board also removed a part that some understood to indicate that African-American students would be taught in Ebonics , although the board denied such intentions .

`` There is something of substance here , '' said Wolfram , who said he has studied African-American English for 40 years . `` There are differences in terms of language and lexicon and so forth that are difficult to understand for most people . So it is an issue . What , of course , happens is , it gets politicized and trivialized by the very term ` Ebonics . ' ''

The Linguistic Society of America calls Ebonics a form of communication that deserves recognition and study .

`` Characterizations of Ebonics as ` slang , ' ` mutant , ' ` lazy , ' ` defective , ' ` ungrammatical ' or ` broken English ' are incorrect and demeaning , '' a 1997 resolution said .

For Baugh , all languages or dialects are `` fundamentally equal . '' Ebonics is a dialect spoken by slave descendants who live in many countries and do n't speak just English , he said . Its early speakers were enslaved , isolated from other speakers of their language and denied access to formal education , Baugh said .

Wolfram -- who has authored more than 20 books on English dialects , including African-American English -- recalled the Black Panther trials during the 1970s , when there was debate over whether the saying , `` Off the pigs , '' was a genuine threat to kill police officers or a more metaphorical saying .

Wolfram acknowledged Ebonics often presented as `` nothing but bad language . '' But , he said , `` However you view it ... why would n't you want to avail yourself of all the interpretive capability that you can get ? ''

African-American English is `` a systematic language variety , with patterns of pronunciation , grammar , vocabulary and usage that extend far beyond slang , '' according to the website of the Center for Applied Linguistics , a Washington-based nonprofit organization that says it aims to improve communication through better understanding of language and culture .

`` Because it has a set of rules that is distinct from those of standard American English , characterizations of the variety as bad English are incorrect , '' the center said . `` Speakers of AAE do not fail to speak standard American English , but succeed in speaking African American English . ''

U.S. English , a political advocacy group , supports the DEA 's recruitment , said Tim Schultz , director of government relations .

`` Having somebody to explain slang terms ... spoken by a particular community is an advantage if it allows them to understand a conversation , '' he said .

U.S. English 's primary focus is making English the official language of the United States and backing laws that ensure immigrants learn English .

Language barriers that contribute to conflicts between nations can be a `` serious issue , '' Wolfram noted . `` It 's the same point here . ''

He said the translators could help in investigations , as `` the differences between dialect and code words can get pretty blurry at times . ''

Sanders said DEA plans to continue seeking the translators .

`` African-American English is an evolving dialect and in some ways is growing in stature , '' Baugh said .
