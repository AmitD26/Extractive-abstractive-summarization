The shocking video of James Foley being beheaded in Syria has set off multiple investigations into the mystery of who killed the American journalist .

A day after the British ambassador to the United States said that experts in his country are close to identifying the killer , two U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN that counterterrorism experts are still unable to ID Foley 's executioner .

U.S. analysts said it 's not knowable from the video released by ISIS who carried out Foley 's killing , because the entire slaying is not shown . A man moves a knife across Foley 's neck , then the picture fades to black .

Now one forensics expert has raised the issue that there appear to be two militants in the video .

It 's one of several puzzles , but there are a number of clues as to who committed this horrible act and where .

1 . Accent

The focus has been on a man in the video who has a British accent . Peter Westmacott , British ambassador to the United States , said Sunday that British agents have been using `` very sophisticated technologies , voice identification and so on '' to identify the suspect . `` We are very close to identifying who this guy is , '' he said .

Martin Barry , an audio expert , told CNN it sounded like the way someone in a certain area of London would talk .

`` The speaker is using a variety of English known as multicultural London English and that 's a kind of melting pot accent that 's emerged in recent years , particularly in deprived , multi-ethnic areas of inner London , '' Barry said .

There is only one voice heard on the audio track .

2 . Stature

But Ross Patel , a forensics expert who spoke to CNN , said there is another man , and he might be the actual killer .

The second militant appears on the video after an obvious edit .

`` There 's definitely a change of actor , '' Patel said . `` There are noticeable , there are subtle but there are also noticeable changes in their build , their physical appearance . ''

The video contains other data like the measurements of a face , even though it is hidden . That could help investigators sift through databases of passport photos .

3 . Knives

The man who speaks holds a knife in one of his hands . It looks to be a different knife than the one that was left next to Foley 's body .

The dimensions and style of the knives are slightly different , Patel said .

4 . Holster

When trying to determine whether the British-accented man is also the killer , it helps to examine where his pistol is holstered . It is underneath his left armpit -- that is for use by his right hand . But the executioner appears on the video to be left-handed . It 's unclear why this happened .

5 . Location

Blogger Eliot Higgins looked at the background of the video . Behind the men is a road going over the hilly terrain . On the right side of the frame is a dip in the hills , one Higgins matched to a break he found in an image on Google Earth . There was another camera angle used in the video and in the distance there is a field and some buildings . He believes the clues show the video was recorded south of the town of Raqqa in north central Syria .
