-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Attorneys representing the family of Marlise Munoz -- a pregnant Texas woman they say is brain dead -- revealed Wednesday that the `` fetus is distinctly abnormal . ''

`` Even at this early stage , the lower extremities are deformed to the extent that the gender can not be determined . The fetus suffers from hydrocephalus . It also appears that there are further abnormalities , including a possible heart problem , that can not be specifically determined due to the immobile nature of Mrs. Munoz 's deceased body .

`` Quite sadly , this information is not surprising due to the fact that the fetus , after being deprived of oxygen for an indeterminate length of time , is gestating within a dead and deteriorating body , as a horrified family looks on in absolute anguish , distress and sadness , '' attorneys Jessica Janicek and Heather King said in a statement .

Munoz 's family has said she has been brain-dead since her husband , Erick Munoz , found her unconscious at their home on November 26 . At the time , she was 14 weeks ' pregnant with the couple 's second child .

Mom of pregnant woman on life support : Change the law

Munoz 's husband asked a court last week to force a hospital to take her off a respirator , ventilator and other machines , saying her wishes should n't be disregarded just because she is pregnant .

Erick Munoz filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against John Peter Smith Hospital , both with the same goal : to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial .

`` Marlise Munoz is legally dead , and to further conduct surgical procedures on a deceased body is nothing short of outrageous , '' her husband says in the motion .

Notably , officials at the Fort Worth , Texas , hospital where 33-year-old Marlise Munoz is have not publicly declared her dead , though they have not disputed her husband 's assertions either .

Woman with flu miscarries , battles for her life

A hearing in the case is set for Friday , and both the hospital and the Tarrant County district attorney 's office said Wednesday they would not comment before then .

Erick Munoz -- like his wife , a paramedic by training -- said the doctors told him his wife `` had lost all activity in her brain stem , '' and an accompanying chart stated she was `` brain dead , '' according to his lawsuit .

Hospital spokesman J.R. Labbe said last month that doctors were simply trying to obey a Texas law that says `` you can not withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient . ''

Munoz 's husband responded by saying that `` Marlise can not possibly be a pregnant patient -- Marlise is dead . '' Furthermore , he argued that her wishes -- relayed , he said , in conversations but not in writing that she not be on `` life-sustaining '' measures when she is brain dead -- should n't be treated differently from a man or other woman simply because of her pregnancy .
