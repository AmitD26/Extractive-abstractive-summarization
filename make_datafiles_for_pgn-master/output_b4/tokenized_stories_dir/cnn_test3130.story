-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- News that the United States is considering a military strike on Syria in response to the Bashar al-Assad regime 's suspected use of chemical weapons suggests we could soon see an American bombing campaign on the war-torn country .

The atrocities that took place in Syria recently , such as those that have been taking place there for almost two years , are deplorable and inhuman .

Before bombing Syria over the regime 's latest crimes , however , we should stand back and ask , `` And then what ? ''

Bergen : For U.S. , Syria is truly a problem from hell

A brief bombing campaign in Syria might make the United States and its allies feel like they are doing something , but it will prove nothing .

We have already abstained from getting involved in the civil war for two years and have chosen not to respond to evidence -LRB- albeit less clear -RRB- of another chemical attack this year .

We have already concluded that as terrible as the civil war is , it can not be our war . The bombing will not change this -- and then what ?

Both sides in Syria are bad . One side is a brutal dictator , and the other includes Islamists and terrorists who are dangerous already and who would be brutal in power if given the chance .

We will not spend the time , money and blood to create a desirable side in Syria . There is no victory to be had there .

Syria is not the greatest threat in the Middle East to U.S. or world security . The Iranian regime is working every day to get a nuclear weapon . It poses a direct threat to Israel 's survival and a long-term threat to America .

The conflicts in Syria , Egypt and Libya are small threats compared with the disaster that could ensue and the lives that would be endangered if Iran succeeds in its drive for nuclear weapons .

We should focus more on the truly big threat ahead of the headlines of the day -- or we will be reading much worse headlines in the future .
