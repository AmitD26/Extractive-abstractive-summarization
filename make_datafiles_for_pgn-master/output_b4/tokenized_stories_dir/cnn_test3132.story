The vast blue sky stretched above Clara Bohitile 's pick-up truck as it trundled down a dirt road deep in the Kalahari bushveld .

Stopping in a whirl of red dust , one of her workers jumped off the back to open the wire gate to her ranch .

It was a typical African rural scene , but with a difference : traditionally the driver would have been a white Afrikaans male farmer , but Bohitile is a black woman . Originally from a township in the capital Windhoek she now runs her own cattle farm , known locally as a `` kraal '' .

Bohitile represents the changing face of Namibia . Under both German colonial and South African apartheid-era rule , political power , wealth and the ownership of productive land were deliberately dominated by whites . But since the country 's independence in 1990 there have been concerted efforts to change the legacy of discrimination .

`` The percentage of black farmers is still very small in comparison to white farmers , '' said Bohitile . `` But , indeed , we are entering that market , as black farmers we go through a lot of training , we do practicals on farms and we just get wiser and wiser and we try to do the right thing . ''

Land reform in Namibia is one of the county 's most emotive issues and changing the old patterns of ownership is not easy . Bohitile is making a success of her venture , but she is former Deputy Minister of Education and a prominent businesswoman today , which gave her access to capital and a head start .

Next to Bohitile 's ranch is a former white-owned farm on which eight resettled black families are struggling to make a living .

Some assistance came last month when a white Namibian mentor , sponsored by German money and directed by the government-owned Agricultural Bank of Namibia arrived to advise one of the new owners , Naftali Katjiuongua .

`` We are making money , '' said Katjiuongua . `` But its not enough to help us . Things are very expensive . We need more help from the government . ''

Problems remain but Namibia has come a long way from when I first visited the country as a teenager in 1976 . I will never forget the long rows of dusty , mostly dilapidated cars parked in the port of Walvis Bay . They had been left behind by white Portuguese settlers fleeing the revolution and civil war in neighboring Angola .

In South Africa , the flames of the Soweto uprisings were filling the air , while the war against white rule raged on the Namibia borders .

The future for many in southern Africa seemed hopeless then . There seemed to be no way out of the conflict between white and black over who should rule the land and own the wealth .

I could never have imagined that over 35 years later Namibia would be such a peaceful country , although serious issues remain : unemployment is estimated to be over 50 % and over 70 % among youth , the gap between rich and poor is too high , and skills development is low .

Yet black Namibians have made huge strides . The CEO of the country 's largest diamond mining company , Namdeb , is Inge Zaamwani-Kamwi , a black woman who is leading a new struggle in the country .

`` The war for talent is an ongoing challenge , '' she says . `` We do n't believe we can ever say we have trained enough . When there is progress and you are moving forward you will need to keep up with skills development . ''

Bohitile and Zaamwani-Kamwi are two women who encapsulate the new Namibia , and the possibilities open to them today were virtually unimaginable in the past .

Namibia 's success is that black advancement has not meant white diminishment .

German and Afrikaans culture is still strong . There remains a strong sense of shared identity among Namibians of all races , and a common belief that their future can be better .
