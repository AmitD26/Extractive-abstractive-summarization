The Transportation Security Administration said Friday it has started the process of firing 25 of its agents and suspending 19 others for not following screening procedures .

The 44 employees all worked in a checked-baggage screening room in Terminal B of Newark 's Liberty International Airport , TSA spokesman David Castelveter told CNN in a written statement .

In November and December of 2011 , they were caught on surveillance cameras not following proper screening protocols , an agency internal investigation revealed .

After passengers check their bags , TSA screeners are supposed to search the luggage with electronic scanners and open some bags by hand .

In this case , the employees allegedly did n't follow procedures on about 250 bags during the two months , the agency said . All bags did receive some screening , however .

The punishment marks the largest removal and suspension of TSA officers in the agency 's history , and part of a larger internal crackdown on improper behavior by TSA agents .

`` Accountability is an important aspect of our work and we take appropriate action with any employee who does not follow our procedures or engages in misconduct , '' Castelveter said .

In June , the same investigation prompted the agency to fire eight checked-baggage screeners at Newark for violating TSA procedures , including some of them for sleeping on the job .

That same month , 43 TSA workers in Fort Myers , Florida , were disciplined for not performing additional screening on random passengers and carry-on bags .

At Boston 's Logan Airport , 20 checked-baggage screeners were punished in August for reading newspapers or talking on the phone when they were supposed to be screening bags , or for not reporting the misconduct , a spokesperson told CNN at the time .

And last year , 36 checked-bag screeners in Hawaii were fired after they were caught on a security camera in 2010 ignoring procedures , including putting bag inspection notices in bags without actually inspecting them , an inspector general 's report said .
