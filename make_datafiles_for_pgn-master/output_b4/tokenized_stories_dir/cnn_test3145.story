As my official bio reads , I was made in Cuba , assembled in Spain , and imported to the United States -- meaning my mother , seven months pregnant , and the rest of my family arrived as exiles from Cuba to Madrid , where I was born . Less than two months later , we emigrated once more and settled in New York City , then eventually in Miami , where I was raised and educated .

By the time I was 45 days old , I belonged to three countries . My first newborn photo appears on my U.S. alien registration card . As an adult , I see this as a foreshadowing of what would eventually obsess my writing and my psyche : the negotiation of identity .

My first encounter with this was with cultural negotiation . My childhood was braced between two imaginary worlds . The first was the nostalgic world of 1950s Cuba in the hearts and minds of my parents , grandparents , and immediate family , but also the exile community at large in Miami . `` Somewhere '' there was an island paradise we all came from , a paradise we lost -LRB- for complex reasons I was too young to comprehend -RRB- , but nevertheless , a paradise , a homeland known as la patria -- to which we 'd all return someday , exactly as we were , to find it exactly as it was .

That storyline was what I knew of that homeland I imagined from family folklore told across the dinner table , gossip at beauty salons with my mother , or in the aisles of the mercados shopping for Cuban staples like chorizo and yucca with my grandmother ; or from old photo albums that they had managed to smuggle out of Cuba , and the rum-drunk talk about `` what happened '' from the men playing dominos on the terraza in the backyard .

The other imaginary world -- America -- was at the other end of the spectrum .

Although technically we lived in the United States , the Cuban community was culturally insular in Miami during the 1970s , bonded together by the trauma of exile . What 's more , it seemed that practically everyone was Cuban : my teachers , my classmates , the mechanic , the bus driver . I did n't grow up feeling different or treated as a minority . The few kids who got picked on in my grade school were the ones with freckles and funny last names like Dawson and O'Neil .

Against that setting , America seemed like some `` other '' place . And as a child , I truly believed that the real America , just beyond my reach , was exactly like the America I saw on TV reruns like `` The Brady Bunch '' and `` Leave it to Beaver . '' In my case , the stereotypical American family was the `` other , '' the exotic life yearned for , as much as I yearned to finally see that imaginary Cuba . Sorting out these contradictions and yearnings was an everyday part of my childhood , and one of the main themes of my writing today .

The other negotiation was the engineer versus the poet . As might be typical , my exile/immigrant family pushed for me to pursue a career that would ensure I would have a better life than they did . Also , in a working-class family , the idea of pursuing a life in the arts was outside the realm of possibilities . My family even thought architecture was too `` artsy . ''

Add to that the cultural-generational divide when it came to the arts in America . Robert Frost and T.S. Eliot were not dinner conversation at my house . My parents did n't even know of the Rolling Stones . They wanted me to continue the story of the `` American dream '' that they had begun . Fortunately -- or unfortunately -- I was a whiz at math , and when the time came to decide on a career path , I succumbed to their loving insistence . But I always harbored a creative spirit throughout my childhood , completely taken by Legos , paint-by-number sets , latch-hook rug kits -- anything that gave me expression .

My sexual identity was something I also had to negotiate . The antagonist in my coming-out story was my grandmother , a woman as xenophobic as she was homophobic . Anything she perceived as culturally `` weird , '' she also labeled as `` faggotry '' -- `` mariconer√≠a . '' This included my playing with toys like G.I. Joes and action figures of super heroes -LRB- Wonder Woman being my favorite -RRB- . Convinced that I was queer -- she had good intuition , I guess -- she was verbally and psychologically abusive because she was also convinced she could make me a `` real '' man .

She scared me into a closet so deep and dark that the idea of living as a gay man was completely , like a career in arts , out of the realm of possibilities . And so , like many gay men of my generation , I led a straight life , and was even engaged twice to be married , until I came out in my mid-20s .

A tale of two terms : Obama 's unfinished business and battles ahead

Being named poet laureate for the inauguration personally validates and stitches together several ideals against which I have long measured America , since the days of watching `` My Three Sons '' and `` The Dick Van Dyke Show '' reruns . For one , the essence of the American dream : how a little Cuban-American kid on the margins of mainstream America could grow up with confidence , have the opportunity to become an engineer thanks to the hard work of his parents who could barely speak English , and then go on , choosing to become a poet who is now asked to speak to , for and about the entire nation .

The most powerful quality of our country is that each day is full of a million possibilities : We are a country of fierce individualism , which invites me to shape my life as I see fit . As I reflect on this , I see how the American story is in many ways my story -- a country still trying to negotiate its own identity , caught between the paradise of its founding ideals and the realities of its history , trying to figure it out , trying to `` become '' even today -- the word `` hope '' as fresh on our tongues as it ever was .

Regardless of my cultural , socioeconomic background and my sexuality , I have been given a place at the table , or more precisely , at the podium , because that is America .
