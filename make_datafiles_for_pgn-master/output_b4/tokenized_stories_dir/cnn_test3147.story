Watching the season 4 premiere of The Walking Dead , it was easy to imagine you had fallen into a Rick Grimes-esque coma and missed a few shows . When did Andrew Lincoln 's much-tortured cop become so handy with a hoe ? When was David Morrissey 's depth perception-challenged maniac The Governor going to make an appearance ? And , perhaps most bewilderingly , when did it become okay for Carol to call Daryl `` Pookie '' ?

To address these questions -- and many more ! -- we spoke with Walking Dead comic writer and Walking Dead TV show executive producer Robert Kirkman .

Entertainment Weekly : How much time has gone by in-between the end of season 3 and the start of season 4 ?

Robert Kirkman : We say `` a few months . '' Some people think a few is two , some people think a few is three . It 's a vague answer .

EW : What 's up with Rick and the gardening ?

Kirkman : Well , we like to change things up . I have to say that is my favorite opening of any season thus far -- just the fact that it 's the Walking Dead but it 's about a guy who comes out and starts hoeing a garden . I was thrilled about that from the moment that -LRB- Walking Dead showrunner -RRB- Scott Gimple suggested it .

We always like coming in and showing that there 's been a passage of time and these are n't the exact same characters that we last saw . I 've always been willing to push the envelope with that . I feel that 's a really cool thing to do , to come in and reintroduce the show to people , and set the stage for all the new things that are going to be coming . The fact that every season of the Walking Dead has been somewhat different thematically has been a really cool evolution and is something we hope to continue every season .

EW : What would you say is this season 's theme ?

Kirkman : It 's a lot of what comes from that woman -LSB- in the woods -RSB- in the first episode : It 's `` Are n't these people too far gone ? '' And `` Can these people retain a little bit of humanity ? '' We 're going to be dealing with those questions a lot more intensely than we have thus far on the show . It 's all about Rick coming from this place where he kind of went off the deep end in season 3 . Rick feels like he failed at everything he was trying to do and so this is him trying a different path and seeing if he can make that work .

EW : Maybe this a foolish thing to say based on having just seen the premiere . But this was the first ever Walking Dead show I could n't at least roughly place in the chronology of the comic . Have you made a decisive break with that mythology ?

Kirkman : There 's a lot of new elements at play here but we 're definitely still dealing with a lot of things from the comic book . You 'll see , starting with the second episode , there 's some very big moments from the comic book that are being worked in in a different way . There will always be moments where you 're like , `` Oh , that 's exactly like the comic book ! '' A lot of that stuff is coming up in future episodes .

EW : I 'm not a doctor -- I just play one on TV -- but I 'm assuming there 's some sort of nasty , swine flu-type virus abroad in the prison .

Kirkman : Well , it 's definitely some kind of nasty illness . Something that can make a guy go from cough-cough-I 'm - not-feeling-well-can-I-go-lay-down ? to essentially bleeding out in the shower after a few hours is something on the swine flu level -- possibly a little bit more deadly .

EW : And that kid Patrick coughed all over the water supply !

Kirkman : Well , that shower water supply is fairly contained . That 's like a bag that they fill up . I do n't know how this works , I 'm getting a little too technical here . All the water is contaminated ! It 's very dangerous ! Be careful !

EW : What did you name your family pig when you were a child ?

Kirkman : -LSB- Laughs -RSB- I find it offensive that you think because I 'm from Kentucky I grew up with pigs . But `` Samuel '' is the answer .

EW : Presumably Michonne is hunting the Governor , right ?

Kirkman : Yes , that is who she is after . The story there is that , after the events of season 3 and the death of Andrea , Michonnne and Daryl spent some time out in the wilderness looking for the Governor and eventually Daryl decided , `` Look , this is a futile effort and we 're not going to find this person . '' And Michonne kept it up .

EW : She 's heading to Macon . Is there any chance of her catching an Allman Brothers Band show while she 's there ?

Kirkman : We can only hope that they are still performing shows . If that 's where the Governor is and that 's what she 's doing I do n't know how Michonne 's going to handle that . She 's gon na want to watch the show , she 's gon na want to get revenge . She 'll be be torn .

EW : Here 's a question you 're not going to answer : How long before we see the Governor ?

Kirkman : -LSB- Laughs -RSB- Is this the question your boss makes you ask ?

EW : No one 's the boss of me !

Kirkman : He 's definitely going to appear at some point this season . It 's possible there are elements of his return that have already been set up in some ways you might not have noticed . But when he returns it will be at a time when you least expect it .

EW : Is Woodbury now a ghost town ?

Kirkman : That will be dealt with in an upcoming episode .

EW : The zombie hanging from the store ceiling by his intestines was a very nice touch .

Kirkman : Look , if they ever need to rappel down something they 're able to do that .

EW : On the other hand , I 'm not very happy with anyone referring to Daryl as `` Pookie . ''

Kirkman : -LSB- Laughs -RSB- Yeah , Norman asked for that . He makes everyone on set call him Pookie . We worked that into the show .

EW : Judging from the premiere , I got the impression you will be exploring the character of Beth more this season than you have done previously .

Kirkman : I think that to a certain extent we will be exploring all characters more than we have . This show has been doing a lot of world-building for the first three seasons . Now that we 've got that out of the way , this season we 're going to be intensely focused on the characters themselves . You 'll learn a lot more about Beth , you 'll learn a lot more about Daryl , you 'll learn a lot more about Rick . We 're going to be doing a lot of character work this season .

EW : You 're both world-building and empire-building . What 's the status of the Walking Dead spin-off show ?

Kirkman : It 's currently , quote unquote , `` in development '' so there 's not really a lot to say about that . But I can say that it 's going to be awesome !
