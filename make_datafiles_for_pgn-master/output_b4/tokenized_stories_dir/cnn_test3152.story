-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rumors that U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden hitched a ride on Bolivia 's presidential jet have sparked a global diplomatic feud that 's roiled leaders throughout South America .

The drama started Tuesday after Portuguese authorities would n't let Bolivian President Evo Morales ' plane land in Lisbon for refueling while on his way back from a conference in Russia , Bolivian Defense Minister Ruben Saavedra told CNN en Español .

France , Spain and Italy also would n't let the plane enter their airspace , Bolivian officials said .

With no clear path home available , the flight 's crew made an emergency landing in Austria .

`` We are told that there were some unfounded suspicions that Mr. Snowden was on the plane , '' Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said .

`` We do not know who has invented this lie . Someone who wants to harm our country . This information that has been circulated is malicious information to harm this country . ''

Late Wednesday morning , Spain agreed to let Morales ' plane stop in the Canary Islands on its way home , the Spanish Foreign Ministry said . The plane landed there as planned Wednesday , and subsequently took off for Fortaleza , Brazil , where it landed and refueled again Wednesday evening , Bolivia TV reported .

The presidential plane was scheduled to return to Bolivia on Wednesday night . The state broadcaster showed crowds of supporters brandishing Bolivian flags and awaiting Morales ' return .

At the El Alto International Airport outside La Paz , the state broadcaster showed crowds waved signs saying , `` Sovereign Bolivia , colony no more '' and , `` You are not alone . The people of the world are with you . ''

Opinion : Snowden and a muzzle free press

The plane spent more than 10 hours in Vienna , where Austrian officials confirmed that Snowden was not aboard after Morales allowed an Austrian airport police officer onto his plane for a `` voluntary check , '' Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck said .

As Morales resumed his journey , differing accounts emerged of what happened .

France denied that it refused to allow the plane to enter its airspace .

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius called his Bolivian counterpart to express regrets about a delay in the confirmation to authorize the plane to fly over its territory , the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement .

The authorization was granted as soon as French authorities were informed that the plane was the Bolivian president 's aircraft , the ministry said .

France `` never intended to deny president Morales 's plane access to -LRB- its -RRB- airspace , '' and the Bolivian leader is welcome in France , Fabius said .

Snowden 's asylum options dwindle

Bolivian minister : U.S. behind Snowden rumor

Bolivian authorities are investigating the source of the rumors about Snowden . Saavedra , the Bolivian defense minister , told CNN en Español that he believed the U.S. was behind them .

`` This is a lie , a falsehood , '' he said . `` It was generated by the U.S. government . ''

Despite several attempts by CNN to get a response , Obama administration officials have declined to comment on Bolivia 's allegations that the United States pressured European countries to deny landing rights to the Bolivian president 's plane , referring all questions to the European countries in question .

It is n't the first time Bolivian authorities have accused U.S. officials of trying to meddle with their presidential plane .

In 2011 , Morales said he was worried that U.S. authorities would plant something on his presidential plane to link him with drug trafficking when he attended a United Nations General Assembly meeting .

Outrage in Latin America

Bolivian Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera described Morales as a `` hostage of imperialism . ''

`` The president has been kidnapped by imperialism , and he is being held in Europe , '' he said in a televised address late Tuesday night . The vice president called for workers worldwide to protest `` this act of imperial arrogance . ''

He said Bolivia would complain about the incident to the United Nations .

The situation drew a stern rebuke from Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff , who said the incident was `` life-threatening '' for the Bolivian leader .

`` The Brazilian government expresses its outrage and condemnation of the embarrassment imposed on President Evo Morales by some European countries , '' she said in a statement Wednesday . `` The pretext that led to this unacceptable behavior -- the supposed presence of Edward Snowden in the plane of the president -- was fictional and a serious disrespect to the law and to international practices and standards of civilized coexistence among nations . ''

The impact of the European countries ' actions extends far beyond Bolivia 's borders , she said .

`` The embarrassment to President Morales reaches not only Bolivia , but all of Latin America . It compromises the dialogue between the two continents and possible negotiations between them , '' she said . `` It also requires prompt and explanation by the countries involved in this provocation . ''

The Union of South American Nations released a statement Wednesday saying the body `` rejects categorically the dangerous act '' of denying Morales ' plane access . The leaders of the UNASUR countries are scheduled to meet on Thursday meeting in Cochabamba , Bolivia , to discuss the matter .

By Wednesday evening , the presidents of Argentina , Venezuela , Peru , Suriname , Ecuador and Bolivia had confirmed their plans to attend , said Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino , who called the situation `` very serious . ''

Cuba 's Foreign Ministry also condemned the incident .

`` This constitutes an unacceptable , unfounded and arbitrary act which offends all of Latin America and the Caribbean , '' the ministry said in a statement .

Argentina 's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner described Morales ' treatment in Europe as humiliating .

`` This is not only a humiliation to a sister nation , '' she said during a military event Wednesday , `` but to the whole South American continent . ''

So where is Snowden ?

The situation is the latest twist in what has become a global guessing game over Snowden 's next steps .

Snowden has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs and faces espionage charges in the United States . He has applied for asylum in 21 countries , including Bolivia .

` Unbowed ' Snowden seeks new havens

Morales , a left-leaning president who has long criticized the United States , had been attending a conference of gas-exporting countries in Russia , where he told the Russia Today news network that he would be willing to consider asylum for Snowden .

But Bolivian officials stressed that accusations that an official aircraft would harbor Snowden were baseless .

`` We can not lie to the international community by carrying ghost passengers , '' Choquehuanca said .

European concerns

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange urged Europe on Wednesday to demonstrate its willingness to defend freedom of information , whatever the fear of political pressure from its `` best ally , '' the United States .

His comments came in a piece co-written with the secretary general of Reporters without Borders , Christophe Deloire , for French newspaper Le Monde .

European Union states should accord Snowden their warmest welcome , their article said . If he is abandoned in the international zone of Moscow 's Sheremetyevo International Airport , it will mean European countries are `` abandoning their principles and part of the reason for the EU , '' it said .

In recent days , a number of European nations have voiced concern about reports -- based on documents apparently provided by Snowden -- that the United States has been conducting surveillance on its European allies .

France believes it would be wise to delay U.S.-EU trade talks for two weeks in light of the allegations , French government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem said Wednesday .

She was echoing remarks made by President Francois Hollande this week after the claims first appeared in German and British media .

Germany 's Economy Minister Philipp Roesler has said the reports of spying do influence the planned talks , said his spokesman , Adrian Toschev .

But the spokesman declined to back the French call for a delay to the talks , which are scheduled to begin Monday .
