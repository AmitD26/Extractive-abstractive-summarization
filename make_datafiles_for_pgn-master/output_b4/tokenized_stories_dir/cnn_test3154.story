NATO has grappled with many perilous issues in its more than six decades of existence . But it 's had few times quite like this .

That was obvious Thursday , as leaders of the trans-Atlantic alliance 's member countries met in Wales . They discussed everything from Afghanistan to the Middle East to Ukraine , each of which has its own special significance and presents its own unique military and diplomatic challenges .

`` We meet at a crucial time in the history of our alliance , '' British Prime Minister David Cameron said at the outset of the two-day summit . `` The world faces many dangerous and evolving threats , and it is absolutely clear that NATO is as vital to our future as it has been in our past . ''

There was no indication given that NATO , as a group , will be deploying more ground troops anytime soon to any new conflict -- as it has done before most recently following the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .

Still , the alliance is looking at a range of options to combat a range of diverse threats .

Here 's a look at a few developments on those front , broken down by region :

Iraq and Syria

NATO has only invoked Article 5 -- which mandates all countries come to the aid of another member of the alliance -- one time , in response to the al Qaeda threat following 9/11 .

Now , its member states are intensely focused on ISIS , a relatively new terrorist group that has rampaged through the Middle East , executing American journalists and threatening more Westerners ' lives .

No one is saying that NATO is about to repeat what it did over 12 years ago , including sending legions of ground troops into a country as it did Afghanistan . But its leaders are certainly talking tough about ISIS and the prospect of NATO playing a role in attacking it .

Any request by Iraq to NATO for aid in fighting ISIS would be `` considered seriously , '' according to NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen , who noted the Iraqi government has n't reached out yet to the alliance .

The United States , however , has coordinated with the Baghdad government to launch airstrikes on ISIS fighters in Iraq and opened the door for similar attacks in Syria . Cameron told CNN that his country supports these American strikes and could take part in further military action .

`` We do n't rule anything out , '' said Cameron , adding that he wants ISIS `` squeezed out of existence . ''

`` We will act with partners in our national interest , '' Cameron said .

Yet he , like U.S. officials , stressed that military might alone wo n't end the threat posed by the Islamist militant group . Cameron said it 's imperative local and national authorities in the Middle East take control and offer their citizens a government they can rely on .

`` We must recognize , '' Cameron said , `` that what 's required is helping those on the ground , rather than some Western intervention -LRB- that is -RRB- completely over their heads and -LRB- leaves -RRB- them to pick up the pieces . ''

Ukraine

NATO countries ' work with the governments of Iraq and Syria have been mixed , at best . For Iraq , they criticized Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki until he was forced out of office , then worked closely with his successor to go after ISIS . For Syria , they 've refused to cooperate at all with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- even if he and NATO share a common enemy in ISIS .

Ukraine , though , is a different story .

Western leaders have made a point of supporting the Kiev-based government as it combats a rebel movement that , its officials say , has been supported in most every which way by the Kremlin . And even as Moscow denies any direct involvement , Western officials have demanded the Russia withdraw thousands of troops they say have crossed the border and shelled Ukrainian forces , not to mention pull its troops back from the border .

`` This is the first time since the end of World War II that one European country has tried to grab another 's territory by force , '' said Rasmussen on Thursday . `` Europe must not turn away from the rule of law to the rule of strongest . ''

But what can NATO countries do about it ?

U.S. President Barack Obama , for one , promised this week that `` we will defend our NATO allies . '' But Ukraine is n't part of that alliance , and Obama has n't suggested he 'll send American troops to faceoff with Russian forces in the country .

Ukraine , however , is working more and more closely with NATO , as evidenced by the Wales summit . Rasmussen said NATO will give nearly $ 20 million for Ukraine 's military and focus on bolstering its cyber-defense , logistics and command and control capabilities .

`` It is definitely a landmark event , '' President Petro Poroshenko said of the `` strong , enormous support '' that NATO government leaders have afforded Ukraine at the Wales summit . '' -LRB- Cooperation is -RRB- at the highest level during the 20-year history of the partnership between Ukraine and NATO . ''

Afghanistan

Afghanistan is where NATO has had its biggest , and most long-lasting , footprint outside of Europe . But that is changing -- or at least NATO 's mission in the south Asian nation is changing .

Exactly how is up in the air , in part to a crisis related to Afghanistan 's recent presidential election .

Despite efforts by the Taliban to disrupt the election , about 8 million votes were cast on June 14 , with provisional results showing Ashraf Ghani ahead with roughly 56 % support to 43 % for Abdullah Abdullah , according to the country 's Independent Elections Commission .

Yet both candidates have alleged large-scale voter fraud and manipulation , and Abdullah has n't conceded . That 's left the nation in limbo -- to this point , the inauguration of the new president was pushed back indefinitely from the first week of August , as an audit of the vote is conducted -- and NATO 's International Security Assistance Force in limbo as well .

That 's because current Afghan President Hamid Karzai had refused to sign what 's known as a Status of Forces Agreement that would set the terms of keeping international forces in Afghanistan beyond the end of this year .

Both Ghani and Abduallah have said they 'd sign it , but -- since neither is in office -- they ca n't . There is also the threat that the election crisis could lead to internal fighting in Afghanistan , further destabilizing an already turbulent nation dealing with a Taliban insurgency .

Rasmussen said Thursday that his alliance hopes to continue its efforts in Afghanistan through `` a new , non-combat mission to train , advise and assist the Afghan forces starting next year . ''

But `` without a signature '' on the Status of Forces Agreement , `` there can be no mission , '' he added .

`` Although our military commanders have shown great flexibility in their planning , time is short , '' Rasmussen added . `` The sooner the legal framework is in place , the better . ''
