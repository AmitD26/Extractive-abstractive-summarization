Chaos erupted after the first student was shot . Children ran screaming and crying . Almost everyone on the playground sprinted away from the boy who had just fired a pistol at his schoolmate .

Not Michael Landsberry .

The 45-year-old math teacher calmly walked toward the gunman as he crossed the basketball court . Landsberry raised his hands to show he was no threat .

He tried to reason with the boy .

A student who witnessed the shooting said Landsberry was trying to make the shooter put his weapon down . He did not . `` He took the shot right then and there , '' the witness said .

The entire tragedy unfolded in a mere three minutes . A popular teacher , coach and member of the Nevada Air National Guard lay dead .

His students and fellow guardsmen were stunned by his devastating death , but no one was surprised by how , directly in the face of danger , he tried to solve the crisis .

`` That was the kind of person that Michael was , '' his brother , Reggie Landsberry , said . `` He was the kind of person that if somebody needed help he would be there . ''

Col. Jeffrey Burkett , commander of the Nevada Air Guard 's 152nd Airlift Wing , said he liked to think that Michael Landsberry -- who had been deployed once to a busy base in Afghanistan -- was using his military training when he confronted the shooter .

`` He was trying to save the children . He was trying to save that child , '' Burkett said .

That child , the 12-year-old shooter , later turned the 9 mm pistol on himself . His identity has not been released .

Landsberry could n't save the shooter or himself , but he did delay the gunman from going immediately after more victims .

`` Mr. Landsberry 's heroic actions , by stepping toward the shooter , allowed time for other students in the playground area to flee , '' Washoe County School District Police Chief Mike Mieras said .

Beloved teacher slain by ` nice kid '

As news of the shooting was reported on Twitter , students and former students tweeted about Mr. Landsberry , who taught eighth-grade math .

He ca n't be dead , they wrote to each other . He 's strong , he 'll make it , one said .

Soon the ugly realization came that he was gone .

He leaves a wife and two stepdaughters . His wife , Sharon , posted a note on Facebook , thanking her friends for their condolences .

`` He was My Everything , My World !! He has touched so many lives and was an incredible Man !! , '' she wrote Monday night .

Landsberry , who joined the Marines after he graduated from high school in Reno in 1986 , had an associate 's degree in law enforcement and a bachelor 's degree in education , according to a statement from the Guard . He began teaching in 2001 , the same year he enlisted in the Guard , the statement said .

He worked at two other schools before moving to Sparks Middle School in 2006 .

In addition to being a math teacher he also coached basketball , cross country , track and volleyball , as well as girls soccer at Sparks High School , the Guard said .

Reggie Landsberry said caring for others was something he and his brother learned from their father , who served in the Marines for 22 years . Michael Landsberry , also a veteran of the Corps , was `` just a good all-around individual , '' his brother said .

The colonel said Landsberry `` was close to a lot of people out here on the base . ''

A Facebook memorial page posted in Landsberry 's honor had more than 16,100 likes on Tuesday afternoon .

Among the comments :

`` Once a hero , always a hero ! RIP . ''

`` God bless you for the greatest act of courage and love . ''

`` From one Air Force vet to a USMC vet , I salute you . Rest in peace , brother . ''

Thousands more honored the slain teacher on a `` Rest Easy Mr. Landsberry '' page .

On a website for his students , `` Mr. Landsberry 's Math Class , '' the slain teacher had posted pictures of himself hiking in the wilderness and standing with a weapon beside an armored vehicle .

`` One of my goals is to earn your respect while you earn mine , '' he wrote in a message to students . `` I believe that with mutual respect that the classroom environment will run smoothly . ''

Sparks Mayor Geno Martini called the loss of Landsberry `` devastating . ''

`` It 's very unfortunate that -LRB- the life of -RRB- someone like that , who protected our country over there and came back alive ... had to be taken at his work , at a school , '' Martini said .

Landsberry attained the rank of corporal and served as a field wireman , Marine spokeswoman Maj. Shawn Haney said . The Guard said he was a master sergeant , who was also once deployed to Kuwait .

`` A lot of lives saved by this Marine . May he guard the gates of heaven . Semper Fi , Sir , '' one commenter wrote on Facebook , referencing the `` Always Faithful '' motto of the Marines .
