Matt Damon said it 's hard not to see his three daughters in the eyes of the girls he helps on his visits to the poverty stricken villages in India .

CNN 's Dr. Sanjay Gupta sat down with Damon and his water.org co-founder , Gary White , to talk about what their organization is hoping to achieve by providing clean water and sanitation to those who need it . `` Our daughters in that situation would be off looking for a water source and hauling water for the family and they would have no prospects for a life or a future , '' Damon said .

On premises access to clean water is something only one in four people have in India , according to UNICEF .

When Damon got into the water business , he worked with H20 Africa and says he learned a lot .

`` I did what I think a lot of people do , which is they kind of get right into the direct impact , like well-digging and how many people can I help if I dig x number of wells , '' Damon said . But he said as his understanding of the issue grew , he realized that charity was n't going to solve the problem .

Together , we can solve the water crisis

He teamed with Gary White , co-founder of WaterPartners , in July 2009 and water.org was born .

`` Had I stayed with just drilling wells , I 'd have reached thousands of people at this point , but by the end of next year we 'll hit 3 million people that we 've reached this way , '' Damon said .

Water.org is a nonprofit focused on giving access to clean water and sanitation to more of the developing world . What makes the organization different is its WaterCredit Initiative , which provides new financing options for poor people so they can pay for a toilet in their home or connect to an existing water supply .

White said he met women in India who were paying 125 % interest to loan sharks to get their own toilet or to connect to the public water utilities . They inspired him to create the WaterCredit initiative .

Now , he said , these women can get a loan at a much lower rate and still get access to these services . `` So , basically we helped microfinance institutions really discover a new market among some of their existing clients and now we 've had over 1.6 million people get access to water and sanitation not through charity but through a microloan . And they 're being repaid at 99 % , '' White said .

In a lot of urban areas the infrastructure already exists . Water pumps right under the feet of people who just ca n't connect to it .

`` It was the recognition that there was a market there for this , and that if we just stopped looking at people as beneficiaries , if we look at them as customers , then we can really unleash their power to solve their own problems , '' Damon said .

Damon 's passion about water is spilling into every aspect of his life . He 's using his celebrity and sense of humor to help spread the word . When he took part in the ice bucket challenge , he did it with toilet water . Before that he proclaimed a strike on toilets , saying `` Until everybody has access to clean water and sanitation , I will not go to the bathroom . ''

His goal to empower people is serious . He said by gaining access to water and toilets , women and girls gain their time and life back . For many , collecting and scavenging for water is a large part of their day . Freed from those duties they can find a job and earn money to help repay the loan .

`` It is an income-enhancing loan because you 're basically buying their time back , and they can work , right ? '' Damon said . `` This is an incredible deal if you 're the lender . ''

It also brings extra security to girls and women , who no longer have to leave their home to use the bathroom .

`` I mean this news that came out of India this summer with the two girls who did n't have access to toilets in their home , so they had to wait until the cover of night because of the dignity of this issue , to go out and find a place to defecate . And while they were out they were raped and murdered , '' White said . `` That 's just unbelievable that something so basic to humanity like access to sanitation should set up these situations . ''

Some 36 % of the world 's population , 2.5 billion people , lacks improved sanitation facilities , and 768 million people still use unsafe drinking water sources , according to the World Health Organization .

The long-term health effects of not having access to water include malnutrition and diarrhea .

According to UNICEF , diarrhea is the second largest cause of death in children under 5 globally and responsible for 600,000 children 's deaths each year . It 's also associated with a higher risk of stunting -LRB- low weight for age and developmental delay -RRB- .

Many other diseases , such as malaria and other parasitic diseases , could be prevented with an adequate water supply , sanitation facilities and proper hygiene , according to the World Health Organization .

That 's also why education is a key component of water.org 's mission . It teaches people about proper hand washing with soap , and is helping people make the connection between hygiene and sickness . It teaches how to store water , avoid contaminating it with utensils and how to practice good hygiene by washing hands before preparing food and after changing a diaper .

`` The practice of hand washing with soap in India is not widespread . A study showed that only 53 % of the population wash hands with soap after defecation , 38 % before eating , and 30 % before preparing food , '' according to UNICEF .

`` It 's an absolute , just white-knuckle crisis right now for three-quarters of a billion people , '' Damon said . `` It 's killing a child every 20 seconds , which is unfathomable that these children are dying from things like diarrhea , which you know , if you have kids , your kid gets a stomach bug , maybe they miss a day of school . But , you know , it 's hard for us in the West to even wrap our brains around this concept that a lack of access to clean water and sanitation is literally slaughtering children by the millions , just because none of them are dying here .
