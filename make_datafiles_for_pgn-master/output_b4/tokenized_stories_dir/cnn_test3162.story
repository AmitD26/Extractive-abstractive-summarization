The European Court of Human Rights on Tuesday rejected a claim by a young Muslim woman that France 's ban on the wearing of burqas and niqabs in public violates her rights .

The French law banning the burqa , a full-body covering that includes a mesh over the face , and the niqab , a full-face veil with an opening for the eyes , went into effect in April 2011 .

It has pitted religious freedom advocates against those who say the Islamic veil is demeaning to women and inconsistent with France 's rigorously enforced secularism .

A 24-year-old French woman brought the case to Europe 's top rights court in Strasbourg because she says the ban infringes on her ability to live according to her religious faith , culture and personal convictions .

But the court said Tuesday that it found that the French law does n't breach the European Convention on Human Rights .

Muslim woman 's case

The woman , a devout Muslim whose name has not been disclosed , had tried to draw on several articles of the convention to make her case .

Those articles cover the right to respect for private and family life ; the right to respect for freedom of thought , conscience and religion ; and the prohibition of discrimination .

The woman said no member of her family has put pressure on her to wear the burqa and niqab . She wears them in public and private , but not all the time , she said .

The European Court of Human Rights started hearing the case in November .

Debate in France

The French Constitutional Council said in 2010 that the law does not impose disproportionate punishments or prevent the free exercise of religion in a place of worship , finding therefore that `` the law conforms to the Constitution . ''

But critics argue the government has no business telling people what clothes to wear or how to practice their religion .

The law drew criticism from some human rights and religious organizations and some Muslims as discriminatory . France has Western Europe 's largest Muslim population .

The French law imposes a fine of 150 euros -LRB- about $ 205 -RRB- for wearing the items . The person breaking the law can be asked to carry out public service duty as part of the punishment or as an alternative to the fine .

When the legislation came into effect , some analysts said it was largely born out of internal French politics , with former President Nicolas Sarkozy 's center-right party seeking to fend off a challenge from a more hard-line right wing .
