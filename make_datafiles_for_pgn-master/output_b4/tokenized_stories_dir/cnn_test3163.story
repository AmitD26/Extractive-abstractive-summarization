A New Mexico man is suing police for allegedly `` subjecting him to multiple digital penetrations and three enemas , '' among other `` shockingly invasive medical procedures '' -- all on an invalid warrant , all without finding any drugs -- his lawyers claim .

The lawsuit states that David Eckert , 54 , spent more than 12 hours in custody last January at a police station and local hospital after being pulled over for a traffic violation . Yet he was never charged , nor did authorities find illicit substances on him .

`` Defendants acted completely outside the bounds of human decency by orchestrating wholly superfluous physical body cavity searches performed by an unethical medical professional , '' states the lawsuit , which was filed earlier this year but has garnered more public attention in recent days .

Police in Deming , New Mexico , did not return multiple messages left by CNN on Wednesday seeking their side of the story . The city attorney 's office also did not offer an immediate comment after being contacted Wednesday .

According to a police affidavit accompanying the lawsuit , a detective asked a different officer to pull over Eckert 's 1998 brown Dodge pickup truck for not properly stopping at a stop sign .

After Eckert was pulled over , a Deming police officer said that he saw Eckert `` was avoiding eye contact with me , '' his `` left hand began to shake , '' and he stood `` erect -LRB- with -RRB- his legs together , '' the affidavit stated .

Eckert was told he could go home after a third officer issued him a traffic citation . But before he did , Eckert voluntarily consented to a search of him and his vehicle , the affidavit states . A K-9 dog subsequently hit on a spot in the Dodge 's driver 's seat , though no drugs were found .

`` Hildalgo County K-9 officer did inform me that he had dealt with Mr. Eckert on a previous case and stated that Mr. Eckert was known to insert drugs into his anal cavity and had been caught in Hidalgo County with drugs in his anal cavity , '' the affidavit said .

While CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim , a search of Eckert 's criminal history found he 's been arrested several times on drug possession charges , though many of those charges were dismissed .

Outrage over highway body cavity search

Eckert was then put in `` investigative detention '' and transported around 2 p.m. to the Deming Police Department .

Sometime after that , a judge signed off a search warrant `` to include but not limited to his anal cavity . ''

The next stop was Gila Regional Medical Center , where the lawsuit states `` no drugs were found '' in `` an x-ray and two digital searches of his rectum by two different doctors . '' One doctor at this time found nothing unusual in his stool .

Three enemas were conducted on Eckert after 10:20 p.m. . A chest X-ray followed , succeeded by a colonoscopy around 1:25 a.m. .

After all this , `` no drugs were found in or on Plaintiff 's person , '' according to the lawsuit .

Because he `` merely looked nervous during a traffic stop , '' the lawsuit claims that authorities ended up violating Eckert 's constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures on a number of grounds .

One was that `` the language in the warrant was overly broad and , therefore , invalid , '' said the plaintiff , asserting that the chest X-ray and colonoscopy , for instance , were n't related or confined to the `` anal cavity . ''

Moreover , many of the tests took place outside the 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. timeframe for which any such search warrant -LRB- unless otherwise authorized -RRB- is legally valid under New Mexico law , according to the lawsuit .

`` While the war on drugs has resulted in aggressive government tactics , '' the suit added , `` the Supreme Court has never authorized the seizing of an alleged drug user for forced medical procedures to purge their bodies of drugs . ''
