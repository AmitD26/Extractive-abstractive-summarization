Mexico City , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As more governments approve same-sex marriage laws , officials here are hoping to attract a growing part of the tourism market : gay honeymoons .

The first couple to wed under Argentina 's recent law allowing same-sex marriages nationwide arrives in Mexico this week on an all-expenses-paid trip -- part of a new push by the government in Mexico City , Mexico to woo gay travelers .

`` We hope that many same-sex couples who get married around the world spend their honeymoons here , '' says Alejandro Rojas , the city 's tourism secretary .

In July , the city opened an office aimed at catering to gay tourists that officials describe as the first of its kind in Latin America .

`` We are a very tolerant , liberal , avant-garde city , '' Rojas says .

Officials inaugurated the new office by cutting a rainbow-colored ribbon . Rojas said the office 's goal is to make Mexico City the No. 1 gay-friendly destination in Latin America .

`` Mexico has a tradition of being a rather macho culture ... This is a sign of a very important social change , '' says Argentinean architect Jose Luis David Navarro , who will be spending part of his honeymoon in Mexico City this week .

The city 's tourism secretary called to congratulate Navarro and his husband soon after they wed in northern Argentina in July .

For years , it was rare to see gay rights issues gaining traction in Mexico and other Latin American countries .

Not anymore , according to Javier Corrales , a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts .

`` Latin America currently has some of the most gay-friendly cities in the developing world , '' says Corrales , who ranks cities ' gay-friendliness in a new book he co-edited , `` The Politics of Sexuality in Latin America . ''

Homosexuality remains a divisive issue in much of Mexico , with conservative politicians pushing for laws banning same-sex marriage in many states after Mexico City approved a gay marriage law last year .

The country 's Roman Catholic Church leaders have been vocal opponents of the Mexico City law , which took effect in March and also allows married gay couples to adopt children .

But Mexico City officials say they hope to set a strong example that the rest of the country will follow .

Project plans for the new gay tourism office are still in the works .

In addition to training local hotels and restaurants on how to be sensitive to gay clientele , officials say they hope to create maps of the city highlighting attractions for gay tourists and possibly host an international gay tourism conference .

Hotels , restaurants and businesses in Mexico City have responded positively to the program so far , Rojas said .

So many sponsors offered to chip in for the Argentinean couple 's free honeymoon that the city government did n't have to contribute any funds .

The annual economic impact of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender travelers is about $ 63 billion in the U.S. alone , according to Community Marketing , Inc. of San Francisco , California . On the global scale , Rojas says , that number is even greater .

`` Around the world , it is a very important market , '' Rojas says .

Gay tourists represent 15 percent of the world 's tourism market , and they spend more money than heterosexual tourists when they travel , he says .

Recognizing the commercial value of gay tourism is a positive step , Navarro says , but it also shows that more social change is needed .

`` I hope that there comes a day in the future when they do n't have to have an office for gay tourists , just like there is n't an office for Asian tourists , '' Navarro says .

But for now , he says , he and his husband are looking forward to the chance to visit Mexico City for the first time .

`` Our suitcase is already packed , '' he says . `` After 27 years of happiness together , this is the icing on the cake . ''
