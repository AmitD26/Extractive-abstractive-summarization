You 've heard of CNN , but unless you pay close attention to photo and video credits on news sites , you 've probably never heard of the Syrian group SNN .

The Shaam News Network is one of several groups that aggregates photos and videos taken by citizen journalists in Syria and tries to show them to the world .

Most recently , the group came into the news on Friday after it played a role in distributing images from a U.N.-condemned massacre in the village of Houla , which left 108 people dead , including some children who reportedly were axed to death .

YouTube , meanwhile , put a collection of 10 videos from Houla on its homepage on Saturday in an effort to raise awareness about the bloodshed there .

Of all the content , one particular photo -- of a tile room lined with bodies wrapped in white cloth -- became the de facto symbol of the violence in Houla . It has been run by numerous news websites , including this one , with credit attributed to Shaam News .

The photo and the group highlight a crucial trend as the government of Bashar al-Assad continues to crack down on protestors and rebels : Activists and everyday people have taken it upon themselves to record violence against themselves and their neighbors and to distribute it online . And they do so at great risk to themselves .

`` Perhaps the single most important way that people are telling their stories is through clips uploaded through YouTube , '' Ausama Monajed , a member of Syria 's opposition group , said during a recent talk at the Oslo Freedom Forum , according to a live blog of the event that was posted online . `` And activist have learned that for this information to be credible , it must be properly dated and documented . And they are hoping that one day , these videos may be used to bring the regime to justice .

`` If a picture is worth a thousand words , a video is worth a thousand times more . ''

Should the U.S. ` airdrop ' millions of phones into Syria ?

Networks like SNN have become aggregators and , in a sense , gatekeepers to the videos uploaded by citizen journalists . Syrians often will upload controversial videos to YouTube anonymously and without any information about the content , said David Clinch , editorial director at Storyful , a company that verifies and distributes videos from citizen journalists to news organizations . The videographers then text information to aggregators like SNN , which adds details and distributes the videos more widely .

The division of labor is intended to make the process of uploading information safer for all those involved , he said . And in a place where it 's difficult or sometimes impossible for journalists to report on the news , these images have become all the more important , said Clinch , who is a former CNN employee .

`` It 's hugely significant , '' he said . `` As far as I can tell there were no international journalists anywhere near Houla when this happened and so the only original video from when the immediate aftermath -- not just of the bodies but of the shelling and everything else -- was provided by what you could call citizen journalists . ''

He added : `` By the time the U.N. got there the next day and shot video themselves , any number of things could have been changed or moved and manipulated . ''

CNN can not verify the authenticity of all photos and video submitted by citizen journalists in Syria , in part because the government restricts the movement of journalists in the country . Clinch said aggregators like Shaam are somewhat helpful at attempting to verify the authenticity of this kind of media , but they do n't always get it right .

As The Atlantic 's Max Fisher wrote on Monday , at least one fake image from the massacre in Syria made it onto a major news website . The mistake , made by the BBC , `` seems like an innocent one , and is in some ways an inevitable result of the changing ways in which international media cover conflict zones , '' he wrote .

Shaam was founded in 2011 , after the conflict began , by a man named Abulhassan Abazeed , according to an e-mail from a man who identified himself as Jafar Alkheer , and who is acting as a spokesman for the organization . Even he does not know how many people contribute to Shaam News . `` There 's no specific number of activities as some of them have been arrested , killed , or wounded the remaining volunteers are not dedicated to reporting to the network , '' he said .

The group 's goal is to counteract misinformation from the Syrian regime . He added : `` We do n't have any kind of protection from any organization , we are always in danger . ''

According to its website and Facebook page , Shaam is headquartered in Damascus , the Syrian capital .

Anas Qtiesh , a Syrian activist based in San Francisco , said SNN has been a `` prime source '' for videos and grassroots information coming out of Syria . The group has become so closely watched that fake SNN accounts have popped up on Facebook and YouTube , Qtiesh said , with similar logs but wildly different information .

`` They are really valuable , '' he said . `` It 's just very tricky to verify it sometimes because the regime often fakes activist videos just to discredit them . ''

He added : `` Videos spread like wildfire once they 're out so it 's very important that they be verified before they 're uploaded . ''

Qtiesh pointed to a Facebook page for `` Shaaam News , '' with too many A 's in its name , and three YouTube channels -- shaamnews2 , shaamnews6 and shaamnews10 -- as fakes that are likely operated by people loyal to the al-Assad regime in Syria .

YouTube , the Google-owned video site , is working with Storyful to try to verify activist videos from Syria and distribute them via its website . The company has created a Human Rights channel and a CitizenTube channel to highlight the verified videos .

YouTube appears to be making efforts to keep content that has high news value on its platform , even if the content could be deemed objectionable or graphic . The video channel occasionally marks clips as graphic or requires users to sign in to prove that they are older than 18 before watching videos that are violent or gruesome .

Jillian York , director of international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , said in an e-mail that YouTube and Facebook generally are doing a good job of making sure videos from Syrian activists surface on their platforms .

`` YouTube has been great about keeping content up , even recently creating a human rights channel with the organization Witness , '' she said . `` Their policy is , explicitly , to keep up violent content if it is educational or documentarian in nature . ''

A YouTube spokeswoman declined to comment on the record for this story .

Getting the videos from Syria to the Internet is , of course , a major challenge .

Clinch , from Storyful , said many Syrian activists upload videos via proxy servers , which are located in other countries , so that it 's more difficult for the government to track them . They also may scramble their communications or run small hard drives or camera cards across the border to neighboring countries so that they can be uploaded , he said .

The Syrian government , meanwhile , has been tracking their efforts with some success .

According to a report from CNN 's Ben Brumfield : `` Supporters of dictator Bashar al-Assad first steal the identities of opposition activists , then impersonate them in online chats , said software engineer Dlshad Othman . They gain the trust of other users , pass out Trojan horse viruses and encourage people to open them . ''

Clinch said dozens of YouTube videos still are uploaded from Syria every day . Watching these clips , from SNN and many others , is perhaps the best and fastest way , he said , to get a sense of what 's really going on inside the country right now .

Four journalists have been killed in Syria since the conflict began , according to the activist group Reporters Without Borders . U.N. officials say more than 9,000 people have died in the conflict , which began in March 2011 .

Opposition groups put the number at more than 11,000 .
