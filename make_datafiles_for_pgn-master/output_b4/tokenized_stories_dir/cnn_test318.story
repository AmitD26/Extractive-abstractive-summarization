-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Frustrated parents are dumping their teenagers at Nebraska hospitals -- even crossing state lines to do it -- and the state Legislature has scheduled a special hearing to try to stem the tide .

A 14-year-old Iowa girl was left Tuesday at Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha , Nebraska .

Nebraska 's `` safe haven '' law , intended to allow parents to anonymously hand over an infant to a hospital without being prosecuted , is n't working out as planned .

Of the 17 children relinquished since the law took effect in July , only four are younger than 10 -- and all four are among the nine siblings abandoned by a man September 24 at an Omaha hospital .

On Tuesday , a 14-year-old girl from Council Bluffs , Iowa , was abandoned at Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha , Nebraska , just across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs . The case marks the first time a parent has crossed state lines to abandon a teenager in Nebraska , authorities said .

`` The few situations we 've seen so far demonstrate the need for a change in Nebraska 's safe haven law , '' Gov. Dave Heineman said in a statement Monday . `` In the coming legislative session , I will advocate for changes that put the focus back on protecting an infant in danger . That should be our priority . ''

All 50 states have safe haven laws , but only Nebraska 's lacks an age limit . Nebraska 's part-time Legislature is adjourned until January , but two state legislative committees will hold a joint hearing November 13 to discuss a remedy .

`` They 've got a huge problem , '' said Linda Spears , vice president for policy and public affairs for the Child Welfare League of America . `` It 's a pretty poorly constructed law to meet its original intent . ''

When it was introduced in the Legislature , the bill had a presumed age limitation of 72 hours , said Todd Landry , director of the state 's Division of Children and Family Services .

`` The original intent was to protect infants from the immediate danger of being harmed , '' he said .

However , the law 's final language uses the word `` child '' and does not specify an age limit , leaving it open to interpretation . Other states ' laws specify the maximum age at which a child may be relinquished , ranging from 72 hours in several states to 1 year in North Dakota , according to the National Center for State Courts .

`` Clearly in these cases so far that we 've seen , none of these children were in any immediate danger of being harmed , '' Landry said . `` It is our opinion that the law does need to be modified . ''

The law is being abused , Heineman 's statement said .

`` Safe haven laws were not designed to allow families having difficulty with older youth and teenagers to abandon their children or responsibilities as parents , '' he said .

The parents may not always be to blame , the Child Welfare League 's Spears said .

`` The original safe haven laws were created for young moms who are having babies who did n't know how to get help . I think these are families with older kids who do n't know how to get help and who are in desperate need , '' she said .

Most state laws fail to provide for research into who is abandoning babies and why , league spokeswoman Joyce Johnson said .

`` Those are the kinds of things we 've been wondering about and saying we need to know more about , and you 'll never know if you just have a law that says you can anonymously leave a child somewhere , no questions asked , '' Johnson said .

New Jersey , she said , is an exception . That state 's safe haven law provides funding for research and evaluation as well as $ 500,000 a year for public awareness , according to a September 2007 report by a New Jersey safe haven task force .

A woman who dropped her 15-year-old nephew at a Lincoln , Nebraska , hospital told CNN affiliate KETV last month that she and the boy 's guardian could no longer handle his behavior problems . Watch woman explain why she left 15-year-old at hospital ''

The woman , Cathy Poulin , said she tried discipline and medication , but nothing worked . The boy 's mother died several years ago , and his father left him , she said .

`` We had to go to the next level , '' Poulin said . `` He can be made to get help . ''

The Omaha man who left his nine children , ages 1 to 17 , at Creighton University Medical Center was overwhelmed by the sudden death of his wife after the youngest child was born , he told KETV .

`` I was with her for 17 years , and then she was gone . What was I going to do ? '' Gary Staton said . `` We raised them together . I did n't think I could do it alone . I fell apart . I could n't take care of them . ''

Staton is just the kind of parent whom safe haven laws fail to help , Johnson said .

`` He was grieving , he did n't have a lot of money , and all those children -- he was trying to figure out how to feed them , how to clothe them , and deal with the grief of losing his wife . He needed help , '' she said .

Heineman and Landry urged Nebraska parents who are having trouble coping to call the United Way 's 211 resource line or Boys Town , a nationally known nonprofit child services organization based in Nebraska .

Other options include community and faith-based support groups , crisis hot lines , treatment centers and other services , Landry added .
