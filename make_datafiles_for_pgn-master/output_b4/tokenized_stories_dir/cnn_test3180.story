Malta can not afford to continue supporting migrants from war-torn countries in its over-crowded detention camps , the country 's foreign minister has told CNN .

Speaking with CNN 's Isa Soares , George Vella said that while he did n't want to blame the migrants , they `` do not help themselves '' in the immigration enclosures as they `` break toilets '' and `` smear the place . ''

When asked what the government can do to improve living conditions in the detention camp , Vela responded : `` They do n't care for the facilities they have ... we can not afford to carry on looking after all these numbers , and utilizing our resources . ''

Vella continued : `` We can not offer these people the opportunities for which they left their countries and risked their lives to get a better life , many of them do n't want to come to Malta , they come by chance as the boat drifts . ''

But Vella believes that measures to manage border control do not go far enough and said more needs to be done to tackle the root of the problem in troubled countries .

On Thursday , more than 200 migrants were rescued from an overcrowded boat in rough waters in the Mediterranean Sea , according to the Italian navy . The boat was spotted about 80 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa , another refugee hotspot .
