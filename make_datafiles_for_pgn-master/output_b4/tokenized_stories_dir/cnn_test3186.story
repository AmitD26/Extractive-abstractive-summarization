New Delhi , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- The North Korean ambassador in Bangladesh issued an apology after one of the embassy 's diplomats was caught carrying 27 kilograms -LRB- 59 pounds -RRB- of undeclared gold into the country 's main airport in Dhaka , according to officials in Bangladesh .

North Korean officials could not be reached for comment . Meanwhile , state media in the largely isolated communist country has not yet reported on the incident .

Kazi Muhammad Ziauddin , a top official in Bangladesh 's customs agency , told CNN his officers discovered the gold on the afternoon of March 5th , after the diplomat arrived on a Singapore Airlines flight .

Ziauddin said customs officials had received a confidential tip that a North Korean diplomat would be carrying `` illegal items . ''

`` It was very tough . We have to be very careful and sensitive when we deal with a diplomat , '' Ziauddin said , referring to the Vienna Convention , which affords diplomats certain degrees of consular immunity .

He said the suspect , whom he identified as Son Young Nam , the first secretary of North Korea 's embassy in Dhaka , initially refused to allow his baggage to be searched .

`` He said there is no way we can open or scan his bag , '' Ziauddin said . `` At first he said ` This is an electric motor . ' After further questioning he changed his mind and told us , ` These are cipher machines and very confidential . ' ''

Eventually , customs officers opened the diplomat 's bag and found the undeclared goods , that included 170 gold bars and golden ornaments .

At current market prices , the gold would be valued at around $ 1 million .

Entering Bangladesh without declaring this quantity of precious metal is a violation of the country 's customs regulations .

An official with Bangladesh 's Foreign Secretary , speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity , said his government lodged a protest with the North Korean ambassador .

It 's far too early to jump to conclusions about whether the alleged gold smuggling incident could be an isolated example of corruption or an effort to move official funds .

Due to international sanctions , North Korea faces substantial obstacles when trying to access international banking systems .

`` It would be interesting to see if -LSB- the diplomat -RSB- is disciplined when he gets back '' to North Korea , said John Delury , associate professor at Yonsei University 's Graduate School of International Studies . `` That would be a way of saying whether or not he 's a corrupt diplomat . ''

According to the Foreign Secretary 's office in Bangladesh , the North Korean diplomat allegedly caught carrying the gold has since left the country .
