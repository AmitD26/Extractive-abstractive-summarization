-LRB- CNN -RRB- A video purportedly shows three British schoolgirls preparing to cross the Turkish border last month into Syria , where the teens are believed to have traveled to join ISIS , a Turkish TV network reported Friday .

If authentic , the video would represent the first publicly released images showing the girls at the Turkey-Syria border .

The video , released by Turkish TV network A Haber and distributed by Reuters , shows three warmly dressed females who resemble the missing teens standing with luggage outside a car and talking to at least one man who is helping them with the bags .

The footage purportedly was recorded February 19 in the southeastern Turkish city of Gaziantep , just north of Aleppo , Syria , A Haber reported . Two days before , East London classmates Shamima Begum , 15 , Kadiza Sultana , 16 , and Amira Abase , 15 , boarded a Turkish Airlines plane from London 's Gatwick Airport to Istanbul without their families ' knowledge , according to British police .

`` Put your bags . ... Hurry , do n't stop here , '' a man says in the video .

The girls in the video wear coats , two with fur-lined hoods covering their heads . A third wears a hijab .

One appears to be looking at a cell phone .

`` He just hung up , '' one of them says .

A man takes a bag from the trunk of a yellow vehicle . The vehicle 's license plate has a number that indicates it is registered in the Gaziantep area .

It was n't immediately clear how A Haber obtained the video . CNN could n't immediately verify the footage 's authenticity .

The video 's release came a day after Turkey 's foreign minister said his country arrested a `` spy '' who allegedly helped the British girls get into Syria . The alleged agent was working for a country that is part of an international anti-ISIS coalition , Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday .

Separately , a Turkish official speaking on condition of anonymity said that the suspect is not Turkish , and is not a citizen of the country for which he was working .

This month , a Turkish broadcaster released images that it said showed the British girls boarding a bus in Istanbul after they arrived from London .

They are thought to have crossed the Turkish border into Syria within days .

A trip to Gaziantep would have been long : The border town is more than 525 miles to the southeast of Istanbul .

Authorities have said they have no reason to believe the girls are still in Turkey and believe they have crossed into Syria , parts of which have been taken over by Islamist terror group ISIS .

The girls ' parents have publicly begged for them to come home .

Days before they left for Turkey , at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman , Aqsa Mahmood , who left her home in Scotland to travel to Syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media .

She has posted tips for girls and young women wanting to travel to Syria to marry jihadis , as she did . Her blog also has links to advice posted by another jihad supporter , which recommends that those traveling to Syria seek to pack the essentials but not too much , since they may need to move often and at short notice , while remaining inconspicuous .
