-LRB- CNN -RRB- Saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in Yemen on Thursday , with Saudi Arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor 's civil war , potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the Middle East .

The swift and sudden action involved 100 Saudi jets , 30 from the United Arab Emirates , 15 each from Kuwait and Bahrain , 10 from Qatar , and a handful from Jordan , Morocco and Sudan , plus naval help from Pakistan and Egypt , according to a Saudi adviser .

The Egyptian state news agency on Thursday quoted Egypt 's Foreign Ministry as saying Egypt 's support also could involve ground forces .

What do those countries have in common ? They 're all predominantly Sunni Muslim -- in contrast to the Houthi rebels , Shiite Muslims who have taken over Yemen 's capital of Sanaa and on Wednesday captured parts of its second-largest city , Aden . The Saudis consider the Houthis proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region .

`` What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border , '' CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis .

The airstrikes did not include warplanes from the United States , which has worked with Yemeni governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi -- to go after al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . In fact , a senior official in President Barack Obama 's administration said `` there will be no military intervention by the U.S. ''

But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday did tell foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia , the UAE , Qatar , Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing , targeting assistance and logistical support , according to a senior State Department official .

How did Yemen get to this place ?

Houthi supreme leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV , saying , `` If any army try to invade our country , we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us . ''

He added , `` We call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner . ''

Iran denounced the military intervention . Marzieh Afkham , a spokeswoman for the country 's Foreign Ministry , said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen 's monthslong internal strife . It also wo n't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda , she said .

`` This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries ' national sovereignty , '' Afkham said , according to a report in Iran 's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency .

Iraq -- 60 % of whose citizens are Shiite , with about 20 % being Sunnis -- offered similar , albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its Foreign Ministry called `` the military interference of the Gulf Cooperation Council , '' which is made up of Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the UAE .

`` We call on the Arab states to live up to their role to support national dialogue -LRB- that includes -RRB- all political forces to find a political solution for the crisis , '' the Iraqi ministry said .

The Houthis are a minority group that has emerged as the most powerful player in Yemen .

In addition to airstrikes , the Saudi adviser said 150,000 troops could take part in an operation in Yemen .

Just a day in , the coalition airstrikes are already costing the Houthis .

Hundreds of explosions ripped through Sanaa overnight , said journalist Hakim Almasmari , who is staying in the capital . The Health Ministry reported 18 dead and 24 wounded in Sanaa , the Houthi-run Saba news agency said .

While Sanaa was a focus -- airstrikes destroyed the Houthis ' combat and control operations there , the Saudi adviser said -- it was n't the only place struck . Compounds and military installations in Saada and Taiz also were targeted .

By Thursday afternoon , the Saudis controlled Yemeni airspace , the adviser said , and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter Yemeni ports .

The military operation , dubbed al-Hazm Storm , was launched after the Houthis rebuffed an initiative by the Gulf Cooperation Council , Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi said in a speech Thursday . It was done in accord with a joint Arab defense treaty , al-Arabi said .

Specifically , the strikes aim to support Hadi , who was ousted in January after talks with the Houthis faltered , but still claims to be Yemen 's rightful leader .

`` We are determined to protect the legitimate government of Yemen , '' said Adel al-Jubeir , the Saudi ambassador to the United States , in announcing the beginning of the military campaign . `` Having Yemen fail can not be an option for us or for our coalition partners . ''

Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen ?

Jubeir told CNN 's `` The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer '' that Saudi Arabia was concerned that the Houthis had control over Yemen 's armed forces ballistic missiles and air force , and the fact that Iran backs the Houthis was troubling .

`` This is really a war to defend the legitimate government of Yemen and protect the Yemeni people from takeover by a radical militant group aligned with Iran and Hezbollah , '' he said .

American military commanders said they did n't know about Saudi Arabia 's action until the last minute .

`` We have been discussing this matter with the United States in principle for many months , '' Jubeir said . `` We have been discussing this matter in more detail as the time approached and the final decision to take action did n't really happen until the last minute , because of circumstances in Yemen . ''

Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Thursday proposed a joint Arab military `` to deal with these challenges . ''

But at least one major player in Yemen besides the Houthis -- the General People 's Congress , which is the party of longtime leader Ali Abdullah Saleh -- thinks the Saudis and their partners should stay out .

The GPC says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties . The best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table , the group said .

`` The -LRB- party -RRB- expresses its rejection of the attack on the Republic of Yemen and the capital , Sanaa , considering what -LRB- is -RRB- happening is an internal affair , '' the GPC said . '' ... The General People 's Congress -LRB- calls on all parties -RRB- to return to and accelerate the completion of a national , historic agreement that ... maintains unity and democracy . ''

Meanwhile , the last person to be elected president of Yemen -- even if he was the only one on the ballot -- is out of the country and will soon be headed to Egypt to petition Arab officials , according to Yemeni officials .

The location of Hadi had been a mystery for days , with conflicting reports about whether he 'd left Yemen and where he 'd gone .

Saudi Arabia 's state news agency , SPA , reported that Hadi arrived Thursday in Riyadh , where he met with the Saudi defense minister and intelligence chief .

But two Yemeni officials close to Hadi said that the deposed president is in Oman . They said that his next stop , on Friday , will be an Arab League summit in Sharm el-Sheikh , Egypt .

Meanwhile , some 3,000 to 5,000 troops from the Saudi-led coalition are expected to reach Aden , the Yemeni city that was Hadi 's last known location , in the next three days , according to the officials .

Their aim is to make that port city safe enough for Hadi to return after the Arab League summit .

Whether the rest of Yemen will be secure at that point is another matter . Unfortunately , there has been little in the last few months to inspire optimism that peace is around the corner .
