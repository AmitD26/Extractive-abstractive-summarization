-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Perhaps the blog VentureBeat put it best : `` Twitter appears to have a problem sharing friends . ''

Twitter on Wednesday pulled access to a friend-finding feature that let Tumblr users search for contacts on Twitter who also use that blogging platform , Tumblr said in a statement . Tumblr users still can find friends using Facebook and Google .

It 's just the latest news in the saga concerning what critics say is Twitter 's inability to play nice with its friends on the Internet . The social platform , once known for its openness , has been putting up walls around its service to make it more difficult for other sites and apps to access its data .

Twitter largely has been mum on its motives for these changes , but some people have defended the company , saying it has to take control of its data to turn a profit .

`` I do n't think people understand that Twitter is a start-up that has to make money , not a non-profit-up , '' New York Times writer Nick Bilton said on Twitter .

Tumblr is not happy about the most recent change .

`` To our dismay , Twitter has restricted our users ' ability to ` Find Twitter Friends ' on Tumblr , '' a spokeswoman said in a statement . `` Given our history of embracing their platform , this is especially upsetting .

`` Our syndication feature is responsible for hundreds of millions of tweets , and we eagerly enabled Twitter Cards across 70 million blogs and 30 billion posts as one of Twitter 's first partners . While we 're delighted by the response to our integrations with Facebook and Gmail , we are truly disappointed by Twitter 's decision . ''

In July , Twitter revoked friend-finding access to the photo-sharing app Instagram , which is owned by Facebook . And it restricted the professional network LinkedIn , too .

`` Consistent with Twitter 's evolving platform efforts , Tweets will no longer be displayed on LinkedIn starting later today , '' LinkedIn wrote in June blog post . `` We know many of you value Twitter as an additional way to broadcast professional content beyond your LinkedIn connections . Moving forward , you will still be able to share your updates with your Twitter audience by posting them on LinkedIn . ''

Twitter also announced changes last week to some of the rules governing the way it shares data about its users with other sites . They go into effect in six months .

The company , which acquired Tumblr 's competitor , Posterous , in March , issued the following statement to CNN via e-mail : `` Some folks covering this have pointed to our comment from the Instagram situation . -LRB- ` We understand that there 's great value associated with Twitter 's follow graph data , and we can confirm that it is no longer available within Instagram . ' -RRB- We do n't have anything to share beyond that . ''

Twitter 's recent moves have been met with considerable criticism .

`` This reeks of grade-school drama , '' Jennifer Van Grove of VentureBeat wrote in reference to the Tumblr friend-finder change . `` It 's the second instance of Twitter acting like a bully and refusing to share its friends on the social networking playground . ''

Matt Buchanan , the BuzzFeed writer who predicted that Twitter would block Tumblr 's friend-find feature , writes that all of these changes are confusing for developers of Twitter apps . Twitter increasingly sees these apps as competition , he writes .

`` It 's easy enough to say that the One Rule to Rule Them All is , ` Do n't compete with Twitter . ' Which is fine and dandy , because it 's all for the greater good of Twitter or whatever . The problem is that it 's real easy to be a valuable , contributing member of the ecosystem today and then tomorrow find out that you 're now competition waiting to be crushed . ''

The Next Web said , `` This is part of Twitter turning the screws on sharing information about the users of its network . ''
