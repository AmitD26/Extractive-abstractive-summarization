Rome -LRB- CNN -RRB- Italy 's highest court Friday will consider whether to uphold the 2009 murder conviction of American Amanda Knox , according to Judge Gennaro Marasca .

The high court judge will either uphold the murder convictions of Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend , or send the case back for another appeal , or potentially on to a different section of the court .

Knox , a 27-year-old Seattle native , and Raffaele Sollecito were convicted of the 2007 killing of Knox 's British roommate , Meredith Kercher . Knox and Kercher lived together in Italy at the time of Kercher 's death .

Sollecito and Knox were acquitted in 2011 on appeal , and then Knox returned to the United States . However , Italy 's Supreme Court overturned the acquittals in 2013 , and they were convicted last year after a retrial .

If a new trial is ordered , Knox and Sollecito will buy a little time before a final decision is reached . But if the court upholds the conviction , the case will be closed for good -- and what happens to Knox next is uncertain .

Conventional wisdom dictates that Knox will eventually face an extradition hearing or reach a deal with the Italian Justice Ministry to serve her 28-year sentence , but that could take years . The statute of limitations is double the sentence , meaning the Italians have 57 years to bring her back to the country .

Knox , however , would benefit from the United States ' extradition treaty with Italy -- under which the United States will not extradite a person who has been acquitted -- and from the U.S. Constitution 's protection against double jeopardy .

Sollecito , on the other hand , still lives in Italy , and has a lot more to lose than Knox does , at least in the short term . He would be scooped up immediately and hauled off to prison to start a 25-year sentence . All of his options will have been exhausted and he will have no choice but to go to directly to jail .

Sollecito earlier said he would be in court on Wednesday to face the judge . `` I 've been living this for eight years , '' he told the Italian crime TV program `` Quarto Grado . '' Not appearing in court would be like hiding in the corner during a tsunami -- it will take you away anyway . ''

Rudy Guede , from the Ivory Coast , was convicted separately in a fast-track trial and is midway through a 16-year sentence for Kercher 's murder . His case was confirmed by Italy 's high court in 2010 .

Many commentators in the U.S. have reasoned that Italy may not ask the United States for Knox 's extradition because it would cause a diplomatic rift between the two nations . But there could be a greater rift if it appears that Knox gets away with murder and her Italian ex-boyfriend pays for the crime .

If Sollecito is languishing in prison and Knox is sipping Frappuccino in a Seattle Starbucks , Italians will not be pleased , says Alessandro Capponi , an Italian journalist for Corriere Della Sera who has been covering the case since Kercher was killed in 2007 .

`` It will be seen as an injustice , '' Capponi told CNN . `` You may not see people out on the streets , but if you ask 10 people what they think , those 10 people will tell you they see it as a complete injustice that only the Italian and the African are in prison . The Italians will say that the American gets away with murder and it wo n't be the first time . ''

This is not the first time Italy and the United States have butted heads on matters involving American suspects accused of crimes in Italy .

In 1998 , an American Marine aircraft sliced through a ski lift cable in the Dolomites , sending 20 people plummeting to their death . Even after admitting to destroying the videotape of the deadly flight , only two of the four Marines were charged and convicted . Only one served jail time -- just over four months of a six-month sentence .

In 2012 , Italy 's highest court upheld the convictions of 23 Americans -LRB- 22 CIA agents and an Air Force pilot -RRB- for the kidnapping of Egyptian cleric Abu Omar , a suspeced terrorist , from a street in Milan . They were sentenced to between five and eight years in prison , but Italy has not yet asked for extradition .

`` Our relationship with the United States is full of these diplomatic tensions , '' said Capponi . `` This will just be added to the list . ''

Knox 's case has been divisive from the start , and her supporters have come down hard on the Italian judicial system . Sollecito has never had the luxury of that attitude , knowing full well that he is in the hands of the system whether he likes it or not , so vocally criticizing it would n't be in his best interest .

In fact , he has long suffered the impact of Knox 's ardent campaigners who have mostly criticized Italy from the other side of the Atlantic .

By almost any Italian precedent , Sollecito should not have had to be in prison during his initial trial -- but because Knox was deemed a flight risk , she had to stay in jail . Because Sollecito was her co-defendant , he did too , even though he had no ties to anyone abroad .

`` Knox could still beat the system , but Sollecito 's game is up if the convictions are upheld , '' Nicola Canestrini , an Italian extradition lawyer familiar with both legal systems , told CNN . `` He has no wiggle room and it could be that he serves the time for both of them , which will likely cause deep resentment here in Italy . ''

Perhaps a little too late , Sollecito 's defense team has been slowly inching away from Knox , especially since the latest conviction .

Last summer , he held a press conference when his lawyers filed their appeal to the high court , in which his lawyer Giulia Bongiorno pointed out `` certain anomalies '' in Knox 's testimony that have nothing to do with Sollecito .

`` We ask that the court to not extend the anomalies of Amanda 's testimony to Raffaele , '' Bongiorno said at the time .

Whether that is enough to get the high court to give Sollecito another , independent chance is yet to be seen .

`` I am not a crazy person . I am not a criminal . I am innocent , '' Sollecito told reporters last summer at the press conference . `` But my name is Raffaele Sollecito , not Amanda Marie Knox . ''

Now it is up to the judge to determine whether that makes any difference .
