-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While Fernando Alonso has overcome the shortcomings of his 2012 Ferrari to be an early title contender , the two-time world champion 's teammate Felipe Massa is facing an uncertain future after a disappointing start to the Formula One season .

Massa was again well off the pace at the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday , despite improvements to the vehicle which helped Alonso finish second and move level on points with championship leader Sebastian Vettel .

The Brazilian suffered the embarrassment of being lapped by Alonso and Williams ' race winner Pastor Maldonado , coming in 15th to leave him with just two points from the opening five rounds .

Ferrari 's team principal Stefano Domenicali publicly backed the under-performing 31-year-old in March , but Massa has now been told better results will be expected when the championship resumes in Monaco on May 27 .

`` Felipe was very unlucky , both in the race and in qualifying , '' read a statement on Ferrari 's official website .

`` But everyone , he more than anyone , is expecting a change of gear starting right away with the Monaco Grand Prix , his second home race , given that he lives just a few hundred meters from what , as from next Sunday , will be transformed into the paddock for the sixth round of the 2012 championship . ''

Massa 's most successful year in the elite division of motorsport was in 2008 , when he was denied a first world championship crown by McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton on the final corner of the final race .

But the former Sauber driver has struggled to reach those heights since , partly due to a freak accident at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix which left him with a fractured skull . His form has also spiraled since being told to let Alonso pass him while leading a race in Germany in 2010 .

The last time the first five races were won by five different drivers was in 1983 , and Domenicali believes Ferrari can be true contenders despite a lack of early-season pace .

`` It takes very little to change the hierarchy among the teams and this rule is even more true when the differences are just a few tenths or even hundredths , '' he said .

`` This year , the winner will be whoever manages to bring the best technical updates to the track in the shortest time possible : staying still for just a handful of races could mean finishing out of the points , given that so many teams have proved capable of fighting for the top places .

`` We achieved our goal of making a step forward in Spain , but we must continue down this path , especially as the gap to the time that gave Hamilton his pole position is still too big . ''

Meanwhile , F1 chiefs are still investigating the fire that cast a shadow over Williams ' first grand prix victory since 2004 and the first race victory by a Venezuelan driver .

The blaze in the British team 's garage left seven people in hospital , but a statement released by Williams on Monday confirmed that all but one of those injured have now been released .

`` One member of the team remains in hospital in Spain having suffered burns in the incident , '' read the statement . `` He is stable and will return to the UK within the next 48 hours to receive further medical care .

`` His family are in constant communication and he is in good spirits . Investigations into the cause of the fire are ongoing in collaboration with the FIA and local authorities .

`` The team would like to thank everyone for their good wishes and support over the past 24 hours . ''

Team principal Frank Williams thanked the other teams for their help and support following the incident .

`` While the incident was unexpected and definitely most undesirable , it has demonstrated the genuine cohesiveness , camaraderie and spirit of co-operation that exists within the Formula One paddock , '' he said .

`` The astonishing response from the teams and other paddock personnel was immediate , unconditional and overwhelming . ''
