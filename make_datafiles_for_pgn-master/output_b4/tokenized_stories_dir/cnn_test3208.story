LOS ANGELES , California -- One of the bigger difficulties any first-time buyer faces is purchasing a car that does n't scream `` first-time '' to friends , relatives and co-workers , or indeed to the buyer each time they step into an ill-chosen purchase .

A `` shark '' that races down roads .

To break from the boring econobox , here are some of the more sculpted and stylish cars available for about $ 20,000 that will hold their looks for a long time and give a little bit of joy to a first-time owner .

Hyundai Tiburon

If you did n't know already , Tiburon means `` shark '' in Spanish , and it 's not hard to see how Hyundai 's sporty coupe can stalk the unwary first-time buyer and snare them quickly .

Like an instantly recognizable dorsal fin , the Tiburon in its third incarnation is perhaps the purest low-slung sportster that wo n't bust a first-time buyer 's wallet , though it may chew a hole in the seat of their pants as they 're pushed back into those tight-hugging bucket seats . The startling Hyundai-designed looks boast a touch of Italian styling uncommon for its bracket .

Mazda MazdaSpeed3

A bona-fide pocket rocket , any first-time buyer can put a fair distance between themselves and the pack in the MazdaSpeed3 , part of the Asian carmaker 's strategy to wrestle performance compact coupe sales from European carmakers .

This one is n't overbearingly dripped in trim or wings , but do n't let any youngster tell you it does n't have what it takes to make their peers jealous . The MazdaSpeed3 will storm from standing to a mile a minute in under six seconds and is said to hit 155 mph . Its secret is torque negation in the low gears -- and perhaps its 263 horses under the hood . Another hidden gem is its seven-speaker Bose stereo .

Pontiac G5 GT Coupe

Much like the fantastic Chevy Cobalt SS , its younger sister Pontiac G5 GT boasts highly sprung motoring at a price that appeals to the first-time buyer 's wallet . The G5 GT has been tweaked just slightly from its sister SS -- like the difference between Ashlee and Jessica Simpson -- boasting a less horizontal grille and more sculpted valance . Both are reasonably stylish from the back and side and both leaving plenty room for aftermarket add-ons . A new grille entirely , like a Phantom , may just be what you need to set it off against the crowd .

The GT 's inline-four 2.4-liter 173-hp engine -- 25hp over the base -- drives the front wheels to hit 0-60 mph in 7.5 seconds . Gas mileage is good and customer satisfaction ratings are off the hook .

Ford Mustang V6

A revamped chassis is the key to why Ford 's Mustang has become an outstanding product at a price that 's hard to beat . A tweak to the iconic lines for last year included a smaller back window and a longer , craggier front end .

Some might of course call us heretics for picking a V6 over the famous eight-cylinder included in the GT package but , to be honest , the V6 performs admirably , pushes out 210hp and emits a low-down growl that sounds wonderful . And it 's still a Mustang .

Civic Coupe

A Civic hatch was my second car -LRB- after a very short-lived VW Rabbit -RRB- . The coupe tested earlier this year brought back fond memories of the Civic 's surprisingly roomy front cabin , its enjoyable handling and maneuverability , first-class economy and its sporty elongated hood and swooping back end .

Standard features include a 350-watt premium sound system , a touch-screen satellite-navigation system whose screen flips to reveal the CD player , and a slot for a computer memory card . It 's also got a funky dash that spectrally lights at night -- what fun .

Scion xB

On the heels of its 2004 release , Toyota 's hipster Scion brand has remodeled its boxy wonder this year , this time boasting more than a design nod to its parent company 's FJ Cruiser . Wide rear pillars , wraparound headlights and bumper define the second-generation variant , which comes dripping with gadgetry inside , as well as leaving plenty of room for after-market customization .

This one turns heads while allowing you to pack five adults in relative comfort . Other notable features include a central console that fits in a DVD player alongside a backlit GPS sat-nav system that lights up in any one of 10 colors .

Honda Fit

A co-worker bought one of these after crashing her old and very badly beaten up Saturn on a left turn into oncoming traffic . Ouch . So it technically was n't her first car , but for many buyers , it will be .

Energetic , filled with flair and boasting a vertical fold the length of its bonnet , the Fit looks the part as well as being colossally roomy inside for what you expect . You do n't get a third row of seats in there but , with the back row folded flat , it almost lends you to believe it can become a camper .

Other great touches include an mp3 input jack and reclining rear-seat headrests , while gas mileage is , as expected , very good indeed . E-mail to a friend
