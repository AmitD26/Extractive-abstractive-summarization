-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We can spend the next few years beating ourselves up and debating the proposition that George W. Bush saved Iraq and Barack Obama lost it . Or we can get real and try to sort out what we can do now to protect U.S. interests in a region that 's melting down .

Iraq was never the U.S. 's to win . That point -- along with lowered expectations and focused goals -- must be the basis of any new approach to the region .

And here are three reasons .

1 . Demography : There are two factors that nations -- even functional ones -LRB- and Iraq is not -RRB- -- ca n't alter : What they are -- their demography ; and where they are -- their geography .

Iraq has been dealt an unhappy hand in both departments . There is , to be sure , a sense of Iraq national identity . But at the same time the end of Saddam Hussein 's cruel rule -- for which the U.S. is responsible -- opened up a Pandora 's box of sectarian tensions and expectations -- for which the U.S. is partly responsible -- that have never been adequately addressed .

In essence , the U.S. overturned a brutal minority Sunni rule and enabled Shia majority rule . The ins became the outs , and the outs the ins . And guess what ? Despite several successful elections , $ 25 billion from the U.S. to train and equip the Iraqi military , and another trillion in support of the Nuri al-Maliki government , Iraq never equitably distributed political and economic power .

Sunnis became disenfranchised , angry and vulnerable to jihadi persuasions ; Shia sought to get even , get ahead and maintain a privileged position ; and Kurds sought to protect their own interests and effectively create a separate governing authority . Iraq these days is n't so much a nation as it is a collection of battling sectarian groups , each seeking advantage at the expense of the Iraqi state .

2 . Geography : Iraq 's neighbors , particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia , do not share America 's vision of an equitably balanced and independent polity . Each of them has its own vision . Iraq has become a pawn in a regional competition between Sunnis and Shia and Arabs and Persians . Iran wants a weak , stable Iraq not aligned with the West , under Shia influence . The Saudis want al-Maliki out and are happy that the militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria may provide that opportunity , even as they fear the jihadists . They want Sunnis empowered and Iran disempowered .

Turkey has made its peace with the Iraqi Kurds and hopes to get them to moderate the radical tendencies of those in Syria , but really has no answer to the ISIS contagion . Jordan is vulnerable to ISIS too , but ca n't exercise much influence in Iraq .

And that leaves Syria . The regime of Bashar al-Assad is aligned with both Iran and al-Maliki , and -- likely under Tehran 's encouragement -- has begun to use military force against ISIS along the Syria-Iraq border . All this regional maneuvering reflects the reality that the neighbors ' interests will continue to trump America 's by virtue of their proximity , their influence in Iraq , and the reality that Iraq is more vital to them than it is to us .

3 . Syria : Iraq ca n't be stabilized without dealing with Syria . And to date , the U.S. -- by default the only power that remotely has the capacity to alter the course of the civil war there -- has been unable and unwilling to do that . The ISIS threat may prompt a review of the Obama administration 's Syria policy , but we should be under no illusions that Washington is ready to jump in with a comprehensive political , economic , and military strategy to end the conflict .

Indeed , the United States will be faced with some tough choices . It may find itself in the odd position of ramping up support for the more moderate Sunni rebels in Syria but also striking ISIS . That means we will be trying to weaken al-Assad on one hand , but indirectly strengthening him on the other by attacking a common enemy . Under no circumstances should the Obama administration commit to trying to put two broken nations back together again . Bottom line is that the real challenge is ISIS , which is likely to remain ensconced in parts of Syria and Iraq .

What should Obama do ?

First let 's be clear about what he should n't do . The United States needs to abandon any illusions that it can transform or find an easy way out of the situation . It is stuck in a region that it ca n't fix or leave . There is n't a single problem in this region that has a comprehensive or definitive solution . Instead , the U.S. should accept the reality that it will be dealing with outcomes , not happy endings , there . Iraq may never be a unified polity , but it need not necessarily be a failed one .

The question is , can we shape these outcomes to our advantage ? Bush 43 tried to do too much ; Obama too little . Is there a balance ?

The U.S. needs at least three different but related approaches :

1 . Coordinate with regional partners . Sure , in the case of Iran , it 's like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop . But the U.S. ca n't begin to deal with ISIS on its own . Iran is the key external power in Iraq . And Turkey , Jordan and Saudi Arabia have a stake in stopping ISIS 's advances . The U.S. may have to accept the reality that the evil al-Assad is a hedge against ISIS , even though his policies helped to facilitate its rise .

2 . Think diplomacy first , then military force . You need the first to make the second effective . That coordination must try to produce a more acceptable political arrangement in Baghdad , with or without al-Maliki . Without the Iraqi government regaining Sunni support , ISIS will continue to roll . And this means some new and more inclusive political arrangement in Baghdad to share power .

Forget democracy and making Iraq whole . To bring Sunnis around and check ISIS , we may have to not only concede influence to Iran but also to some pretty bad Sunnis , including former Saddam supporters and insurgents .

3 . The U.S. will need to do what it can to buck up the Iraqi military . This could easily lead to sending additional advisers , but under no circumstances should it involve the use of combat forces . We may well have to use airstrikes and drones against ISIS . And this is tricky , because it risks feeding jihadi sentiment . That 's why a new political arrangement is mandatory .

But even without it , the United States must face the reality that ISIS -- with money , passports , and a base of operations -- will emerge as a threat to our friends in the region , to Europe and ultimately to us .

We should n't run scared . ISIS 's own ideology will produce a counterreaction among Iraqis who will oppose its harsh , unforgiving ideology . Indeed as the International Crisis Group points out , ISIS is its own worst enemy .

The region is littered with the remains of failed jihadi efforts , including al Qaeda central . In 2013 , there were 17,800 global fatalities as a result of terrorist attacks . Only 16 of those were Americans .

Terror is not a strategic threat to the homeland right now . But it may well require a coordinated counterterror effort with our regional and international partners to prevent it from becoming one .

Aaron Miller : Debating what went wrong in Iraq not useful ; protecting U.S. interests now is

Iraq is complex , he says , with sectarian groups at odds , neighbors with own interests

@highlight

He says U.S. must work with Iraq 's neighbors , even al-Assad , to halt ISIS . Democracy can wait

Miller : U.S. must help right Iraqi military , but without combat forces . Point is to check terror
