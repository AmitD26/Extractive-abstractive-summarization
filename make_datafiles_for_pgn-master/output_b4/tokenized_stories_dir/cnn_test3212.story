-LRB- LifeWire -RRB- -- After his father was diagnosed with dementia in 1996 , Anthony Lazzara Jr. faced a difficult decision : He and his wife , Gail , either could place his father , Anthony Lazzara Sr. , in a facility , or they could care for him themselves .

Anthony Lazzara Jr. -LRB- right -RRB- and his wife , Gail -LRB- left -RRB- , cared for Anthony Lazzara Sr. at home for eight years .

Unable to afford a care facility , the Lazzaras brought him home .

So began eight long years of caring for the World War II veteran and onetime truck driver as he slowly declined -- a burden borne largely by Gail , 56 .

She fed him , bathed him and changed his diapers on a daily basis while her husband , a truck driver , was on the road .

Slowly , she says , her marriage began to crumble .

`` I could n't take my frustration out on my father-in-law , '' she says . Instead , she took it out on her husband .

`` We almost ended up divorcing over the whole deal , '' says Anthony Jr. , 56 .

Gail concedes she considered leaving , `` but I could n't walk away from my father-in-law . ''

Two years ago , the Lazzaras finally threw in the towel . A bed became available at a local Veterans Affairs facility , and the elder Lazzara was admitted . He remained there until April 2008 , when he died at age 95 .

A difficult labor of love

As the Lazzaras can attest , the stress of caring for an elderly parent can overwhelm a relationship . Chauffeuring loved ones to appointments , handling their shopping , assuming their financial burden , even just living under the same roof can test even the most committed couples .

In 2004 , the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP reported that over 44 million Americans care for an adult family member or friend . Almost 80 percent of these are caring for someone older than 50 .

Although caring for a parent in their twilight years can be rewarding , it can also be a trial , says Beth Witrogen , the Pulitzer Prize-nominated author of `` Caregiving : The Spiritual Journey of Love , Loss and Renewal . ''

`` Caregiving brings out the best and worst in us all , '' she says .

Al Levi , 39 , a Brooklyn , New York , occupational therapist , has experienced that kind of strain in his marriage . Levi says he has been at odds with his wife since his father was diagnosed with Alzheimer 's two years ago . `` I felt like my wife was n't taking this seriously enough , and that if it would have been her parents , it would have been more important , '' he says .

For a while , the Levis cared for Al 's father at home , but eventually it got to be more than they could handle . Levi placed his father in a nursing home this past summer . But he says the ordeal has continued to strain his marriage .

`` It 's complicated , '' he says .

` Your best is good enough '

Often , couples will harbor unreasonable expectations of what they can or should do -- together or individually -- to care for an aging parent . `` You have to accept that your best is good enough , '' Witrogen says . `` It may not be pretty , but you will get the job done . ''

It 's also crucial that couples communicate clearly and effectively , Witrogen says . Too often , one partner will fixate on solving the problem while neglecting to listen to the other 's needs . In the Lazzaras ' case , Anthony Jr. says he would search for care facilities for his father from time to time , but Gail was still left to shoulder most of the daily duties of care -- something her husband still feels guilty about .

With their three children grown , `` it was her time to have and here she was taking care of my dad , '' Anthony Jr. laments .

It was n't until the Lazzaras finally found room for Anthony Sr. at the VA facility that they finally found some relief .

`` We knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel , '' Anthony Jr. says .

Balancing your needs

Although finding a balance between caring for an aging parent and maintaining a healthy marriage can be tremendously challenging , it can be done , experts say . Part of that solution is ensuring the aging parent gets proper care , says Leah Siskin , senior psychologist at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks , New York .

`` When the psychological needs of the care recipient are addressed , this can no doubt have a positive effect on the marital relationship of the caregivers , '' she says .

It 's also important that couples care for one another .

Giuseppe Manca , a 58-year-old holistic healer in Manhattan , grew frustrated that he could n't take a vacation with his wife for fear of leaving his live-in mother-in-law alone , even though she was in good health . So the couple decided to take weekend trips , making sure neighbors and loved ones were on standby in case of an emergency .

The Lazzaras did n't have the luxury of traveling while Anthony Sr. was still alive . Although they say their marriage has stabilized since his passing -- Gail has been able to devote more time to her job coordinating a local volleyball league -- they admit that it could have crumbled .

`` We nearly crashed and burned , '' Anthony Jr. says .

How to cope

Author Witrogen offers the following tips for coping when a couple 's `` for better or worse '' turns to the latter in caring for an elderly parent :

• Talk it out . Bring in a third party such as an attorney to provide objective perspective . Those short on money can invite clergy or a neighbor .

• Make time for yourself -- and each other . It takes willingness , intention and time management , Witrogen says . `` Get out your day planners and schedule the time in . I suggest that couples schedule ` play dates , ' even if for an hour . ''

• Do n't neglect your health . Sleeping enough , eating right and exercising displaces stress from your partner .

• Set caregiving goals . `` Write down objectively what needs to be done , '' Witrogen says . Divide the duties equitably .
