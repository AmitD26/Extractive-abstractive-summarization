-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Roberto Ascencio has lived in the New Orleans area for 30 years , 28 of them on the West Bank of the Mississippi River .

Thousands of drivers sat in traffic for hours as they fled Gulf Coast ahead of Hurricane Gustav 's arrival .

The last time he fled the city , ahead of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , he was worried about his restaurant , which was two months away from opening . Once again , as he leaves town , his primary concern is his restaurant , which finally opened little more than a year ago after repairing damage from Katrina .

`` It was very hard to get back to where we were , because the money was gone , '' he said .

`` I 'm worried because it 's my livelihood . My wife runs the restaurant with my sister-in-law . We worked so hard to get there . If it gets destroyed again , I 'll probably go bankrupt . I 'm just praying that it 's going to be OK . ''

By Sunday night , more than 1.9 million people had fled the city and its surrounding parishes , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said , many of them , like Ascencio , spending hours in traffic . Watch Jindal discuss the progress of evacuations ''

`` I thought it was going to be a piece of cake . As soon as we hit the interstate , it was bumper-to-bumper . It was very , very slow-moving , '' he said .

As the sun set behind him Sunday , Ascencio was driving east on Interstate 10 with his wife , daughter , three cats , three dogs and two birds . After 16 hours on the road , he was closing in on Biloxi , Mississippi , about 60 miles east of New Orleans . iReport.com : Leaving home ? Share your story

`` We just took off , '' he says . `` We do n't know where we 're going right now . It 's just crazy . ''

When Katrina hit three years ago , Ascencio and his family fled New Orleans for Houston , Texas . That trip took 18 hours , he said .

Then , like now , the worst part was leaving behind his restaurant .

This time , Ascencio said he took all the precautions he could before he left , safeguarding his stocks in the restaurant and moving possessions in his two-story home upstairs . CNN 's Susan Roesgen report on evacuations from New Orleans ''

But supplies were limited . The local home improvement store was out of plywood to board up the restaurant windows when he arrived .

But he did what we could and set out on the road , unsure of where he would end up .

`` Everybody on my side has Louisiana license plates . It looks like we own the whole highway , '' Ascencio says , almost laughing . But just as quickly , his voice turns serious .

`` I hope everything is well . I 'll need to get back and see how things are going , but right now we 've just got to keep going . ''
