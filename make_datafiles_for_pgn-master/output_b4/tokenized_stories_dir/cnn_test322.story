Havana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Cuban officials have accused the U.S. government of bizarre plots over the years , such as trying to kill Fidel Castro with exploding cigars . On Wednesday , they said Washington is using a new weapon against the island : spam .

`` It 's overloading the networks , which creates bad service and affects our customers , '' said Daniel Ramos Fernandez , chief of security operations at the Cuban government-run telecommunications company ETECSA .

At a news conference Wednesday , Cuban officials said text messaging platforms run by the U.S. government threatened to overwhelm Cuba 's creaky communications system and violated international conventions against junk messages .

The spam , officials say , comes in the form of a barrage of unwanted text messages , some political in nature .

Ramos said that during a 2009 concert in Havana performed by the Colombian pop star Juanes , a U.S. government program blanketed Cuban cell phone networks with around 300,000 text messages over about five hours .

`` It was a platform created to attack Cuban networks , '' Ramos said .

As first reported by The Associated Press last week , the U.S. Agency for International Development created a cell phone-based `` Cuban Twitter '' program , known as ZunZuneo .

It allowed U.S. government officials to send blast texts to Cubans and allowed people on the island to message each other independent of Cuban government restrictions on communications .

Under Cuban law , all Internet and communications services on the island are controlled by government-run entities .

USAID officials envisioned the program being used to organize `` smart mobs '' that could challenge the Cuban government 's control on power , according to documents obtained by the AP .

U.S. defends ` discreet ' program

Just this month , Cuba started a government e-mail service that allows people to receive e-mails on their phones .

In the country , which has the lowest rate of Internet access in the Western Hemisphere , the vast majority of people communicate via text message rather than using e-mail .

ZunZuneo -- Cuban slang for erratic , zigzag movements -- counted around 68,000 users at the height of the program 's popularity , USAID said . The program ended in 2012 after U.S. government funds for it dried up .

Cuban officials have blasted the program as part of a long-running campaign by Washington to destabilize the island 's single-party communist government and said other similar mass-messaging programs still exist .

U.S. government officials have defended the program , saying they were trying to foster free expression in Cuba .

Last week , State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf denied accusations that the program aimed to push a particular political agenda .

`` We believe that the Cuban people need platforms like this to use themselves to decide what their future will look like , and that 's certainly what we did here , '' she told reporters . `` We were trying to expand the space for Cubans to express themselves . They could 've expressed ... anti-American views on it . We did n't monitor or ... choose what they say on these platforms . That 's up to them . ''

But other U.S. officials have been less positive about the program 's value .

During a USAID budget hearing Tuesday , U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , called ZunZuneo `` a cockamamie idea '' that the Cuban government had little difficulty tracing back to the United States .

USAID administrator Rajiv Shah said that ZunZuneo had been carried out `` discreetly '' to avoid Cuban government detection , but it was n't a covert program that would have required congressional approval .

`` Creating platforms to improve communication in Cuba and in many parts of the world is a core part of what USAID has done for some time and continues to do , '' Shah said . `` Our administration 's policy is to continue to support efforts to allow for open communications . ''

Shah said that USAID `` continues to support platforms '' like ZunZuneo , but he did n't go into details .

Alan Gross ' attorney : Program is ` shocking '

Attempts by USAID employees and contractors to get U.S. government technology into the hands of Cubans has been at the heart of a high-profile case that 's been a flashpoint in Cuba-U.S. relations in recent years .

Former USAID subcontractor Alan Gross is serving a 15-year sentence in prison on the island after his 2009 arrest for importing banned communications as part of a USAID program to connect Cubans to the Internet .

He was charged by a Cuban court in 2011 of being an American spy . USAID has said he was in the country working on a U.S. government project setting up satellite Internet connections .

Shah said the U.S. government continues to push Cuban officials to release Gross .

But Gross , 65 , announced Tuesday that he had begun a hunger strike on April 3 from his cell at a Cuban military hospital to protest the way both countries ' governments are treating him .

His lawyer said he was shocked to learn about the ZunZuneo program .

`` Once Alan was arrested , it is shocking that USAID would imperil his safety even further by running a covert operation in Cuba , '' attorney Scott Gilbert said in a statement .

Gross has lost 10 pounds since beginning the hunger strike , a spokeswoman for his attorney said Tuesday .

A statement issued Wednesday by Cuba 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed `` concern '' about news of Gross ' hunger strike but said he `` was in good physical condition and his health was normal and stable . ''

Cuban government officials have offered to discuss trading Gross for three Cuban intelligence operatives serving lengthy prison in the United States . But U.S. officials have said that there will be no swap , saying Gross was not spying in Cuba .

Former Cuban counterintelligence official weighs in

A former member of Cuba 's secretive State Security unit , which hunts what Cuban officials perceive to be internal threats , said he was n't surprised to hear about the U.S.-funded ZunZuneo program .

It 's just the sort of thing that Jose Manuel Collera Vento says he was tasked with stamping out when he worked as a counterintelligence official .

`` My job was to discover and neutralize these plans against my country , '' said Collera , who 's also a cardiologist and a top official in Cuba 's Masonic community .

Stretching back centuries , the Freemasons describe themselves as one the world 's oldest and largest charitable and fraternal organizations . The organization has offices , or `` lodges , '' across Cuba and counts important Cuban historical figures like revolutionary Jose Marti among its members .

In 2004 , Collera says he came face to face with Gross .

`` It 's impossible that he did n't know he was carrying out clandestine and illegal activity , '' Collera said .

Gross , Collera said , visited him to deliver camera equipment and money . At the time , USAID officials and representatives from other U.S. agencies proposed setting up satellite , Internet-based centers at the Masonic temples that Collera oversaw .

`` Alan Gross as a person was nice , very friendly , '' Collera said . `` He communicated by making gestures because his Spanish was very limited . ''

What Gross did not realize , according to Collera , was that Collera was a 30-year veteran of Cuba 's State Security and was informing his superiors of the USAID contractor 's activities in Cuba .

In 2007 , a cable signed by the then-head of the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana described Collera as a likely Cuban government `` pawn , '' following `` instructions from the Castro regime to penetrate , weaken , and divide the Masonic community . ''

The message also said that only 100 members of Cuba 's 25,000 Freemasons had Internet access and called the organization 's Havana headquarters a `` neutral space '' where Cubans could `` participate in civil society . ''

U.S. diplomats in Havana , the cable concludes , `` and Miami-based donors have supported the Freemason movement in the past and should continue to do so . ''

The cable was among the trove of U.S. government documents obtained by WikiLeaks and published in 2010 .

It is unclear if Gross was ever warned that by meeting Collera , he had crossed paths with a possible Cuban counterintelligence operative and was now on authorities ' radar .

In 2009 , Gross was arrested as he arrived at a Havana airport carrying satellite communications gear .

According to a Cuban sentencing document from Gross ' trial , he was traveling to the island to begin a project of connecting Masonic lodges to the Internet .

The next time Collera saw Gross was in a Cuban courtroom . Collera testified against Gross at his 2011 trial and revealed himself as `` Agente Gerardo , '' a foot soldier in Cuba 's vast State Security apparatus .

Gross was convicted of threatening Cuba 's national security and sentenced to 15 years in prison .

His cover blown , Collera says Gross ' arrest was his last case . But in an interview with CNN , Collera said Cuba 's domestic intelligence capabilities make any United States-directed program , from the CIA 's alleged exploding cigars to USAID 's `` Cuban Twitter , '' nearly impossible to keep secret .

`` There are 11 million Cubans , '' Collera said . `` That means there are 11 million people who could be State Security . ''
