MALMO , Sweden -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The breathy vocals of Nina Persson helped launch The Cardigans onto the music scene in the 1990s . The band developed its dreamy pop sound in the Southern Swedish town of Malmo .

Singer Nina Persson finds musical inspiration in love and relationships .

They were catapulted to international success in 1997 , when the single `` Lovefool '' appeared on the soundtrack for `` Romeo and Juliet , '' starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes . The song 's chorus -LRB- `` Love me , love me , say that you love me '' -RRB- became a pop anthem .

In addition to fronting The Cardigans , Persson , 34 , has worked on solo projects under the name A Camp . Now , after a near decade long hiatus , her second A Camp album , `` Colonia , '' is due out later this month .

Persson , who splits her time between New York and Malmo , talks to CNN 's `` My City , My Life '' about music , inspiration and life after `` Lovefool . ''

CNN : How did The Cardigans start ?

Nina Persson : We formed the band in this town where we are all originally from -- Jonkoping -- and that was in 1992 . Magnus and Peter were the two guys who actually met and wanted to form the band . And then they recruited people and I was one of the first to be recruited , along with a friend of mine who played guitar in the first version of The Cardigans .

I had not sung before that really . I was sort of hired because they knew they wanted a girl singing . And I was like ` I 'm a girl ' and I guess we got along well and I was willing to learn to sing . So that 's how it started really . Watch Nina take CNN on a tour of her favorite Malmo spots ''

CNN : How big was music in your life before you joined the band ?

Nina Persson : I 've loved music my whole life . But I never really listened to a record and thought that was something that I wanted to do . I was interested in becoming a painter , an architect , a designer . Those are the things I was interested in . But music , I never took instrument classes -- it was a random thing to start doing .

CNN : Sometime a career finds you ?

Nina Persson : Yeah and I was a person who was really helped by it . I was looking for something but I did n't know what it was and it proved to fulfill what I needed at the time .

CNN : How is A Camp different from The Cardigans ?

Nina Persson : It 's hard to say what makes it different because I 'm still doing the same thing -- I 'm still writing songs and singing them -- but it feels like it 's a bigger freedom because I am in charge in A Camp . I like both . Both serve good purposes . I like to be in the collective , being part of the machinery , but I also really enjoy being dictator .

CNN : How do you define yourself as a musician now ?

Nina Persson : Well I 'm not . I 'm not one of these people who live and breathe music . In the beginning I was a reluctant musician -- I still have n't bothered to learn an instrument . I 'm still only a singer and that 's how I write my songs . I 'm always superstitious that if I do learn an instrument I would pop the bubble a bit .

CNN : Is there anything else you would have liked to have done if you had n't done singing ?

Nina Persson : At the time when I was found , picked up by the band , I was into art . I was really good at drawing , really creative . I made stuff , I built stuff , I sewed stuff . I thought I would end up in that world somewhere . Photography was a big thing for me . In retrospect , I 'm sure that could have been a good career for me .

But recently I 've started to wish that I could start over and dedicate my life to medicine . I would have loved to go to med school . I do n't think I will because I do n't want to spend seven or eight years in training , but I dream about working in a hospital .

CNN : What were your inspirations over the years ?

Nina Persson : That 's an incredibly difficult question to answer , but I think I 'm a sucker for constantly going back to the subject of love and relationships . It also varies very much from project to project and month to month . I 'm very emotional when it comes to the music . I want to make people cry .

CNN : Tell us the story of how the band ended up in Malmo . See photos of Nina in Malmo ''

Nina Persson : We moved here because we started to record in Tambourine Studios which was here . Most studios are in Stockholm so sort of all roads wanted to drag us to Stockholm but we did persist and came here .

CNN : When you came to Malmo , what was it like starting out in the early days ?

Nina Persson : Our parents helped us move down here which was really sweet . They sort of dropped us off and waved goodbye and we moved in . We really did hang out , the five of us , quite exclusively in the beginning .

CNN : What was the area like back then ? Has it changed ?

Nina Persson : Well actually the area where I now live has n't changed that much . A lot of Malmo has moved away from the blue collar past it has , but not that area . It has strangely remained the same , and I like it .

CNN : Do you think the gritty atmosphere of Malmo has helped you stay grounded ?

Nina Persson : Well it 's hard to say how much has to do with the people we are or how much to do with Malmo . But there certainly is something here that does not encourage big headedness .

CNN : The musical heritage of Malmo is quite rocky . How did you guys fit in ?

Nina Persson : People thought we were really ridiculous when we came to this totally rock place and played pop music . So we did n't fit in at all -- we were never part of the scene here .

CNN : You were happy to be outsiders of the rocky heritage ?

Nina Persson : I think we felt sort of cool about doing our own thing . We thought we knew something that the others did n't understand .

CNN : Is there something about Malmo that helps shape your music or influence you ?

Nina Persson : I think Malmo did have a big influence on us . Obviously we came here for the sound , and we got the sound we wanted . We were away from the industry -- that was great for us . I really did appreciate being in a place where there is not a lot whole of press and industry . Nina takes

CNN : So you also live in New York . What brings you back to Malmo ?

Nina Persson : For me , I love Malmo very much because of my friendships . In Malmo I get the intimacy and get to run into my friends in the street once in a while which is a lovely feeling and I get to have a great grocery store just around the corner .

CNN : If Malmo was a person , what kind of person would it be ?

Nina Persson : It would be somebody who has been around for a while and survived a lot of hardships -- somebody you do n't mess with , somebody really intelligent , stubborn , with a lot of beauty on the inside .
