NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chris Cornell has taken to Twitter like Tweety Bird took to making mischief .

Chris Cornell 's new solo album , `` Scream , '' was produced by Timbaland . He acknowledges it 's an odd mix .

Not to suggest he 's using the popular social networking service to cause trouble . Hardly .

The 44-year-old rock musician said he enjoys the open stream of chit-chat with his fans .

`` It 's actually created an environment where I can answer simple questions that someone 's probably had forever , '' said Cornell . `` And I do n't mind answering them . And I can actually have conversations with fans that are quick , but still more meaningful than the typical situations you 're put into . I 've really liked it . ''

His more than 200,000 followers can revel in bite-size musings about life on the road -LRB- `` crowd was amazing last night '' -RRB- or sweet tweets to his wife , Vicky -LRB- `` hi baby ! i miss you ! '' -RRB- . Watch Cornell talk about his Twitter fascination ''

The former front man of Soundgarden and Audioslave -- who is also known for singing the James Bond theme `` Casino Royale '' -- is the first to admit he 's a fan of experimenting . His new solo album , `` Scream , '' has him meshing his rock vibe with dance-floor beats by the much sought-after producer Timbaland .

The collaboration has left some people scratching their heads . Nine Inch Nails lead singer Trent Reznor took a swipe by twittering : `` You know that feeling you get when somebody embarrasses themselves so badly YOU feel uncomfortable ? Heard Chris Cornell 's record ? ''

Ouch . The album debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart , but it took a substantial tumble the second week .

But Cornell -- who said he 's never met Reznor nor read or responded to his tweet -- was more than ready for criticism .

`` You could kind of see it coming , '' he said . `` Some of it is a script that was written just by putting -LSB- me and Timbaland -RSB- together . And most of the negative responses fit that script perfectly : ` You ca n't put these two things together . We do n't like it ! We 're not going to let you ! So we 're gon na say bad stuff . ' ''

For Cornell , working with Timbaland required him to `` rinse away everything that I knew about songwriting and recording . '' He said the biggest challenge was in having to relearn how to sing to a different rhythm , his raspy voice needing to match up with slick studio beats rather than sliding loosely around the live , loud accompaniment he 's so used to .

`` To me it seemed like an exciting thing to just go and do , '' he said . `` I think this is as good as any album I 've ever made , and I listen to it probably more than any other record I 've ever made . ''

Cornell spoke to CNN about Timbaland , Twitter and throwing stuff out windows . The following is an edited version of the interview .

CNN : Some people have said that you 've lost your musical identity in this album .

Chris Cornell : I do n't have one , really . I do n't want to have one . If I had a musical identity that was definable then it would be time to get into painting or something else . Race car driving .

CNN : So you would be happy to be experimental on your next album ?

Cornell : Absolutely .

CNN : So what was it like working with Timbaland ?

Cornell : He did n't really have a particular direction in mind in terms of what he wanted me to do . He did what Timbaland does , and I did what I do . We just wrote songs , which is really the best thing that came out of it . ...

It does n't sound like anybody else 's record . It does n't sound like music I 've ever heard . It defies genre , and yet it 's very much a song-oriented album as well as an album-oriented album . ... The music never stops . I 've performed it that way . It 's almost like a movie soundtrack .

CNN : How often do you Twitter ?

Cornell : It depends . When I 'm out on the road , depending on the day , a couple times a day I 'll spend a half-hour or an hour or so . I 've found that doing vocal warm-ups and Twitter at the same time , cause I 'm a multitasker . I can watch CNN -- because I do -- and then I can be online and do vocal warm-ups all at the same time . And only one of those things is way too boring .

CNN : I read a couple of your tweets , and you said that you were having trouble sleeping . Is that an occupational hazard ?

Cornell : Probably , yeah . I think everybody has a hard time when you play ... -LSB- a -RSB- show and then you 're finished at 1:30 in the morning . It takes me an hour and a half to be able to eat after that and then to be able to sleep after that . It 's hard .

CNN : What is the biggest misconception about being a rock musician ?

Cornell : My first answer would be that it 's just all a big party . But then I 've been in that situation or seen bands like that where it is all a big party .

I think overall there 's this idea that it is n't work , that it is n't something that you have to put pretty much 100 percent of your focus and your being into , that it 's like winning the lottery in a sense . And I think if you 're a musician that 's had any kind of success there is a component to that . There 's some aspect to timing and luck , there 's talent obviously as well .

But it 's a lot of traveling . It 's a lot of waiting , it 's a lot of leaving one city going into another city only to see the venue you 're going to play in when you arrive , playing for the audience and then leaving and going to the next city .

CNN : Have you ever thrown a really big object through a window ?

Cornell : Yeah . I threw an amplifier , a small one , through a window only because me and a few friends of mine that were out on tour together just made the observation -LSB- that -RSB- our generation just does n't do stuff like that . So we sort of did it as kind of a ritualistic , `` OK , let 's participate in the real thing . ''

There was a piece of duct tape on the amplifier that had my name on it . So I had to run down to the alley and take that tape off so that they would n't know who threw it off to the street .
