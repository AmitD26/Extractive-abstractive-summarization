BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From a distance , it looks like an apparition : a huge multi-colored hot-air balloon floating in the Baghdad sky , bearing a large poster of Jesus Christ . Below it , an Iraqi flag .

Santa and his helpers stand under palm trees at Baghdad 's first public Christmas festival .

Welcome to the first-ever public Christmas celebration in Baghdad , held Saturday and sponsored by the Iraqi Interior Ministry . Once thought to be infiltrated by death squads , the Ministry now is trying to root out sectarian violence -- as well as improve its P.R. image .

The event takes place in a public park in eastern Baghdad , ringed with security checkpoints . Interior Ministry forces deployed on surrounding rooftops peer down at the scene : a Christmas tree decorated with ornaments and tinsel ; a red-costumed Santa Claus waving to the crowd , an Iraqi flag draped over his shoulders ; a red-and-black-uniformed military band playing stirring martial music , not Christmas carols .

On a large stage , children dressed in costumes representing Iraq 's many ethnic and religious groups -- Kurds , Turkmen , Yazidis , Christians , Arab Muslims not defined as Sunni or Shiite -- hold their hands aloft and sing `` We are building Iraq ! '' Two young boys , a mini-policeman and a mini-soldier sporting painted-on mustaches , march stiffly and salute . Watch the celebration in Baghdad ''

Even before I can ask Interior Ministry spokesman Major-General Abdul Karim Khalaf a question , he greets me with a big smile . `` All Iraqis are Christian today ! '' he says .

Khalaf says sectarian and ethnic violence killed thousands of Iraqis . `` Now that we have crossed that hurdle and destroyed the incubators of terrorism , '' he says , `` and the security situation is good , we have to go back and strengthen community ties . ''

In spite of his claim , the spokesman is surrounded by heavy security . Yet this celebration shows that the security situation in Baghdad is improving .

Many of the people attending the Christmas celebration appear to be Muslims , with women wearing head scarves . Suad Mahmoud , holding her 16-month-old daughter , Sara , tells me she is indeed Muslim , but she 's very happy to be here . `` My mother 's birthday also is this month , so we celebrate all occasions , '' she says , `` especially in this lovely month of Christmas and New Year . ''

Father Saad Sirop Hanna , a Chaldean Christian priest , is here too . He was kidnapped by militants in 2006 and held for 28 days . He knows firsthand how difficult the lot of Christians in Iraq is but , he tells me , `` We are just attesting that things are changing in Baghdad , slowly , but we hope that this change actually is real . We will wait for the future to tell us the truth about this . ''

He just returned from Rome . `` I came back to Iraq because I believe that we can live here , '' he says . `` I have so many -LSB- Muslim -RSB- friends and we are so happy they started to think about things from another point of view and we want to help them . ''

The Christmas celebration has tables loaded with cookies and cakes . Families fill plates and chat in the warm winter sun . Santa balloons hang from trees . An artist uses oil paint to create a portrait of Jesus .

In the middle of the park there 's an art exhibit , the creation of 11 - and 12-year-olds : six displays , each about three feet wide , constructed of cardboard and Styrofoam , filled with tiny dolls dressed like ordinary people , along with model soldiers and police . They look like model movie sets depicting everyday life in Baghdad .

Afnan , 12 years old , shows me her model called `` Arresting the Terrorists . ''

`` These are the terrorists , '' she tells me . `` They were trying to blow up the school . '' In the middle of the street a dead `` terrorist '' sprawls on the asphalt , his bloody arm torn from his body by an explosion . Afnan tells me she used red nail polish to paint the blood . A little plastic dog stands nearby . `` What is he doing ? '' I ask . `` He looks for terrorists and searches for weapons and explosives , '' Afnan says .

Her mother , the children 's art teacher , Raja , shows me another child 's display called `` Baghdad Today . ''

`` This is a wedding , '' Raja explains . `` Despite the terrorism , our celebrations still go ahead . This is a park , families enjoying time . And this is a market where people go shopping without fear of bombings . This is a mosque where people can pray with no fear . ''

In the middle is a black mound that looks like a body bag . Policemen and Interior Ministry forces surround it . `` This is terrorism , '' she tells me . `` We killed it and destroyed it , and our lives went back to normal . ''

A Christmas tale perhaps , I think , but one that many Iraqis hope will come true .
