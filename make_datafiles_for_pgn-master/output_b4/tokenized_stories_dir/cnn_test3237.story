-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Efraim Diveroli 's father hoped his son would become a doctor or lawyer .

Efraim Diveroli , 22 , is doing his `` patriotic '' duty as an arms dealer , his grandfather says .

What he got instead is a 22-year-old international arms dealer who faces a congressional inquiry for allegedly selling old Chinese ammunition to the U.S. military to equip allies in Afghanistan .

Diveroli is president of AEY Inc. , a South Florida company which , according to U.S. government documents , has done more than $ 10 million of business with the U.S. government since 2004 .

The papers also reveal the company struck it big in 2007 with contracts totaling more than $ 200 million to supply ammunition , assault rifles and other weapons to the Afghan National Army and police . The company 's contract said it would get the ammunition from Hungary .

But Army investigators found what the Afghan military got included corroded ammunition made in China as long as 46 years ago .

The New York Times reported Thursday that AEY shopped stockpiles and ammo dumps in old Soviet bloc allies , from Albania to Kazakhstan . Albania was a big customer for Chinese armaments in the 1960s and '70s , the Times reported .

Angelo Diveroli , Efraim 's grandfather , told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV that his grandson is being targeted by `` jealous competitors '' in the international arms market .

Since he was a boy , the grandfather said , Efraim Diveroli has known his way around weapons . Read the WPLG story

`` He 's a genius about anything to do with weapons , '' the 72-year-old says . `` Ever since he was a little boy , I would take him to gun shows and he could identify every model of guns . People would ask : How can he do that so young ? He has a gift , I would tell them . ''

Michael Diveroli , Efraim 's father , told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV that he wished his son had turned his intellect elsewhere .

He said Efraim was `` a boy genius '' who is `` hard to control . '' Read the WFOR story

`` I would prefer he became a nice Jewish doctor or lawyer rather than an arms dealer , '' WFOR quoted Michael Diveroli as saying . Watch how father says son runs his own show ''

But his son seem to have a good idea of the circles he was running in .

`` What goes on in the Albanian Defense Ministry , '' the New York Times quoted him as saying . `` Who 's clean ? Who 's dirty ? Do n't want to know about it . ''

On a MySpace page Efraim Diveroli last updated in 2005 , he says `` I probably grew up way to -LRB- sic -RRB- fast . ''

But in a hint of where the then-19-year-old 's future was heading , he wrote , `` I definately -LRB- sic -RRB- have the desire to be very successful in my business and this does take up alot -LRB- sic -RRB- of my time . ''

The MySpace page also hints of his need for thrills .

`` I 'm one of those guys who needs to be entertained and having lots of fun all the time so if your -LRB- sic -RRB- also an undiagnosed case of ADD look me up , '' it says . He lists the weapon-heavy films `` Heat '' and `` Scarface '' among his favorites .

A CNN search of Diveroli 's Florida criminal record shows arrests , but no convictions , on offenses from misdemeanor battery to felony possession of stolen property .

He has yet to appear in court on a March 3 arrest for driving under the influence .

For now , relatives say Efraim Diveroli is out of the country . CNN attempts to contact him have not been successful .

His grandfather told WPLG that Diveroli is now in Turkey or Albania doing his `` patriotic '' duty . `` He 's all over the world getting what the military needs , '' Angelo Diveroli says .

But in a MySpace message exchange with Radar magazine , a person thought to be David Packouz , a 25-year-old who was AEY 's vice president , refers to Efraim Diveroli as `` my former scumbag partner '' and says he is motivated by money .

`` Efraim Diveroli has a serious psychological illness called ` extreme greed , ' '' Radar quotes him as writing in a report on its Web site .

Packouz would not discuss AEY with CNN on Friday , saying he had no comment `` because of the ongoing investigation . '' E-mail to a friend
