-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Richard Deitsch struggled through several days of denial before facing the fact that he was thousands of miles from home and he had no idea where his passport was .

It 's most important to make copies of your passport , say experts . Web sites offer easy-access digital storage .

The Sports Illustrated reporter was covering the 2008 Olympics in Beijing , China , where he should have been having the time of his life . But his emotions were all over the place -- and none of them were good . His passport , he assumed , had fallen out of his backpack .

`` When I realized it was missing , I went through a number of stages -- panic , fear , anger , and finally , acceptance , '' he wrote while enjoying a recent vacation in Russia . `` I looked for three days in every possible spot before I finally admitted to myself it was gone . ''

Deitsch 's bureaucratic nightmare reached a low point when he found himself inside a police station telling his story to five police officials who spoke no English . `` I was a wreck , '' he wrote later in a Sports Illustrated piece .

He had brought his own translator , an SI China reporter whom Deitsch credited with negotiating through the red tape and eventually saving his entire assignment .

Fortunately for Deitsch , he had prepared well for such an emergency .

The best thing Deitsch did , said travel experts , was to make several copies of his passport and work visa before departing for China . As a result , he had a replacement passport in his hands within a few days after he reported it missing .

Experts seem to come from two schools of thought on how to protect a passport . Some prefer to lock the document away once they arrive in a destination , while others say keeping the passport with you is the best way to safeguard it .

Whatever option you choose , the bottom line is , if you lose your passport you must be able to prove your identity and citizenship to the U.S. government . The best way to do it is to have a copy of your passport handy .

Deitsch 's experience has prompted him to become `` hyper-vigilant '' about his passport , he wrote . He usually chooses to lock the document in a safe during his travels , rarely carrying his passport on him .

`` And when I do , I find myself grabbing the front of my pants-pocket every couple of minutes to make sure that it remains where it should , '' he wrote .

Once it 's clear your passport is lost , bring your passport copy and any other traveling or ID-related paperwork to the nearest embassy or consulate during business hours .

Be prepared to spend at least four hours waiting in line , filling out forms and answering questions from officials .

If you did n't bring extra ID photos with you on your trip , have some taken before heading to the embassy or consulate . Make sure the photos are cropped to the correct size for your country 's passport .

If you have no paperwork , take someone in your traveling party with you . They will have to vouch for you .

U.S. citizens who are traveling alone and have no other way to prove their identification will be allowed to call `` family , friends or associates '' in the United States to confirm their identity , according to the U.S. State Department Web site .

Laura Kidder , editorial director of Fodor 's travel guides , suggested making color copies of the passport 's data page and sticking them inside your luggage ; you can scan them into a computer and e-mail them to yourself ; or you can use an online document storage company .

`` There 's one -LSB- online company -RSB- that is particularly geared for passport and travel documents , '' Kidder said . She recommends the Australian Web site www.passportsupport.com , which costs about $ 15 Australian per year .

`` This is the safest way to do it , which is more secure than you e-mailing it to yourself , '' said Kidder . Storing your passport data on a server offers higher security , she said , because the data is encrypted . In addition to passport documents , such services also will safely store data for tickets , drivers licenses , medical papers and lists of critical contacts .

Passportsupport.com users are asked to scan their documents in jpg files . Users can then upload these files to the passportsupport.com server with the Web site 's interface .

Kidder said she keeps copies of her documents in her luggage when traveling , and her passport secure in the hotel -- either in a self-service safe in the hotel room or a safe operated by the front desk .

Rather than safes , Robert Siciliano , CEO of IDTheftSecurity.com , said he prefers to hold his passport himself .

Siciliano said he always carries his passport -LRB- and other valuables -RRB- on him , even when he heads down to a beach to relax with his laptop . He says if you plan to go in the water , know that someone is waiting to steal your stuff . Invest in portable alarms and do n't lose sight of your possessions .

Siciliano said locking passports in a room safe leaves you open to the possibility of a forgotten combination .

In those cases , a hotel will send someone to the room who can unlock the safe .

Devices that unlock room safes can easily be bought online , Siciliano said .

It 's a good example of how many people can access your room and safe if they want to go through your stuff .

`` There are people out there that are focusing on you not paying attention , on you being trusting , you being naive , '' he says . `` You 're putting your faith and trust in someone who might have problems . People are flawed . ''

The best way to protect yourself is to buy a passport holder for $ 10 - $ 20 and always keep it on you , Siciliano said . Wear it under a shirt and pull it out only if needed . Never put it in a backpack or a purse .

Experts said preparation is most important ; you need to do your research and have multiple copies of everything .

`` I always have backup for my backup , '' Siciliano said .
