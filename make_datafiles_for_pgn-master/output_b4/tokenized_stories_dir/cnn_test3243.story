-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a Tuesday morning and Dr. Eric DeJonge is headed to work . But unlike most physicians , DeJonge 's office is his car and his patients are waiting for him in their homes , not in a large waiting room .

As part of the Medical House Call Program , Dr. Eric DeJonge visits one of his group 's 600 patients .

DeJonge , a geriatric specialist at Washington Hospital Center , runs the hospital 's `` Medical House Call Program . '' Sharing duties with program co-founder Dr. George Taler and two other doctors , DeJonge criss-crosses the nation 's capital , checking on patients in their homes .

Armed with a black bag and blackberry , DeJonge visits mostly the elderly who either ca n't get to a hospital or are so ill that moving them would prove life-threatening . He usually sees them once a month to check on their status , to make sure their medications are working , and to let them know he 's there for them .

DeJonge says the one-on-one care is invaluable . `` We know the patients , their families , '' he says . `` We know when they change medically , what has to happen to prevent them from making an ER visit . '' Terry Carter 's father , Aubrey , has been homebound since he suffered a stroke over 20 years ago . For most of those years , Carter ran back and forth to doctors ' offices and the ER , making sure his father got the best medical help . It got to be expensive and time consuming and , as the years progressed , it became increasingly difficult to care for his dad . Carter says it was tough because `` I really do n't have very much help to take him out . ''

Now , with DeJonge making regular visits , Carter 's father does n't have to be moved from his home and his health has improved . `` He 's only been in the hospital twice in the last three years , '' says Carter . `` Before that he was in the hospital every other month . '' Dr. Gupta : Watch more on the return of the house call ''

House calls , once popular in the 1930s , began to drop off as medical technology improved . According to a recent article in the Clinics of Geriatric Medicine , home visits by doctors dropped from 40 percent of physician encounters in 1930 to 10 percent by 1950 ; by 1980 home visits represented less than 1 percent of physician encounters . Many patients , the article stated , felt they could get better care at hospitals and clinics , and shied away from having a doctor come to their home . And over the years , billing and paperwork for medical professionals became so overwhelming that many spent hours at their desks with calculators instead of spending time with their patients in their homes .

And then , there was the financial disincentive : most insurance companies did n't pay for house calls . It was easier and more lucrative for doctors to see more patients in their office than fewer patients in their homes . Reimbursement was spotty and in order to survive doctors had to put house calls on the back burner .

But that has begun to change . Ten years ago , Medicare made it a bit easier for physicians to receive payments for house calls by modifying the way doctors bill for their procedures . And this month , a new `` Independence at Home '' bill -- designed to coordinate benefits for Medicare 's most expensive beneficiaries , like Aubrey Carter -- will be reintroduced , making it easier and less expensive to carry out house calls .

`` Our current health care system does a poor job caring for seriously ill Americans , who often are ` lost in transition , ' '' says Massachusetts Congressman Edward Markey , author of the bill . `` This bipartisan , bicameral bill holds great promise for improving quality of care , reducing hospitalizations , lowering costs and lifting the spirits of those who , after a lifetime of contributions to our society , deserve the dignity and peace of mind that comes with living independently . ''

From the doctors ' perspective , DeJonge says it will make all the difference in how he and his partners practice , and everyone would benefit . `` Those savings would be shared with the health systems that are willing to create them and serve their communities .

For now , DeJonge , along with his fellow physicians and staff -LRB- three nurse practitioners , three social workers , one office nurse and four support staffers -RRB- , will continue to provide care for 600 patients in the neighborhoods of Washington . With the help of machines such a portable EKGs , compact ultrasounds and X-ray programs for laptops , they can provide even more extensive care to patients in their own homes than their 1930s counterparts .

DeJonge says it 's stressful but rewarding . `` They feel like the medical community is part of their family , '' he says . `` There is a trust level that they develop when you know them over that long period of time . That 's very important . ''
