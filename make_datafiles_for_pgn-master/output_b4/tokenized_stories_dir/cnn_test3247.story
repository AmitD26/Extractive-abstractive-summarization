-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The leader of a religious group that authorities believe preys on children was released from a Pennsylvania prison Friday but wo n't be required to register as a sex offender , triggering outrage in the community where he plans to live .

George Feigley , who was released from prison Friday , is the subject of community protests .

George Feigley , now 68 , was convicted in 1975 on charges including statutory rape , indecent assault and corrupting the morals of minors .

Because Feigley 's 1975 conviction predated the passage of Megan 's Law , he will not be required to register as a sex offender . And , having served his maximum sentence , he was not put on parole upon his release .

Feigley 's Neo American Church , which authorities have called a sex cult , operated a school in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , that police said was a front for sexual activity .

The church 's manifesto says , `` We hold that the changes called creation and procreation are divine and that human sexuality is to humans the most available expression of that function of divinity , '' according to community activist Scott Portzline , who has researched Feigley 's history and that of the group . `` Sexual activity is the greatest act a human can do . ''

Court documents filed in connection with Feigley 's criminal case alleged a less lofty goal .

`` The defendants ' design was to operate a ` church oriented ' school , which is free of any governmental regulation , for the ostensible purpose of education when their real goal was to gratify their own deviant sexual desires , '' the documents stated .

One of Feigley 's victims , identified only as `` J , '' told the Harrisburg Patriot-News she was part of the organization from the ages of 5 through 12 , when her mother left the Neo American Church .

Children were beaten for letting anyone but fellow cult members see them , she said , and their genitals were pierced with a lock to be controlled by Feigley , who called himself `` The Light of the World . '' Children also were photographed in graphic sexual poses , she said .

Feigley is `` not a man who should be out with society , '' J said . `` He preys on -- at least he did -- the people who believed in him . ''

And , community members say , there will be no protections in place to stop him from continuing to do so . Watch why the case inflames emotions ''

Feigley was convicted of additional conspiracy charges in 1995 . Authorities said he was attempting to direct sexual activity involving children by telephone from prison . However , conspiracy charges do not require listing on a sex offender registry .

Feigley `` never admitted what he did was wrong , '' said John Goshert of the Dauphin County district attorney 's office , who interviewed him last week as part of a pre-release program .

Protests took place Friday in front of Feigley 's Harrisburg home and the church headquarters .

His wife , Sandra , still lives in the home . She was convicted in 1975 on one count of corrupting the morals of minors . She served a brief prison sentence , according to the Patriot-News .

Sandra Feigley now operates a Web site ostensibly aimed at benefiting state , local and federal prison inmates . The site has a lengthy section with articles discussing sex in prison and elsewhere . Some of them are written by George Feigley , using his own name and some of his aliases .

`` Thanks to the Christian crazies who were and are so influential in this country , America has criminalized more sexual conduct than any other Western nation , '' says an article on the site , which does not name an author . `` It 's a neurosis . As a result , there are a lot of ` sexual offenses . ' ''

Another article bearing George Feigley 's alias of G.G. Stoctay , Ph.D. , and included in Portzline 's research says , `` There is nothing injurious to sexuality . It 's good and pleasant , not an evil . Children exposed to it are simply not injured . ''

Angel Fox , who will be Feigley 's next-door neighbor , helped organize Friday 's protest and is circulating a petition to prevent his return to the neighborhood , according to the Patriot-News .

`` I mean , what happens when I 'm not at home ? '' she asked . `` Do I have to worry about what 's happening with my kids ? I have to try to do something . ''

The community is `` outraged , '' said Annette Antoun , publisher of a weekly newspaper . She said authorities are looking into whether Feigley would be required to register under a federal statute . And , she said , if there is a loophole in the law , legislators are starting to work on ways to close it .

She said she has spoken to Feigley 's victims , and `` they have scars they say will never go away . ... They 're frightened . ''

In 1976 , Feigley escaped from a Pennsylvania prison . He was captured two years later in West Virginia but escaped again from a local jail and was recaptured by the FBI .

In 1983 , two members of the Neo American Church drowned in what authorities believe was an attempt to break Feigley out of prison .

Laura Seligman and James Gilbert drowned in the sewer line outside the prison where Feigley was being held .

The two had crawled a mile and a half through the line , according to Portzline . A rainstorm caused an overflow gate to open , flooding the line .
