ASUNCION , Paraguay -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo acknowledged Monday that he is the father of a 2-year-old child who was conceived when he was a Roman Catholic bishop .

Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo speaks at a news conference in Asuncion on Monday .

`` It 's true that there was a relationship with Viviana Carrillo , '' Lugo told reporters , citing the mother . `` I assume all the responsibilities that could derive from such an act , recognizing the paternity of the child . ''

He said he was making the acknowledgment `` with the most absolute honesty , transparency and feeling of obligation . ''

The announcement came in the week after Carrillo had filed suit in a city in southern Paraguay seeking a paternity test .

Judge Evelyn Peralta , who is overseeing the case , said she was treating it routinely . `` It is a case like any other , which involves the president and nothing more , '' she said . `` It will be processed as it should be . ''

Some Cabinet members interpreted Lugo 's acknowledgment of paternity as an indication of the change he has promised to bring about to achieve greater transparency in the public sector .

`` This is the Paraguay that we want , '' said Liz Torres , minister of children 's issues . `` This is the Paraguay of serious change , in which there is no double standard or secrets . It seems to be an example , a very big lesson . ''

But some opposition party members said it appeared that Lugo had practically been forced to acknowledge what happened ; that he had not done so willingly .

Sen. Julio Cesar Velasquez of the opposition Colorado Party called on the Vatican to excommunicate Lugo .

Lugo was laicized last year , around the time he assumed the presidency .

Journalist Sanie Lopez Garelli contributed to this report from Asuncion .
