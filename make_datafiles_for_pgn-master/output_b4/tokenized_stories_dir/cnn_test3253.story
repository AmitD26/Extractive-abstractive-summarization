William , 25 , is already a second lieutenant in the British Army , where he serves in the Household Cavalry -LRB- Blues and Royals -RRB- .

Since January , he has been on a four-month attachment with the Royal Air Force designed to give the future king experience with the various branches of the military .

William plans to complete a similar attachment with the Royal Navy later in the year , according to his office at Clarence House .

During his time with the RAF , William learned to fly three different aircraft : a Grob 115E light aircraft , the faster Tucano T1 plane , and a Squirrel helicopter .

The prince was only eight days into his flying course when he made his first solo flight , Clarence House said . At the time , William described it as `` an amazing experience . ''

`` Going solo is one of those things -- if you had a list of the top 50 things to do before you die , it would be in there , '' he said in January .

Clarence House said it was William 's `` lifetime ambition '' to learn to fly .

After the ceremony , he will be known in the RAF as Flying Officer Wales .

Prince Charles earned his wings more than 35 years ago at the same air force base , graduating as a Flight Lieutenant .

William 's uncle , the Duke of York , flew Sea King helicopters during the Falklands War in 1982 . E-mail to a friend
