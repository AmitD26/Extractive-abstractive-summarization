-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Violence and drug-trafficking have become such a major threat to Latin America that the presidents of Colombia , Mexico , Guatemala and Panama will sit around a table Friday in Panama to discuss what they can do about it .

Cartridges and weapons seized from gangsters and drug-traffickers at the Military Headquarter in Mexico City .

Their summit comes at a particularly troubled time for these governments , especially Mexico , which tallied a record number of drug-related killings last year . Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich characterized the battle in Mexico among drug cartels and with government authorities as a `` civil war '' on a news program this week .

But Mexico is not alone .

Colombia has been fighting drug cartels for decades . Panama has been a center of money-laundering for dug cartels and other organized crime groups for many years . And Guatemala has seen its share of slayings and bloodshed .

`` It 's a recognition that there is a shared problem and that they ca n't solve that problem independent of each other , '' said Robert Pastor , a professor of international relations at American University in Washington who served as a national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s .

Jennifer McCoy , the director of The Americas Program at the Carter Center in Atlanta , says it is `` encouraging '' that presidents Felipe Calderon of Mexico , Alvaro Uribe of Colombia , Alvaro Colom of Guatemala and Martin Torrijos of Panama not only recognize the problem but want to meet to see what they can do about it .

`` The issue of security is vital in these countries and in Latin America , '' McCoy said .

It 's not just a threat for Latin America , a recent report from the U.S. military says . The violence in Mexico and elsewhere south of the border could spill over to the United States , says the report , issued in November by the U.S. Joint Forces Command .

`` The growing assault by the drug cartels and their thugs on the Mexican government over the past several years reminds one that an unstable Mexico could represent a homeland security problem of immense proportions to the United States , '' says the report , `` Joint Operating Environment 2008 . ''

That instability could threaten the United States ' underbelly along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico .

`` Any descent by Mexico into chaos would demand an American response based on the serious implications for homeland security alone , '' the report says .

Mexican Secretary of Governance Fernando Gomez Mont rejected that notion in an interview with CNN this week , saying it is `` inadmissible '' that the United States would have to intervene .

Pastor , who was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1994 to become U.S. ambassador to Panama , believes the United States should be more involved now .

`` The United States is a major part of the problem , '' he said . `` The dollars are coming from the United States . The demand is coming from the United States . The arms are coming from the United States . ''

Pastor pointed out that there are 7,600 gun shops in the United States within 100 miles of the Mexican border .

`` We ought to have a clear recognition that that we are part of their problem , and they ca n't solve it without us , '' he said .

Panamanian Foreign Minister Samuel Lewis Navarro indicated at a news conference this week that other nations also need to be more involved .

He did n't mention the United States but it was clear whom he was talking about . The summit leaders will ask nations that have high drug consumption to do their part to reduce that demand , the Spanish news agency EFE quoted Lewis as saying .

Mexican President Calderon met with President-elect Barack Obama in Washington this week and security was a prime subject of their discussions .

`` Both countries share a long border , '' said Peter Hakim , president of the Inter-American Dialogue . `` They are terribly worried about the violence from organized crime in Mexico and slipover into the U.S. ''

Hakim met with Calderon at a private dinner hosted by the Mexican president Sunday night .

After his meeting with Obama on Monday , Calderon stressed the level to which the two nations are intertwined when it comes to security .

`` The more secure Mexico is , the more secure the United States will be , '' the Mexican president said , first in Spanish and then in English , to make sure no one missed the point .

Obama is likely receptive to that message , said Michael Shifter , a vice president at the Inter-American Dialogue .

`` I think Obama is going to understand that Mexico is very important to the United States , '' Shifter told CNN last week . `` This is n't an issue that he has focused a lot of attention on up until now . But he 's going to understand that if Mexico really deteriorates or if the violence spills over into the border states , this is a war that he really has to deal with . ''

Drug-fueled violence reached record levels in Mexico last year , with around 5,400 slayings , more than double the 2,477 reported in 2007 , Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said last month .

The situation is so dire in Mexico that the Joint Forces Command report says , `` In terms of worst-case scenarios for the Joint Force and indeed the world , two large and important states bear consideration for a rapid and sudden collapse : Pakistan and Mexico . ''

The report goes on to say that the `` Mexican possibility may seem less likely , but the government , its politicians , police , and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels . How that internal conflict turns out over the next several years will have a major impact on the stability of the Mexican state . ''
