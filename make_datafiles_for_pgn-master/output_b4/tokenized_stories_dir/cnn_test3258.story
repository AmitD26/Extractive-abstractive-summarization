BUENOS AIRES , Argentina -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Smoke blanketed the Argentine capital Friday as brush fires apparently set deliberately consumed thousands of acres in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Entre RÃ­os .

A haze surrounds the Palermo neighborhood of the Argentine capital early Thursday .

The smoke , from about 300 fires , is blamed for at least two fatal traffic accidents this week that left eight people dead .

Sections of major highways and the Buenos Aires port , among the busiest in the world , have been closed . Incoming flights to the city 's domestic airport , Jorge Newbery Airpark , have been diverted .

The Argentine government has blamed farmers looking to clear their land for crops and grazing for the fires , which are estimated to cover 173,000 acres -LRB- 70,000 hectares -RRB- .

`` This is the largest fire of this kind that we 've ever seen , '' Argentine Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo said Thursday .

Randazzo called the situation a `` disaster . ''

As of Friday morning , little progress had been made extinguishing the blazes .

No rain is predicted for the next few days , but the National Meteorological Service predicts that the winds will change direction soon , dispersing the smoke .

On Friday morning , the National Roads Administration closed sections of the heavily traveled Panamericana Highway , which leads in and out of Buenos Aires . Spokesman Ernesto Arriaga said `` visibility is 5 meters '' -LRB- about 16 feet -RRB- in some sections of the highway .

`` Covering highways with smoke just to clear a field of weeds is unforgivable , '' Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez told Radio Diez . `` It 's incredibly irresponsible . ''

Hospitals have reported an increase in visitors complaining of breathing problems , sore throats and burning eyes in the past three days .

Citing a high level of carbon monoxide in the air , officials have encouraged people not to exercise outside .

Schools in Pilar , a city in the province of Buenos Aires , were closed Friday because of the gray , thick air .

The smoke has obscured views of some of the capital 's landmarks , such the Obelisco monument and the government house , Casa Rosada , and people were seen walking on the city streets covering their faces with clothes .

This month , Argentina 's farmers suspended a three-week strike over a new government export tax on commodities .

The bitter lockout left grocery shelves empty and caused major friction between President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 's government and Argentina 's large agricultural sector . E-mail to a friend
