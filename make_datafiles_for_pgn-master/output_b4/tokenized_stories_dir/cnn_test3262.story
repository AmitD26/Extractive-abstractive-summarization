-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Robert Swan 's life reads like a boy 's own adventure tale with a modern eco-twist .

Robert Swan was the first man to walk to both the North and South Poles .

Inspired by the daring age of Antarctic exploration , Swan followed in the footsteps of his heroes ; the men who risked , and lost , their lives to reach the South Pole .

At the age of 29 he embarked on an expedition to the South Pole that was unsupported -- a trek that required him to pull his own sleigh and that lacked medical support crews .

By the time he was 33 he had become the first man to walk to both the North and South poles unsupported .

But for Swan , the epic journeys to the Poles , and the sailing and overland adventures that have followed , unearthed more than just a spirit for adventure .

He experienced firsthand the impact of humanity on the environment when under the hole in the ozone layer at the South Pole , the harsh ultraviolet rays from the sun burned his skin and permanently changed the color of his eyes .

It firmed a desire to preserve the fragile natural world and to educate and inspire others , particularly the next generation of decision-makers to do the same .

`` As the last unspoiled wilderness on Earth , Antarctica is currently protected by the treaty prohibiting drilling and mining until 2041 . Decisions made by today 's youth will impact our entire planet 's ecosystem and the future of life on earth , '' he says on 2041.com .

His polar icewalks gained international attention and in 1992 he was asked to speak at the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , later gaining an OBE and being appointed Special Envoy to the Director General of UNESCO in recognition of his work .

At the Earth Summit in Rio he committed to a `` global mission '' to remove 1,500 tons of waste from Antarctica . Swan and a team of young people from across the world were successful in cleaning up the Russian Antarctic base of Bellinghausen by 2000 , making it inhabitable for wildlife again .

Foresight , planning and determination then are not alien to a man who spent five years sourcing the funding for his first Antarctic expedition , and Swan 's latest project is taking an even longer-term view .

Swan founded his organization `` 2041 '' in 2003 in order to further his mission of action and education .

Named after the year in which Antarctica 's protection against mineral exploitation ends , Swan regularly takes business people , teachers and students on expeditions to Antarctica to impress on those with the capacity to enact change that preservation of the environment is essential and achievable .

Continuing the green mission on the continent by minimizing the human footprint in the region , his international teams have helped design and build the world 's first education station in Antarctica that is run solely on renewable energy .

Add to the expeditions , ocean voyages on a boat with sails made from recycled plastic bottles , and it 's clear that the veteran polar explorer is a man who is doing all he can to protect and preserve the Antarctic .
