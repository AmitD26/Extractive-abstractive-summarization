-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From Yellowstone National Park to the Everglades , America 's 391 national parks are in need of repair -- and thanks to the economic stimulus signed into law , help is now underway .

President Obama and his family visit the Grand Canyon in Arizona , a national park .

President Obama 's $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan passed in February and designated $ 750 million dollars to the national parks .

But not all of the stimulus money is being used -- and the parks are facing a $ 9 billion backlog in maintenance projects . So far , nearly 10 percent is in the pipeline .

`` We are picking away at it as much as we can and we 've been fortunate to have the recovery act money , '' said Jeffrey Olson of the National Park Service .

Olson said half of the $ 9 billion is slated to go for road repairs .

`` Half of that -LSB- $ 9 billion -RSB- is roads and about $ 2 billion of that are the most pressing needs -- those we get some help from the stimulus . The president 's budget proposal is calling for more maintenance and construction money , '' Olsen said .

Dan Wenk , the acting director of the National Park Service says most of those pressing needs include , `` camp grounds , camp sites , it 's amphitheaters for evening programs . It 's the bathrooms . It 's literally everything we have to make our visits enjoyable . ''

And those needs , Ranger Rocky Schroeder hopes , will be fulfilled soon . Watch more on the national parks facelift ''

Schroeder patrols Prince William Park , about 35 miles outside the nation 's capital . It has more than a dozen historic cabins slated for repair and is just one of the 250 national parks getting a face lift because of the stimulus package .

`` The stimulus will help keep our visitors here , keep them happy and keep them coming back , '' Schroeder added .

And the numbers are good for national parks .

As of the end of July , attendance at the parks is up roughly 3 percent from the same time last year , according to the parks service . In 2008 , nearly 275 million people visited the national parks compared to 272 million in 2006 .

At Prince William Forest park , officials are hoping to start putting the money to use next month -- and said they 've had overwhelming interest . For these stimulus projects , they need to hire six additional people . So far , they 've received nearly 200 applications .

The Interior Department estimates the stimulus allocation will create around 8,000 jobs over two years -- though many will be temporary .

`` It 's stimulus because we are putting people to work ... but it 's also stimulus because we 're creating a better place ... increasing the visitor experience , '' Wenk said .

Some Republicans , however , are skeptical .

`` Clearly we need to improve our national parks ... but nobody should confuse that with economic stimulus . I mean frankly that 's just false advertising , '' Rep. Jeb Hensarlin , R-Texas , says .

For Ron Tipton of the National Parks Conservation Association , the funding is vital .

`` We must ensure our national parks are well funded to address the parks ' crumbling historic buildings and trails , enhance the Park Service 's ability to protect wildlife , and provide needed public education and services , '' he said on the association 's Web site .

Olson believes that when economic times are tough -- especially during the current recession -- parks are an economically friendly alternative to more expensive getaways .

`` We rise above other things like theme parks , '' he says . `` When times are tough economically , people turn inward and ask some really basic questions and there is nothing like being in a national park to ask those questions . ''

Olson adds that 147 parks in the United States and in the nation 's territories have an entry fee , which ranges from $ 5 to $ 25 ; 244 do not have an entry fee .

But when it comes to this money , the key question being asked : How is the stimulus money being used ?

Nearly $ 56 million is for Washington landmarks , which some say are in dire need of repair . More than $ 14.5 million is going to Mesa Verde National Park and nearly $ 11 million has been allocated for the Grand Canyon .

Schroeder said he is confident the infusion of stimulus dollars is a worthwhile investment .

`` The national parks are our past , our history . ''
