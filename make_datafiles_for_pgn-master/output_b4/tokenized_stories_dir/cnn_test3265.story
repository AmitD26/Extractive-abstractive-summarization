An ocean wave knocked three people into the Atlantic off Maine 's Acadia National Park on Sunday .

Coast Guard rescuers plucked the three from the ocean after a wave swept them from a rocky ledge at the park , according to Sheridan Steele , the park 's superintendent .

The conditions of the two survivors -- a 12-year-old girl and a man -- were not immediately available . No names were released .

Ocean waves also injured a few other people at the park , knocking them to the ground or into rocks and crevices , Steele said . Some were taken to a hospital with broken bones or other injuries , Steele said .

The victims were among several thousand people who were at the park late Sunday morning to watch the high waves that Hurricane Bill -- a Category 1 storm -- was producing offshore .

`` Even though we try to warn people and try to get people to watch from a safe distance , we were n't able to contact everybody in time , '' Steele said Sunday evening .

The hurricane 's center passed New England without making landfall and got very close to the Canadian province of Nova Scotia on Sunday afternoon . It was expected to pass near or over southeastern Nova Scotia , Canada , on Sunday night , the National Hurricane Center said . Watch how Canada is bracing for Bill ''

At 11 p.m. , Hurricane Bill was about 115 miles west-northwest of Cape Race , Newfoundland , according to the hurricane center .

The storm had maximum sustained winds near 75 mph , and was moving to the east-northeast near 40 mph the center reported . Bill would become a tropical storm if its winds fall below 74 mph .

`` Weakening is forecast during the next 24 hours and Bill is expected to become extratropical on Monday , '' the center 's 11 p.m. advisory said . `` Large and dangerous swells generated by Hurricane Bill will continue to impact the Atlantic Maritimes of Canada overnight . ''

Though tropical storm warnings were lifted in the United States , tropical storm warnings were in effect for parts of Canada 's Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island and and Newfoundland .

A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 24 hours .

`` Large and dangerous swells generated by Hurricane Bill '' were possible along those provinces Sunday night , and 2 to 6 inches of rain were possible in Newfoundland , the advisory said .

Earlier , the weather service warned that dangerous surf and `` life-threatening rip currents '' remained concerns along the U.S. East Coast .

The water is unsafe even for `` strong swimmers , '' Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick warned Saturday .

Though beaches along the Massachusetts coast remained closed , the National Weather Service lifted its tropical storm warnings there Sunday morning .

Stuart Smith , the harbormaster in Chatham , Massachusetts , said there were reports of `` insignificant '' storm-related damage , but Bill did not cause much concern .

`` I think we really dodged a bullet , '' he said . `` It stayed just enough offshore to give us a break . '' Watch how Canada is bracing for Bill ''

It 's good news for President Obama and his family , who planned to arrive for vacation in Martha 's Vineyard , Massachusetts , on Sunday .

`` We look forward to welcoming him to Massachusetts as soon as he can safely get here , '' Patrick said .
