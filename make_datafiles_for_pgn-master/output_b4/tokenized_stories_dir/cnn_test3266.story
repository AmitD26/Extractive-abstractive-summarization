NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mary J. Blige has sung her way to nine Grammy Awards and sold 40 million albums worldwide .

`` I know I 'm definitely gon na pursue this as a profession , acting , '' Mary J. Blige said .

With music credentials like that , the `` Queen of Hip-Hop Soul '' needed a new challenge . So Blige decided to stretch her range to the big screen .

The singer stars in the new Tyler Perry film `` I Can Do Bad All By Myself '' alongside Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson , Perry and Gladys Knight .

Being in the film allows Blige to test her acting chops and sing as well . Her character , Tanya , is a club owner who takes the mic at least twice in the film . And whether she 's in character or not , Blige 's ability to communicate a song can take your breath away .

CNN spoke with Blige about Tyler Perry , her acting angst and music . The following is an edited version of that interview :

CNN : What does the title of the film `` I Can Do Bad All By Myself '' mean ?

Mary J. Blige : Well , the title `` I Can Do Bad All By Myself '' is basically saying `` I do n't need anyone to help me do worse or feel worse than what I already feel . '' So if you 're coming with negative energy , please keep it moving , you know ? If you 're coming with negative deposits , you 've got ta go . That 's basically what it 's saying .

CNN : Were you nervous about acting in this film ?

Blige : I was definitely nervous , because acting is not my first profession , so I had to go and get an acting coach and really figure this thing out . It helped a lot . It relaxed me to have a little more information about it .

And I find that actors are highly underrated ; they do n't get all the credit they deserve , because this is a hard job . That 's a hard job .

CNN : Were you bitten by the acting bug ?

Blige : Well , I 'm gon na be open to scripts , and I 'm ready to receive more scripts from anywhere . I know I 'm definitely gon na pursue this as a profession , acting . I was definitely bitten by the acting bug .

CNN : Did you feel any pressure to write songs for this film , as opposed to writing for one of your albums ?

Blige : There 's not any pressure in writing songs . Writing a song for the movie versus writing songs for my album because ... you get it all from inspiration from somewhere , you know ? I got all the lyrics from the actual movie , and I got all the lyrics for my songs from my life so , and other people 's lives .

CNN : Do you want to hear poetry in your lyrics ?

Blige : I would love to hear poetry in my lyrics .

CNN : Tell me about Tyler Perry .

Blige : Wow , working with Tyler Perry was -- it 's always a treat . He 's the most kind , generous , you know , supportive professional man . He 's a really good person to have in such a tough business . It 's like a pillow for your head . ... You just get to lay on it after laying on rocks for so long .

CNN : What is the link between spirituality and music in the film and in life ?

Blige : Well , I think the link with the spirituality and the music is that we all have a place where we need to go to heal , and most of the time people go to music to heal . Whether it be gospel or secular , but it all comes from some song that pulled you through your life or helped you through college or something like that .

CNN : Do you think this film is about redemption ? Do you think people can really change ?

Blige : I definitely feel this film is a lot about redemption . You saving yourself first of all , and believing you can be saved and wanting the help .

I think it takes time for people to heal from whatever wounds they 're healing from . But in order to get free , what I learned is that you have to release it , because you 'll stay stuck for the rest of your life .

What if this person is enjoying their lives and you hate them ? So it 's just best to release . Easier said than done , please believe it .

CNN : What do you think about the music industry these days ?

Blige : Well , I mean , the music industry has moved with the times . You know , I mean we are in the age where technology has taken over and music is technology now , so it 's not hands-on . It 's a little sad that there is n't any more record stores .
