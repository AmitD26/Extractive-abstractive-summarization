-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Why was Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 flying over war-torn eastern Ukraine ?

`` We , along with hundreds of other airlines , have flown that route safely for quite some time , '' Hugh Dunleavy , commercial director for Malaysia Airlines , told CNN 's Saima Mohsin over the weekend . `` Primarily we flew that route because we were advised that this was a safe corridor and there would be no incidents . ''

Dunleavy said the plane , which was traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur , adjusted its altitude on its way across Europe under the direction of air traffic control .

Now , he said the airline is reassessing the route it uses for that flight . And since Thursday 's crash , commercial airlines that usually cross eastern Ukraine on their flights to Europe , Asia and elsewhere have been detouring away from the volatile region .

But far beyond Ukraine 's borders , analysts say the incident could pave the way for new guidelines for how close planes can fly to conflict zones .

`` The rules in aviation are written in blood , or a tombstone mentality if you like , '' CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said . `` What happens is , people die , and things get safer . ''

David Soucie , a CNN safety analyst and former FAA safety inspector , said the situation highlights the need for change in an antiquated system that has what he calls a `` flaw in the evaluation of the risk . ''

Eight unanswered questions

`` There had been aircraft shot down just prior to this , '' Soucie said . `` Someone should have taken action . ''

Last week Eurocontrol , the agency responsible for coordinating European airspace , said Ukrainian authorities had closed airspace in the region below 32,000 feet , but it was open at the level Flight 17 was flying -LRB- 33,000 feet -RRB- .

`` There 's a lot of questions to be asked in a lot of different places , '' O'Brien said . `` Malaysia , for example , what about the airline policy ? What did they inform crews and flight dispatchers about flying through that particular part of the world ? And why did n't government officials close off that airspace completely ? 32,000 feet , that 's a completely arbitrary number . ''

The president of Dubai 's Emirates airline is calling for an international meeting of carriers to come up with a response to the downing of the plane , Reuters reported on Sunday .

The U.N. 's International Civil Aviation Organization ca n't close airspace , Emirates President Tim Clark told Reuters , `` but they can issue advisories and they may be a little more active . ''

And national regulators `` may start getting involved a little more than they have , '' Clark said , according to Reuters . `` They have perhaps left airlines to their own devices . ''

The airline chief 's comments are a good sign that changes soon could be in the works , O'Brien said .

Les Abend , a CNN aviation analyst and commercial pilot , said before last week 's crash , pilots were n't worried about missiles hitting planes they were flying .

`` None of us , I think , would have conceived that kind of devastation from a surface-to-air missile , '' he said . `` Evading missiles -LRB- is -RRB- not part of our training . That 's just something that 's not in our vocabulary at this point and time . ''

But now , he said , guidelines for pilots will likely change .

`` Now we 've got a new threat that we 've got to deal with , '' he said . `` Now we 've lost lives . ''
