MOSCOW , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As I raised my hands toward the ceiling and then pointed them toward my head , I had to wonder : How would the 19th-century Russian writer Nikolai Gogol feel if he knew that a bunch of foreigners were dancing the YMCA at a nightclub named after him ?

The iconic St. Basil 's Cathedral in Red Square takes on a brighter , more colorful look at night .

Gogol the man is considered the father of modern Russian realism , with works such as `` Dead Souls . '' Gogol the cafe-club is considered a favorite hangout for Russians and expatriates alike , perfect for meals , coffee , fruity cocktails and music 'til everyone clears out around 2:30 a.m. , when Moscow 's `` real '' nightclubs heat up .

Since the Soviet Union fell in 1991 , Russia 's capital city has progressed in many ways , breaking free of old social structures while struggling to maintain its cultural heritage .

The city has preserved a lot of its old beauty , boasting monuments such as St. Basil 's Cathedral and gorgeous landscapes such as Tsaritsino Park . At the same time , there are Internet cafes and 24-hour bookstores , and you 'd be hard-pressed to meet someone who does n't carry a cell phone .

But , as an American studying abroad at Moscow State University , I sometimes felt perplexed in this immense modern metropolis that still makes certain familiar conveniences inconvenient .

In Moscow , kiosks for adding money to your cell phone seem far more common than ATMs . Even nice restaurants with $ 40-minimum meals -- for example , the best beef stroganoff and fried cheese balls of your life -- accept only cash , no cards . After two weeks , I never figured out where to buy a nail clipper -- but I did see Vladimir Lenin 's body , perfectly preserved since 1924 . View more photos of Moscow ''

At the university , I had to present a special ID card to one set of guards at the entrance , a dorm pass to another crew , and then confront a third layer of hallway-based security before arriving at my room . I also needed written approval from my floor 's `` administrator '' to take luggage out of the building .

Then , there 's money . Moscow , or `` Moskva '' in Russian , holds the distinction of the world 's most expensive city , according to Mercer 's 2008 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey . Be prepared for fees from your bank and the Russian bank whenever you use an ATM . Try to stay away from touristy restaurants for meals , and do your souvenir shopping at Izmailovsky Market -LRB- Metro : Izmailovsky Park -RRB- instead of in stores .

The expatriates I encountered all echoed the sentiment that Moscow is a city of constant stress . Maybe that 's why I will always love most the Moscow I experienced at night .

The monuments that look mildly impressive by day suddenly come to life with light against the onyx sky . You can look out over Sparrow Hills and see the endless glittering skyline , or settle down somewhere like Gogol -LRB- Metro : Tverskaya -RRB- for vodka-enhanced beverages and music from around the world . And , as long as you know `` Mozhna ? '' -LRB- `` May I ? '' -RRB- and `` Spasiba '' -LRB- `` Thank you -RRB- , '' it matters less that few people speak substantial English .

Café Bilingua -LRB- Metro : Chistye Prudy -RRB- is another cozy place to mingle with locals and ex-pats for hours on end -- you can have your coffee in the tiny two-story book shop , or take it up to the restaurant and performance section . Another bar I liked is Etage -LRB- Metro : Pushkinskaya -RRB- , right off Pushkin 's Square near a large neon-light sculpture of flowers -LRB- how would the great poet feel about that ? -RRB- .

Nightclubs dedicated to too-many-people-to-move dance floors do n't start up until well after midnight . Propaganda -LRB- Metro : Lubyanka -RRB- , conveniently located near the headquarters of the KGB , spins all kinds of dance music -- go on a Thursday evening for a less crowded experience .

Then there 's The Real McCoy -LRB- Metro : Barrikadnaya -RRB- , so packed with people that merely crossing the room to stand in the bathroom line requires bumping bodies to the beat . At first we could n't even get in because the bouncer shook his head at my Swiss friend . But , as always , it 's all about who you know -- my Spanish friend 's Spanish friend had VIP status , so we went as his entourage to an upscale restaurant-like room in the back . Part of my Moscow nightlife adventures included riding on an overnight train . For my trip from St. Petersburg to Moscow , I had been told at every ticket office that only seats were available . But upon boarding at midnight , I asked a crew member if I could have a bed . Five minutes and $ 80 later , the fleshy man who took my ticket had locked me into a less-than-closet-sized space with him .

I prepared to claw at the door with my untrimmed nails and scream .

`` Close , '' he said . Then he unlocked it to demonstrate `` open . '' He stepped out , gave me a stiff wave , and said , `` See you in Moskva . '' I sighed and fell asleep on the child-sized mattress .

Among the plethora of Moscow 's unspoken rules : Do not talk in the elevators or hallways of your student dorm . Accustomed to the silence , one night I was surprised to hear the glorious sound of a Frédéric Chopin nocturne coming from behind a security guard 's desk . `` Mozhna ? '' I asked , pointing to the door his chair blocked . He just shrugged , so I quietly ducked behind him and pulled the handle .

Behold , a secret two-story ballroom with tables and chairs and an upright piano in the corner , and a Russian student who abruptly lifted his hands from the piano keys when I sat down . We took turns playing -LRB- thus , my failed-love song `` Sad Panda '' debuted on a new continent -RRB- and , in broken but passionate English , he told me how he wished he could sound like the Russian-American pianist Vladimir Horowitz , and said he often comes with his friend to play around 9 p.m. .

As if it were the end of a great Russian novel , I never heard music in that hallway again .
