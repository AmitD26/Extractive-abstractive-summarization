-LRB- Entertainment Weekly -RRB- -- Punctuation promises comedy in `` The Informant ! '' as if the title subject is a cartoon secret agent -- maybe Agent 86 in `` Get Smart . ''

Matt Damon , as a corporate turncoat , offers up secrets in `` The Informant ! ''

But he 's not . The whistle-blower worthy of an exclamation point in this groovy-looking , chuckle-baiting , fact-based movie from protean director Steven Soderbergh is Mark Whitacre -LRB- Matt Damon -RRB- , a biochemist and well-placed executive at the agri-processing giant Archer Daniels Midland -LRB- ADM -RRB- in Decatur , Illinois .

It 's the early 1990s . The company man is helping expose ADM 's alleged global price-fixing activities to the FBI , cooperating with the feds long enough to gather invaluable evidence . But what Whitacre does n't confide to his FBI handlers , and what his wheat-colored jackets , Dilbert ties , and weakling mustache hide , at least at first , is that this inside source is not completely trustworthy .

Damon , fattened up to fit his boxy suits , wears Whitacre 's slack demeanor beautifully . The star -- who has quietly and steadily turned into a great Everyman actor -- is in nimble control as he reveals his character 's deep crazies . Watch why Damon gained 30 pounds for the role ''

Soderbergh 's amused study of the highest-ranking corporate whistleblower in U.S. history is adapted from `` The Informant : A True Story , '' an amazing , deeply reported book by New York Times reporter Kurt Eichenwald . That book told the story without editorial eye-rolling . But somewhere between Eichenwald 's journalistic attention to detail and the bubbly , dialogue-besotted script by `` The Bourne Ultimatum 's '' Scott Z. Burns , Soderbergh has chosen to apply an attitude of arch whoopee , a greasy veneer of mirth over what is , no joke , a serious mess of malfeasance and mental instability .

It 's tempting to laugh , but what 's the joke : Whitacre ? ADM ? The FBI ? The fashion trends of Decatur ? Smarty condescension lurks behind the suburban bushes .

Had a '90s date and place card not been supplied , I would have remained in an honest muddle about the era depicted on screen . And since Whitacre is subliminally likened to bumbling , fictional Maxwell Smart , that 's probably as the filmmaker intended . The artistic choice is reinforced by a '70s - era `` Laugh-In '' aesthetic seen in everything from the smiley yellow novelty typography of the opening credits to the fancy rubber-chicken music served up in heaps of horns and whistles by essence-of - '70s composer Marvin Hamlisch . Sock it to me .

Playing it straight and letting his Sam-Donaldson-meets-Spock hairdo suggest otherwise , Scott Bakula makes an appealing FBI agent with a deadpan grimace just this side -- or maybe it 's the other side -- of `` Dragnet 's '' Joe Friday . Comedian Joel McHale from E! 's `` The Soup '' plays the fellow agent who stares with big round eyes while his partner squints at Whitacre 's successive leakages of truth/lie / truth/lie .

The always wonderful , huggable Melanie Lynskey , who stole the show in `` Away We Go , '' does more great wifely work as Ginger Whitacre , her husband 's biggest booster . A valued subset of Soderbergh 's audience is sure to dig iconic hipster comic brothers Tom and Dick Smothers in small roles . In fact , the wily pair would fit right in with an `` Ocean 's Whatever '' cast of coolios , enjoying some retro-style ensemble fun , regardless of whether the audience does .

Soderbergh is as smart , stylish , and attentive a filmmaker as they come . And there are moments in `` The Informant ! '' when I can almost be convinced that the tonal feints he establishes at the intersection of joke and no-joke are seriously , thoughtfully meant to replicate the misaligned synapses in Whitacre 's own head . iReport.com : Damon 's latest worth checking out

But if that 's the intention , Soderbergh ultimately made the choice to abandon interesting , dispassionate empathy for the more quick-fix payoff of amusement . As Whitacre goes through his days , Damon recites interior monologues of distracted observation in voice-overs meant to demonstrate how his character 's unusual brain works .

In `` The Informant ! '' , that brain -- screwy and yet capable of doing important undercover work -- free-associates like Ellen DeGeneres on a swing through Walmart . Cute , but as even Agent 86 would say in `` Get Smart '' : Missed it by that much .
