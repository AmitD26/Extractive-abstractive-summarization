-LRB- Budget Travel -RRB- -- When you have beach on the brain , who wants to bother with a layover ? Budget Travel has prepared the ultimate insider 's guide to seven resort towns south of the border that are just one quick flight away .

The Pacific-coast resort of Puerto Vallarta has attracted artists in recent years with its natural beauty and well-preserved colonial architecture .

MAZATLÁN

As resort towns go , Mazatlán is one of Mexico 's prettiest , with an assortment of 19th-century neoclassical , republican , and French baroque buildings in pastel colors . The best place for wandering is Old Mazatlán , particularly the tree-lined streets around Plazuela Machado , where guitarists and singers roam from one sidewalk café to the next .

Eat Sample traditional Sinaloan dishes at Pedro & Lola , a restaurant with seating on the square that 's known for its Mexican Molcajete , grilled beef served with cactus and onions -LRB- 011-52/669 -982-2589 , restaurantpedroylola.com , beef $ 14 -RRB- .

IXTAPA-ZIHUATANEJO

The twin cities of Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo are separated by just three miles , but despite that proximity , they do n't have a lot in common . Zihuatanejo , which dates back to precolonial times , is a relaxed fishing town set on an enclosed bay with not a single high-rise hotel .

ACAPULCO

Acapulco got its glamorous start in the 1950s and '60s , when celebrities like Frank Sinatra , Elizabeth Taylor , and Judy Garland turned the exclusive hotels on the rugged cliffs over the bay into their playground .

PUERTO VALLARTA

Puerto Vallarta 's art scene does n't yet rival that of San Miguel de Allende , but it 's well on its way : Painters , sculptors , and other artisans have moved to the Pacific-coast resort town in recent years , drawn by the natural beauty of the mountainous coast and the well-preserved colonial architecture in Old Vallarta .

Shop The old town has a number of galleries and boutiques , such as Joyería Yoler , which sells handcrafted silver jewelry -LRB- 011-52/322 -222-8713 -RRB- , and Peyote People , a purveyor of Huichol Indian art -LRB- 011-52/322 -222-2302 -RRB- .

LOS CABOS

Wedged between granite peaks and the water on the tip of Baja California , Los Cabos has one of Mexico 's most dramatic settings .

CANCÚN

Cancún may never shake its reputation as a rowdy college-party destination , but outside of spring-break season , the city is a surprisingly subdued place . The peninsula is where most of the major resorts are located , so if you 're looking for character , it 's best to head downtown on the mainland .

Stay The boutique hotel Sol y Luna has 11 brightly painted rooms , mosaic-trimmed baths , and balconies overlooking Parque de las Palapas -LRB- 011-52/998 -887-5579 , solylunahotel.com , from $ 48 -RRB- .

COZUMEL

Surrounded by vibrantly colored coral reefs , the island of Cozumel , 11 miles off the Yucatán coast , has been attracting divers since Jacques Cousteau popularized it in the 1960s . The most central place to be situated for day trips around the island is the town of San Miguel , which has a number of reasonably priced guesthouses .
