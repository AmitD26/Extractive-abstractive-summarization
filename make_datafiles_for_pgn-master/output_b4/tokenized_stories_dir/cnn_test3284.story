-LRB- Parenting.com -RRB- -- A dad looks at how long it really takes a kid to sleep alone :

Getting the baby to sleep is a challenge for many parents .

1:28 a.m. Every couple of hours , Jack -LRB- 2 weeks -RRB- cries . My wife feeds him , then hands him to me to change his diaper . It 's an equitable division of labor , but I wish I could sleep .

2:15 a.m. Jack -LRB- 1 month -RRB- is sleeping between me and my wife because this way she can nurse while she dozes . I 'm happy , but so tired . He 's on his back , and there are no pillows or blankets around him , but I 'm wide-awake , thinking about SIDS . He 's like a little hot-water bottle . His breath is sweet and milky against my face .

10 p.m. I 'm lying on a tiny crib mattress on the floor next to the crib . We 're trying to get Jack -LRB- 9 months -RRB- to sleep through the night . His mother and I take turns lying next to him on the floor and holding his hand through the slats . I miss my wife .

1:36 a.m. Jack -LRB- 12 months -RRB- is sleeping in between us , again . Lying next to his crib did n't work -- Jack kept crying , waking both of us . This way , we all get some sleep . Parenting.com : Dad 's in charge ? Uh oh .

4:27 a.m. I 'm wide-awake because Jack -LRB- 15 months -RRB- kicked me in the groin . I have to get up to drive my wife to New York , then turn around and drive back home with Jack , all on about three hours of sleep . I decide that while his mother is gone , I will Ferberize him . Parenting.com : Ferberizing is not what you think it is

9:13 p.m. Jack -LRB- 15 months and a day -RRB- is in his crib , crying , crying , crying .

10:11 p.m. Jack -LRB- 15 months and a week -RRB- is in his crib , alone and asleep . Ferberizing worked . Suddenly I have a great idea -- let 's have another baby ! But this would require that my wife and I stay awake for longer than ten seconds once our heads hit the pillows .

12:02 a.m. . In bed with my wife , I 'm feeling romantic , but then Jack -LRB- 18 months -RRB- cries out . He has a fever . We give him kids ' Motrin and bring him back into bed with us . He 's burning up .

11:21 p.m. Jack -LRB- 18 months and a week -RRB- is no longer sick , but now he 's back in our bed , every night . It 's once again the only way he 'll go down .

7 a.m. I realize that for the first time , Jack -LRB- 22 months -RRB- has finally slept through the night . Now we have to get him out of diapers and back in his own room .

11:41 p.m. . We are lying in an H formation . Jack -LRB- 2 years -RRB- is nestled into his mother 's chest , perpendicular to us , with his feet lodged against my throat , trying to push me off the bed . Freud was right about Oedipus . Parenting.com : Why good dads make moms jealous

4:25 a.m. Jack -LRB- 3 years -RRB- has kicked the covers off me again and I wake up , shivering . I pull the covers up . He kicks them off . I pull them up . He kicks them off . I go downstairs , turn on the TV , and fall asleep on the couch .

2:15 p.m. I 'm sound asleep , dreaming . Unfortunately , I 'm at work . Tomorrow is Jack 's fourth birthday . Last night in bed , he said , `` Hey , why do I have to sleep in the middle ? ''

7:30 p.m. I am lying in the new twin bed we bought Jack -LRB- 4 1/4 years -RRB- , to show him how it works . We made a big deal of it , his very own Big Boy Bed , and we let him pick out the dinosaur sheets and the dinosaur comforter . All is ready .

12:05 a.m. I 'm in this big empty bed , alone . We told Jack that on his fifth birthday he 'd have to sleep in his own bed , because that 's what big boys do , and he agreed . He wants very much to be a big boy . On his birthday , my wife lay down with him at 8:30 and fell sound asleep .

5:02 a.m. I get up and peek in on Jack -LRB- 5 1/2 -RRB- . He 's been sleeping alone in his room for almost a month now . I get back into bed with my wife and snuggle up next to her . At least I think it 's her -- it 's been a while . She feels good against my skin , but now I miss Jack . I miss getting kicked in the throat . I miss getting the covers pulled off of me . Where 's my little boy ? How did he grow up so fast ?

9:42 p.m. Hearing a noise , my wife and I go upstairs to check on Jack -LRB- 6 -RRB- . He says he was having a bad dream . We lie down with him , three of us in a twin bed . It 's crowded , but if we brought him into our bed again , we 'd never get him out . His breath is still sweet and milky on my cheek . How could this not be okay ? This is my family .
