Vero Beach , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Louis Schacht 's family has been growing citrus in Vero Beach , Florida , for 60 years , contributing to a multibillion-dollar industry . But this year , he 's worried .

The winter weather blasting much of the country has made it to Florida , and the cold front now moving through is expected to last longer than usual . That could prove disastrous for Schacht and his fellow growers at the peak of the picking season .

A chill can enhance the taste of the oranges and grapefruit that the Schacht family business grows and ships around the world . But if the temperature drops to 28 degrees Fahrenheit or below and stays there for four hours , fruit across Florida could be frozen and the crop destroyed .

`` If it stays just above freezing , it can really help sweeten the fruit , but it 's a fine line to walk . If it gets too cold , you can definitely have some damage , '' Schacht said .

He has flooded his 280-acre grove in a bid to protect his fruit , as have larger growers across the state .

`` What that does is create a little layer of warmth , usually about 20 to 25 feet from the surface , which is all we really need , '' Schacht said .

And Schacht said that 's just about all he can do . He said the fate of his fruit is now out of his hands .

`` We 've basically done what we can do , '' he said . `` You say a prayer and go to bed . ''

Schacht ships directly to customers around the world . `` As a small grower , you try to sell everything that you can , direct to the consumer , '' he said .

His crop contributes to Florida being the No. 1 producer of oranges in the country . `` The citrus industry has a 9 billion-dollar annual economic impact , '' says Florida Citrus Mutual spokesman Andrew Meadows .
