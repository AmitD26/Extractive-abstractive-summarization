London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police in London have reached a settlement with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes , whom officers shot dead in 2005 , mistaking him for a suicide bomber .

The police offered `` a further unreserved apology '' for the death of de Menezes in 2005 , plus an undisclosed compensation package , the police and the de Menezes family said in a joint statement .

`` All litigation between them arising out of the tragic death of Jean Charles de Menezes has been resolved , '' the statement added .

De Menezes was killed on a London Underground train weeks after four suicide bombers struck on the London transport system on July 7 , 2005 .

The controversial shooting of the unarmed Brazilian man sparked a number of investigations , including one that found police acted illegally .

A jury found in 2007 that London 's Metropolitan Police Service broke health and safety laws in the shooting . It did not examine the cause of death .

Jurors at a 2008 inquest found that the police who shot de Menezes did not shout a warning before firing at him . They also found that de Menezes did not advance toward armed officers on the subway train , which would have given them a reason to shoot .

But the coroner at the inquest , who acted as the judge , had told the jury members they could not return a verdict of unlawful killing .

They returned an open verdict in the case , meaning the jury was unable to establish a cause of death . De Menezes ' family called the proceedings a `` whitewash '' because jurors were not allowed to consider a verdict of unlawful killing .

De Menezes was killed July 22 , 2005 , a day after four failed bombings aboard the London transit system . Two weeks earlier , four suicide bombers blew apart three London subway trains and a bus , killing 52 people and wounding 977 .

The city was on edge as police sought the four failed bombers .

Officers staking out a home in south London saw and followed de Menezes , 27 , believing he was one of the suspects . They trailed him as he traveled on a bus and into a subway station , where they chased him onto the platform and into a train , and shot him dead .

The Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded in 2007 that de Menezes was innocent of anything that might have justified police action .

`` We made a most terrible mistake , '' Acting Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson said at the time , adding police needed to learn from the incident . `` I am sorry . ''

The shooting was one of several issues that led to the resignation last year of Police Commissioner Ian Blair .
