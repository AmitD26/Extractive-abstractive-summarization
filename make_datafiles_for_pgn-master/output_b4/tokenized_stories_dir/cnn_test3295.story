-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There are many reasons why Roz Savage is an extraordinary woman -- she has rowed single-handed across the Atlantic and is now tackling the Pacific , after all .

Life changer : From successful career to ocean rower , Savage has been an inspiration for many .

But her response to everyday commuter ennui is perhaps of the most remarkable things about her . Back in 2000 a 33-year-old Roz was facing another dreary journey by train to the office .

She had a great job as a management consultant , money and a husband ; but deep down she knew something was missing . So , instead of just burying her feelings , she wrote two obituaries of herself . In one she kept going with life as it was . In the other she took a jump into the unknown and did the things she 'd always wanted to . From that moment on her life has never been the same .

`` One-by-one , I shed the trappings of my old life , '' she writes on her web site .

`` The job , the husband , the home , the little red sports car . I moved house with increasing regularity , wherever I could find cheap or preferably free accommodation .

`` Little by little I began to realign my life , to put myself on track for the obituary I really wanted . ''

Eventually she settled on the challenge that would in many ways define her : rowing the Atlantic single handed .

It was , of course , incredibly hard , both physically and mentally . She had done some rowing while at the University of Oxford -- but the open ocean was a different challenge altogether . But she emerged a tougher , happier person on the other side , and is now deep into her new attempt to row the Pacific , a journey she hopes to use to raise awareness of environmental issues .

The courage she has found , both to take on the might of the open ocean and give up safe , conventional notions of success to pursue her dreams has made Roz a hero to many people that hope to find inspiration in her life -- including a large number of CNN.com readers who have nominated her as a `` Green Inspiration '' .

`` I feel a little embarrassed about it -- that must be the British in me ! '' she told CNN from the middle of the Pacific Ocean .

`` I certainly do n't see myself as any kind of hero , just a human being trying to be the best human she can be . But at the same time I want to reach out to as many people as I can , because I wish I 'd had more positive role models to show me how good life can be , and if I can inspire just a few people to change their lives for the better , I 'll feel I 've lived a very blessed life . ''

Rowing across the Pacific Ocean

On her journey she keeps the many people following her up to date with regular blog posts on her website .

Posts range from the personal to the global , the reality of life on the open waves to plastic pollution , the North Pacific Garbage Patch , and how people could reduce the amount of waste they generate .

`` I try to offer my life as an example of what can be done when a very ordinary person decides to do something out of the ordinary , '' she said .

`` I love my life , and want to show people how much fun it can be when you get out there and grab life by the horns . It would be very selfish of me to keep this fantastic discovery to myself !

`` Every time I get a comment on my blog from someone who says they have changed their life as a result of reading about me and my adventures -- anything from composting their kitchen scraps to quitting their job to start out on an adventure of their own -- it gives me a huge warm glow of accomplishment . And it makes me feel even better when they tell me how much fun they are having doing it . Because that is what life is all about . ''

But adventure does n't have to involve months alone in a rowing boat , with only sea birds , the sun and the wind for company .

`` Everybody is different , and will find their own way , '' she said . `` For me , at the time when I decided to row oceans , I felt the need for a dramatic contrast to the very conventional life I 'd had before , and ocean rowing seemed to fit the bill . I do think that you learn things about yourself in extreme situations that you would n't learn in less testing circumstances .

`` But the situation does n't have to be physically extreme . Parenthood , starting a new business , moving to a new town or a new country -- these are all ways to put yourself in a challenging new environment where you have to throw away your old preconceptions about what is or is not possible , and try out new approaches . ''

Ever action has an effect

Roz 's advice for anyone stuck in a rut is do n't be afraid to fail . If you know what you want to do , then do n't be intimidated . Write a list of what you can do to achieve your goals . If there seems to be things on it you ca n't do yet , then Roz says it is n't detailed enough -- any task can be broken down into achievable steps .

`` Everything is a learning experience if you allow it to be . I keep a journal -- on land and at sea -- and this really helps me to learn from my experiences , '' she said .

At the core of her mission in the Pacific is a belief that we can not only transform our own lives through our actions , but our relationship to the natural world around us as well .

`` There has been so much bad news about environmental issues that I think some people feel overwhelmed , '' she said .

`` But there is something we can all do to make a difference -- and it all adds up .

`` It 's about more than just using a re-usable bag , or picking up a piece of trash from a beach . It 's about an attitude and a way of thinking .

`` Every action has effects beyond the action itself -- other people will see what you are doing and follow your example . It 's the ripple effect . And if we all pull together , we can make a world of difference . ''

Fundamentally , her message is that life is for living and we learn as much from failure as success if we are open-minded and positive .

`` My life now is so much more fulfilling and fun , and I 'm incredibly glad I took that leap of faith . There is nothing special about me that made me able to do it . If I can do it , anybody can -- if they want to .

`` Get out there , live life large , make the world a better place -- and have fun ! ''
