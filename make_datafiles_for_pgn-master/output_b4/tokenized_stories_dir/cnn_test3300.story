-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Not content to sit quietly at home eating their tofu cutlets , more and more vegetarians , it seems , are taking action , trying to get the carnivorous masses to change their ways .

Of course , the meat-free have been trying to win people over to their cause since the time of Pythagoras . But lately , activists are trying more in-your-face tactics .

For Lierre Keith , author of `` The Vegetarian Myth , '' the `` in-your-face '' part is quite literal . A former vegetarian who has publicly recanted , she was lecturing in San Francisco , California , last week , when three masked assailants shouted `` Go vegan ! '' and lobbed chili pepper-laced pies at her .

Even in hard-core vegan circles -- which exclude using animal-based products for food , clothing , medicine or any other purpose -- such borderline-violent exploits are controversial .

More common is the approach of folks like newly converted talk show host Ellen Degeneres , who has been sharing recipes for vegan nachos along with her philosophy .

Still , recipes only go so far . And , more to the point , they do n't get as much media attention . For many vegan and vegetarian activists , getting coverage is an art .

PETA

If you 've ever read about a particularly outrageous pro-vegetarian campaign , there 's a good chance that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals was behind it . The folks at PETA seem to be firm believers in the idea that `` all media attention is good media attention , '' and the more shocking or ridiculous the stunt , the more media outlets will pick up the story .

PETA was laughed at when it tried to rebrand fish as `` sea kittens , '' in hopes that the more cuddly name would make seafood a less appealing mealtime choice . It was criticized for the suggestion that recently deceased Oscar G. Mayer should be buried with his company 's hot dog-shaped Wienermobile .

After British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay cooked up horse meat on his show , PETA UK dumped a ton of manure outside his London restaurant .

Plenty of ecological activists cringe at these kinds of prankish maneuvers , but they do get noticed . And that , apparently , is the point .

Why else would PETA organize an army of zombies to protest outside of KFC restaurants ?

Not content to oppose meat-eating in the real world , PETA also took a swipe at virtual carnivorousness : In response to the Nintendo DS game `` Cooking Mama , '' the group released its own bloody version .

And , as anyone who 's seen its anti-fur posters knows , PETA is well aware that sex sells . The group got the granddaughter of Argentinean revolutionary Che Guevara to pose wearing nothing but a bandolier filled with carrots .

Last , year PETA proposed a too-racy-for-TV `` vegetarians have better sex '' Super Bowl commercial , guaranteeing plenty of coverage when -- surprise ! -- NBC rejected the ad .

PETA also brings its soft-core approach to the streets with its `` Lettuce Ladies '' campaign : young models , clad in a few strategically placed leaves , handing out veggie hot dogs .

The group has enlisted Pamela Anderson and Elizabeth Berkley to pose for the Lettuce Ladies Web site -LRB- find it yourself -RRB- -- probably the best thing that 's happened to their careers in years . Is there tofu wresting ? Yes , there is tofu wrestling .

Casa Diablo

PETA is not alone in combining feminine pulchritude and an anti-meat agenda . A couple of years back , Portland , Oregon , resident Johnny Diablo got a bunch of media attention when he opened Casa Diablo , the world 's first vegan strip club .

Serving veggie burgers with a side of nudity -LRB- or maybe the other way around -RRB- might seem to be just a publicity stunt . -LRB- The fact that Diablo tried to put the club up for sale shortly after opening would seem to suggest that . -RRB-

But Mr. Diablo is an earnest vegan himself , and he 's apparently retained ownership of Casa Diablo , though reviews -- of both the cuisine and the more fleshy attractions -- are decidedly mixed .

McVegan

As the most public face of our carnivorous culture , McDonald 's is a popular target of vegetarian activism .

Back in 1985 , the London branch of Greenpeace declared October 16 World Anti-McDonald 's Day , and every year since , there have been protests and rallies all over the globe .

The group Vegan Action , founded by Berkeley students in 1993 , has come up with a gentler -- and tastier -- way to combat the ubiquity of the golden arches . With its help , you can host your own `` McVegan '' event . There will be veggie burgers , there will be uniformed servers , and there will even be a costumed clown mascot -- Reggie McVeggie , `` Ronald 's kinder brother . '' The slogan : `` Billions and billions saved . ''

Vegan Avengers

Even a green group like Friends of the Earth is n't safe from vegan wrath . Last year , the group hosted a comedy night at the Hammersmith Apollo in London , only to have the event crashed by masked activists wearing enormous artificial testicles .

They called themselves the `` Vegan Avengers , '' and their crude slogan suggested that the middle-of-the-road members of FoE should grow a similar pair by supporting veganism . The Avengers have not been heard from since their single appearance .
