Madrid , Spain -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Spanish fishing boat repelled an attack by suspected pirates Sunday morning in the Indian Ocean off the African coast , Spain 's ministry of defense said .

The Spanish Ortube Berria fishing vessel was in waters southwest of the Seychelles when pirates aboard two skiffs opened fire on the ship with light arms and a grenade shot from a launcher , according to a defense ministry news release . The Seychelles are a group of islands located north of Madagascar and southeast of Somalia , whose coastal waters have become known for piracy .

The attack happened at about 5:40 a.m. , the ministry said .

A private security company aboard the fishing vessel returned fire and thwarted the attack , the statement said .

No one was injured , and the ship did not suffer any material damage .

Following the attack , the Ortube Berria was sailing southward away from the area , the defense ministry said .

Pirates have captured more than 50 ships this year off Somalia and are currently holding 11 , according to information from Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon .

Earlier this month , the crew of another Spanish fishing boat , the Alakrana , was released by Somali pirates after 47 days in captivity .

The Alakrana was hijacked off the coast of Somalia .

On Sunday , the commander of a European Union anti-piracy operation , deployed a Portuguese frigate based in the area toward the site of the attack , Spanish authorities said .
