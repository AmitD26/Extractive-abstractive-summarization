Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Full-body imaging machines that see through clothes have significantly improved security in airports where they are deployed , and have revealed more than 60 `` artfully concealed '' illegal or prohibited items in the past year , the Transportation Security Administration says .

To date , no explosives have been detected by the machines , but their ability to spot even small concealed objects demonstrates their effectiveness as a security tool , officials said .

`` It is absolutely a tremendous improvement of what we can detect at the checkpoints , '' TSA Acting Administrator Gale Rossides said this week . `` It is an excellent piece of technology that will significantly improve our detection capabilities . ''

As evidence of the machines ' capabilities , the security agency released five photos of drugs or suspected drugs that airport screeners found after scans revealed anomalies on the ghost-like images of people 's bodies . The agency said metal detectors would not have revealed the items .

Screeners using the technology also found a knife hidden in the small of a person 's back at the Richmond , Virginia , airport , a concealed razor blade on a passenger in Phoenix , Arizona , and other concealed items such as large bottles of lotion , which are prohibited as carry-on items .

In addition , the machines have revealed numerous prohibited items that passengers evidently inadvertently left in pockets . Those items are confiscated but are not counted in the tally , a TSA spokesman said .

U.S. to implement new airport security measures

The agency field-tested the full-body imagers for more than a year before announcing last month the deployment of machines to 11 airports nationwide . Today , 46 machines are in place in 23 airports , and the agency is stepping up deployments and plans to have about 1,000 set up by the end of 2011 .

Interest in the machines has heightened since the Christmas Day incident in which a man allegedly attempted to detonate an explosive concealed in his underwear . In an appearance before Congress last month , Rossides declined to say whether the machines could have detected the underwear bomb .

But to illustrate the machines ' effectiveness , Rossides showed a packet of white powder smaller than a tea bag , saying it was identical to a concealed bag detected by an imager .

`` The amazing thing is that our officers , as they get more and more familiar with this technology , are actually finding very , very small things that are being secreted on the body , '' she said .

But some passengers say the machine 's capabilities are presenting new Fourth Amendment questions about the government 's searches , saying the machines -- in detecting very small objects -- are subjecting passengers to scrutiny beyond what is needed to safeguard the plane .

`` I ca n't imaging an explosive that is powerful enough in that -LSB- tea-bag size -RSB- quantity to endanger an aircraft , '' said John Perry Barlow , a former Grateful Dead lyricist who once took the TSA to court after a search of his checked luggage revealed a small amount of drugs .

`` Every time technology makes another leap forward , we have to reclaim the Fourth Amendment , and often we have to reclaim the entire Bill of Rights , because technology gives us powers that were not envisioned by the Founding Fathers , '' Barlow said .

The security agency said that it searches only for prohibited items -- not illegal items such as drugs . When it finds illegal items during a search , it refers the item to local law enforcement officers , it says .

`` What we 're trying to resolve is the anomaly that we 're seeing on the body , '' said Rossides . `` If it 's drugs , then we call in local law enforcement and they handle it from there . ''

Barlow predicted that the body scanner will lead to another court case to clarify the extent it can be used to search the body .

`` Eventually they 're going to bust somebody for something that was clearly and obviously not a threat to the aircraft , and any reasonable person would have known that -LSB- while looking at the -RSB- body scan . And at that point somebody is going to make it an issue , '' he said .

Rossides said the body imagers are especially useful because they can expose contraband on parts of the body that are n't fully explored in pat-downs , such as the groin .

`` I think what was so telling about the Christmas Day attack was that it exploited our cultural norms , that we do n't frequently pat down persons in that part of the body . This technology will give us the image of the entire body , '' she said .

But Rossides said the imagers are not a `` silver bullet '' because `` those who intend to do harm are constantly adapting . ''

`` We still have to have multiple layers of security , '' she said .

For all his reservations about scanners , Barlow said he does not hesitate going through one .

`` I 've got nothing to hide , '' he said . `` I go through the scanner . If anybody wants to see me naked , they 're welcome to the sight . ''
