-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Skeletal remains found in a hayfield are those of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington , a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police said Wednesday .

The remains were identified based on dental records provided by the victim 's family , spokeswoman Corinne Geller said .

Morgan Harrington , a 20-year-old education major , went to a Metallica concert at the University of Virginia 's John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville , Virginia , on October 17 . She was separated from her friends and was the subject of repeated searches .

`` Investigators are now working to determine how the remains came to be in this particular location , cause and time of death , and identifying who was responsible for the remains being there , '' Geller said in a news release .

More information is expected after the completion of an autopsy , the spokeswoman added .

Police said skeletal remains were found Tuesday morning by a farmer driving a tractor through a hay field on his 700-acre farm . The area has no public access point , police said .

The farm is about 10 miles from where the concert was being held .

The farm 's owner , David Dass , told CNN affiliate WTVR that he was out looking for damage after wind and rain knocked down several trees in his yard over the past week . He told WTVR that the area is at least a mile and a half from a main roadway .

`` I looked down and saw what looked like a human skull , and my first thought was that it was Morgan Harrington , '' Dass told WTVR , adding that he immediately called 911 .

WTVR : State police ` confident ' remains are Harrington

There was significant evidence leading police to believe that the remains are Harrington 's , Virginia State Police Col. W. Steven Flaherty said , though he declined to specify what the evidence was .

Police said the area where the remains were found had not been searched during the early stages of the investigation into her disappearance .

The girl 's parents , Dan and Gil Harrington , were in town to identify the remains , WTVR reported .

Dan Harrington , in tears , told WTVR that `` this is a horrible day '' for his family .

Gil Harrington expressed concerns Saturday that there was beginning to be complacency in the search , she wrote in a blog on the Web site set up to help find their daughter .

On Sunday , more than three months after Morgan went missing , Gil Harrington still clung to hope .

`` Despite the length of time Morgan has been gone I remain hopeful , '' she wrote . `` Part of me is waiting to be surprised . Waiting for God to pull the rabbit out of the hat and bring Morgan home .

`` I remember that the light always returns , it can not help but return . Will the light of my life return soon ? I can not imagine that all the water of Morgan 's potential is to run down the drain and be wasted . Can it really play out like that ? ''

Now , it appears , the Harringtons finally have their answer . Police say they have now switched their focus to finding out how Morgan Harrington ended up in the remote farm and who put her there .

During the concert , Harrington left her friends to use the restroom , police said . When she did not return , they called her cell phone at 8:48 p.m. . She told them she was outside the arena and could not get back in because of its policy , police said , but told them not to worry about her and that she would find a ride home .

There are restrooms inside the arena , police said , and police do not know how or why Harrington got outside . Witnesses who saw her outside the arena said she did not appear to be with anyone , police said .

About 9:30 p.m. that night , witnesses reported seeing a person matching Harrington 's description walking on a nearby bridge , police said . No further sightings were reported .

Harrington 's purse , with her identification and cell phone inside , was found the following day in an overflow parking lot near the arena , police said . A friend had driven Harrington 's car to the concert , she said , and was still in possession of the car keys when they got separated .

Harrington was reported missing the day after the concert , when she did not show up at her parents ' home to study for a math exam with her father .

Working with police and the Texas-based Laura Recovery Center , the Harringtons organized community searches , saying they would not give up hope that their daughter would be found .

A $ 150,000 reward has been offered for information leading to Harrington 's whereabouts , police said . Of that , Metallica contributed $ 50,000 .

The couple was joined at a news conference after her disappearance by Ed Smart , whose daughter Elizabeth was abducted in 2002 . She returned home nine months later , after police say they found her in the custody of Brian David Mitchell and his wife , Wanda Barzee .

Harrington said he reached out to Smart last week to seek advice on how to go through the disappearance of a child .

Harrington was wearing a black Pantera T-shirt , a black miniskirt , black tights and black boots when last seen .
