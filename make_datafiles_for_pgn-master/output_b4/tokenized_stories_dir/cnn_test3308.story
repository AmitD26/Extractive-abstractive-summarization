-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iceland 's voters overwhelmingly rejected a deal to pay billions of dollars it owes to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , the Foreign Ministry said Sunday .

With around 90 percent of votes counted , just over 93 percent said no and just under 2 percent said yes . Not enough votes remain to be counted to change the result . Some 62.5 percent of Iceland 's roughly 200,000 register voters cast ballots , the ministry said .

The referendum was on a law about repaying the Netherlands and UK , which helped savers in their own countries who lost money in a failed Icelandic Internet bank .

The British and Dutch governments came up with more than $ 5 billion for bailing out people who lost money in Icesave -- an online retail bank branch of Landsbanki . That Icelandic bank failed in October 2008 , along with two other banks in the country .

Under a European Union directive , Iceland now owes compensation to Britain and the Netherlands . The Icelandic government has said it will honor its international obligations .

Iceland 's parliament passed a bill authorizing a state guarantee for repayment of the funds , but President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson declined to sign it in January . He cited public disapproval , and in particular , an Internet petition signed by up to one-quarter of the electorate , as a reason for not signing the bill . He said there needed to be a national consensus in addressing the issue .

That prompted Saturday 's national referendum on the law .

The Icelandic public widely disapproved of the deal , the government said in a fact sheet on the deal . `` There is widespread frustration over the claim on ordinary citizens in Iceland to pay the price for the irresponsible behavior of reckless bankers , '' it said .

Magnus Arni Skulason , who campaigned against the bill , called the terms of the loan repayment unacceptable .

`` Of course we feel empathy for those people that lost money , '' he said Saturday while voting was going on . `` We just want to get a more reasonable agreement , '' he told CNN .

It is not clear what happens now that voters have said no to the loan guarantees .

The International Monetary Fund loaned Iceland $ 2.1 billion in November , and said repaying the money to the British and Dutch governments was a requirement of the loan .

Iceland has begun moves toward applying for European Union membership , which Britain and the Netherlands could block .

Britain spent £ 2.3 billion -LRB- $ 3.69 billion -RRB- last year to cover the losses that British savers incurred when Icelandic banks collapsed .

The Dutch government spent € 1.3 billion -LRB- $ 1.87 billion -RRB- to cover bank losses in the country .

The Icelandic government said it has `` clearly stated its intention to honor its international obligations and remains fully committed to implementing the bilateral loan agreements with the UK and the Netherlands . ''
