-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A tornado almost a mile wide tore through Mississippi on Saturday , killing at least 10 people and causing significant injuries and damage as it raked cities from the central western border with Louisiana northeastward to Alabama .

Two of the dead were children and one was a 3-month-old baby , according to Mississippi Emergency Management Agency -LRB- MEMA -RRB- spokesman Jeff Rent .

The death toll is expected to rise as rescue crews reach hard-hit areas where structures have been badly damaged , said another MEMA spokesman , Greg Flynn .

Five of the dead were from Choctaw County , in the north central part of of the state , four were from Yazoo County , north of Jackson , and one was from Holmes County , also in the north central Mississippi , he said .

Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , who was in Yazoo City where his home is located , called the twister `` gigantic '' and said that `` in places -LSB- it -RSB- seemed to be to be several miles wide . ''

Some residents were trapped in badly damaged homes , he said .

`` They 're working to get to the people and rescue as many as they can , '' said Dan Turner , a spokesman for the governor , reporting `` significant injuries '' in at least three counties .

Residents from the region shared tales of tragedy and survival on Saturday evening .

Dale Thrasher was inside Yazoo City 's Hillcrest Baptist Church when it was flattened by the tornado .

`` I went in the sanctuary and got under the pulpit table and the whole building fell around me , '' he said .

His injuries : `` three little scratches . ''

Rob and Ashley Saxton were driving to a Yazoo City restaurant owned by Rob 's father -- planning to take shelter in the restaurant 's walk-in freezer ahead of the tornado -- when the twister blew out the car 's windows at a red light . The car was tossed across the intersection , then picked up again and flung into the restaurant .

`` When the windows exploded it was n't like anything I 've ever experienced , '' Rob Saxton said . `` It was amazing . It scared us plumb to death . ''

Many tornado victims were seeking attention at King 's Daughters hospital in Yazoo City , where only one doctor was on duty Saturday night , said Jess Silvino , a nurse there .

The hospital is expecting `` another one or two waves of victims '' as crews are able to fully access the tornado 's path , said Richard Summers , chairman of emergency medicine at the medical center .

The hospital has crews in Yazoo City and Lexington that have been `` amazed and astounded '' by the amount of damage they 're seeing , Summers said .

Mississippi residents reported that the path of the twister was a half-mile to a mile wide , said Mark McAllister , a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Jackson .

CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said the tornado had traveled 150 miles across Mississippi , starting in the western part of the state and moving northeast before weakening as it moved into Alabama .

In Yazoo City , Fire Chief Roy Wilson said that between 20 to 30 houses were destroyed , and said some people were trapped inside structures . Wilson said he did n't yet have confirmed numbers on injuries .

`` It 's in pretty bad shape so far , '' he said of the city .

Speaking to reporters in Yazoo City , Barbour said that 17 injured have been taken to a hospital via ambulance and that two others were airlifted to Jackson .

`` By God 's grace -LSB- the tornado -RSB- did not go into the most central part of the city , the most populous . However , it went through the southern edge and eastern edge of town in a number of large neighborhoods , '' he said . `` A number of businesses have been destroyed and others severely damaged -- there are churches that have been obliterated . ''

Saturday 's tornado was part of a broad band of storms that stretched from Missouri to the Florida Panhandle , Jeras said .

The storm system struck Louisiana before it moved into Mississippi . A Tallulah , Louisiana , police dispatcher said a chemical plant in the city had been damaged , but could not give further details .

Turner , the Mississippi governor 's spokesman , said emergency response teams had been slowed by people out surveying the effects of the storm .

`` One of the biggest obstacles is , of course , people are curious and want to get out and see the damage , '' he said . `` We 've urged people to stay away from those areas , not only because it slows down the emergency response , but there are also still live electrical wires , there are open gas lines that will have to be shut down .
