PHOENIX , Arizona -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thirty-year-old Lisa Locascio is walking through what she hopes will soon be her new living room .

Lisa Locascio is trying to buy her first home with help from the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program .

`` The carpet 's clearly trashed , but that 's going to get ripped out , '' she says .

She 's excited to become a first-time homebuyer and has been shopping exclusively for foreclosed homes in the Phoenix , Arizona , area for several weeks now .

`` It 's the American dream , '' Locascio says of home ownership , and she 's just zeroed in on the one she wants to be hers . She has a bid in and is waiting to hear on her offer .

Financially strapped prospective buyers like Locascio have discovered hope in the Neighborhood Stabilization Program , a year-old federal program designed to help stabilize communities decimated by foreclosures and abandonment . Families and individuals who qualify can get a loan of up to $ 15,000 to cover down payment and closing costs of foreclosed homes . The amount varies by region , but can amount to tens of thousands of dollars .

Congress approved the nationwide program in July 2008 , pumping a total of $ 3.92 billion into the hardest-hit communities . Almost $ 2 billion more was allocated in May .

A total of $ 121 million in funding arrived in Arizona in April , and the Phoenix area received the largest cut , approximately $ 39.4 million .

Program watch dogs are keeping their eyes on states like Arizona to see how the money will be spent and whether it will make a difference .

Arizona had the fourth highest rate of new foreclosures in May , according to Realty Trac .

With such a high foreclosure rate , the funds allocated to Arizona , and in particular the Phoenix area , were significant .

However , not one home in Phoenix has been purchased using the NSP funds despite hundreds of applications . People are still trying to navigate an unfamiliar process , housing experts in Phoenix say .

Locascio would be thrilled to be the first person to close on a home . She is single and works as a project manager at a Scottsdale asset management company . However , she currently has no savings . After recently providing financial assistance to a relative -- a move that depleted her bank account -- Locascio admits she never thought she 'd be able to afford a home of her own any time soon . She 's unable to meet the 3.5 percent down payment required for the most affordable government-backed home loans ; therefore , she had resigned herself to paying rent until she was able to recoup her savings .

That 's when a friend , Lance Connolly , a Phoenix Realtor , told Locascio of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program .

`` My Realtor filled me in on it , and then I did some research on it and decided that would probably be the best route to take , '' Locascio says . The program is limited to applicants with incomes between $ 55,350 and $ 104,400 , depending on family size , according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development . The income limits vary from region to region .

Applicants must also complete eight hours of financial counseling and courses in budgeting and home ownership , and be able to invest $ 1,000 of their own money . Under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program , HUD requires the lender to give buyers a 15 % discount below the appraised value and the loan must be paid back in full when the homeowner sells the home or refinances . Lenders are not required , however , to accept a discounted offer .

Once approved for the maximum loan , Locascio wasted little time in locating and bidding on a property she liked . Although Locascio 's bid was $ 30,000 less than the listing price , offers like hers are common in the Phoenix area . On any given day in 2009 , real estate listings can show more than 25,000 foreclosed single family homes available .

Locascio said , `` I 'd be disappointed '' if the bank turned down her offer .

Locascio has good credit , and so she qualified for a $ 275,000 fixed-rate mortgage using the approved federal funds . She believes taking the mandated classes taught her the importance of personal affordability . `` I liked the programs , the counseling and things like that that teach you not to live outside your means ... I do n't want to be house poor , '' Locascio said .

Under the scenario of her bid , Locascio would only have to come up with about $ 1,500 on her own for earnest money and appraisal costs . If approved , her monthly mortgage payment would actually be $ 180 less than what she is paying to rent for a two-bedroom , 900-square foot apartment .

Connolly has been in the Phoenix real estate market for about nine years and has seen the disastrous real estate downturn up close . He hopes to soon see more clients using NSP funding .

`` It 's just kind of coming out now that people are understanding it 's there . I do n't think they have done a very big promotion ... put it on billboards or anything like that to say , ` Hey , this is available to you , ' '' Connolly said . Until now , Connolly said , Internet-savvy house hunters have had to discover the program on their own .

Experts want to caution those who think the Neighborhood Stabilization Program will solve Phoenix 's devastated real estate market .

John Smith , president of Mesa , Arizona-based Housing Our Communities , a nonprofit that helps people find affordable housing , says that wo n't happen .

`` We have to identify those goals , those strategies and those resources that are going to make a difference , '' he says . `` This is not , in and of itself , going to do that . ''

He compares the program to a Band-Aid , cautioning , `` It is only one tool ... we 're going to have to find some other solutions to stabilize these communities . ''

Communities are visibly ailing all across the area , with some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods nearly abandoned by foreclosures . Homes are boarded up and weeds cover the `` For Sale '' and `` For Rent '' signs in thousands of yards .

`` It 's overwhelming when you look at the numbers , '' Smith said , noting that Phoenix still records roughly 8,000 new foreclosure notices every month .

Smith estimates the loan program will probably help only about 1,000 families acquire homes across the Phoenix metro area .

Nonprofit housing assistance programs such as Smith 's are available in many cities across the country to educate and counsel prospective home buyers and inform them of available assistance . However , Smith cautions it 's not just about quick ownership .

`` We just do n't want houses to be bought and sold . We want families to invest and develop affordable , sustainable home ownership throughout the community . '' Smith urges patience and warns it will take full cooperation for all sectors to turn the housing crisis around .

`` We have to encourage the private sector , the banking industry , the mortgage industry to also get involved and provide product that makes it possible for families to buy houses . It all ca n't be federal money , '' Smith said .

Less than 24 hours after submitting her bid , Locascio received a call from the bank . After watching the property sit foreclosed and idle on the market for almost two months , she was informed that someone else beat her bid by only a few hours . Despite the funding assistance , Locascio quickly learned there are no assurances or guarantees in the federally funded home buying process . She later found two more places she likes and placed bids on them .

She hopes one of the banks will come through quickly and make her a new homeowner , the first to use funds from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program .
