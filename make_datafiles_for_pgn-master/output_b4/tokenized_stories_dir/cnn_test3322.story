-LRB- Wired -RRB- -- On its tenth anniversary in 2008 , Google promised $ 10 million to the best five ideas for using technology to improve the world , through Project 10x100 -- a neat play on words -LRB- 10 to the 100th power expresses the number `` googol , '' which is a one followed by one hundred zeroes -RRB- .

Google 's intentions were good , of course -- $ 10 million spent the right way could have a real impact on these problems , which range from building better banking tools to a real-time , user-reported news service .

However , the company 's follow-through leaves much to be desired . Google announced this cash prize contest in September 2008 and closed public voting on 16 finalists chosen from over 150,000 ideas in October 2009 . Over eight months later , the company has yet to announce the winners .

Meanwhile , e-mails sent to Project 10 to the 100th 's Gmail account are bouncing , indicating that Google has deleted the address . And the company 's press department has yet to respond to our inquiries about the project .

`` We 'll announce the winning big ideas in the near future , '' reads a notice on the project 's website , which lists '' Â© 2009 Google '' at the bottom . According to Daniel Meyerowitz , who says his idea for mapping ongoing genocides and providing early warning of new ones is a finalist in the competition , Google has not said a peep about this competition in nine months -- despite having apologized for delays as early as March 2009 .

`` While genocide and other pressing problems relentlessly advance , it would seem that Project 10 ^ 100 does not , '' Meyerowitz told Wired.com . `` Years behind schedule . Nine months since announcing their most recent delay . How hard can it be to give away ten million bucks ? Harder than Google can handle , apparently . ''

Google , which reported revenue of $ 6.77 billion for the first quarter of this year , could practically consider $ 10 million to be a rounding error , so money is n't the problem . And the company already did the hard work of combining the overt 150,000 submitted ideas , many of which were duplicates or complementary , into 16 `` theme '' ideas , on which the public has already voted .

Assuming the project is still ongoing , Google will select an organization already involved with the issue to receive a share of the cash with the goal of solving the problem . So all that remains for the company to do at this point is to announce the five winning ideas and the organizations that will receive the money to implement them .

`` An inspirational effort which began in the best Google tradition seems to be mired in the worst Google lapses , '' said Meyerowitz , who brought this situation to our attention . `` When can we expect the final projects to be funded ? Or how about just a blog update ? ''

Google 's not talking -- not yet , anyway . But apparently , it 's the process of choosing the right organizations to address these issues that threatens to turn Google 's 10th birthday celebration into a 12th birthday surprise .
