Goma , Democratic Republic Of The Congo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Rwandan military and an allied rebel group massacred ethnic Hutus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the aftermath of genocide in Rwanda , says a leaked draft report commissioned by the United Nations .

The report states that it is not making a definitive conclusion on whether the slayings in Congo amounted to genocide , and that a competent judiciary would have to try the cases .

Commissioned by the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , the report says `` tens of thousands '' of Hutu civilians were slaughtered with knives , bludgeoned with hammers and burned alive as the Rwandan army and the Allied Democratic Liberation Forces swept across Congo -- then called Zaire -- leading to the toppling of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko .

The report , titled `` Mapping Exercise , '' documents crimes against humanity throughout the Congo between 1993 and 2003 .

The Rwandan government blasted the report as `` malicious , offensive and ridiculous . ''

`` It is immoral and unacceptable that the United Nations , an organization that failed outright to prevent genocide in Rwanda and the subsequent refugees crisis -LSB- and -RSB- is the direct cause for so much suffering in Congo and Rwanda , now accuses the army that stopped the genocide ... in the Democratic Republic of Congo , '' government spokesman Ben Rutsinga said in a statement .

The final version of the report will be officially published Monday . Its most controversial parts are accusations against the Rwandan government of `` systematic attacks , in particular , killings and massacres perpetrated against members of the Hutu ethnic group . ''

`` There is no denying that ethnic massacres were committed and that the victims were mostly Hutus from Burundi , Rwanda and Zaire , '' the report states . `` The joint mission 's preliminary opinion is that some of these alleged massacres could constitute acts of genocide . ''

It adds , `` The majority of the victims were children , women , elderly people and the sick , who posed no threat to the attacking forces . ''

The Rwandan government said the report 's `` extremely serious allegations '' are `` based on questionable methodology , sourcing and shockingly low standard of proof . ''

`` Given the gravity of its mission , the Mapping Team 's failure to consult with Rwanda even though they found time to meet with over 200 -LSB- non-governmental -RSB- representatives is shocking and shows complete disregard for fundamental fairness , '' Rutsinga said .

More than 1 million Rwandans fled to neighboring eastern Congo when the Rwandan genocide ended in 1994 -- most of them Hutu . In 1996 , Rwanda invaded Congo in pursuit of the genocide orchestrators , who were living amid hundreds of thousands of other refugees .

The stated goal of Rwanda during that time was to end the refugee crisis in eastern Congo . But the United Nations report says that the Rwandan military did not discriminate between fugitives and refugees , nor did it discriminate by age or gender .

`` The majority of the incidents reported indicate that the Hutus were targeted as such , with no discrimination between them , '' the report says . `` The numerous attacks against the Hutus in Zaire , who were not part of the refugees , seem to confirm that it was all Hutus , as such . ''

The report says people who convinced soldiers that they were Tutsi were let go , while the Hutus were massacred .

`` People who were able to persuade the aggressors that they belonged to another ethnic group were released just before the massacres , '' the report says .

The report says tens of thousands of Hutus were massacred in particular areas with an intent to commit genocide .

`` Even if only a part of the Hutu population in Zaire was targeted and destroyed , it could nonetheless constitute a crime of genocide , if this was the intention of the perpetrators , '' the report says .

Although independent researchers have documented the crimes against humanity committed by the Rwandan government , the United Nations report is the most official and forthcoming accusation made so far .

Rwanda indicated that it could withdraw from U.N. peacekeeping operations if the report is published . The country is a major contributor to the peacekeeping force in Darfur , and has sent troops to Haiti .

The report is publicly humiliating for recently re-elected President Paul Kagame , who earned praise for helping heal Rwanda after the genocide .

In recent years , the nation has developed dramatically , with a reputation as one of the safest , cleanest , least-corrupt and most organized countries in Africa . The fallout of the scathing report is unclear , but it is sure to have an impact .

Rwanda 's reconciliation policy is governed by anti-genocide laws that human rights organizations have called intentionally vague . The laws make it virtually impossible to accuse the Rwandan government of human rights violations , crimes against humanity or war crimes .

Accusing Rwanda of crimes against humanity committed in the Congo would break those laws .

In April , presidential aspirant Victoire Ingabire was arrested in Kigali for saying that Hutus were killed by the Rwandan government , both in Rwanda and in neighboring Congo .

Ingabire was charged with ` genocide ideology ' for those comments , and could face up to 25 years in prison . Her American lawyer was arrested on similar charges , but was later released .

Col. Patrick Karegeya , who was a senior member of the Rwandan army and a key actor in the wars in the Congo before fleeing to South Africa in 2008 , said Rwanda never set out to commit genocide against the Hutu , but war crimes were committed .

`` Civilians died , politicians died , '' Karegeya said earlier this month before Rwanda 's presidential election . `` They died in the Congo , they died in other places . ''
