-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The son of a Florida couple known for adopting special-needs children was in his parents ' room when they were slain in a home invasion last month , according to documents released by prosecutors .

Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr. , 35 , is one of seven people charged with murder .

A nurse who works with special-needs children interviewed the boy , who has autism and speech issues , regarding the deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings . The nurse told police that the child said `` two bad men '' were wearing black masks when they knocked on the door . They woke Byrd Billings and said , `` You 're going to die . ''

The child , whose age was not given , said one of the men counted to three `` before he shot mom and dad , '' and his father kept screaming , `` No way , no way . ''

Byrd Billings grabbed the back of one man 's neck and struggled with him before he was shot , the child said . The boy said Melanie Billings `` got shot in her shirt . ''

Another child told the same nurse he was upstairs in bed and stayed in his room when he heard the knock on the door . The second boy recalled hearing `` seven booms '' and crept into the hallway . He heard Melanie Billings scream , he said , but stayed upstairs until police arrived .

It was unclear from the interviews whether the men knocked on the bedroom door or the front door of the home .

The Billingses were shot and killed July 9 in their Beulah , Florida , home . Seven males are charged with first-degree murder and home invasion robbery . An eighth suspect , a woman , faces a charge of being an accessory after the fact . The seven males , including a 16-year-old charged as an adult , pleaded not guilty to the charges last week .

The children 's accounts were contained in hundreds of pages of documents released this week by the state attorney 's office as part of the pretrial discovery process .

Also in the documents is a police interview with Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr. , 35 , one of the seven suspects and the man police believe was the organizer of the slayings . Two of the other suspects told authorities he was the lone gunman , according to court documents .

Gonzalez told authorities in a July 22 interview that a group of car dealers did not like Byrd Billings and had gotten together to discuss the problem . Used car dealer Henry `` Cab '' Tice came to him , Gonzalez said , and told him the group wanted Billings killed , but he refused to do it .

Another son of Billings told police that a man named `` Cab '' had `` double-crossed '' his father and that the son was present when the two men argued .

Tice has been questioned but not charged in the slayings . He is charged , however , with one count of grand theft for allegedly writing a series of bad checks to Billings , authorities have said . Various interviews in the documents point to a close relationship between Tice and Gonzalez .

Also released by prosecutors was a transcript of a police interview with Tice in which he acknowledged accepting a $ 20,000 loan from a man he later learned was connected with the Mexican Mafia . Tice said he was told his family could be killed if the money was not repaid . Police had previously said Tice was believed to owe the Mexican Mafia money .

Contacted by CNN Tuesday , Tice refused comment . But in an interview Monday with CNN affiliate WEAR , Tice said Gonzalez 's comments about him constitute an `` act of a desperate man . ''

`` There is nobody that I know in Pensacola that would want to see Bud Billings killed , '' Tice told WEAR , using Billings ' nickname . `` There are business people in Pensacola that are upset with him , that were upset with him , but nobody that I know would want to see Bud Billings killed . ''

The Billingses each had two biological children and had adopted 13 children . Police have said nine of the children were home during the slayings and several were believed to have seen the gunmen . One child managed to flee the home and seek help from a neighbor .

Autopsy reports also were released . They showed that the Billingses were shot multiple times . Byrd Billings also had a white zip tie on his left arm , according to the report .

The eighth suspect in the case , Pamela Wiggins , was taken back into custody Monday after her bond was raised from $ 10,000 to $ 500,000 . Authorities said they found a safe belonging to the Billingses in Wiggins ' backyard . That safe contained prescription medications , family documents and jewelry and was taken from the home during the slayings .

Family members have since confirmed that a second safe was in the home and that it contained $ 164,000 , antique jewelry and legal documents . The second safe was not taken .

The released documents also said that safe contained a sealed hard drive , a detail not previously revealed . The Billings family agreed to allow authorities access to that hard drive , according to the documents .

Prosecutors believe there were dual motives in the killings : robbery and a contracted hit , a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN last month . The source said prosecutors were working under the belief that most of the suspects in the case were told only that they were robbing the Billingses , but that Gonzalez and other yet-unnamed suspects also were plotting to kill the couple . The source was not sure of the alleged motive behind the slayings .

Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has said publicly his office believes a contract hit was a possibility . The state attorney 's office said last month it was focusing on the robbery , but was willing to consider other motives .
