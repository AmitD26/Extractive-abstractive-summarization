Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The challenger in a hotly contested race for a U.S. House seat in central Florida accused Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson on Monday of using misleading edits in a campaign ad to distort his comments .

Former Florida state Rep. Dan Webster said the new ad by Grayson 's re-election campaign does n't accurately portray what the GOP candidate said .

`` Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom -- in Afghanistan , in Iran and right here in Central Florida , '' says the narrator in the 30-second Grayson spot , which is cast on a background of Afghan women in burqas , militants with machine guns , and maps of Iran and Afghanistan .

The ad which began airing over the weekend shows Webster telling a Christian group : `` Wives , submit yourself to your own husband '' and `` she should submit to me . ''

But video of Webster 's full comment , provided to CNN by his campaign from a 2009 address in Nashville , Tennessee , seems to show a different picture of the candidate 's intent .

`` So , write a journal . Second , find a verse . I have a verse for my wife . I have verses for my wife , '' Webster goes onto say . `` Do n't pick the ones that say , ` she should submit to me . ' It 's in the Bible , but pick the ones that you 're supposed to do .

`` So instead , ` Love your wife , even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it , ' as opposed to , ` Wives submit yourselves to your husband . ' She can pray that if she wants to , but do n't you pray it . ''

The Grayson campaign dismissed questions Monday over whether their editing had distorted the meaning of Webster 's comments .

`` Webster is a member of this group , Institute for Basic Life Principles . That 's where he was speaking , '' said Grayson campaign spokesman Sam Drzymala .

`` They are a group that interpret the Bible literally . When Webster says ` she should submit to me ' is in the Bible , he believes that 's the truth , '' Drzymala said . `` He is explaining that women and children should be submissive to their husbands and fathers , but that the men have to earn it , not just expect it . ''

The Grayson attack ad is the second in a matter of days to draw fire over factual claims .

Last week , the two-term Florida Democrat 's campaign released a spot dubbing Webster a `` draft dodger , '' during the Vietnam War . The ad cites a series of student deferments the GOP candidate received before reporting for duty . He was ultimately disqualified for medical reasons .
