-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Germany 's Martin Kaymer beat Bubba Watson after a three-hole playoff to win the 92nd PGA Championship at Whistling Straits and claim his first major title .

Dustin Johnson should have joined Kaymer and fellow American Watson in the playoff but was controversially penalized two-shots for an infringement on the final hole in regulation play .

Johnson initially finished on 11-under 277 but was ruled to have grounded his club in a bunker before playing his second shot to the 18th green and his five became a triple bogey seven , putting him back to nine-under .

Watson initially made the running in the playoff as he made a birdie at the first extra hole , but Kaymer hit back with a birdie of his own on the next .

The 18th proved the decider and Watson found the water with his approach to the green and could only make a double bogey .

Kaymer was also in trouble , but made a two-foot bogey putt to clinch victory after a dramatic final day in Wisconsin .

`` I hope it is one of many majors I win in my career . It 's spectacular , '' the 25-year-old told gathered reporters .

Long recognized as a star of the future , Kaymer becomes the second German after Bernhard Langer to win a golfing major .

He is also the third first-time major winner this season after U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland and British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa .

Phil Mickelson , who won the first of the season at the U.S. Masters made a last day charge , but his five-under 67 left him in a tie for 12th .

It means Tiger Woods remains as world number one , but he finished well off the pace after a fine round one-over 73 , still searching for the first win of his truncated season .

Northern Ireland 's Rory McIlroy and another American Zach Johnson shared third , both having their chances to claim victory , but missing the playoff by one shot .

Overnight leader Nick Watney lost his three shot lead on the first hole and carded a sorry nine-under 81 to slip into a tie for 17th .

But it was hard not to feel sorry for Johnson , who had blown a three-shot final round lead at the U.S. Open in search of his first major title .

A superb birdie two on the short 17th had left him needing a par four on the final hole to emerge on top after a fluctuating final day .

But his tee shot found a sandy lie in an area trampled by spectators , one of many such areas at Whistling Straits .

Johnson did not believe it constituted a regular bunker and illegally placed his club face on the ground before making his shot .

After he finished his round with a bogey five , officials examined television footage of the incident and handed down the penalty .

`` It never crossed my mind I was in a sandtrap , '' said Johnson . `` That was one situation where I should have looked at the rule sheet a little harder . ''

Whistling Straits , which has the look of a seaside links course , has nearly 1,000 sanded areas and under local rules all of them are designated as bunkers .

Johnson finished in a tie for fifth with compatriot Jason Dufner and Australian Steve Elkington .

China 's Liang Wen-chong , who set the course record with a 64 on Saturday , shot a final round one-over 73 and finished in a tie for eighth .
