-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Roger Federer cruised into the quarterfinals of the Toronto Masters tournament with a 7-6 6-3 win over Frenchman Michael Llodra on Thursday .

It earns the former world number one a rematch with Czech Tomas Berdych , who beat him in the quarterfinals to end his reign as Wimbledon champion in a massive upset .

Earlier , seventh seed Berdych continued his fine form this season with a hard-fought 6-3 6-7 6-4 win over Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine .

Federer , who is playing his first tournament since the grass court grand slam , showed he is returning to best form after an early scare .

Llodra went up an early break in the first set , but once Federer drew level it was one-way traffic .

The third seed claimed the subsequent tiebreak seven points to two and early breaks of service in the second put him in command .

Federer , who has slipped behind Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in the rankings , will be intent on revenge when he faces his Wimledon nemesis .

`` Playing Berdych is going to bring back memories , some not so nice , '' he told Sky Sports .

Defending champion Andy Murray survived a second set slump to record a 6-2 0-6 6-3 victory over 15th seed Gael Monfils .

Scot Murray was in total command in the opener but his French opponent hit back with a vengeance as he whitewashed him in the second .

But fourth seed Murray regained his composure and with the injury-hit Monfils receiving treatment for a shoulder problem in the decider , he eased to victory .

Washington champion David Nalbandian is also into the last eight , claiming the scalp of fifth seed Robin Soderling as he claimed his 11th straight victory on the ATP Tour , a personal record .

The Argentine won 4-6 6-4 6-1 as he broke the Swede 's powerful service six times , sweeping through the decider after falling a set behind .

Sixth seed Nikolay Davydenko is also out , the Russian beaten 6-3 6-2 by unseeded Frenchman Jeremy Chardy .

World number one Rafael Nadal was playing his last 16 match later Thursday in the night session , taking on giant South African Kevin Anderson .
