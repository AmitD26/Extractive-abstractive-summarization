New Delhi , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An official with the Indian lawn bowls team has been diagnosed with dengue fever but is in stable condition , doctors confirmed Monday .

Ruptu Gogoi was hospitalized on Friday , according to doctors , who suspect the 30-year-old male patient could have contracted the mosquito-borne viral disease from outside the Commonwealth Games athletes ' village in New Delhi .

Gogoi had complained of feeling sick a day after he arrived at the athletes village last month , said Rajiv Sagar , a spokesman for the G.B. Pant Hospital in the city .

Doctors , therefore , think he may have acquired the mosquito-borne viral disease from outside the facility , Sagar said .

Dengue is the most common virus transmitted by mosquitoes in the world . It causes as many as 100 million infections and kills 25,000 people every year . Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide , mostly in urban and semi-urban areas , according to the World Health Organization .

Meanwhile , after harsh criticism and controversy , the 2010 Commonwealth Games began Sunday with a lavish opening ceremony .

Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium gleamed with multi-colored lights as representatives from Commonwealth countries walked the length of the field by turns , waving their flags and wearing traditional native costumes .

It 's the first time India has hosted the international sporting event between countries of the former British Empire . The games , held every four years , include many Olympic events as well as other sports played traditionally in those countries .

Among the competitions is lawn bowling , where the object is to get more of one team 's ball closer to a small white ball , or jack , than the opponent .

Britain 's Prince Charles and Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil officially declared the games open . Prince Charles was representing his mother , Queen Elizabeth .

The games have been a tough act for a nation that has never hosted such a large international event .

Parliament has been forced to deal with accusations of corruption in the planning of the games .

Two weeks ago , gunmen fired on a tourist bus in New Delhi and injured two Taiwanese tourists . A car blaze turned out to be a crudely manufactured bomb . And a militant group warned that it planned to target the games .

Indian law enforcement authorities responded with a heightened security plan , placing thousands of extra forces on the streets of the capital .

If all that were n't enough , two days before athletes were scheduled to begin arriving , complaints rang out across the globe about their shoddy living quarters .

`` You know , construction dust is still there , filth , excrement , it really is disgusting in parts and it really requires a professional deep clean throughout the entire complex , '' said Michael Hooper , chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Games Federation .

As if to amplify Hooper 's complaint , a pedestrian bridge leading to Nehru stadium collapsed that same day .

Two world-class athletes canceled their trips , citing security and health concerns . Entire teams threatened to do the same , while others delayed their arrival date .

Indian officials went to work on a massive clean-up effort . In the end , athletes from 71 countries showed up .
