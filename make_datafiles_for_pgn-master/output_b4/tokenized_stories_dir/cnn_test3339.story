Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law , it was clear he would face an uphill battle defending the law and communicating its benefits to the American public .

In the months leading to passage , we heard cries of rationing , death panels and blatant mischaracterization of what is in the bill .

Since passage , the cries have shifted from rationing to repeal . Efforts to repeal the law have been highlighted by the self-proclaimed `` Young Guns '' of the GOP -- House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia , Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California . President Obama should not be fazed by this or any other calls for repeal . He should do the job he was elected to do and protect patients ' interests , but he will need to face a confused public .

In a recent national survey conducted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners , only 14 percent of respondents correctly identified September as the starting month for the law 's first set of patient protections . Less than half understood that health reform would allow for them to receive preventive care services without having to pay anything . Even fewer could specifically identify other important provisions that started on or after September 23 , 2010 .

Moreover , a recent Associated Press poll found that a quarter of Americans believe incorrectly that the law designated a panel of government bureaucrats to make decisions about health care for individuals .

The confusion and apathy surrounding the health care reform law leaves ample opportunity for others to mischaracterize and foster doubt , energizing and exciting the repeal platform . The unwavering confidence of dissenters is stronger than a mere promise of good .

But health care reform will not be repealed , and despite messy politics and angry voices , policymakers , providers , insurance companies and other stakeholders are moving quickly to implement the bill .

To override a presidential veto would require a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives and in the Senate . But even according to the GOP 's most optimistic forecasts , Republicans can not expect to achieve a supermajority in both chambers in November .

Republicans may expect to block funds or repeal small parts of the bill . But even that is n't as simple as it sounds . Last week , the Senate voted on two amendments regarding the 1099 provision in the Affordable Care Act introduced by two senators , one by Sen. Mike Johanns , a Republican from Nebraska , and another by Sen. Bill Nelson , a Democrat from Florida .

The 1099 provision requires that businesses report all purchases from vendors over $ 600 , creating a significant burden on small businesses . The Republicans wanted to repeal the provision ; Democrats wanted to change it . Neither amendment was able to muster enough support .

But more importantly , a repeal of health care reform , followed by a replacement with a more modest set of changes , is tantamount to leaving millions of patients in a state of free fall , with no net to catch them . As a physician , I see the consequences of uninsurance and a broken health care system every day .

Frustrated patients , crowded emergency rooms and burdensome insurance requirements are driving good physicians into other professions and making patients feel hopeless . Our system was not working , and we can not afford to quietly stand by while one in seven lack access to basic care and one in six people live in poverty .

It would be unfortunate if our country kept listening to ideological shouting and failed to understand the value of the important provisions in the law .

Health reform starts at birth -- health plans will no longer be able to refuse to cover children younger than 19 simply because they were born with a medical condition . From birth through your 26th birthday , you can stay on your family 's health insurance plan , regardless of your income or marital status .

For female readers of childbearing age , you no longer need a referral to see an OB-GYN doctor . From there , adults and seniors will no longer have cost-sharing provisions for preventive services . And what is a preventive service exactly ? There are at least 45 services that will be covered , including everything from nutrition counseling to cancer screening . Last but not least are the elimination of lifetime caps and the gradual elimination of annual coverage limits .

Together this all adds up to more patient protections than we have ever had , and this is just the beginning . Keep in mind that some of these provisions will not technically kick in until your health plan starts the new plan year , which usually happens in January . But do not wait until then to get your information ; search your plan 's website and talk to your employer 's human resource department or benefits manager .

The real verdict on health reform will likely come in 2014 when an expected 32 million people will be added to insurance exchanges , state Medicaid programs and other private insurance plans . The pathway from here to there is long and filled with many speed bumps , but information , transparency and advocacy are our best friends .

As patients , we should ask questions and not be afraid to challenge our health care system , insurance companies and government officials when we are left feeling confused or misguided .

As medical providers , we must not compromise our responsibility to first do no harm . We should begin by asking our patients what they do and do n't understand and by helping them navigate these uncharted waters together .

As Americans we need to send a strong signal to Republican and Democratic leaders that repeal and replace is not an option .
