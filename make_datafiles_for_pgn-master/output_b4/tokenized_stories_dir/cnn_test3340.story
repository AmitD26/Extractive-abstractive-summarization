Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As an umbrella group of humanitarian entities called for `` urgent international support '' Monday in flood-ravaged Pakistan , the United States was sending materials to provide shelter for almost 47,000 displaced Pakistanis .

The U.S. Embassy said that a cargo aircraft carrying 530 rolls of heavy-duty waterproof and fire-resistant plastic sheeting for use as temporary shelters was sent by the United States to Karachi , Pakistan , on Monday , a day after another flight ferried 240 rolls of plastic sheeting to Karachi .

`` Our experience has shown that plastic sheeting is urgently needed for temporary shelters , and we know it is urgently needed in Sindh as the flood waters continue to move south , '' Ambassador Anne Patterson said in a written statement . `` It will be supplied along with locally purchased materials that can be easily moved when people are able to return home . ''

The embassy said the sheeting material will provide dry shelter for 46,800 people in Sindh province . It was going to a logistics hub in Sindh for distribution by local and international organizations .

To date , the United States has committed approximately $ 76 million for Pakistan emergency flood relief assistance . But the overall global response has not been nearly enough , according to an International Rescue Committee-chaired consortium called the Pakistan Humanitarian Forum .

About $ 150 million had been received from nations around the world by Monday , the group said in a news release , but much more is needed .

`` The international response to the disaster has been too small to even begin to effectively address the needs of survivors , '' said Tammy Hasselfeldt , the country director of the International Rescue Committee , in the release . `` The most urgent priority is to ensure that safe water as well as medicines are available , food supplies are restored and transportation networks fixed to accelerate the delivery of desperately needed aid . ''

John Holmes , the emergency relief coordinator for the United Nations , acknowledged Monday that the international community is just beginning to recognize the massive need in the flood-ravaged country .

`` We know full well we have a lot of people still to reach , a huge distance still to go to make the assistance meet the need , '' he said . `` That 's why we 've appealed for $ 460 million , and I 'm glad to say the international response is beginning to come in . ''

However , he warned that `` we need to see more -- we need to see a response that is commensurate with the size of the disaster that we 're seeing . ''

He noted that while the need is beginning to be recognized , `` unfortunately , the need is still rising because the floods are still rising in some parts of the country . ''

Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said Saturday that as many as 20 million of his countrymen have been affected by the flooding . The Pakistan Humanitarian Forum put the number at 14 million on Monday .

The death toll from the flooding that 's raged more than a fortnight is up to 1,463 , and more than 2,000 people have been injured , the National Disaster Management Authority said Sunday .

With about one-fifth of the country underwater , almost 900,000 homes have been damaged , the agency said .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday that while he has visited sites of natural disasters around the world , he has never seen anything like the devastation created by flooding in Pakistan . He said the disaster is worse than the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 Pakistani earthquake combined .

`` Thousands of towns and villages have simply been washed away , '' Ban said , speaking alongside Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari . `` Roads , buildings , bridges , crops -- millions of livelihoods have been lost . People are marooned on tiny islands with the flood waters all around them . They are drinking dirty water . They are living in the mud and ruins of their lives . Many have lost family and friends . Many more are afraid their children and loved ones will not survive in these conditions . ''

Water-borne bacteria and illness have become serious concerns . At least 36,000 cases of acute watery diarrhea have been reported , the United Nation 's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in Islamabad on Saturday .

Up to 3.5 million children are at high risk of deadly waterborne diseases including watery diarrhea and dysentery , which cause dehydration , said Maurizio Giuliano of the humanitarian affairs office .

Children also are at risk for typhoid and hepatitis A and E , Giuliano said .

Clean water is an urgent need , but UNICEF can not reach all those in need due to a serious lack of funds , Giuliano said . Medication is a priority , but funding shortages hamper the work of the World Health Organization even though plans are in place . Lack of proper food increases vulnerability , the United Nations said .

President Zardari said his nation needs more international help to deal with the immediate recovery efforts as well as longer-term reconstruction and infrastructure development , according to spokesman Farhatullah Babar .

Ban said he is allocating a further $ 10 million from the U.N. 's Central Emergency Response Fund , making $ 27 million allocated since the crisis began .

According to ReliefWeb.int , more than two dozen countries , organizations and individuals have pledged about $ 305 million .

Ban and Zardari have made a public plea to the international community to increase aid .
