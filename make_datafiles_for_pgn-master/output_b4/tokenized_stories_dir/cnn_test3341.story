-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- New Zealand 's air force has gone to the rescue of a sick American -- in Antarctica .

A crew of 12 , plus three medics , flew to evacuate the man Tuesday from the U.S. research base at McMurdo Station .

There were limited details about the man 's health , but he had an illness , rather than an injury , said New Zealand Air Force Squadron Leader Kavae Tamariki .

A rescue team initially set off Monday from Christchurch , but was forced to turn back after about an hour .

With the snow , `` You were n't able to see anything , '' Tamariki said . There also was snow on the runway at McMurdo .

The second flight was able to touch down safely in Antarctica on Tuesday , despite temperatures of 35 below zero Celsius , he said .

`` She 's landed , and we 're just waiting for confirmation that they 've taken off , '' Tamariki said from New Zealand on Tuesday afternoon . The plane was expected back in Christchurch by Tuesday night , after a flight of 6Â 1/2 hours .

It 's the second time in six months that New Zealand 's Air Force has been asked to rescue a sick American from McMurdo , because the Air Force is familiar with Antarctic weather and flying conditions , Tamariki said .

It was unclear what the man in Tuesday 's rescue was doing at McMurdo Station , but research is done at and near the station in aeronomy and astrophysics , biology and medicine , geology and geophysics , glaciology and glacial geology , and ocean and climate systems .

McMurdo was established in 1955 to serve as the logistics hub of the U.S. Antarctic Program . The station -- on the southern tip of Ross Island , on the shore of McMurdo Sound -- has a harbor , a helicopter pad , and landing strips on sea ice and shelf ice , according to the station 's website . The station , which is like a small town , includes repair facilities , dormitories , administrative buildings , a firehouse , a power plant , a water distillation plant and stores .

Recorded temperatures there have fallen as low as 50 degrees below zero Celsius . Because of the tilt of the Earth and its orbit around the sun , there are two seasons in Antarctica -- summer and winter , or cold and colder . September is one of the coldest months .
