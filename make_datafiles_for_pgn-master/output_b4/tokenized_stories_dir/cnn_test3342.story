-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World No. 1 Roger Federer got his European clay season up and running at the second attempt with a routine win in his opening match at the Estoril Open in Portugal on Wednesday .

The Swiss superstar was upset by young Latvian Ernests Gulbis in Rome last month , but had no such problems against German journeyman Bjorn Phau as he triumphed 6-3 6-4 in the third-tier ATP Tour event .

The 28-year-old , returning to the tournament that he won on his debut there in 2008 , will next play another seeded player in Friday 's quarterfinals when he takes on French veteran Arnaud Clement .

`` I 'm happy that I came through the first round , it was nice to win , '' Federer told reporters . `` Today was a matter of coming through tough situations . I played well when I was down 0-40 and serving for the first set .

`` This win was not always beautiful but it does n't matter . I 'm sure my best tennis is not far away . I have a bit of a breather now and I 'm looking forward to Friday . ''

Federer has now been top of the world rankings for 281 weeks , and if he can stay there for another five he will match the all-time mark of American Pete Sampras .

But he has been surpassed by Rafael Nadal on the list of all-time Masters Series titles after the Spaniard won in Rome to match record-holder Andre Agassi on 17 .

Nadal is poised to be Federer 's biggest obstacle in his bid to retain his French Open title later this month , having ended an injury-wrecked past 12 months by winning his first two events of this season on clay .

Federer 's route to a second success in Estoril has been made easier by the withdrawal of Croatian second seed Ivan Ljubicic , who has pulled out due to the stomach strain that ended the world No. 14 's campaign in Rome .

Defending champion Albert Montanes moved into the last eight with a 6-1 6-2 victory against fellow Spaniard Daniel Gimeno-Traver .

The fourth seed will next play Uruguayan eight seed Pablo Cuevas , who overcame Spanish qualifier Marcel Granollers 7-6 -LRB- 10-8 -RRB- 7-6 -LRB- 7-2 -RRB- .

Meanwhile , top seed Marin Cilic won his opening match at the BMW Open in Munich , moving into the second round as he completed a rain-delayed 6-4 6-2 victory over Michael Berrer on Wednesday .

The Croatian will next play another German , Simon Greul , whose fourth-seeded compatriot Philipp Kohlschreiber also progressed into round two by beating Daniel Brands 6-4 6-4 .

Russian second seed Mikhail Youzhny defeated German Andreas Beck 6-3 6-3 to reach the third round , where he faces Jan Hajek of the Czech Republic .

Third seed Tomas Berdych moved into the third round , with the Czech defeating Spain 's Pere Riba 7-5 6-1 .
