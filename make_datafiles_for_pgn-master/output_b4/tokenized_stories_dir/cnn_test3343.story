-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nicaragua 's president is calling on U.S. authorities to investigate the death of a Nicaraguan diplomat as quickly as possible so his body can be returned home .

Cesar Mercado , the consul of Nicaragua in New York , was found with his throat slashed in his apartment in the Bronx last week .

`` We are asking for an investigation in the United States as soon as possible , to be able bring our fallen brother back to his birthplace ... for a Christian burial , '' President Daniel Ortega said at an event in Nicaragua 's capital Saturday .

Authorities have not said whether Mercado 's death was a homicide or a suicide .

`` The investigation is ongoing , and a final determination has not been reached , '' Paul Browne , deputy commissioner of the New York Police Department , told CNN Saturday .

Mercado also suffered 12 stab wounds in the stomach , New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Friday .

Kelly described a `` hesitation wound '' in Mercado 's neck , one that was not delivered in a single motion . That indicates the wound could have been self-inflicted , Kelly told reporters .

`` The medical examiner has not determined whether or not this was a homicide , '' he said . `` If in fact there is a wound from an assailant , it is generally more direct and in one motion . ''

Police found a 12-inch steak knife beside a blood-filled bathroom sink and a second knife -- a 4 - to 6-inch paring knife -- in the sink .

`` There is a lot of blood in the apartment , '' he said , adding that police were analyzing fingerprints found in the blood .

He said the autopsy on Mercado is complete and human hair was found in both of his hands -- 10 strands in the right hand and five in the left . It 's not yet known whose hair it was .

Police have found no evidence of forced entry or robbery . Security video cameras in the building were not working , Kelly said .

Mercado , 34 , was last seen alive Wednesday .

His body was found just inside the door of a small , sixth-floor studio apartment in the Bronx on Thursday morning by a driver who had taken him to the United Nations the day before , Kelly said .
