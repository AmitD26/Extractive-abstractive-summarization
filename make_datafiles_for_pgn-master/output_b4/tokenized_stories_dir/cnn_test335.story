-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was intended as a piece of comedy , but it 's turned into a drama .

A young American living in the United Arab Emirates has been imprisoned since April , his family says , for posting what was intended to be a funny video on the Internet .

Now , the family of Shezanne `` Shez '' Cassim wants to bring attention to his case ahead of a hearing December 16 .

The video in question is a 19-minute short that pokes fun at a clique of Dubai teens who are influenced by hip-hop culture . In the 1990s , the label `` Satwa G '' was coined for a group of suburban teens who were known to talk tougher than they really were .

The video depicts a look at a `` combat school '' in the suburb of Satwa , where these `` gangsters '' are trained . The training includes how to throw sandals at targets , using clothing accessories as whips , and how to call on the phone for backup .

`` It 's like someone in the U.S. making a parody video of a Brooklyn hipster and getting thrown in jail for it and being held in jail for months without bail , '' Cassim 's brother , Shervon Cassim , told CNN affiliate KARE . `` That 's what 's going on here . ''

Cassim 's family says Shez , 29 , has been charged with endangering national security , but they 've not been told what about the video endangered security .

UAE authorities did not respond to CNN requests for details about what charges Cassim may be facing and why .

`` It 's just a straightforward silly comedy video . And he 's being treated like some sort of dangerous criminal , high security criminal that they need to keep under maximum security conditions , '' Shervon Cassim told KARE about his brother .

Shez Cassim has lost a lot of weight , but is otherwise in good physical condition , his brother told CNN .

Cassim , from Woodbury , Minnesota , moved to Dubai in 2006 after graduating college to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers .

He and some friends made and posted the video online in 2012 . He was arrested in April 2013 .

According to the family , Cassim and eight friends have been charged under a cybercrimes law for endangering public order . This law , the family says , was n't passed until after the video had been released .

Two attempts by Cassim 's lawyers to get him released on bail have been rejected .

The U.S. State Department is providing consular services to Cassim , a department official said , and has attended all his court hearings .

`` The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General have engaged with UAE counterparts to urge a fair and expedient trial and judgment , '' the official said .

The Satwa G 's , the family said in a statement , were known as wanna-be gangsters , and that 's how Cassim portrayed them .

`` These ` gangstas ' were known for their decidedly mild behavior and were seen as the total opposite of actual criminals , '' the statement said . `` The fictional training depicted in the video teaches techniques that include the best way to throw a sandal at a newspaper -LRB- target -RRB- and , ultimately , how to use the mobile phone when in trouble . ''

At the last hearing , the judge in the case asked for an Arabic translation of the video , giving the family some hope that the authorities will realize that it was a parody .

`` I just want my son home for Christmas , '' said Cassim 's mother , Jean Cassim , in a statement . `` He 's a good young man with a great career and has never been in trouble . Now he 's being held for no reason . I 've been praying , going to mass and lighting candles , and that 's what I 'm going to keep doing . ''

An average of about 2,500 Americans are jailed abroad every year , and about a third of those arrests are related to illegal drugs , the U.S. State Department says . `` In 2010 alone , consular officers conducted more than 9,500 prison visits , and assisted more than 3,500 Americans who were arrested abroad , '' the State Department 's website says .

Advice for U.S. citizens traveling abroad

U.S. travelers in foreign countries are subject to the laws of those countries , and there 's a limit to how much help they can get from the U.S. Embassy or Consulate there .

U.S. diplomatic corps officials `` can not represent you in legal proceedings or pay your legal fees or other expenses . But they can perform many vital services such as providing a list of attorneys , assisting in contacting your family , helping your family to send money , and monitoring your health and welfare , '' the State Department says .
