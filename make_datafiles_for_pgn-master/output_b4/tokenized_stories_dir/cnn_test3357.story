-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Meet Phonchan Kraiwatnutsorn -LRB- Newey -RRB- and you quickly get the feeling , she is a no-nonsense young lady with a driving personality .

But you do n't need Thai lessons to pronounce her name , because she goes by the nickname `` Newey '' . Most Thais forsake their formal names for a single nickname .

At 30 , Newey is a Thai citizen and director of the Youth Venture program in Thailand , an initiative that is empowering young `` changemakers , '' as the parent organization Ashoka calls them , to improve the quality of life in their communities .

Ashoka is a global , not-for-profit organization working to promote social change . What they do and how they do it will be the subject of Newey 's blogs , because it is very different from anything you 've ever seen . We 'll link you to Ashoka 's Web site as well .

Newey has quite a track record of working in this field , having co-founded YIY , a youth group that creates opportunities for young people to grow into engaged citizens and social entrepreneurs .

Her day-to-day role as Youth Venture director takes her to all parts of Thailand to meet , encourage and support 14-24 year-olds -- be they middle class , underprivileged , marginalized , or delinquent .

The challenge is to develop an idea that benefits their community . Youth Venture provides them with the necessary tools and resources in addition to linking them with mentors , ultimately allowing them to develop and implement projects that are far more broad and sustaining than they could achieve on their own .

By helping the programs get off the ground , dealing with the obstacles , learning from mistakes , she and her Youth Venture teams are really making a difference in people 's lives . Newey 's going to show you how they are doing this .

As for Newey , she 's a deep individual and an artist at heart . She doggedly pursued her desire to learn the art of bookmaking a few years back , something that requires severe patience , all the way to the U.S. . She paid for the trip with her own savings .

`` Reading and writing is a way to peace and a channel to express myself , '' Newey says of her true love .

Over the course of the next year , Newey will show you her work in the teeming city of Bangkok , but also take you to the rural countryside , where conditions can be even more challenging . E-mail to a friend
