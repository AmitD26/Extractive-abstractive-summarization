-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Indiana judge Monday froze the assets of Marcus Schrenker , a suburban Indianapolis financial manager who authorities say tried to fake his own death by crashing his private plane into a Florida swamp .

Marcus Schrenker exited his small plane before it crashed , and investigators are looking for him , police say .

Investigators looking into his business dealings for possible securities violations requested the temporary restraining order in Hamilton County Superior Court , said Jim Gavin , spokesman for the Indiana Secretary of State .

He said the order , which also applies to Schrenker 's wife , Michelle , and to his three companies , is aimed at protecting investors , and is related to a receivership filing . He did n't elaborate .

Heritage Wealth Management , Heritage Insurance Services and Icon Wealth Management are `` the subjects of an active investigation by the Indiana Securities Division , '' Gavin said . Public documents list Schrenker as president of Heritage Wealth Management in Fishers , Indiana .

A search warrant related to the inquiry was served December 31 , Gavin said .

According to The Herald Bulletin in Anderson , Indiana , Michelle Schrenker filed for divorce in Hamilton Superior Court on December 30 . A hearing was set for February 5 .

Schrenker , 38 , took off alone Sunday night in a corporate plane , a Piper PA-46 , from Anderson , Indiana , en route to Destin , Florida . Authorities said the Fisher , Indiana , businessman parachuted to the ground before letting the plane crash in the Florida panhandle .

The craft came down near the Blackwater River , only 50 to 75 yards from homes , said Sgt. Scott Haines of the Santa Rosa County Sheriff 's Office . Watch more about the mysterious flight ''

`` It is a neighborhood -- some very nice waterfront property , '' he said .

Military aircraft from Whiting Field , which were dispatched to intercept the plane after Schrenker reported an emergency , witnessed the crash about 9:15 p.m. CT. . The crews fired flares and noticed the plane 's door was open and the cockpit was dark , Haines said in a news release . They got no response .

Haines said the plane appeared to have been put on autopilot at around 2,000 feet , over the Birmingham , Alabama , area , before the pilot parachuted to the ground . Schrenker had contacted air traffic controllers , saying that the windshield imploded .

`` The pilot stated that he was bleeding profusely , '' the news release said . `` Radio contact with the plane was not able to be established after that point . When deputies located the plane at the crash site , no blood was present and the door to the plane was open . ''

The Childersburg , Alabama , Police Department reported that Schrenker approached one of its officers shortly before 2:30 a.m. , `` and said that he had been in a canoeing accident with some friends , '' a news release said . Childersburg is about 35 miles southeast of Birmingham .

Childersburg officers , unaware of the plane crash , took Schrenker to a hotel in nearby Harpersville . After hearing about the crash , they went back to the hotel , where they found that Schrenker had checked into the hotel under a fictitious name .

`` When authorities entered Schrenker 's room , he was not there , '' the release said .

Authorities said Schrenker checked in under a fake name , put on a black cap and fled into a wooded area .

Hotel manager Yogi Patel , who identified Schrenker on surveillance video , told CNN that Schrenker was the only guest overnight . He signed in as Jason Galouzs of Bolingbrook , Illinois , Patel said .

Steve Darlington , manager of Anderson Municipal Airport , told CNN the plane was in fine condition at takeoff , and said Schrenker is `` an accomplished pilot '' who owns `` a couple of airplanes '' and flies regularly .

No agency has come forward to lead the probe .

`` The FBI is looking into the matter , along with other agencies , '' said Paul Draymond , of the Birmingham FBI office .

Kathleen Bergen , spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration , said several factors indicated the pilot likely left the plane before the crash : a `` detailed review of radar data , '' the fact that the plane was switched to autopilot before it crashed , the sighting by military jet crews and the fact that the cockpit was found mostly intact with no one inside .

After the pilot alerted air traffic controllers about the alleged problems with his plane , authorities tried to persuade him to land in Pell City , Alabama , east of Birmingham , Haines said .

Schrenker also flew an acrobatic plane , and made a video featured on a YouTube site . A message preceding the video warns , `` No pilot should attempt this stunt . You will get yourself killed . Pilot specially trained to fly unlimited acrobatics and shows . ''
