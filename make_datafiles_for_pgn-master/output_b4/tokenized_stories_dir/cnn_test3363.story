-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lie-detector tests could be used in a bid to stamp out corruption in cricket , an advisory committee of the sport 's rule-making body announced on Wednesday .

Cricket was shrouded in controversy earlier this year when three members of the Pakistan team became the subject of match-fixing allegations during a tour of England .

Following a police investigation , captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Aamer and Mohammad Asif -- who all protested their innocence -- will face a disciplinary hearing by the International Cricket Council in January .

But after a meeting of the MCC World Cricket Committee in Perth on Tuesday and Wednesday , officials admitted that the latest corruption scandal has had a negative impact on the sport .

`` We are concerned at the scale of the problem , and the detrimental effect it has placed on the integrity of the game , '' a statement on the MCC 's official website read .

`` The committee feels more resources -- and increased powers -- are required to attempt to eradicate this issue from the game . The education of players should not be a meaningless formality ; the message should be pressed home with regularity by figures known and respected by the players . ''

As well as the possible introduction of lie-detector tests , other suggestions included the legalizing and regulating of betting markets in India , the inclusion of anti-corruption clauses in playing contracts and the non-inclusion of `` tainted '' players .

The committee , comprised of past and present cricketers and officials , also said that captains should take more responsibility for their players .

Its recommendations will be considered by the MCC Laws sub-committee in February .

However , the proposal to use lie-detectors to determine whether or not players are competing for the right reasons has already been questioned .

`` I do n't know about the accuracy of lie-detector tests , '' England captain Andrew Strauss told the UK Press Association on Wednesday on the eve of his side 's third Ashes Test against Australia in Perth .

`` But what I do know , and is probably more important , is that we do n't want the whiff of anything suspicious going on in the game . ''

Strauss ' team also came under the spotlight when Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt made accusations -- which he later withdrew -- that some England players had themselves accepted money to fix match results .

The ongoing scandal took a further turn when Pakistani wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider fled to Britain during a series with South Africa in Abu Dhabi , claiming he had refused to fix a match .

`` We 've seen how disruptive and detrimental to the game of cricket it is . If we have to take extreme measures in order to be 100 % confident the game is being played in the right spirit , then I 'd certainly be happy to do that , '' Strauss said .

`` I 'd have to think about the arguments -LRB- for lie-detector tests -RRB- first . But the principle , of having 22 guys on the pitch that the supporters are absolutely 100 % certain are playing the game for the right reasons , is a good thing . ''
