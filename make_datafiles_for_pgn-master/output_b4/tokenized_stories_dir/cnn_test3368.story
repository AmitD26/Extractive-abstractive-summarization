Bangkok -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Border skirmishes between Thailand and Cambodia over a temple have grown quiet , a Thai military official said Wednesday .

`` There has been no gun firing for two days now , the last firing was on Monday , '' said Col. Shingark Rattanakitti . `` The situation in general here is calm , but we are all on high alert . ''

The development came as the chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations pushed for talks between the two nations to end the deadly clashes .

The issue `` can only be addressed bilaterally , '' Marty M. Natalegawa , who is also the Indonesian foreign minister , said Tuesday . He added that he has the impression , after visiting Phnom Penh and Bangkok , that there is an overwhelming commitment on both sides to `` address their issues through peaceful means , through dialogues and negotiations . ''

The United Nations Security Council will hold a meeting on Monday to discuss the tensions between Thailand and Cambodia . Diplomats from both countries will be given a chance to address the council . The meeting comes after a request from Cambodia for the council to hold an emergency session .

The border skirmishes , which started Friday , have killed five people , including members of the military and civilians , a statement from ASEAN said , adding that each nation accuses the other of firing first .

Thailand 's official news agency , MCOT , reported Tuesday , `` Since the fighting erupted Friday , one Thai soldier was killed , 25 were wounded and one civilian died in the clashes . ''

The report added that Cambodia on Tuesday `` handed over a Thai soldier captured during the cross border clash . ''

Cambodia 's official news agency , AKP , reported Tuesday that `` Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen has sought the United Nations ' intervention in arranging a buffer zone '' at the border area and wants to make sure the fighting does not expand to other parts of the border .

The U.N. Security Council on Monday expressed `` grave concern at aggravation of tensions between Cambodia and Thailand '' and said it was willing to hold an emergency meeting requested by Cambodia , but first wanted to wait for regional mediation efforts by the Indonesian foreign minister .

An official Thai report said the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday , but skirmishes continued afterward .

The clashes stem from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple . The building sits on a cliff in Cambodian territory , but the most accessible entrance to the site is on the Thai side .

In a letter to the United Nations over the weekend , Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said that in addition to the human toll the fighting was taking , the temple had suffered damage .

Conflict over the Preah Vihear site has taken place periodically for years . In 1962 , the International Court of Justice in The Hague , Netherlands , ruled that the site was in Cambodia , adding that the structure was `` an outstanding masterpiece of Khmer architecture . ''

But Thailand says the 1.8-square mile -LRB- 4.7-square kilometer -RRB- area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated , and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th century during the French occupation of Cambodia .

In July 2008 , the United Nations approved Cambodia 's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site , meaning the U.N. believes the place has outstanding universal value .
