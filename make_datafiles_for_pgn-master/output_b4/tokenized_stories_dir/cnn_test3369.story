-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hosts Sri Lanka are through to their second successive Cricket World Cup final after beating New Zealand by five wickets in Colombo on Tuesday .

The Black Caps struggled throughout their innings , failing to use their allocated 50 overs before eventually being skittled out for just 217 in 48.5 overs .

And although Sri Lanka wobbled in their reply , Thilan Samaraweera -LRB- 23 not out -RRB- and Angelo Mathews -LRB- 14 not out -RRB- saw them home with a crucial 35-run stand as the home side made 220-5 off 47.5 overs -- inflicting a sixth semifinal defeat on New Zealand .

As well as the significance of a World Cup semifinal , the match also marked the last apperance on home soil for legendary Sri Lankan spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan .

The 38-year-old , who is the most successful Test and one-day bowler in cricket history , went out in style , taking his 534th one-day wicket off his very last ball .

Muralitharan had New Zealand top scorer Scott Styris -LRB- 57 -RRB- lbw to send the 38,000-crowd at the R. Premadasa stadium into wild scenes of celebration .

It was one of Muralitharan 's two wickets , with Ajantha Mendis -LRB- 3-35 -RRB- and Lasith Malinga -LRB- 3-55 -RRB- also successful as New Zealand rarely threatened to post a score big enough to defend .

In reply , Tillakaratne Dilshan -LRB- 73 -RRB- and skipper Kumar Sangakkara -LRB- 54 -RRB- helped Sri Lanka reach 160-1 to appear in total control .

However , the loss of four wickets for just 25 runs threatened to derail Sri Lankan hopes before Samaraweera and Mathews steered them to their victory target .

The victory moves 1996 champions Sri Lanka into their third final and , after finishing runners-up to Australia in 2007 , they will be looking to make amends when they face either India or Pakistan in Saturday 's final in Mumbai .

Those two rivals face each other in Mohali on Wednesday in one of the most eagerly anticipated matches in recent history .
