Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For hours on March 21 , U.S. Air Force Maj. Kenneth Harney of Lexington , Kentucky , and Capt. Tyler Stark of Littleton , Colorado , were the focus of nearly every U.S. service member in the Mediterranean Sea region . Nearly a dozen aircraft , a platoon of Marines and even Libyan civilians worked to rescue Harney and Stark after their F-15 crashed in eastern Libya .

Most details about the mission , including their names , were a closely held secret by the military . But earlier this month , with little notice , their identities and details of their rescue came out during a welcome-home ceremony at their air base . For the first time , the men spoke publicly to a small group of friends , family and Air Force personnel .

The Air Force public affairs office posted pictures and video of the event on its official website , even after U.S. military public affairs officers involved in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya told CNN their names would never be made public .

`` You feel the weight of not only the Air Force , but the entire military , focusing on you , making sure you get home , '' Stark said recently in a video prepared by the Air Force .

U.S. still not ready to recognize Libyan opposition

The men were part of a the 48th Fighter Wing normally based at RAF Lakenheath , a Royal Air Force base that has hosted U.S. Air Force units for years in Suffolk , England . But on March 21 they took off from the U.S. air base in Aviano , Italy , in support of the no-fly zone enforcement over Libya .

At some point they ran into trouble .

`` We soon find ourselves in a situation where we are forced to eject over potentially hostile territory , and over the country of Libya . Something that neither one of us would ever have thought that we 'd have to do , '' Harney , the pilot of the Strike Eagle said .

The Air Force is still trying to figure out why the plane crashed and a post-incident investigation is ongoing , but four days after the crash , Vice Adm. Bill Gortney , director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon , told reporters that the military was `` confident that it is not a result of hostile fire . ''

Homes destroyed in battle for Misrata

After the ejection , Harney -- `` Meso '' to his fellow fliers -- and `` Mask '' Stark became separated . `` When you find yourself alone , and you 're isolated , in a country where there 's hostiles , you are scared , '' said Harney , a veteran of both the Afghan and Iraq wars .

Stark was found by Libyan civilians who protected him from possible retaliation by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , and eventually he was taken safely back to Europe . Details of how he was taken out of Libya have yet to be disclosed .

Harney 's rescue came more quickly . He stayed in communications with another F-15 pilot still in the air over Libya . Eventually an MV-22 Osprey carrying Marines who were part of a Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel , or TRAP , team landed near his position .

`` As that back door opened , I see a group of young Marine recon units jump out , and that was probably the best feeling I 've ever felt in my entire life , '' Harney said . He was flown to the USS Kearsarge for a quick medical check then a short time later sent home with Stark to RAF Lakenheath , where friends and family welcomed them with hugs and a rendition of `` God Bless America .
