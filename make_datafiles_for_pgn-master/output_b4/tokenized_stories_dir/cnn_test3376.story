Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Los Angeles survived what officials warned could have been a traffic nightmare this weekend when a section of one of the nation 's busiest freeways , closed for construction , was reopened ahead of schedule Sunday .

`` Carmadegeddon , shmarmageddon , '' said Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky , as he and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced at midday Sunday that Interstate 405 would reopen 17 hours before Monday 's morning rush hour begins .

Despite Los Angeles ' reputation as `` the car capital of the United States of America , the congestion capital , the city most addicted to the single-passenger automobile , '' motorists found alternatives to driving for the weekend , Mayor Villaraigosa said .

A 10-mile segment of the freeway was closed Friday night to allow crews to demolish a section of bridge to make way for a car pool lane . Workers completed the demolition faster than expected , Mayor Villaraigosa said Sunday morning .

`` The fact that we were able to do it sooner meant that things went very , very smoothly , '' Villaraigosa said Sunday . `` Had they not , we might have had this press conference on Monday afternoon . ''

Barriers that had detoured northbound and southbound traffic away from the 405 since late Friday were removed at noon Sunday , with the opening of interchanges and ramps to follow .

The real story may be how Los Angeles residents reacted to dire warnings to keep their cars parked or else get struck in predicted gridlock that Yaroslavsky had dubbed Carmadegeddon .

The number of cars driving on Los Angeles roads dropped a dramatic two-thirds Saturday , Yaroslavsky said .

`` I propose a yearly carmageddon holiday ! What a lovely chill summer day in Santa Monica , '' resident Novena Carmel said in a Twitter posting Saturday afternoon .

Yaroslavsky and Villaraigosa both agreed Sunday , sounding as if they were only half-joking .

`` I like the idea of us taking a time out once a year , '' Villaraigosa said . `` I think everybody has realized that we can get out of our car once in a while and survive . ''

The mayor said he was pleased with reports of `` people going to their neighborhood restaurants , going to a coffee shops , talking with neighbors , having family dinners or barbecues that they might not otherwise have done in the rat race that we live in . ''

In fact , the city will do it again in 11 months when the second half of the Mulholland bridge is demolished to complete the expansion project .

While fear of gridlock motivated the change in habits this time , Yaroslavsky suggested Los Angeles residents may have learned an unexpected lesson .

`` I think a lot of people in Los Angeles have learned that you can get along without taking long rides in your cars on weekends these past couple of days , '' he said . `` There 's a feeling in Los Angeles that if you do n't get in your car on a weekend that you 're somehow being cheated of something . ''

Demolition of a section of the southern half of the Mulholland bridge , necessary to make room for a northbound car pool lane , was expected to keep the freeway closed for 53 hours , ending at 5 a.m. Monday , the start of the morning rush hour .

Crews closed ramps late Friday on the 405 , where it passes over the Santa Monica Mountains , California Department of Transportation officials said .

The $ 1.2 billion construction project calls for replacing a portion of a bridge at Mulholland Drive , a mountain summit road that is featured in many Hollywood films , authorities said . A year from now , crews will have to shut down the 405 again to replace a final portion of the Mulholland Drive bridge , officials said .

The project also calls for adding a car-pool lane in each direction , creating `` the largest HOV system in the world '' at 48.6 miles in length between the San Fernando Valley and Orange County , said Mike Miles , the California Department of Transportation 's director for Los Angeles and Ventura counties .

The two-year project will replace two more bridges , also to accommodate the widening of the 405 , and will improve about two dozen on-off ramps and add 18 miles of sound-deadening walls for nearby residents , Miles said .

The 405 is usually one of the busiest freeways in the country , carrying about 500,000 cars a day through the Sepulveda Pass , a critical artery connecting Californians along the coast . The 405 achieved notoriety on national television as the corridor that former NFL player O.J. Simpson used as he was being slowly chased by police in 1994 .

The highway also cuts through the west side of Los Angeles , an area that includes the high-status communities of Bel Air , Brentwood , Beverly Hills and Santa Monica .
