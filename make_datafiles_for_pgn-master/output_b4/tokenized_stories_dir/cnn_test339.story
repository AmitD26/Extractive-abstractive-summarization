-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An education department in one Malaysian state is sending effeminate boys to a boot camp to change their behavior , a move that 's drawn fire from educators and activists .

The Terengganu state Education Department picked 66 boys for the camp this month , part of a program to help boys deal with identity crises , media in the Asian nation reported .

The camp offers physical training and other activities and is designed to prevent the boys from developing feminine traits , The Star newspaper reported , quoting Razali Daud , the education department 's director .

`` The boys involved were selected from most schools in the state , '' Daud is quoted as saying . `` They were carefully vetted before a final selection was made . ''

Daud said there could be big problems for such boys if their behavior was not addressed . He cited a couple of factors contributing to the issue -- parents dressing boys in girl 's clothing `` as they had really wanted a girl '' or boys `` surrounded by female siblings . ''

The move smacks of homophobia to many .

Donna Guest , deputy director of the Asia-Pacific program at Amnesty International , deplored the action , which `` feeds into gender stereotyping and homophobia . ''

Malaysia is a state party to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women , and an article in that convention calls on countries to ensure that gender stereotyping does not occur , she said .

`` Starting a re-education camp or boot camp is directly counter to that . It goes to encouraging discrimination against all people because of their sexual orientation . ''

Guest also noted that homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia .

`` Amnesty would oppose that and urges the government to repeal those provisions in the law , '' she said , adding that `` anyone who is arrested merely for being gay we would consider as prisoners of conscience , they should be released immediately non-conditionally . ''

Malaysia 's Women , Family and Community Development Minister Datuk Seri Sharizat Abdul Jalil said the ministry views the move with `` alarm and great concern '' and said such boot camps should be abolished .

`` The experience of being singled out on the basis of perceived characteristics is an extremely traumatizing experience , in particular for adolescent teens . Such profiling has potentially serious psychological repercussions and could harm the development and mental health of the children , as it exposes them to prejudices among their peers and members of their family and community , '' she said .

She said the camps violate the Child Act 2001 , which says `` every child is entitled to protection and assistance in all circumstances without regard to distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , social origin or physical , mental or emotional disabilities or any other status . ''

The Joint Action Group for Gender Equality , a coalition of Malaysian organizations , said it was appalled at the move , noting that `` identifying and singling out boys who behave effeminately is highly discriminatory bordering on predatory . ''

It said the department is undermining the role of education -- nurturing `` the personality and talents of the child '' and inculcating `` respect for human rights in preparation for responsible adulthood . '' And it said fashioning a criterion for so-called normal behavior `` is highly questionable . ''

`` The boys in this case have been denied and persecuted for the expression of their personalities and identities . Ideally , school is supposed to provide a safe and neutral space for children to develop without fear of recrimination for being themselves , '' the group said .

It added that the children in question were n't -- but should have been -- consulted .

`` Corrective boot camps to ` fix ' children and individuals must not be condoned because it violates the rights of people who are perceived as ` different . ' It should be strongly opposed and challenged as it promotes homophobia and prejudice . We should send a clear message to institutions that they have no business meddling with an individual 's identity and personal preference , '' the group said .

Ellen Kahn , director of the Human Rights Campaign 's Foundation Family Project and a professional social worker , said it is `` heartbreaking that young men are being forced into ` masculinity camps ' simply because some adults do n't think they are masculine enough . '' The group is an advocate for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights .

`` It is irresponsible for adults -- particularly parents -- to shame and punish their children for who they are . These attempts to change children only cause emotional harm and distress . We should heed the advice of The American Psychological Association , and the American Academy of Pediatrics , among other experts , and provide love , support and affirmation to our children regardless of their gender expression or sexual orientation .
