HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe published a draft constitutional amendment in the government gazette Saturday , paving the way for the power-sharing agreement reached after violence disrupted this year 's presidential election .

President Robert Mugabe , left , and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai signed the deal in July .

Constitutional Amendment 19 details the posts and institutions that were created by the power-sharing deal , including the position of prime minister intended for Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the Movement for Democratic Change .

The publication of the draft is the first step in creating a law in Zimbabwe . For the law to pass , it must be appear before parliament in 30 days , according to the country 's constitution . If it is approved , it will be sent to Mugabe for his signature .

The deal arose after Tsvangirai withdrew from a June 27 runoff days before the vote , saying Mugabe 's supporters had waged a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters .

The two leaders signed the initial agreement , brokered by former South African President Thabo Mbeki , in July but have failed to agree on how to form a cabinet .

The MDC , the main opposition party , noted that Mugabe 's latest move does not legalize the amendment .

`` Gazetting the bill -- which was done by -LSB- Mugabe 's party -RSB- Zanu-PF -- does not automatically translate into passing it into law , '' MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said . `` That can only take place if outstanding issues have been addressed . Otherwise we will not support the bill . ''

The two parties agreed last month to the draft amendment during talks in South Africa , but Chamisa warned then that problems remained .

`` We have differed with Zanu-PF for a long time while the citizens suffer , but fortunately we have agreed on something . I need to hasten to mention that we still have some outstanding issues , such as the cabinet , appointment of diplomats , '' he said in late November .

Zanu-PF lost its majority in the parliament in the March elections . As no party has the two-thirds majority to pass the law , its passage relies on MDC support .

If parliament does not approve the amendment , Mugabe may call for new elections , Zimbabwe Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa told state-run daily newspaper The Herald .

`` I envisage that it will require two weeks for it to be debated and passed through both Houses . If no support is forthcoming , it means that Amendment Number 19 Bill will be dead matter , '' Chinamasa is quoted as saying The Herald .

`` In the event that the collaboration that we envisage is not forthcoming , then that will necessitate fresh harmonized elections at some point in time , '' he said , according to The Herald .

Tsvangirai won the most votes in the March election , but not enough to avoid a runoff , according to the government 's official count .

South African President Kgalema Motlanthe , chairman of the Southern African Development Community , welcomed the draft .

`` The gazetting of Amendment 19 of the Zimbabwean Constitution is indeed a major step towards the formation of an inclusive government in Zimbabwe , '' he said in a written statement . `` We urge the Zimbabwean political parties to establish an inclusive government . ''

Meanwhile , the country is battling a cholera outbreak that has killed nearly 800 people since August , according to the World Health Organization . More than 16,000 people have been infected , WHO said .

This week , Mugabe declared that `` there is no cholera in the country . '' His spokesman later said Mugabe was sarcastically ridiculing what he believes are Western designs to invade the country .

Another Zimbabwean official , Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu , said Friday that the disease was a `` calculated , racist attack on Zimbabwe by the unrepentant former colonial power , which has enlisted support from its American and Western allies so that they can invade the country . ''

Britain ruled the country as a colony until 1965 .

Ndlovu 's claims triggered quick and pointed reaction from Britain and the United States .

In Washington , State Department spokesman Rob McInturff called Ndlovu 's accusations `` patently ridiculous . ''
