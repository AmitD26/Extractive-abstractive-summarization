Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Jackson 's mother says she 's hoping Dr. Conrad Murray will get the harshest sentence possible , four years in a state prison , in the death of her son .

`` I do n't believe that he intended for Michael to die , '' Katherine Jackson told CNN Monday . `` He was just taking a chance . ''

A jury found Murray guilty of involuntary manslaughter three weeks ago , and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor set Tuesday for his sentencing .

Pastor , who sent Murray directly to jail after he was convicted this month , has a choice ranging between probation and up to four years in a state prison . But measures to relieve California prison and jail crowding could significantly shorten his time locked up .

Prosecutors successfully argued that Murray 's reckless use of the surgical anesthetic propofol to help Jackson sleep , without proper monitoring equipment , led to the pop icon 's death .

Testimony during his trial revealed that Murray gave propofol nearly every night in the two months before the singer 's death on June 25 , 2009 , as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts set for London the next month .

Katherine Jackson and several of her children will be in court for the sentencing Tuesday , but her grandchildren Prince , Paris and Blanket will not . They 'll be at school , she said .

She was uncertain whether anyone from the family would speak in court , but she was interviewed by a probation officer who will include her thoughts in the report to the judge , Jackson said .

Murray 's elderly mother , Milta Rush , wrote a letter to the judge asking for mercy , saying `` his compassion and his soft heartedness for others led to this dilemma . ''

Prosecutors are asking for the maximum four years behind bars , and they want Murray to pay Jackson 's children more than $ 100 million in restitution . Defense lawyers want probation , not prison time .

Each side will have a chance to present oral arguments Tuesday , but their positions were detailed in sentencing memos filed with the judge last week .

Murray has `` displayed a complete lack of remorse '' about Jackson 's death , and is , `` even worse , failing to accept even the slightest level of responsibility , '' deputy district attorneys David Walgren and Deborah Brazil wrote .

The prosecutors cited Murray 's decision not to testify in his own defense , even while he was giving interviews for a documentary that aired days after the verdict .

`` In each of these interviews , the defendant has very clearly stated that he bears no responsibility for Michael Jackson 's death , '' the prosecutors said . `` Moreover , the defendant has continued to express concern only for his individual plight and portrays himself , not the decedent , as the victim . ''

`` I do n't feel guilty because I did not do anything wrong , '' Murray said in the documentary quoted by the prosecution .

`` Finally , the defendant consistently blames the victim for his own death , even going so far as to characterize himself as being ` entrapped ' by the victim and as someone who suffered a ` betrayal ' at the hands of the victim , '' the prosecutors said .

Jackson 's death came as he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts in London , which the defense argued pressured the singer to seek sleep or risk having the concerts canceled .

The prosecutors contend in their sentencing memo that Murray should be ordered to pay Jackson 's three children restitution for the subsequent `` wage and profits lost , '' as provided under California 's `` victim 's bill of rights '' law .

The singer 's `` estate estimates Michael Jackson 's projected earnings for the 50-show O2 concert series to be $ 100,000,000 , '' the prosecutors said .

With nearly $ 2 million in funeral expenses and 10 % interest added each year , the prosecution is asking Pastor to order Murray to pay Prince , Paris and Blanket Jackson more than $ 120 million in restitution .

While it is doubtful that Murray , who is unlikely to ever practice medicine again , could pay much of that sum , it could prevent him from reaping financial benefits from any books , interviews or film projects in the future .

Defense lawyers , in their sentencing memo , said Murray is suffering `` manifold collateral consequences '' because of the felony conviction .

The memo included a biography of Murray that described him as `` a self-made man of humble origins , '' who paid his own way through medical school without scholarships or family funds .

`` He was raised in a home that lacked indoor plumbing or electricity , and he walked to school barefoot for his first couple years of school , '' the defense said .

He worked as a doctor for 20 years , with `` no prior contacts with the law , '' and many of his patients were elderly in low-income , underserved communities , the defense said .

`` It seems reasonable that the transgression for which he is to be judged should be viewed within the context of the larger life of which it is a part , '' it said .

The defense challenges the prosecution 's contention that Murray is not remorseful .

`` Dr. Murray wishes to make it unmistakenly clear to everyone that he deeply mourns the loss of Michael Jackson 's life , and he profoundly regrets any mistakes or oversights on his part that may have contributed to it , '' the defense said .

The judge should also consider `` the manifold collateral consequences that Dr. Murray has sustained as a result of his mistake , '' the defense said , including the loss of his medical career , the public disgrace and loss of privacy .

`` Dr. Murray has been described as a changed , grief-stricken man , who walks around under a pall of sadness since the loss of his patient , Mr. Jackson , '' the defense said .

The defense memo included a letter from Murray 's elderly mother , Milta Rush . She sat in court for much of her son 's trial , just a few feet away from Jackson 's mother .

`` I sympathize with Mrs. Jackson as a mother , '' Rush wrote in a letter to the judge . `` I sense she was very close to her son . I really wanted to approach her personally and tell her I am sorry for the loss of her son , but I was unsure if she would be receptive , and I did not want to take the chance of violating court rules . I am sorry for all her loss . ''

While Murray 's mother told the judge her son is `` saddened and remorseful '' about Jackson 's death , she said `` his compassion and his soft heartedness for others led to this dilemma . ''

The defense contends that Murray was trying to help Jackson , who was desperate for sleep so he could be ready for rehearsals . `` His compassionate intentions should not be overlooked , '' it said .

`` The victim was a willing recipient of the medications administered , '' the defense said . `` In fact , Mr. Jackson had repeatedly begged Dr. Murray for propofol to overcome his insomnia so that he could sleep . ''

Murray does not pose a safety threat to the public , it said . `` The likelihood of recurrence is essentially nonexistent since Conrad Murray 's medical license has been suspended . ''

Aside from the arguments of what Murray deserves , the defense contends that California 's prison and jail crowding mean that `` neither the space nor the public funds exist to continue imprisoning nonviolent , nondangerous offenders who do not need to be incapacitated for the sake of public safety . ''

`` Dr. Murray is clearly such a defendant , '' the defense said . `` He is an individual who remained free on bond for more than two years prior to the jury verdict , adhering assiduously to all of the bond conditions that had been imposed . ''

If Murray takes up a state prison or county jail cell , it `` may mean that someone else with higher potential for violence will be released , '' the defense said .

Instead , the defense proposed that Murray could be sentenced to community service along with probation .

`` Though he will perhaps not again be a doctor qualified to make diagnoses , he could educate and counsel patients about heart care and disease prevention , '' it said . `` There are many nonprofit clinics and organizations that would benefit from his participation , if ordered to perform community service as a condition of his sentence and a means of ` putting some water back into the public well .
