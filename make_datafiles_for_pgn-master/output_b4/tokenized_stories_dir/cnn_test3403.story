-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least 40 people were killed and numerous others injured in a reported grenade attack at a casino in Monterrey , Mexico , the capital of Nuevo Leon , according to attorney general in that northern state .

The incident occurred around 4 p.m. local time -LRB- 5 p.m. ET -RRB- at the Casino Royale when two people aboard a vehicle arrived , and one threw three grenades into the building .

There were conflicting unconfirmed reports from local media that the assailants poured gasoline on the building before setting it on fire .

Between 20 and 30 people were trapped in the casino because of debris from the explosions , said Cmdr. Angel Flores with the Green Cross .

Video from the scene showed a burned-out building as firefighters made rescue attempts to break the wall of the facade of the casino to release the smoke inside the building .

Mexican President Felipe Calderon sent the following statement from his official Twitter account -LRB- translated from Spanish -RRB- : `` With deep consternation , I express my solidarity with Nuevo Leon and the victims of this abhorrent act of terror and barbarism . ''

He added more : `` These reprehensible acts require us all to persevere in the fight against gangs of unscrupulous criminals . All the support to NL -LRB- Nuevo Leon -RRB- . ''

About five families were outside the casino waiting for information from authorities , local journalist Javier Estrada reported .

Gustavo Madrazo was one of those waiting outside the casino . He said his wife , Martha , and her sister , Miriam Gonzalez , were inside .

Authorities have not identified any of the victims .

So far , no representative for the company that manages the casino had arrived outside . The Mexican Army and state and municipal police forces were also on the scene .

Alejandro Poire , Mexico 's top national security spokesman , said the federal government has made contact with local officials and that Calderon has spoken to the governor of Nuevo Leon to offer support .

Poire said those who carried out the attacks will be held responsible . `` They will pay for their crimes . ... We will do absolutely everything ... to restore tranquility . ''

The National Commission on Human Rights in Mexico sent a news release saying it has opened an investigation regarding the response to the events at the casino .

`` The priority is to help safeguard the human rights enshrined in the Constitution of the United Mexican States and international treaties . The commission again makes clear that the insecurity in the country requires public officials responsible for implementing and enforcing the law , carry out preventive actions to protect society and away from any violence . ''

`` The National Commission will monitor the actions taken by the competent authorities to respond adequately to the aggrieved persons . ''

The NHRC says it has also sent personnel to the scene including physicians , psychologists and lawyers to work jointly with authorities .

Nuevo Leon , in northeastern Mexico , has seen several grenade attacks so far this year . On August 13 , four civilians were wounded when an armed group fired two grenades at a jail in the municipality of Apodaca .

In July , gunmen entered a downtown bar in Monterrey and shot 20 people dead . A public safety spokesman told CNN the attack was likely sparked by a dispute between organized crime groups for control of the El Sabino Gordo nightclub , where drugs were allegedly sold .

Nuevo Leon and the neighboring states of Coahuila and Tamaulipas have been the scene of a series of clashes between organized crime groups . The Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas are vying for control of trafficking routes into the United States .

In November 2010 , the federal government launched the Coordinated Operation Northeast , which involves sending more security forces to the area to tackle crime .
