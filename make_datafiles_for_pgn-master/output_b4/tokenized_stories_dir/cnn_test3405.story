New Delhi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In India , milk is used in holy ceremonies , it is offered to the gods , poured over deities and generally considered the healthiest of drinks .

But a first-of-its-kind government survey reveals that a stunning 68.4 % of milk sold in India does not meet basic government standards .

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India tested milk across the country . It took 1,791 samples -- and of of those , 1,226 were found to be `` non-conforming . ''

In seven Indian states , 100 % of the samples failed to meet standards .

Some samples contained water and milk powders ; others included potentially toxic ingredients .

`` We found about 14 % of the samples which found traces of detergent , '' said V.N. Gaur , the chief executive officer of the food safety authority .

In lesser percentages , the tests also found hydrogen peroxide and urea -- a substance found in fertilizer and urine .

`` There is a problem and they need to face it head-on and they have to kind of really take some strict action against those people who are violating simple consumer rights of getting a clean glass of milk , '' said Savvy Soumya Misra , the food safety and toxins deputy program manager with the Center for Science and Environment .

Doctors say ingested over long periods of time , chemicals like detergent can eat away the lining of intestines , stomach and affect the liver and the kidneys .

Just adding water to the milk can pose a real danger in India where waterborne illnesses are commonplace .

`` What you get is diarrhea . Vomiting . What we call gastroenteritis , '' said Dr. Suranjit Chatterjee , a senior consultant for internal medicine at Delhi 's Apollo hospital said . `` You can get something like cholera . You can have jaundice . There are infections like typhoid fever , which are all part of water-borne infections in this part of the world . ''

At a dairy on the outskirts of India 's capital , a worker dilution is widely practiced -- but that his plant does not participate .

`` A lot of people do it . They add water and take the milk and sell it , '' Ram Prasad said . `` They add water because it increases the quantity of milk and there is more to sell . ''

The milk industry in India is a chaotic mix of producers and sellers .

Milk comes to the market in many different ways . It can be carried in on the heads of farmers in pails , put in containers which are strapped to a train or a bicycle , or delivered in a massive milk truck .

In many places , including the capital , fresh milk is still delivered to homes .

The sources also vary : from a family with three cows , to farms with more than 30 cows and buffaloes , to huge dairy plants .

Government authorities say 70 % of the milk on the market comes from small to medium farms that operate in , what is known , as the `` unorganized sector . ''

In the government test , less than a third of the milk samples came from large producers .

While India has strict regulations in place to ensure milk safety , consumer advocates say enforcement is so lax it 's laughable .

`` Well it does reflect that there is a need to strengthen our implementation machinery , Gaur said . `` That need is definitely underlined by this study . ''

But , he said , his office has been granted new powers recently and it plans on more surveys . He expects there will be better enforcement in the coming weeks , months and years .

Food safety watchdog groups say milk dilution has been around for decades .

They hope the milk survey will mean good news for consumers because -- for the first time -- the government itself has revealed the true scope of the problem and pledged to do something about it .
