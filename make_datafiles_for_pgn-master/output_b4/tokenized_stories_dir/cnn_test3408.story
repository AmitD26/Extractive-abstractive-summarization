-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Japanese protesters took to the streets Saturday to demand safer energy as the nation marked the three-month anniversary of an earthquake and tsunami that sparked the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years .

The massive quake on March 11 triggered a nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant , forcing the evacuation of thousands . Months later , crews are still working to control radioactive emissions .

`` We need electricity , but we can not put lives at risk , '' said Kentaro Morisawa , a railway worker who took part in the Tokyo protest .

`` We have the responsibility to protect our children 's lives as much as our lives . Safer energy , such as fuel and water , is what we need today .

Crowds sang , chanted and beat drums in protests held nationwide .

`` Because we are letting radioactive material leak into the environment , we are getting a bad reputation from overseas , '' protester Mamoru Matsuda said .

`` So we need to end this Fukushima crisis as soon as possible . ''

Some of the protesters gathered near the headquarters the Tokyo Electric Power Co. , which operates the nuclear plant .

The protests comes three months into the crisis , which is the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster .

One of three operating reactors at the plant melted down after the March earthquake and tsunami , and others suffered extensive damage to their radioactive cores .

The resulting contamination has forced authorities to evacuate more than 100,000 people from towns surrounding the plant .

In addition , restrictions on various agricultural and fisheries products have devastated Japanese farmers and fishermen since the disaster started , though some of those bans have been lifted in recent weeks .

The protests are the latest show of discontent for embattled Prime Minister Naoto Kan , who survived a no-confidence vote in this month .
