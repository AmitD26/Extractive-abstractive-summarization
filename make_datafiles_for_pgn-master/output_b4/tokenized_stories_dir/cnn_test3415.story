-LRB- Budget Travel -RRB- -- In recent years , this fishing town -- and next-wave surf spot -- has turned into a popular rest stop for Inca Trail hikers .

Oceanfront lodging runs about $ 40 a night in Mancora , Peru .

Bus ride : $ 37

The quickest way to reach Máncora , about 700 miles north of Lima , is to hop on one of Lan Peru 's twice daily flights from Lima to Piura -LRB- $ 225 round trip -RRB- ; from there , it 's about a two-hour cab ride to Máncora -LRB- $ 70 -RRB- . If you have 18 hours to spare , take the Cruz del Sur bus -LRB- cruzdelsur.com.pe , $ 37 -RRB- . Tear your eyes from the dubbed American movies shown along the way and you may spot a dolphin or two frolicking in the Pacific Ocean .

Beach hotel : $ 40

There are two types of lodging : on the beach -- like Punta Ballenas Inn -LRB- 011-51/7325 -8136 -RRB- -- and almost on the beach . In the case of Hospedaje Costa Norte , you 're a minute 's walk from the surf . The rooms surround a courtyard guarded by Pedro , a parrot with a penchant for giving besitos -LRB- little kisses -RRB- to female guests -LRB- 011-51/7325 -8198 , from $ 10 -RRB- .

Yoga hotel : $ 70

Samana Chakra is a new thatched-roof bungalow resort on the northern end of the beach , owned by an ex-marketing director from California and his wife , a Peruvian yoga instructor . The rate includes breakfast and a daily hatha yoga class -LRB- totally optional , of course -RRB- . Early risers can even surf with the owners , who ride tandem on a longboard -LRB- 011-51/1 -9830-5896 , samanachakra.com -RRB- .

Taxi fare : 95 ¢

Moto-taxis , three-wheeled motorbikes with a covered backseat for two , are Máncora 's primary form of transportation . The bumpy ride across town costs about a dollar . For $ 14 round trip , a moto cabbie will take you into the Amotape Mountains to the thermal hot springs at Poza de Barro .

Surf school : $ 16

Máncora 's six-foot waves rival those of better-known surf spots in Peru , such as Chicama , but early mornings often bring waves that are ideal for beginners . Several shorefront surf schools offer 90-minute private lessons .

Tasty lunch : $ 6

Fried yucca and ice-cold Brahma beer are the perfect companions to ceviche , the national dish of Peru , made with seafood , maize , crescents of sweet potato , and a citrus marinade . At Cevichería Las Peñitas , an entire meal , including ceviche and beer , costs less than $ 6 .

Fruit drink : 50 ¢

The best deal in town is a cremolada -LRB- a crushed-ice beverage made with passion fruit , strawberry , orange , or pineapple -RRB- at Papa Mo 's Milk Bar . Passion fruit is said to have a mildly sedative effect -- not unlike a few days spent in Máncora .

Necklace : $ 7

On a three-block stretch of sidewalk near the southern end of town , dreadlocked nomads and local artisans sell everything from shark jaws to tins of natilla , Peru 's version of dulce de leche . The most unusual wares are adorned with deep orange huayruro seeds , which come from the Amazon rain forest and are believed to ward off negative energy . A double-strand necklace costs $ 7 .
