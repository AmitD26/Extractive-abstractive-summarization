-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- To call `` The Dark Knight Rises '' `` highly anticipated '' at this point would be an understatement .

The fervor for Christopher Nolan 's third Batman film has been so intense , tickets were selling out in select theaters back in January , months ahead of its July 20 U.S. opening .

With this being the third and final film in an acclaimed trilogy , each casting announcement and trailer clip has been thoroughly analyzed and discussed . And now , thanks to early reviews that have circulated on Monday , the fascination with `` The Dark Knight Rises '' has reached a new level .

`` Big-time Hollywood filmmaking at its most massively accomplished , this last installment of Christopher Nolan 's Batman trilogy makes everything in the rival Marvel universe look thoroughly silly and childish , '' says The Hollywood Reporter 's Todd McCarthy .

`` Entirely enveloping and at times unnerving in a relevant way one would never have imagined , as a cohesive whole this ranks as the best of Nolan 's trio , even if it lacks ... an element as unique as Heath Ledger 's immortal turn in ` The Dark Knight . ' ''

A review from Todd Gilchrist at IndieWire 's The Playlist says even more effortless than Nolan 's filmmaking is the way the movie `` fits into the summer 's conversation about The Big Important Issues that are preoccupying us , even when we 're walking into darkened theaters and asking only to be entertained . ''

Set eight years after the events of 2008 's `` The Dark Knight , '' the latest installment finds Bruce Wayne/Batman -LRB- played to applause by Christian Bale -RRB- in seclusion . Gotham City not blames the caped crusader for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent . There 's even been a drop in crime in Gotham City -- that is , until Tom Hardy 's masked sociopath Bane rips into Gotham , leaving terror and death in his wake .

With aid from Anne Hathaway 's Selina Kyle , who initially lures Bruce Wayne out of hiding with a burglary , Batman tracks down Bane only to find that it is going to take some doing to vanquish this villain .

Gilchrist calls the film `` A cinematic , cultural and personal triumph , '' adding that the story `` is emotionally inspiring , aesthetically significant and critically important for America itself -- as a mirror of both sober reflection and resilient hope . ''

Variety 's Justin Chang notes that , `` All in all , the picture impressively conveys a seething vision of urban anxiety that speaks to such issues as the greed and complacency of the one percent , the criminal neglect of the poor and oppressed , and above all the unsettling sense that no one and nothing is safe . ''

HitFix 's review from Drew McWeeny found that `` The Dark Knight Rises '' `` more than fulfills the promise made by the first two films . ''

`` We may never see superhero films quite like these again , and that 's fine , '' the review continues . `` Whoever Warner Bros hires to reboot the ` Batman ' films a few years from now , I wish you luck . The bar is as high as it could possibly be . ''

Agrees Time magazine 's Richard Corliss , `` The most eagerly anticipated movie of summer 2012 was worth waiting for . ... The movie may not top ` The Avengers ' at the worldwide box office , but it is a far , far better thing -- maybe the best , most troubling , assured and enthralling of all the superhero movies . ''
