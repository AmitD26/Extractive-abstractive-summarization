LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Democratic presidential hopefuls stressed their common ground with the gay and lesbian community in a televised forum , but one significant exception loomed -- same-sex marriage .

A panel that included lesbian rocker Melissa Etheridge questions Sen. Barack Obama .

Thursday night 's forum in Los Angeles was sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation . It was broadcast on the gay-themed cable network Logo , making it the first-ever televised presidential forum on gay issues .

The group said it offered Republican presidential candidates the opportunity to participate in their own forum , but they declined .

The HRC , which claims 700,000 members , is the nation 's largest advocacy group for the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered communities .

While officially non-partisan , the HRC overwhelmingly backs Democrats . In 2006 , just 11 of the 219 federal candidates endorsed by the group were Republicans , and the HRC also backed the losing presidential bids of both Sen. John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000 . Watch how Democrats consider the gay community a key constituency ''

With varying degrees of success , the front-running candidates in the Democratic field tried to reconcile their opposition to opening up marriage to gay and lesbian couples with their stated beliefs in gay and lesbian equality .

Asked what was at the heart of her opposition to same-sex marriage , Sen. Hillary Clinton said , `` I prefer to think of it as being very positive about civil unions . ''

`` It 's a personal position , '' she said . `` For me , we have made it very clear in our country that we believe in equality . How we get to full equality is the debate we 're having . ''

Sen. Barack Obama said his view is that `` we should try to disentangle what has historically been the issue of the word ` marriage , ' which has religious connotations to some people , from the civil rights that are given couples . ''

`` My job as president is going to be to make sure that the legal rights that have consequences on a day-to-day basis for loving same-sex couples all across the country ... are recognized and enforced , '' he said .

John Edwards , a former senator from North Carolina and the Democratic Party 's 2004 vice-presidential nominee , offered an apology for a previous statement that his religious faith was at the heart of his opposition to same-sex marriage .

`` I should n't have said that , '' said Edwards , who has previously said he has struggled with his position . `` I believe to my core in equality . My campaign for the presidency is about equality across the board . ''

`` All I can tell you is where I am today , '' he said . `` I do not support same-sex marriage . ''

New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson cast his opposition to same-sex marriage in pragmatic terms , saying `` it 's a question of doing what 's achievable '' and trying to move the country forward on the issue .

`` In my heart , I 'm doing what is achievable , '' he said . `` And I 'm not there yet , and the country is n't there yet . ''

However , two long-shot candidates in the field who do support same-sex marriage -- Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Mike Gravel , a former senator from Alaska -- made it clear they do n't see why their rivals are so conflicted .

`` This is really a question of whether you really believe in equality , '' Kucinich said . `` When you understand what real equality is , you understand that people who love each other must have the opportunity to be able to express that in a way that 's meaningful . ''

Gravel accused his better-known rivals of `` playing it safe '' on the marriage issue and said he believes same-sex marriage `` will be a nonissue in the next presidential campaign '' in 2012 .

`` Marriage is a commitment between two human beings in love , '' Gravel said . `` And if there 's anything we need in this world , it 's more love . ''

A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Thursday found that a majority of Americans -- 57 percent -- oppose same-sex marriage . Forty-three percent oppose both same-sex marriage and civil unions , which offer most or some of the protections and benefits of marriage .

All of the 2008 Democratic candidates are on record as supporting civil unions , a position also taken by President Bush , an opponent of same-sex marriage , during his 2004 re-election campaign .

While just 3 percent of voters in the 2006 election identified themselves as gay or lesbian , the community has outsized influence , particularly among Democrats , because it is politically active and a source of campaign contributions .

Reflecting that sway , six of the eight 2008 Democratic hopefuls -- all but Sens. Christopher Dodd and Joe Biden -- attended Thursday 's event .

Eschewing the usual debate format , candidates appeared on stage one at a time , where they sat in an easy chair and fielded questions from a panel that included lesbian rocker Melissa Etheridge .

One area where the Democratic candidates were in clear agreement with gay rights advocates was on the question of ending the do n't - ask-don ` t-tell policy , which allows gay men and lesbians to serve in the military only if they do not publicly disclose their sexual orientation .

Clinton -- whose husband , former President Bill Clinton , originally proposed the policy in 1993 -- said she changed her mind in 1999 and that repealing it would be `` one of my highest priorities '' as president .

Edwards also voiced his is opposition , but he noted that '' ` do n't - ask-don ` t-tell is not just wrong now , it was wrong when it began . It 's been wrong the entire time . ''

Thursday 's poll also found strong public support for ditching do n't - ask-don ` t-tell . Fifty-seven percent of those polled opposed the policy itself , while 79 percent said openly gay people should be allowed to serve in the military . E-mail to a friend
