The statement from President Asif Ali Zardari said he has called for an urgent report on the incident and added that vulnerable sections of society must be protected `` from any misuse of the blasphemy law . ''

`` Blasphemy by anyone can not be condoned but no one will be allowed to misuse blasphemy law for settling personal scores , '' said the president 's spokesman , Farhatullah Babar .

Critics of the controversial law say it is being used to persecute religious minorities .

Politician and former international cricketer Imran Khan tweeted : `` Shameful ! Sending an 11 yr old girl to prison is against the very spirit of Islam which is all about being Just and Compassionate .

`` Poor child is already suffering from Down Syndrome . State should care for its children not torment them . We demand her immed release , '' said Khan , who now leads the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf .

The legislation makes it a crime punishable by death to insult Islam , the Quran or the Prophet Mohammed .
