Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Feuding among Michael Jackson 's family reached a new level Monday when a `` scuffle '' erupted at Katherine Jackson 's home in Calabasas , California , according a sheriff 's spokesman .

Paris Jackson , the 14-year-old daughter of the late pop icon , posted a Twitter message about the time the incident was happening : `` got ta love fam . ''

She also tweeted about her distress about not hearing from her grandmother for more than a week : `` 8 days and counting . something is really off , this is n't like her at all . . i wan na talk directly to my grandmother !! < | 3 ''

Michael Jackson 's siblings attack estate executors

Deputies were called to the mansion where Katherine Jackson has been raising Prince , 15 , Paris and Blanket , 10 , since their father died three years ago , Los Angeles County sheriff 's spokesman Steve Whitmore said .

A battery report was taken , but no arrests were made , Whitmore said . He would not identify who was involved because `` the investigation is ongoing . ''

Janet , Jermaine and Randy Jackson were on the scene , a source with firsthand knowledge of the incident said . The source asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter .

The drama happened as Los Angeles County sheriff 's detectives closed a missing persons case opened for Katherine Jackson , who was found to be with daughter Rebbie in Arizona .

`` Katherine Jackson has been located and she is fine and with family , '' Whitmore said . `` Our missing persons case is closed . '' Deputies talked to two family members and were satisfied , he said .

A lawyer for Katherine Jackson is not satisfied , saying the sheriff 's deputies who tried to talk to her in Arizona Monday were blocked from seeing her .

Because the 82-year-old matriarch of the Jackson music dynasty was taken across state lines , Katherine Jackson attorney Sandra Ribera said earlier , she hopes the FBI will investigate the circumstances of what she called her disappearance .

Jermaine Jackson , in a statement posted on Twitter Sunday night , said his mother `` is safe and well in Arizona with her daughter and our sister , Rebbie , resting up on doctor 's advice . ''

But Michael Jackson 's three children still have not heard from their grandmother eight days after she left them at home , Ribera said .

Jermaine Jackson 's statement insisted the children were not `` being ` blocked ' from speaking with Mother . ''

`` She is merely an 82-year-old woman following doctor 's orders to rest up and de-stress , away from phones and computers , '' he tweeted .

His statement did not explain why Paris was rebuffed during several attempts to reach her grandmother on the phone . That led to Paris posting messages on Twitter early Sunday pleading for help in finding her .

`` Yes , my grandmother is missing , '' Paris tweeted . `` I have n't spoken with her in a week i want her home now . ''

It is the latest chapter in a messy dispute between several of Jackson 's children and her advisers .

Whitmore confirmed that the sheriff 's department is investigating allegations that Jackson was being `` emotionally and financially mistreated by family members . ''

Katherine Jackson has custody of Michael Jackson 's children and a 20 % share in her son 's huge estate . Her husband , Joe Jackson , and her eight surviving children were completely left out of Michael Jackson 's will .

The abuse probe began when `` a business associate of the Jackson family '' reported the allegation to a sheriff 's official in April , Whitmore said .

`` Investigators contacted Katherine Jackson and she emphatically denied any and all of them , '' Whitmore said . When investigators met with Jackson she was `` in good health and voiced no complaints , '' he said .

`` Out an abundance of caution , we have continued to interview legal representatives of the family about the possibility of financial abuses , '' he said . `` That investigation remains open . ''

Katherine Jackson 's lawyer and business manager decline to immediately comment .
