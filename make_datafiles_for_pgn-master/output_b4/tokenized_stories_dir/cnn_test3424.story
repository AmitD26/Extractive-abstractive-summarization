London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With 50 meters to go , it looked like Oscar Pistorius was cruising to gold in the men 's 200 meters .

But then , to his outside , a flash of green went by , a 20-year-old Brazilian who rocketed past him to upset the most famous Paralympian of all time .

Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira beat Pistorius to the line , winning gold in 21.45 . South Africa 's Pistorius took silver in 21.52 , unable to come near his world record set Saturday . The bronze went to Blake Leeper of the United States .

On Saturday , the third day of the Games , Pistorius blazed through the men 's 200-meter-T44 qualifier with a world-record time of 21.30 seconds . The Paralympic movement classifies events , using terms like T44 , to group competitors based on their disability .

Pistorius , who uses carbon fiber prosthetic blades , made it to the semifinals of the individual 400-meter and the 400-meter relay final at the Olympics last month , running against athletes with no disablities .

Besides the 200-meter run , he will also compete in the Paralympics in the men 's 100-meter-T44 -LRB- set for Wednesday and Thursday -RRB- and the 400-meter-T44 -LRB- happening Friday and Saturday -RRB- , both of which he won in Beijing four years ago .

Pistorius , nicknamed the Blade Runner , is also part of South Africa 's 4x100-meter T42/T46 relay team , which is scheduled to race Wednesday .

U.S. two-sport athlete Rudy Garcia-Tolson , a day after finishing ninth in the men 's 200 meters -LRB- T42 -RRB- on the track , won a silver in the 200-meter individual medley . Yevheniy Bohodayko of Ukraine won the event in a world record time of 2:33.13 . Garcia-Tolson set an American record of 2:33.94 .

Jessica Long of the United States , who was looking to add a fourth gold medal in swimming in the games , finished fifth in the 50-meter freestyle -LRB- S8 -RRB- . Her teammate , Mallory Weggemann , won the event in 31.13 , edging 13-year-old Maddison Elliott of Australia .

Long , a 20-year-old from Baltimore , is entered in nine events in the meet . She won three gold medals in Athens at age 12 and four more in Beijing . She also has a silver and bronze from 2008 , giving her 12 career Paralympic Games medals .

Long was born in Siberia with fibular hemimelia , meaning she had no fibulas and other bones in lower legs , according to her website . She was adopted by her U.S. parents at age 13 months and had her lower legs amputated five months later .

Australian Jacqueline Freney won her third gold medal with a world record in the women 's 200-individual medley -LRB- SM7 -RRB- .

The thin line : Paralympic classification

At the weightlifting venue , Fatma Omar of Egypt set a world record in women 's powerlifting . The 38-year-old won her 56-kilogram -LRB- 123-pound -RRB- division with a lift of 140 kilograms -LRB- 309 pounds -RRB- .

New Zealand 's Phillipa Gray and Laura Thompson also set a world record Sunday in the qualification round of the women 's individual B pursuit , an event on a tandem bicycle for the visually impaired . They won the final , beating the Irish team of Catherine Walsh and Francine Meehan .

China has a huge lead in medals , topping the table with 87 . The Chinese added to their total on Sunday with golds in table tennis from Feng Panfeng in men 's singles -LRB- Class 3 -RRB- and Liu Jing in women 's singles -LRB- Class 1-2 -RRB- . China also took golds in rowing 's mixed doubles sculls and men 's single sculls from Huang Cheng , the world record holder .
