-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- `` Snow White and the Huntsman '' was awoken to the tune of $ 56.3 million this weekend , according to studio estimates .

That 's a big win for Universal Pictures , especially considering that the studio 's last film , the sinking big-budget bomb known as `` Battleship , '' opened to less than half that amount two weeks ago .

`` Snow White '' also marked the best debut for star Kristen Stewart outside the `` Twilight '' franchise , and the second-best start for Charlize Theron after `` Hancock . '' The film skewed female , but just barely , as 53 percent of its crowd consisted of women . The PG-13 revisionist fairy tale was also pretty evenly split between younger and older moviegoers , with 52 percent being at least 30 years old .

Audiences liked but did n't love the film , which received an okay `` B '' rating from CinemaScore participants . Considering that Universal spent $ 170 million producing the picture , `` Snow White '' needs to hold moderately well the next few weeks . But even if the movie does n't wind up being a huge moneymaker , it at least avoided the fate of `` Battleship '' and is the first major post - `` Avengers '' flick to exceed industry expectations .

In second place , `` Men in Black 3 '' held up fairly well , dropping 46 percent for $ 29.3 million . The $ 230 million threequel has so far earned $ 112.3 million domestically in 10 days -- just slightly behind where `` Men in Black '' -LRB- $ 118.8 million -RRB- and `` Men in Black II '' -LRB- $ 115.6 million -RRB- were at the same point -- and an impressive $ 386.9 million worldwide .

Of course , that 's nothing compared to `` The Avengers , '' which fell 45 percent for $ 20.3 million and walked away with two notable achievements . First , the Marvel superhero movie passed `` The Dark Knight 's '' $ 533.3 million tally to become the third-highest-grossing domestic release ever , behind only `` Avatar '' -LRB- $ 760.5 million -RRB- and Titanic -LRB- $ 658.6 million -RRB- . While `` The Avengers '' should be able to reach the $ 600 million mark , it 'll almost certainly fall short of those two James Cameron productions . Still , No. 3 is not a bad place to be , especially when you 're also talking about the worldwide record board .

Over the weekend , `` The Avengers '' passed `` Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 '' to become the third biggest movie ever globally . The movie has so far smashed $ 1.36 billion worldwide . Though again , third place is likely where it 'll stay , as `` Avatar '' and `` Titanic '' are way out in front with $ 2.78 billion and $ 2.19 billion , respectively .

Rounding out the top five were `` Battleship '' and `` The Dictator '' with $ 4.8 million and $ 4.7 million . In limited release , Wes Anderson 's critically acclaimed `` Moonrise Kingdom '' continued to dominate , collecting $ 849,000 at just 16 theaters for a per-location average of $ 53,000 .

The Mexican historical drama `` For Greater Glory , '' starring Andy Garcia and Eva Longoria , settled for a decent $ 1.8 million at 757 theaters . But the horror-comedy sequel `` Piranha 3DD '' mustered only $ 179,000 at 86 locations , while the Adrien Brody comedy `` High School '' flunked out with just $ 80,600 at 200 sites -- that 's $ 403 per theater . If one assumes each theater played `` High School '' five times per day , then each screening was attended by an average of three moviegoers .

1 . `` Snow White and the Huntsman '' -- $ 56.3 mil

2 . `` Men in Black 3 '' -- $ 29.3 mil

3 . `` The Avengers '' -- $ 20.3 mil

4 . `` Battleship '' -- $ 4.8 mil

5 . `` The Dictator '' -- $ 4.7 mil
