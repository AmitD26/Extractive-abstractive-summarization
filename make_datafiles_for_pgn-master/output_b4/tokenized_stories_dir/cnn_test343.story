Vancouver , British Columbia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Luge is a dangerous sport in which accidents happen . That was the refrain from athlete after athlete when asked how they felt about the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili , who was killed when he flew off the Olympic track during training in Whistler on Friday .

But luge athletes will be the first to tell you they are more driving technicians than adrenaline junkies , and when pressed about why they would participate in a sport that 's so dangerous , several concede they do n't consider the sport to be that risky .

Amidst the shock at the death of a young athlete , the fact has been lost that in the hands -- and feet -- of masters , luge is relatively safe .

A 1997 paper in the American Journal of Sports Medicine analyzed luge injuries between 1985 and '92 on the Lake Placid , New York , luge course , a track that sliders consider to be technically trickier , though slower , than Whistler .

The conclusion was that luge on that difficult track is remarkably safe . With `` injury rates comparable with recreational skiing , '' the study says , `` the sport of luge is quite safe ... despite the appearance of danger . ''

The study analyzed 57,244 runs by competitive , or training to be competitive , men and women from 12 - to 35-years-old . It recorded 407 injuries . The vast majority of those were bruises , scrapes and muscle strains . Luge is rough on the back and neck muscles .

During the seven years , a mere 10 injuries were serious enough , like a broken bone , to force the athlete to miss a week or more of practice . According to the study , athletes were more likely to get hurt away from the track while carrying their sleds than to suffer a major injury on it .

The grand total of concussions recorded was 10 . A six-year study of the National Football League found , conservatively , that a concussion happened about every other game .

Because 16 games are played on the opening NFL weekend , concussions during pro football should surpass seven years of Lake Placid luge in Week 2 of the season .

And never mind boxing , where athletes are occasionally killed , and the actual goal is to physically insult the brain of a competitor until he or she is unable to stand .

It 's a discrepancy that Canadian luge coach Wolfgang Staudinger , who was angered that the men 's race was moved to the lower women 's start after Kumaritashvili 's death , was quick to address .

The speed of race cars is not reduced every time a professional driver crashes and dies , he said . For that matter , nor are speed limits on roads , where 37,261 people in the United States died in crashes in 2008 .

That said , nothing would be wrong with reducing speeds at the Whistler course ; the sport is just as exciting for fans at 80 mph as at 90 mph .

As for the Lake Placid luge analysis , study author Dr. Robert Cummings , an orthopedic surgeon in Concord , New Hampshire , said different tracks have different hazards . -LRB- Cummings was a competitive luger himself , and said he never suffered a serious injury . -RRB-

Much was made of the Whistler track being the world 's fastest after a German slider topped 95 mph on it last year . Kumaritashvili was going 88 mph when he crashed .

And yet , in the three years of its existence , the Whistler track 's crash stats are in line with other tracks around the world , according to officials from the International Luge Federation . Out of more than 30,000 runs in the three sliding sports -- bobsled , luge and skeleton -- Whistler has seen 340 crashes .

Lugers and coaches at the Olympics said that they 've never seen an athlete fly off the course entirely , as Kumaritashvili did .

`` Everything came together at the same time , '' said Tony Benshoof , a U.S. luger who finished eighth on Sunday , `` but there are places on every track where that could feasibly happen . ''

But it essentially does n't happen . This was a terrible , terrible , freak accident . U.S. luge coach Wolfgang Schaedler says he has n't seen an athlete fly off a course in his 35 years in the sport . That is n't to say that the modifications in Whistler -- the ice on curve 16 was shaved to make it harder for sleds to go up the wall , a new retaining wall was put in place and a lower start is being used -- are not perfectly prudent .

Perhaps retaining walls should be put along every curve at every track in the world . Even the athletes who were upset at the change of their starting spots said the luge federation had to show the world how serious it is about safety .

What happened to Kumaritashvili was a tragedy so deeply affecting that athletes who should have been basking in the realization of their Olympic dreams were frequently choking back tears .

Still , they agreed that the rush to see every luge run as a gambler 's game of life and death is a characterization that can only be made by those who started following the sport on that tragic Friday .
