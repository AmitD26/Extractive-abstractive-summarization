BEIJING , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The death toll in China 's outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease has risen to 42 children , with the capital Beijing reporting its first case Wednesday , state media said .

Parents sit with children being treated for the virus in Fuyang , China , last month .

The child died on the way to a hospital Sunday , health authorities told the Xinhua news agency .

Another child died of the virus at a Beijing hospital , but that death was counted in the child 's home province of Hebei , which neighbors Beijing , the news agency said .

So far , the virus has sickened 24,934 children on the Chinese mainland , authorities said . All 42 people who died have been children .

The deaths are blamed on enterovirus 71 , or EV-71 , one of the most common causes of hand-foot-mouth disease -LRB- HFMD -RRB- .

The official count of infections has increased dramatically in recent days since an order issued late last week by the Ministry of Health mandating that all cases be reported .

HFMD is not related to foot-and-mouth disease , which affects farm animals . HFMD can be caused by a number of intestinal viruses , of which EV-71 and Coxsackie A16 are among the most common .

In mild cases , EV-71 causes cold-like symptoms , diarrhea , and sores on the hands , feet and mouth . Severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain , resulting in polio-like paralysis and death .

There is no treatment for severe EV-71 infections nor does a vaccine exist . Adults with well-developed immune systems can usually fend off the virus , but children are particularly vulnerable to it , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

Public health officials expect the number of cases to peak this summer , since the disease thrives in warm weather .

The virus is a concern for Chinese officials as the nation prepares to host the Summer Olympic Games starting August 8 .

Taiwan had a large outbreak of HFMD in 1998 with 78 deaths , and smaller outbreaks in 2000 and 2001 , according to the CDC .

China is also coping with the devastation left by a magnitude-7.9 earthquake that struck Monday , killing thousands and leaving even more people trapped in debris or simply listed as missing .
