Manama , Bahrain -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Clashes broke out in Bahrain on Friday as authorities tried to prevent thousands of opposition supporters converging on a mosque to hear a sermon from the kingdom 's most prominent Shia cleric , Sheikh Isa Qassim .

The unrest followed a series of bombings in the capital , Manama , earlier this week , and the government 's decision to strip some 31 opposition activists of their citizenship .

Amid the unrest Friday , a teenage boy was knocked over by a car and killed as he crossed a busy road in the area .

Sixteen-year-old Ali Abbas Radhi had been detained by police , according to witnesses and his family , and then escaped . They said he was hit by the car as he was pursued .

The Ministry of Interior said Radhi was killed as he tried to cross the road , but made no reference to his being arrested .

Bahrain strips Shiite activists of citizenship amid unrest

The Bahraini opposition is made up largely of the kingdom 's Shiite majority , which has long complained that it is marginalized under the rule of the Sunni al Khalifa dynasty . As the Arab Spring erupted last year , opposition groups twice occupied the island 's famous Pearl Roundabout , until protestors were dispersed in a security crackdown in March 2011 .

The opposition had called prayers Friday to support Sheikh Qassim , who has come under attack in pro-government media for meeting the Iranian consul in Bahrain . Authorities summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires in Manama last month to complain about the meeting .

A large number of police had sealed off access to the mosque in the village of Diraz . Witnesses say many worshippers abandoned their cars and tried to reach the mosque on foot . Police fired tear gas to prevent people from reaching Diraz , according to witnesses .

The Ministry of Interior in a statement said the roads had been closed to prevent `` vandals from outside the area '' from gathering , after receiving information that protests were planned .

Earlier this week , authorities said the 31 people stripped of their Bahraini nationality had harmed state security . They included three former members of parliament and several opposition figures .

A leading cleric , Ayatollah Hussein Al-Najati , also lost his Bahraini nationality . Ayatollah Al-Najati is the representative in Bahrain of Iraq 's Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani , whose teachings are widely followed by the island 's Shiite communities .

Bahrain says ban on protests is response to rising violence

In his sermon Friday , Ayatollah Qassim criticized both the move to deprive Bahrainis of their nationality and bomb explosions this week in Manama , which killed two Indian workers . He also called for only peaceful forms of protest .

Attempts at political dialogue between the government and opposition parties have made little progress , and there 's been an uptick in violence in recent weeks .

Condemning the bombings , the U.S. State Department said this week that violence had `` claimed the lives of protesters , of security forces , of innocent bystanders . ''

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the violence `` undercuts the process of national reconciliation that we have strongly been urging on Bahrainis of all stripes . '' On Friday Nuland welcomed a declaration of non-violence by six opposition parties .

But Ayham Kamel , an analyst with the Eurasia Group , said that `` Shia hardliners that condone the use of violence , such as Haq and the 14 February movement , are likely to use the wave of attacks to reinforce their rising popularity . ''

Since anti-government protests began in February 2011 , more than 100 civilians and at least six police officers have been killed in sporadic violence .
