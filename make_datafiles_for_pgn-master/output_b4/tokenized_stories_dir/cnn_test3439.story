-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The wife of fugitive Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , three of his children and some of his grandchildren arrived in Algeria on Monday morning , Algerian diplomats said .

Mourad Benmehidi , the Algerian ambassador to the United Nations , said he relayed the news to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon earlier Monday . Benmehidi said his country granted entrance to Gadhafi 's wife , Safia , his daughter , Aisha , sons Hannibal and Mohamed and their children on `` humanitarian grounds . ''

`` We made sure the international community has been informed , '' said Benmehidi .

The ambassador said he did not know whether Moammar Gadhafi was expected to seek entry into Algeria and claimed none of the Gadhafis were subject to U.N. Security Council sanctions .

In fact , U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970 , passed on February 26 , includes the names of all three Gadhafi children who are now in Algeria as being subject to a `` travel ban '' because of their `` closeness of association with -LRB- the -RRB- regime . ''

The U.N. ban requires `` all member states '' to prevent them and others listed from entering their territories , unless there is some special circumstance that the council agrees warrants an exception . The resolution also allows the nation -- in this case , Algeria -- to determine `` on a case-by-case basis that such entry or transit is required to advance peace and stability -LRB- and -RRB- notifies the committee within 48 hours after making such a determination . ''

News on Monday of the Gadhafi relatives ' departure from Libya came the same day that a senior rebel commander reported that Khamis Gadhafi , a son of the Libyan leader and military commander in his regime , had been killed Sunday night .

Mahdi al-Harati , the vice chairman of the rebels ' Military Council , the military wing of the National Transitional Council , said Khamis Gadhafi died in a battle with rebel forces between the villages of Tarunah and Bani Walid in northwest Libya .

Khamis Gadhafi , who was a senior military commander under his father , was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries , said al-Harati . He was then buried in the area by rebel forces , al-Harati said .

His father , Moammar Gadhafi , meanwhile , is still wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague on charges of war crimes . So , too , is Moammar 's son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and his brother-in-law and intelligence chief , Abdullah al-Sanussi .

But should any of those three get to Algeria , there is no guarantee they would face trial . Algeria is not a signatory of the Rome Treaty that established the International Criminal Court .

The longtime ruler 's whereabouts have been a mystery since the rebels overran Tripoli last week . Rebel commanders said Gadhafi was not found in the network of tunnels beneath his Bab al-Aziziya compound , and reports that he had been holed up in an apartment block nearby or at a farm near Tripoli 's airport did n't pan out .

The National Transitional Council , which is forming a provisional government in Tripoli since overrunning the city last week , has not yet confirmed the news about Gadhafi 's family members , spokesman Mahmoud al-Shammam told CNN . But he said that if true , the NTC would demand the return of the family members . He promised they would receive a fair trial .

The rebels had previously speculated that Gadhafi could be trying to reach Algeria or Libya 's southern neighbor Chad , both countries with which his government had close ties .

`` Those are the only two neighboring countries that have been showing support for him , '' Guma El-Gamaty , an NTC official based in Britain , said last week .

In London , Britain 's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the fate of Gadhafi 's relatives `` is a matter for the NTC . '' In Washington , White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters the United States has no indication Gadhafi has left Libya .

On Monday night , a senior official in President Barack Obama 's administration -- speaking on condition of anonymity , given the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue -- said the Libyan leader 's wife and three children are believed to be in the Algerian government 's custody .

The official echoed earlier comments from U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland that what 's important is that Gadhafi and his relatives , wherever they are , are held accountable .

`` We want to see justice and accountability for Gadhafi and those members of his family with blood on their hands and those members of his regime with blood on their hands , '' Nuland said . `` But it 'll be a decision of the Libyan people , -LRB- as to -RRB- how that goes forward . ''

Algeria , which the CIA World Factbook says has a population of 35 million , repeatedly has been mentioned as a possible destination for Gadhafi and his family . Guma El-Gamaty , the Britain-based coordinator for Libya 's National Transitional Council , said earlier this month that Algeria and Chad `` are the only two neighboring countries that have been showing support for him . ''

Jon Alterman , director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , noted similarities between Libya under Gadhafi and Algeria , with a largely oil-driven economy and strong central government under President Abdelaziz Bouteflika `` that is concerned with popular uprisings . ''

`` My sense is that Algeria was supportive , in part , because they had worked out a modus vivendi -LRB- or , practical compromise -RRB- with Gadhafi and they feared the contagion of mass popular unrest in the region , '' Alterman said .

Yet while many nations in Africa had determined `` it was easier to manage -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- than to defeat him , '' especially when he shared some oil-derived wealth around the continent , Alterman said he finds it unlikely any nation will now risk international scorn by taking in the embattled leader himself -- or that Gadhafi would ever leave Libya .

Of Gadhafi 's family members now in Algeria , Aisha Gadhafi was a good will ambassador for the U.N. Development Program and has kept a low profile during the six-month revolt against her father . She had been named to the position in 2009 to address HIV/AIDS and violence against women in Libya , but U.N. officials terminated her position as Gadhafi unleashed his military on anti-government protesters early in the conflict .

She is due to give birth in early September , sources close to her family told CNN .

Hannibal Gadhafi is a headline maker . He has reportedly paid millions of dollars for private parties featuring big-name entertainers including Beyonce , Mariah Carey and Usher . Several of the artists now say they have given the money back .

Rebels who picked through his seaside villa on Sunday also introduced CNN 's Dan Rivers to his family 's badly burned former nanny , who said she had been doused with boiling water by his wife , model Aline Skaf , when she refused to beat one of their crying toddlers .

The nanny , Shweyga Mullah , is covered with scars from the abuse , which was corroborated by another member of the household staff .

Hannibal was also accused of a string of violent incidents in Europe , including beating his staff and his wife . Charges were dropped in the case of his staff , and Skaf later said her broken nose was the result of an accident .

In another high-profile episode , Hannibal was stopped after driving his Ferrari 90 mph the wrong way on the Champs-Elysees in Paris . He invoked diplomatic immunity .

Mohamed Gadhafi , meanwhile , was one of three Gadhafi sons who had been reported captured as the rebels overran Tripoli last week . But the rebels said he had escaped the next day .

CNN 's Jill Dougherty , Greg Botelho , Richard Roth and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .
