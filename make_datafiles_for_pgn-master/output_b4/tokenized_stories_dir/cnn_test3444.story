-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thinking about Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas ' efforts this week to gain observer status as a nonmember state , I 'm reminded of one of my favorite `` Seinfeld '' episodes .

Sitting in the Restaurant -- the venue for so many of the best `` Seinfeld '' bits -- George and Jerry conspire to produce a new sitcom , a show literally about nothing . Not surprisingly , the idea comes to nothing as well , though the ironic brilliance that the very show they want to produce already exists adds a cool philosophical edge to the comedy .

Sadly , like the `` Seinfeld '' episode , the Palestinian effort to gain entry into the U.N. General Assembly as an observer state will come to nothing as well , even if -- as is likely -- he succeeds .

And that 's the real tragedy . Success will neither provide the gains Palestinians hope to achieve nor the disasters that opponents of the initiative predict . In the end , Abbas and the Palestinians will be no closer to statehood and perhaps even a little further away .

Motives

Frustrated by the world 's seeming indifference to the Palestinian issue and weakened by his inability to deliver anything , Abbas is desperate for an end-of - the-year success of some kind .

Blocked by Washington and the U.N. Security Council last year from gaining admission as a state , he 's fallen back on the idea of observer status , an initiative that ca n't be vetoed by the Americans and is likely to succeed in the General Assembly .

Opinion : Why U.S. , Israel should welcome Palestinian move at U.N.

Observer status is largely a symbolic issue , but the Palestinian Authority might then have access to other U.N.-affiliated agencies , including the International Criminal Court , assuming that body would be willing to entertain Palestinian claims and charges against Israel .

Indeed , Palestinian desperation is accompanied by a Palestinian assessment that the international arena offers a fertile field to score political points and to pressure and isolate the Israelis . Call it a kind of global station identification for an organization -- Fatah -- that 's run out of options .

What matters is what happens on the ground

If the history of this issue shows anything , it demonstrates that what really counts is what happens between Israelis and Palestinians in the region . How sad and ironic that it was Hamas ' rockets , not Abbas ' diplomacy , that put the Palestinian issue on the map again .

And that 's likely to be the story again -- whether through violence or diplomacy . What counts is whether Israelis and Palestinians can offer incentives and disincentives to one another in currency that matters -- prisoners , land , cease-fires , economic assistance , etc. . It matters not a whit what goes on in New York at the United Nations .

Abbas might well be the best partner Israel will ever have , but if he ca n't deliver or if the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does n't want to deal with him , well Houston , we have a problem . And at the moment , it is Hamas -- not Abbas -- that counts more and the Gaza/Egypt arena , not the U.N. , that 's more relevant .

Washington 's calculations

Why not support the Abbas move ? Does n't the U.S. have a stake in bucking him up and reinforcing the two-state solution ?

Obama 's calculations in opposing the observer initiative are three .

First , philosophically , ever since we 've had Israeli-Palestinian negotiations , the American talking points have been pretty consistent . What matters is negotiations , not moves , at the U.N. And even though there are no talks now , the U.S. position is correct ; the only thing that can produce two states are two -- maybe three -- parties talking .

Second , there 's no doubt that Obama understands that observer status will only deepen the adversarial relationship between Abbas and Netanyahu , give the Israelis another reason not to negotiate and get the president into a fight with Congress should he support the Palestinian bid . Indeed , that 's the last thing he needs at a time when he 's wrangling with Congress about the fiscal cliff and fighting with the Republicans about Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .

Finally , if he is going to consider an initiative on the big Israeli-Palestinian issues during his second term , he needs to build up credibility with the Israelis -- as he 's done on the cease-fire in Gaza -- so he can be in a better position to push and persuade them later .

News : Palestinians again take status case to U.N. .

An initiative about nothing

The observer state initiative wo n't make the difference that either its advocates or detractors imagine . Congress might further restrict aid to the Palestinians at a time when the Palestinian Authority is in the red . Abbas will look feckless -- and Hamas even stronger -- because in the end , the results in New York will change nothing on the ground for the better in the region . Indeed , Israel might well retaliate by withholding tax revenues it collects for the Palestinian Authority under agreements reached in the mid-1990s .

And sadly , unlike a `` Seinfeld '' episode , what happens between Israelis and Palestinians actually matters . For the time being , these two peoples will remain suspended between a peace they can not have and a confrontation neither wants but might well come nonetheless .
