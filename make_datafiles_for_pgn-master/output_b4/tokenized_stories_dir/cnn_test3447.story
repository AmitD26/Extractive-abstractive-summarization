Ishinomaki , Japan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's been nine months since I took the photos , but as the temperature drops below zero at the start of another Japanese winter , one image stubbornly dwells on my mind .

It 's not of the tsunami-inflicted destruction -- the flattened homes , mangled cars or piles of debris -- in Ishinomaki , one of the worst-hit areas in the Tohoku region , in the country 's north .

Instead , it is an image of retirees huddled on small benches outside their temporary homes .

The pre-assembled homes have ample heating and are equipped with small kitchens -- and yes , many people in other parts of the world live with much less .

But in talking with some of the elderly residents in March , one year after the devastating earthquake and tsunami , it was clear that they were struggling to adapt to their new surroundings .

Now as a second winter arrives after March 2011 quake , I was curious as to how these people were coping and I wondered what their thoughts were on Japan 's upcoming general election .

Did they have a strong preference on who should become Japan 's seventh prime minster in just over six years ? Or , with so much political change and their own upheaval , were they even paying any attention ?

I was also compelled by the fact that , according to government figures , more than 320,000 people remain in temporary housing across the affected region .

And it could be the case for quite some time .

According to a recent report in The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper , of the nearly 24,000 housing units set to be constructed in three prefectures , only roughly 13,700 will be completed by March of 2015 . That 's four years after the tsunami hit .

And with this all in mind , it 's particularly tough for many people in the Tohoku region to grasp the concept of the revolving door of leaders , as they watch the reconstruction drag on .

Junko Hino , a resident at one housing center , told us , `` Nothing has changed here , but the prime minister has changed many times . I do n't understand the meaning of any of it . ''

Sixty-seven-year-old Katsuji Ogata lost his wife in the tsunami . He used to run a small restaurant in Ishinomaki . Now it 's a simple food truck .

He is even more outspoken , saying `` the government has n't done a thing for us . They 've only cleared the debris . ''

Kenichi Kurosawa erected a sign it what was once a neighborhood that reads Ganbaru , or `` try your hardest , '' in the hope of inspiring those who are struggling in the aftermath of the tsunami .

He says , `` I know it was a huge disaster and things would take time . But I am frustrated . The reaction has been too slow for too long . We are working hard and trying to move forward , but there are many people who are really struggling and need some help . ''

The people in the housing complexes are making the best of their situation though .

One we visited outside Ishinomaki had setup a small Sunday morning market the day we visited .

They were also operating a basic convenience store .

And we also met Satoshi Sakurai at the complex 's barber shop .

`` Another prime minster and another new cabinet , the reconstruction will be delayed again , '' he sighs .

But the barber shop 's owner , Hiroshi Yokota , tried to keep things in perspective .

`` I sometimes wish I 'd wake , and it was all a dream , '' he says .

`` But it happened to us , so we make the best of situation , and try to get back to the life we once had . ''
