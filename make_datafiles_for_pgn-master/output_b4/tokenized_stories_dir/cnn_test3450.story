-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sierra Leone 's incumbent president won re-election and was sworn in for a second term , pledging to boost the economy of the nation scarred by years of civil war .

President Ernest Koroma got nearly 59 % of the vote , beating his closest competitor 's 37 % in an election international observers described as peaceful .

By getting more than 55 % , he avoided a second round of voting with the opposition frontrunner .

Following his win , Koroma called for unity as he was sworn in late Friday .

`` Let us , as we celebrate , be mindful that the work starts today and every Sierra Leonean from all political parties , regions , ethnic group , age and religion is central to our agenda for prosperity , '' the president said . `` We must therefore embrace each other as we march forward with action , bravery , commitment , discipline , empathy and fortitude . ''

Koroma , 59 , a former insurance executive , assumed office in 2007 . Supporters have credited him with improving infrastructure while critics have said he has not addressed rampant corruption .

`` I will make sure the fruits of the agenda for prosperity are equality distributed in every district of the country and enjoyed by all , '' he said in his swearing-in . The work starts today . ''

The United States applauded him and hailed the west African nation 's democracy .

`` This election demonstrates the progress that Sierra Leone has made in strengthening its democratic institutions since the end of the civil war in 2002 , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement .

Sierra Leone 's economy was gutted by an 11-year civil war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing

During the brutal war , which was funded using the so-called `` blood diamonds , '' teenagers were placed under the influence of drugs to provoke violent behavior such as killing , raping and plundering .
