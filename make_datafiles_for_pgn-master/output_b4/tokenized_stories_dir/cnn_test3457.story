`` I 'm happy as we missed a penalty and drew . This is our first experience after 31 years so , as you see , it was fantastic for our football , '' he told reporters .

`` The players have shown their characters , and shown the rest of the world they can play football .

`` The goalkeeper also has to defend , he went to defend the ball , and should n't have been red carded . ''

Ethiopia should have been ahead even by the time Tassew had been sent off for a reckless challenge on Chisamba Lungu 10 minutes before the break .

Playing against a Zambia side consisting of 10 of the 11 which had won the competition in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea last year , Ethiopia started in impressive fashion and came agonizingly close to scoring .

Ahmed Said raced through on goal and lifted the ball over the on rushing Kennedy Mweene but the ball somehow bounced over the crossbar .

Buoyed by a vociferous following , Ethiopia continued to threaten and had the perfect opportunity to take the lead on 23 minutes when Said was fouled inside the penalty area by Lungu .

But the striker appeared to lose his nerve at the crucial moment as his effort was easily dealt with by Mweene .

That miss looked to have taken the momentum out of Ethiopia 's sails and it was left firmly on the back foot 12 minuets later as Tassew was shown a straight red card after taking out Lungu in dangerous fashion .

Slowly but surely , Zambia began to take the upper hand and it was no surprise when Mbesuma took Isaac Chansa 's headed pass in his stride before firing home from close range .

But Ethiopia was not to be denied , and despite enduring a barrage of pressure , it fought back to equalize with 25 minutes remaining .

Substitute Addis Hintsa picked out Said and it was his pass which allowed captain Girma to fire home at the near post past Mweene to seal a point .

Mbesuma came close to stealing a winner for Zambia but coach Herve Renard admitted his team were fortunate not to lose following a disappointing display .

He told reporters : `` First of all I would like to congratulate Ethiopia for a very good performance .

`` I 'm not surprised -- I said be careful of this team , they are able to play very good football .

`` Today , we have to thank our goalkeeper -- without Kennedy Mweene it could have been a very , very bad result .

`` Our fans expected more than we did today , and they are right . Today , it was the fault of the coach . I did not prepare the team well to start the competition -- we 'll see how things go after the third game .

Nigeria held

`` All four teams have one point so everything is open , '' Burkina Faso coach Paul Put told reporters .
