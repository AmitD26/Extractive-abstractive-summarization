-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pete -LRB- Paul Rudd -RRB- , the floppy-haired hero of Judd Apatow 's winningly nimble and close-to-the-bone family-mishegoss comedy `` This Is 40 , '' is a married father of two in L.A. who escapes the frazzled swirl of his existence by engaging in deep , dark secret activities .

He eats chocolate cupcakes -- many , many more of them than his wife , Debbie -LRB- Leslie Mann -RRB- , a major nutritional scold , would suspect . And when he 's feeling beyond overwhelmed , he heads for the bathroom with his tablet to access ... his favorite porn site ? No , to play Internet Scrabble . It 's a sign of what his life has become that this is his notion of a grand escape , an oasis of me-time .

If neither of these jokes strikes an amused chord of recognition in you , then you may find `` This Is 40 '' to be mildly funny at best . But if they do resonate , you may chuckle , with knowing pleasure , throughout the movie .

'30 Rock ' wraps filming , tweets a photo

The comedies that put Apatow on the map -LRB- `` Knocked Up , '' `` The 40 Year-Old Virgin '' -RRB- took off from broadly italicized concepts , but `` This Is 40 '' lets you know in its title that it 's less about a concept than a state of being . Pete and Debbie were supporting characters in `` Knocked Up , '' and now they 're turning 40 , with two lovely daughters -LRB- nicely played by Apatow 's own daughters , Maude and Iris -RRB- and two crusty fathers -LRB- a terrific Albert Brooks and John Lithgow -RRB- , who each have young families of their own . The couple still love each other , but their relationship is a mess -- a whirlwind of fights , lies , negotiations , teamwork , good sex , bad sex , and general confusion .

The whole tone of the movie is spontaneous , rolling , experiential . It 's got some laugh-out-loud lines , especially when the two jump into the politics of Sadie 's middle school , or when Pete is dealing with the business he owns , a struggling boutique music label devoted to the white-guy indie rockers he grew up with and still thinks are cool . The joke is no one else does -- not even Graham Parker -LRB- playing a version of himself -RRB- , Pete 's latest relic-legend , who knows his records wo n't sell .

` Hobbit ' looks tough to beat at box office

That said , a lot of the best gags in `` This Is 40 '' are the ones that percolate between the lines . The comedy is there in how Pete leaps like a puppy to do his wife 's bidding , without realizing that he 's already in the doghouse for not having taken the initiative himself ; or in the way that Apatow never once stages a marital-therapy session -- but has Pete and Debbie lapse into the euphemisms of therapy-speak , even as it still sounds like they want to kill each other .

`` This Is 40 '' is n't always hilarious , but it 's ticklishly honest and droll about all the things being a parent can do to a relationship . And why it 's still worth it . A -
