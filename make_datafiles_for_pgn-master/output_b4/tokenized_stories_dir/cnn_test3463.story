Cairo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Outside Egypt 's top court in Cairo , protest leader Hussein Abdel Rahman wears a sash around his collared shirt emblazoned with a zucchini . The judiciary , he says , has transformed into what the green vegetable means in colloquial language : corruption , nepotism , favoritism .

An editorial cartoon in a Cairo daily sums up Egypt 's state of affairs : a scribbled mess of spirals .

And the presidential election this weekend , once hailed as Egypt 's big step toward democracy , is now satirized in an online mock-up of a video game pitting a bare-chested Ahmed Shafik , the last prime minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak , against the bearded Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood .

The runoff vote is taking place after the Supreme Constitutional Court declared the parliament invalid and triggered renewed chaos over the country 's leadership .

The ruling dealt a blow to the Muslim Brotherhood , which dominated parliament , and was victory for supporters of Shafik , the focus of protesters ' derision for his ties to the deposed dictator .

Anger festered Friday among those who feared that a hard-won revolution was fast unraveling ; that little had changed .

Rankled revolutionaries felt left out in the cold on a hot June day .

The dissolution of parliament gives the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces , or SCAF , full legislative and executive power alongside , it appears , a friendly judiciary .

`` SCAF has been suppressing our protests , suppressing the youth movements on the ground , '' said Wisam Mohamed . `` They have been arresting thousands of us . ''

Ahmed Maher , a founder of the April 6 Youth Movement , which played a prominent role in last year 's Tahrir Square uprising , called the ruling `` provocative . ''

The contentious verdict , he told the English language news website Ahram Online , will `` pave the way for the reanimation of the ousted Mubarak regime . ''

The court dissolved parliament after it had been in session for a little more that four months , saying that constitutional articles that regulated the parliamentary elections were invalid .

SCAF , which has been in control of the country since Mubarak 's ouster , claimed full legislative power .

Many view the move as a `` soft coup '' staged by Egypt 's powerful military , a move intended to diminish the power of the Islamists , who have long been held under the military 's microscope .

The court ruling was `` a complete coup d'etat through which the military council is writing off the most noble stage in the nation 's history , '' said Mohamed el-Beltagy , a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood 's Freedom and Justice Party .

Sally Toma , a member of the Revolution Youth Coalition , blamed the Islamists for what happened .

`` The parliament only served the Islamists , who dominated it , '' she told Ahram .

She said the Brotherhood stood against the idea of creating a presidential council mandated with powers of administration until a new constitution could be drawn up .

`` Legislative powers have been transferred to the SCAF because of the Brotherhoods ' selfishness , '' she said . `` They made us lose the revolution , and they lost everything . ''

After the ruling , speculation rose that Morsi , the Brotherhood 's candidate , would pull out now that his party 's pillar of power had crumbled . But Morsi said he will stay in the running , though the notion of carrying on a vote under the circumstances seemed absurd to some .

In the absence of a parliament , the winner of the runoff vote will be put in a position of dealing directly with Egypt 's military leaders , a reason for SCAF to postpone the elections , said Mohamed ElBaradei , a 2005 Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose own presidential bid failed .

`` Electing president in the absence of constitution and parliament is electing an 'em peror ' with more powers than deposed dictator . A travesty , '' he tweeted Friday .

Gamal Mahmoud hoped the election process would proceed peacefully .

`` And I hope that the voter chooses the person who will achieve the goals of the revolution , '' he said .

The streets of Cairo were calm early Friday , but everyone braced for Tahrir Square to erupt with anger . Already , protesters were amassing in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria .

The April 6 Movement took to Facebook to motivate protesters .

`` We are now back at the crossroads and perhaps at the point of zero . Martial law under the disguise of legality , '' it said .

`` The Muslim Brotherhood proved beyond a reasonable doubt that they are incapable of understanding history , refuse to learn from their mistakes , and have a level of arrogance that makes them unable to accept advice . ''

The unease was palpable on Twitter as well .

`` So now we have a country with no constitution , no parliament , no president . And military police in checkpoints and around parliament ! Ummm , '' wrote @TheBigPharaoh .

Wael Ghonim , the former Google executive who attained fame after being arrested during the uprising , said : `` The only thing that will make us go back to living in fear , oppression and silence is a time machine -- they have n't invented that yet . ''

Many Egyptians , emboldened to speak their minds now more than ever , felt alienated by both the Muslim Brotherhood and their other choice : a remnant of the old regime .

`` Both choices are unacceptable to me , '' said Ahmed Maher , a civil servant . `` I will be boycotting . ''

University student Ibrahim Gamal Al-Din has become an online sensation with his satirical music videos . In one , he takes aim at the Muslim Brotherhood .

`` This is our country , but you were all sleeping , '' he sings . `` We took parliament and the constitutional assembly , and we 'll take the presidency , too . And if you do n't like it , you can go to hell . ''

Humor has long been a form of dissent in Egypt , Ibrahim says . Whenever things get tense , he says , Egyptians try to cope by making fun .

But the rumblings Friday were not all funny . It was clear many Egyptians had had enough .

Wait until the sun goes down , tweeted an activist . The small gathering at Tahrir will get stronger .

But by the time evening came , the air filled with uncertainty , though not much had transpired in the iconic square .

CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported from Cairo and Moni Basu from Atlanta . CNN 's Ivan Watson and Tracy Doueiry contributed to this report .
