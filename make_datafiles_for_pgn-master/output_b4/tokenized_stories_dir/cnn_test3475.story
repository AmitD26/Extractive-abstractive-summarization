BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least 20 people were killed and 30 wounded in a double suicide bombing Thursday in northern Iraq , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said .

Houses are left in ruins earlier this week after truck bombings in the northern Iraqi village of al-Khazna .

Two suicide bombers with explosive vests carried out the attack at a cafe in Sinjar , a town west of Mosul .

Later Thursday , two people were killed and 13 were wounded in a motorcycle bombing in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood of southern Baghdad , an Interior Ministry official said .

In Sinjar , many townspeople are members of the Yazidi minority , an ancient religious sect that has been the target of previous attacks in Iraq .

In August 2007 , More than 400 people died and at least 300 were injured when suicide truck bombers struck predominantly Yazidi villages , a series of attacks that rank among the deadliest in Iraq 's ongoing violence .

The Yazidi sect is a mainly Kurdish minority , an ancient group that worships seven angels , in the form of peacocks , who its followers believe are subordinate to the supreme god who created the universe .

Thursday 's attack is at least the second this week apparently targeting ethnic minorities in northern Iraq .

On Monday , two truck bombs destroyed 32 homes , killing 30 people and burying others in the rubble , officials said .

The bombs targeted al-Khazna village , which is inhabited by a Shiite Shabak ethnic group . The village is an area disputed between Kurds and Arabs .

CNN 's Yousif Bassil in Baghdad contributed to this report .
