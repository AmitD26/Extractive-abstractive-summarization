San Diego , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For me , the issue of skyrocketing gasoline prices came into focus about four years ago , when the national average that Americans paid at the pump reached an all-time high of $ 4.11 a gallon . Today , the average -- up 30 cents in the last four weeks , and 13 cents in the last week alone -- is about $ 3.70 .

In the summer of 2008 , I pulled up next to a gas pump off a major highway in Southern California where -- apparently , a few minutes earlier -- a recreational vehicle , which held more than 100 gallons , had stopped to fill up . The price was still on the screen : $ 500 .

Can you imagine paying $ 500 to put gas in your vehicle ? For many of us , that 's more like a monthly car payment .

But for those who live in Southern California -- where the car is king , public transit is spotty and the carpool lane is almost always underused -- even a tab that size hardly raises an eyebrow . At the gas station closest to my home in San Diego , a gallon of gas is going for about $ 3.49 , and a full tank costs me about $ 65 . I shell that out three or four times a month . Prices are sky high in Los Angeles .

With the average price here expected to reach as much as $ 5 a gallon by Memorial Day , it 's not surprising to see more commuters jammed onto trains and hear that more of your friends are trying to work from home a few days a week .

Although my friends on the East Coast like to think they have it easier with more options for public transportation , it 's a mistake for people to assume that higher gas prices do n't affect them . It 's not about geography . We 're all in this together . Have you noticed the price of groceries lately , as those companies that operate delivery trucks have to spend more to stack food on supermarket shelves ? So you do n't own a car . Maybe you take the subway to work . Swell . But if you have a mouth , and occasionally like to fill it with food , high gas prices should be hard to swallow .

Meanwhile , political leaders -- in both parties -- need to fill up on courage and common sense in order to work on a solution . President Obama was right to say recently that there is little a chief executive can do about gas prices . That said , presidential candidates should stop promising otherwise . At the moment , our politicians seem to be running low on ideas and yet overflowing with an eagerness to exploit the uptick in prices for their own political benefit .

Newt Gingrich is promising lower prices . He also pledges that , if elected president , he wo n't bow before a Saudi king .

So what ? What does that have to do with anything , beyond political rhetoric ? At the moment , our main concern -- and certainly that of our one true friend and ally in the Middle East , Israel -- is n't Saudi Arabia but Iran .

As part of a small group of Latino journalists who visited Israel last month , I was reminded by Israeli officials in one briefing after another that -- were Iran to build a nuclear weapon -- the entire world would change . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad could block the Strait of Hormuz and the rest of the world would be too frightened to do anything about it . That 's what we should be worried about , not whether U.S. presidents bow before the Saudis .

It also would n't hurt to pay more attention to oil reserves in this hemisphere . Mexico is a major producer , and a friend and ally . The relationship between the United States and Mexico is n't perfect ; tensions recur over immigration , drugs and trade . Each country has an annoying habit of blaming the other for its problems .

But it 's a strong marriage that will endure . Instead of chanting `` Drill , baby , drill , '' more of our leaders should be saying : `` Hola amigo . '' The U.S. government should increase oil imports from Mexico . Not only is it better to deal with friends than adversaries , it 's also a good way to help the Mexican government fund its war against the drug cartels -- a battle that is , let 's not forget , fueled by another one of our addictions .

Granted , in order for the United States to increase oil imports from Mexico , our neighbor may have to increase production . That 's a slippery situation . Mexico nationalized the oil industry in the 20th century and foreign companies are prohibited from drilling . But that resistance seems to be weakening .

Mexico 's national oil company has allowed some private contracts and says its mature fields , which produce just 12,000 barrels of oil per day , could produce up to 220 million barrels of oil . We can have that conversation . And let 's face it , the United States would rather work through that issue than work with countries that are hostile to Americans .

Look at the polls , and you 'll see that one of the major reasons everyday Americans think we need to become more energy self-sufficient and develop a better strategy for importing oil is that they 're leery of becoming too dependent on countries in the Middle East that are often unwelcoming , undemocratic and unstable . After all , no matter how much we love our cars and need our gasoline , few things are scarier than breaking down in a bad neighborhood .
