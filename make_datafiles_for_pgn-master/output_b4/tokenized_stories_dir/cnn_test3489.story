-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An explosion outside a police station in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on Saturday morning caused severe damage to the building , said the state news agency , LANA .

No casualties were reported in the early morning attack , which shattered several weeks of relative calm for the city 's residents .

Over the past year , Benghazi , the birthplace of Libya 's 2011 revolution , has been the scene of multiple attacks targeting security forces . Many of the attacks have been blamed on Islamist militants .

On Friday evening , armed men attacked the headquarters of a government-affiliated militia in the city of Derna , about 120 miles -LRB- 200 kilometers -RRB- east of Benghazi , killing one of its members , LANA reported .

After the attack , a car bomb with more than 50 kilograms of explosives was found and defused , the news agency said .

Western intelligence sources believe that Islamist militant groups some with links to al Qaeda are active in and around Derna .

Earlier in the week , a car bomb carrying a large amount of explosives detonated outside the French Embassy in Tripoli , injuring two French security guards and a Libyan girl .

There has been no claim of responsibility for Tuesday 's attack .

After the French military intervention in Mali in January , there were fears militants could strike French interests in the region , including Libya , which has been struggling to impose security across the country since the 2011 revolution that ousted Moammar Gadhafi .

Libyan officials said an investigation was under way to determine who carried out the attack on the embassy . The bomb also damaged surrounding buildings in a residential part of the capital .

A team of French investigators has been in the Libyan capital collecting evidence and investigating the bombing .

The French Embassy bombing followed a series of attacks last year that targeted foreign diplomatic missions and the International Committee of the Red Cross in Benghazi .

The attacks are believed to have been the work of Islamist extremist groups with ties to al Qaeda .

Last September , U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a militant attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi .

After Tuesday 's bombing , the first targeting a foreign diplomatic mission in Tripoli , Libyan officials said security would be increased around such facilities .

The high level of unease was evident when a bomb threat at a cultural event Friday evening led to its cancellation and the evacuation of the foreign diplomats in attendance .

The Libya Movie Awards , an event organized by the European Union , the Italian Cultural Institute and the Libyan nongovernmental organization 1 Libya , was being held at a theater adjacent to the Radisson Blu Hotel in central Tripoli .

In a news release on Saturday , organizers said they `` regret to announce the decision to postpone the First Edition of the Libya Movie Awards -LRB- LMA -RRB- in light of yesterday evening 's security threat . ''

The statement said the rest of the events scheduled for Saturday and Sunday have been postponed until further notice `` while insecurity persists ''

A management source at the Radisson Blu Hotel told CNN the hotel did not receive any threats and was functioning as normal on Saturday .

A security official told the Libyan state news agency that security precautions were taken Friday after a member of the security forces guarding the hotel received a call from an unidentified person saying there was a car bomb in the vicinity .

The official said security measures were taken immediately and the report appeared to be `` baseless . ''
