-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Slovenia 's Tina Maze was crowned World Cup overall champion Sunday -- landing the coveted Crystal Globe with fully nine events of the season still remaining .

Maze 's victory in the super-combined at Meribel was her eighth of a remarkable season and meant she could not be caught by her nearest rival Maria Hoefl-Riesch .

Germany 's Hoefl-Riesch fell in the slalom section of the super-combi as Maze recorded an aggregate time of one minute 59.54 seconds .

Maze had been fastest in the opening downhill on a shortened course after heavy overnight snow at the French resort and made no mistake on her slalom run . .

Austrian pair Nicole Hosp and Michaela Kirchgasser finished second and third at 0.82 and 0.90 seconds .

The 29-year-old Maze has achieved 1,844 points across all races in all alpine skiing 's disciplines , finishing on the podium 18 times in a season marked by incredible consistency .

She is almost certain to break through the 2,000 point barrier by the end of the season , a feat only once achieved by Austria 's Hermann Maier in the 1999-2000 season .

Maze also won the super-G gold at the recent world championships in Schladming in Austria and claimed two silvers in the super-combined and giant slalom .

She succeeds American Lindsey Vonn as overall champion . Vonn has been sidelined for the season after a nasty fall in super-G at the world championships .

Maze is not resting on her laurels and is targeting the individual discipline crowns in a triumphant year .

`` I will stay focused and try to get all the globes possible and most important to keep that high level of performance until the end of the World Cup season '' , she told the official FIS website .

Meanwhile , Austria 's Marcel Hirscher increased his advantage in the battle for the men 's overall World Cup title with second place in the giant slalom at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany .

Hirscher finished 0.60 seconds behind France 's Alexis Pinturault , who was claiming his first World Cup win in the discipline .

Triple world champion Ted Ligety of the United States finished third after making crucial mistakes on his first run .

Ligety , who claimed the giant slalom title in Schladming , was only fifth going into the second leg and could not make up the deficit .

`` I 'll try and take all the points I can get , I do n't think about the globes yet , '' Hirscher told the official FIS website , but with his nearest rival , world downhill champion Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway only sixth , he has a 209 point lead in the overall standings .
