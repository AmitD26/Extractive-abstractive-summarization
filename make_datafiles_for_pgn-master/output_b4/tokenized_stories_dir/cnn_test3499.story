-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- The eternal wait for a return journey to Pandora continues . But `` Avatar '' fans , just know that James Cameron is hard at work on the script that will follow up his 2009 sci-fi mega-blockbuster .

Cameron , the writer-director-producer of reigning box office champion `` Avatar , '' recently talked with the website Play Goes Strong , revealing that he 's currently in New Zealand working on writing `` Avatar 2 '' and `` Avatar 3 . '' `` I 'm writing on a little farm . When you live in a special world like Pandora , you have to live in that world , '' he said .

`` There is that startup torque where you feel it 's coming to you , '' Cameron said of his work on the scripts . `` Then you build up momentum . That 's when it gets fun . The characters talk and it 's writing itself . I 'm almost there right now . It 's building fast . ''

Cameron also recalled a recent conversation with `` The Hobbit '' and `` Lord of the Rings '' director Peter Jackson . `` You had it easy dude , '' Cameron told him . `` You had the books when you did the second and third Lord of the Rings . I have to create my own books in my head and extract a script from it . ''

As Cameron is tasked with creating the follow-up to a film that took the world by storm three years ago and broke his own previous record for highest-grossing movie ever , one would of course think he 's feeling an incredible amount of pressure right now . Not so , said Cameron :

`` Pressure ? No . It 's a little daunting because sequels are always tricky . You have to be surprising and stay ahead of audience anticipation . At the same time , you have to massage their feet with things that they know and love about the first film . I 've walked that line in the past , so I 'm not too worried about it . At the same time , I definitely have to deliver the goods . ''

But how long is all this isolation on this ranch going to take ? No update on that or how long Cameron expects production on the sequels to take .

`` As for a release date that will be determined by when I get the script out , '' he said .
