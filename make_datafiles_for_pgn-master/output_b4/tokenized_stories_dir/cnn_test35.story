Las Vegas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- To break out beyond the personal computer market in the U.S. , Lenovo Group will need a little help from its friends .

Lenovo has operated as a lone wolf in China , where the company is based , by building hardware that runs its uniquely designed software . At the International Consumer Electronics show this week , Lenovo launched a cloud service in China , similar to Apple 's iCloud , that will keep all of its devices in sync .

The company will take a different approach , however , when it expands in the U.S. , Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing said in an interview here .

`` We can not do everything by ourselves , '' Yuanqing said . The U.S. market is `` more challenging than in China because we have to rely on somebody else 's ecosystem . So we have to find the right partner here . ''

Lenovo expects to continue using Microsoft 's Windows on its computers , and Google 's Android on its tablets and smartphones , Yuanqing said . Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft may try to court the Chinese electronics giant to help with its U.S. mobile efforts , however .

In the U.S. , Lenovo is barely a top-five PC manufacturer , but it 's a solid No. 2 globally . Its trio of tablets , which are all based on Android , have n't sold particularly well in the United States .

Lenovo Group has grown significantly in the U.S. in the last few years thanks to its aggressive pricing and the 2005 acquisition of International Business Machines ' PC division , which has catapulted Lenovo 's sales to corporations .

U.S. retailers have suggested that Lenovo should price its computers $ 50 below competitors ' comparable systems , advice the company has heeded because it has n't achieved a strong brand in America , Yuanqing said . Pinching pennies delays the U.S. expansion because Lenovo ca n't accumulate enough profit to fund development in other areas like smartphones or TVs , he said .

`` The priority for today is to succeed in the PC area , '' Yuanqing said . `` We have invested a lot in this area , and also we have seen hyper-growth in this area . But we have not made money from the consumer PC area . So we can not afford to invest more in different , other categories . ''

At Lenovo 's CES news conference , Yuanqing discussed `` the four-screen strategy , '' but in the U.S. , it only sells two of those screens .

Lenovo and Sony , which has long been a proponent of selling multiple devices , define the four primary screens in the consumer electronics world as the PC , smartphone , tablet and television .

In the United States , Lenovo only sells computers and tablets . Sony sells all four in many countries and has been deploying software to tie them all seamlessly together .

Lenovo will release its fourth screen , a connected TV set , in China . It has gotten some buzz because its software is based on the latest version of Android , heavily modified by Lenovo 's programmers , rather than on Google TV . On Lenovo 's platforms , Google does not have the ability to control content in the way it does on a Google TV set , like those made by Samsung , Sony and Vizio .

Before it brings a TV or phone to the United States , Lenovo will focus on improving its brand through PCs , and on building relationships with U.S. cellular carriers and retailers , Yuanqing said .
