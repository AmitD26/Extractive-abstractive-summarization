-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- To the rest of the world , Sweden seems to represent all that is enviably European . Scandinavia 's largest country has a reputation for being stylish , progressive and glacially cool -- in short , everything the Eurovision Song Contest is not .

So it may come as a surprise to some to learn that the Swedes take the annual song competition -- occasionally viewed by some of their neighbors as a bit of a joke -- very seriously indeed .

Unlike in many other western European countries , the privilege of representing Sweden at the annual contest is hotly contested , through a grueling series of televised heats which have grown to become more popular than Eurovision itself .

Melodifestivalen , a six-week , `` American Idol '' - style TV series in which established acts compete against unknowns for the honor of representing Sweden , has broken every local ratings record . Nearly half of the country 's 9.4 million people tuned in to this year 's final .

`` Melodifestivalens is the Swedish equivalent to the Superbowl , '' said Per Blankens who produced the TV show in 2006 and 2007 .

`` No other TV show gets the Swedes so rallied up . People put on dinner parties just so they can watch it together . They even get dressed up for the occasion . ''

Forgettable song , memorable outfit : The crazy clothes of Eurovision

The show has proven an invigorating force for the Swedish music industry , reviving old pop careers , launching new ones and selling thousands of records and concert tickets in the process .

But why do the Swedes , often viewed as cool , collected tastemakers , get so worked up about a contest widely seen as having little musical credibility ?

Proud tradition

`` A lot of people do n't know this , but Swedes are obsessed with music , '' said Blankens , who followed his stint on Melodifestivalen -LRB- Melody Festival -RRB- by producing the Swedish version of American Idol .

`` Not only are all the most popular TV shows in Sweden music-related , but choral singing is the second most popular pastime after sports . It 's only natural for us to get worked up about a music competition . ''

That love of music has translated to a long history of Eurovision success , with the most wins in the competition after Ireland -LRB- seven -RRB- , France , Luxembourg and the UK -LRB- five each -RRB- . The Netherlands has also won four times .

The love affair began when ABBA won the 1974 contest with their hit `` Waterloo , '' launching them on their way to becoming Eurovision 's greatest success story and one of the biggest-selling pop bands of all time .

The Swedish entry this year , `` Euphoria '' by Loreen , was the bookies ' favorite to follow in their footsteps and duly delivered success at the 57th Eurovision , in Baku , Azerbaijan .

The tradition of success has seen many Swedes grow up with `` Melodifestivalen '' and Eurovision as annual fixtures in their households .

`` Watching Eurovision is a national tradition in Sweden , '' said Maria Akesson , 28 , a motion graphics student from Stockholm . `` When I was a kid it was the only night , apart from New Year 's Eve , that my parents would allow me to stay up past midnight and let me eat as much crisps and candy as I liked . ''

Even as an adult , Eurovision remains a big occasion . `` I watch it with my friends and there 's always someone who will organize a house party where we 'll cook strange dishes from all the different countries and bet money on what song will win . People usually take the betting really seriously but we add silly categories like the worst outfit or the worst song . ''

`` Melodifestivalen '' 's timing -- screening on Saturday nights for six weeks in the middle of the country 's famously gloomy winters -- is seen as another reason for its enduring appeal .

`` Sweden in the winter is very dark and can be quite depressing . When ` Melodifestivalen ' starts airing in February we 're in the middle of this season , but every week leading up to the final is a week closer to spring , '' said Sebastian Hjalmarsson Downey-Clark , a self-confessed Eurovision addict who works in London as a primary school teacher .

`` It 's almost as if ` Melodifestivalen ' is the vessel that carries Sweden from the dark of winter to the light of summer , and soundtracks that journey with some awfully catchy music too . ''

Reviving the contest

`` Melodifestivalen '' is nearly as old as Eurovision itself , having run almost every year since 1959 . But it was n't always such a polished affair .

`` In the 1990s the competition was struggling . There were n't enough good artists wanting to take part so it was decided that something radical needed to happen , '' said Christer Bjorkman , a former hairdresser who won `` Melodifestivalen '' in 1992 .

So in 2002 , he oversaw the transformation of the contest from one-off contest between ten songs into a six-week pop marathon featuring 32 . The ultimate winner is decided by a combination of public vote and a jury that consists of Swedish industry experts , and Eurovision judges from 11 other countries .

The new format , featuring knock-out semi-finals held in cities across Sweden , was a smash hit , and Bjorkman has been involved in the production of every contest since . Today he is known as `` Mr Melodifestivalen . ''

`` Taking the show on the road was incredibly important to its success as it galvanized local support , '' he said . `` Equally as important was the fact that the audience now have weeks to familiarize themselves with all the songs . They form emotional attachments to the songs and , ultimately , also the winner -- which is one of the reasons why so many Swedes still care about how we do in Eurovision . ''

The resulting surge of interest in `` Melodifestivalen '' sees thousands of songs submitted to the contest each year , and has been a boon to the Swedish music industry . `` It 's a goldmine for artists and songwriters that do well in the competition , as they go on to sell thousands of records and sell out tours across Scandinavia , '' said Blankens .

Bjorkman agrees . `` The competition is enormously important for the Swedish music industry because not only does it launch new careers and revives old ones , it sells a lot of albums too , '' he said . `` From winter until spring , our songs occupy the charts . The final was in March , but four of our songs are still in the top ten . ''

` Why not try ? '

The Swedes are very aware that not every country shares their infatuation with Eurovision .

`` Big countries who take themselves quite seriously -- like Britain and France -- do n't really want to compete against all these tiny nations on the European periphery in some silly music competition , '' said Blankens . `` They think it 's beneath them , so they keep sending bad songs that never win . ''

But given the benefits to Sweden 's music industry from the country 's Eurovision obsession , perhaps the question should n't be why does Sweden care , but why do n't others ?

`` Ultimately you get what you give , '' said Bjorkman . `` In countries like the UK they do n't give much -- in fact they keep changing the format of the national try-outs each year . It 's no wonder the public has lost interest in ... Eurovision . ''

`` Melodifestivalen '' 's success owes much to the Swedish tendency not to `` do things by half measures , '' he said . `` When we decided to revive ` Melodifestivalen , ' our aim was to create an amazing and engaging TV program that would benefit not only us as broadcasters , but the music industry and the viewers as well . I 'm very proud to say that we have succeeded in doing just that . ''
