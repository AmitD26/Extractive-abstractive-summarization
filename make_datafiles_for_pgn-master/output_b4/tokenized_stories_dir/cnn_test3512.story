-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bizarre and suicidal actions of Arizona shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner have pushed a federal appeals panel to reverse an earlier decision and allow authorities to force him to take anti-psychotic medication .

The three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco had ruled on July 12 that Loughner can refuse anti-psychotic medication .

But since that ruling , Loughner , who has been diagnosed as schizophrenic , has deteriorated , prosecutors said .

He 's had screaming and crying fits that last hours , he has harmed himself and claims that the radio was inserting thoughts into his head , prosecutors said .

Loughner has also expressed `` regret for the circumstances that led to his arrest , '' prosecutors wrote in court documents .

When asked whether he had thoughts of harming himself , Loughner said : `` I want to die . Give me the injection . Kill me now , '' court documents said .

Authorities placed Loughner on suicide watch and prosecutors argued in court documents that he would continue to deteriorate and could become more dangerous if he continues to refuse the drugs .

The judges released a ruling Friday that allowed authorities to force him to take the medication .

Loughner is charged with killing six people -- including the chief federal judge of Arizona , John Roll -- in a supermarket parking lot in Tucson , Arizona , on January 8 .

Among the 13 people wounded was U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , D-Arizona , who was shot in the head .

The suspect is being held in a federal mental hospital after an earlier court ruling found him incompetent to stand trial .

His attorneys have argued that forcing him to take strong drugs violates his rights .

Administering the anti-psychotic drugs was more about restoring his competency for trial rather than dealing with his behavior , his attorneys said in court filings .
