New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Family heirlooms are often packed away for safe keeping . For one man from China , hiding a 26-carat black diamond worth $ 14.5 million was not in his plans .

A businessman from Hong Kong commissioned craftsman Stuart Hughes of Liverpool to help him show off his family treasure .

The result ? An iPhone 5 boasted by Hughes to be `` the world 's most expensive phone , '' valued at $ 15 million .

According to Hughes ' website , this iPhone includes 600 flawless white diamonds , a full solid gold dressing and 53 diamonds on the rear that make up the iconic Apple logo .

However , the reason this particular iPhone is so valuable is on the face of the phone .

The Chinese businessman , identified only as `` Joe , '' contacted Hughes and asked to have a rare , black diamond incorporated into the iPhone .

`` It 's not often that people get to deal with a very , very rare diamond , '' Hughes said .

Hughes said he was contacted 18 months ago by Joe , who expressed interest in his gold chassis iPhone handsets .

Joe then told Hughes about the black diamond that had been in his family for generations . Hughes spent nine weeks creating the solid gold chassis of an iPhone 5 and then placed the black diamond as the home button .

The appraisal Joe had done on the black diamond put its value at approximately $ 14.5 million , according to Hughes , who said he saw the certificate of authenticity .

Hughes told CNN that one of the solid gold handsets with the diamonds that he crafts is worth approximately $ 153,000 .

`` We had a tech guy in Macau who was able to set the stone , which to this day has never left China , '' Hughes said .

Hughes set a record in 2011 for crafting an iPhone 4S with 500 individual diamonds , totaling more than 100 carats . That phone was estimated to be valued at $ 9 million .

The 42-year-old craftsman is known for making lavish and expensive items , including an iPad made of solid gold he debuted two years ago .

`` I am a craftsman , '' Hughes said . `` I basically fulfill and make up these ideas . ''

Throughout the years and his many projects , Hughes said this particular handset is right up near the top of the most lavish projects he 's completed .
