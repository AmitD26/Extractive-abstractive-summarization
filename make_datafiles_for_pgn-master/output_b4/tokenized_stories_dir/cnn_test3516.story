-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Every third Monday in January we gather as Americans to commemorate the values and beliefs -- as well as the ultimate sacrifice -- of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. .

His tireless advocacy for civil rights , equal protection under the law , labor rights , and for the ultimate realization of our essential creed that we are `` one nation , endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness '' is taught in every school in America , and is now enshrined in a memorial on the National Mall .

Dr. King believed so strongly not only in these values , but also in the moral imperative to heed the `` fierce urgency of now . '' He knew that in the face of injustice no moral man or woman can stay silent -- and he paid for it with his life .

He was a `` drum major for justice '' He inspired us -- not just with his eloquent sermons , rich in purpose ; or his speeches , inspiring and provocative -- but he challenged us with his dream , his daring imagination : to see an America where all of God 's children would be equal ; all of God 's children would have a seat at the table .

Dr. King , along with other men and women of his generation did not just see the barriers . They believed in the opportunities that could be realized if we could just move beyond racial inequality and injustice .

He truly believed that we had to `` take the first step in faith , even when you do n't see the whole staircase . '' Just take the first step .

I 've written and spoken about Dr. King many times , but this year , one area of his crusade seems particularly worthy of remembrance : the fight for the ballot .

Prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , African-Americans and many others faced regular and malicious restrictions to the free exercise of their constitutionally protected right to vote , especially in my native South .

Literacy tests , poll taxes , and grandfather clauses : many insidious techniques were used by certain states to restrict , confuse , and write off , marginalize and disenfranchise so many eligible citizens from voting simply because of the color of their skin .

Southern governors and those in Washington comfortable with the status quo hid behind arguments about `` states rights . '' Yet these laws were little more than legislated racism and all knew the real goal behind their unequal effects .

In a 1957 speech titled `` Give Us The Ballot , '' Dr. King spoke plainly about the imperative of equal voting rights .

`` So long as I do not firmly and irrevocably possess the right to vote I do not possess myself . I can not make up my mind â € '' it is made up for me . I can not live as a democratic citizen , observing the laws I have helped to enact â € '' I can only submit to the edict of others . ''

For Dr. King , the right to vote was sacrosanct and foundational . It is the very essence of our social contract . Free elections create legitimacy . They imply the consent of the governed . He knew that unfair elections laws did not just hurt minorities or the working poor , they rendered hollow the very essence of American government .

It 's a message that 's as true today as it was then . The 47-year old Voting Rights Act has stood the test of time , but there are new obstacles to the ballot springing up in today 's America .

Around the country , conservatives in state legislatures are attempting to put fresh roadblocks in the path of this most basic right . The latest vogue in anti-suffrage legislation is mandatory photo ID laws .

From Tennessee to Texas , from Wisconsin to Pennsylvania , conservative Republicans and their allies are implementing laws that undermine , even flout , the Voting Rights Act .

The Justice Department has begun to challenge these laws , opposing new efforts in South Carolina and Florida . Laws in other states that have deep histories of discrimination , such as Texas and Mississippi , are also being examined . But many states , refusing to pass neutrally applicable laws , have vowed instead to sue the federal government in court .

These laws disproportionately impact minority communities -- groups much more likely than white voters to lack photo identification for reasons as simple as the fact that they may not own a car and use the city bus to get to work .

According a study published in 2006 by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law , as many as 23 million American citizens -- that 's 11 % of those of voting age -- lack the government-issued photo ID many of these laws demand .

Keep in mind , this is not just a racial issue . Older Americans are less likely to have these IDs , as are lower-income Americans . College students , who already face challenges based on their seasonal residency , will face an even greater burden than they did previously .

Dr. King demanded that all Americans be given the ballot . We must demand today that we keep it . Demand to keep the ballot because our laws must be made by all of us . Demand to keep the ballot because an election where 23 million ca n't vote is an election that undermines democracy .
