-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For the better part of four years , voters have said the No. 1 issue is the economy .

For the past year , the economy has been the GOP 's primary point of attack against President Obama .

For months , the economy and job creation has been Mitt Romney 's calling card .

So now that the president has stepped out and voiced support for marriage equality , we 're going to see if the economy and jobs remain the top issue or if the direction of this election has been permanently altered by Obama 's historic remarks .

Remember , Republicans characterized the war on women as a Democratic strategy to divert attention from the `` real issue '' of the economy . Over the next couple of days , we 'll see if the GOP will be as dismissive with gay rights . Or will the fact that in 2004 , George W. Bush successfully used discrimination against the gay-lesbian-bisexual-transgender -LRB- GLBT -RRB- community to motivate his base be too juicy a strategy for Romney and the gang to pass up ?

Keep in mind that a CNN/ORC International poll taken in late March showed gay rights was tied for dead last in what voters felt was the most important issue , so if the GOP does try to use Obama 's remarks as weapons against him , there is a good chance the rhetoric will fall on deaf ears . Perhaps Romney said it best himself , during a big primary night victory speech in April : `` It 's still about the economy and we 're not stupid . ''

But it 's Romney speaking , and he 's never been married to any position for very long -- pun intended .

In 1994 , when he referred to himself as a moderate , Romney told the Log Cabin Republicans -- a GLBT organization -- that he 'd be better than Sen. Ted Kennedy on gay rights . Wednesday , he reiterated his views in his latest incarnation as a conservative by saying that he 's against marriage equality and civil unions . So whether or not Romney actually stays focused on the economy is anyone 's guess .

This probably explains why Obama holds double-digit leads over Romney on likeability , honesty , confidence , values and leadership -- and that was before Obama 's courageous interview with Robin Roberts on ABC 's `` Good Morning America . ''

Even in the one area where on paper Romney has significant credibility -- the economy -- 44 % of voters believe the president will do a better job , while 42 % prefer Romney , according to a CNN poll . If Romney ca n't get any more traction from his calling card , nor a boost from his vice presidental selection , there is the possibility the economy will take a backseat to gay rights in his campaign .

Assuming of course , it has n't already .

I guess we 'll have to wait and see what kind of ads begin to emerge and what he says on the trail once the initial dust has settled .

But what is clear is that President Obama is no coward .

Critics can question the timing of his remarks but the reality is , he did n't have to state his support for marriage equality before the election .

Even with reporters dogging him at every news conference because of the remarks on same-sex marriage made by Vice President Joe Biden over the weekend , all Obama had to say was `` I 'm getting there '' and we would 've moved on . But in embracing a view most assumed he had anyway , Obama places his core convictions ahead of political expediency . That 's very rare to see in an election year .

What he did took a great deal of courage , especially considering that a recent Gallup poll showed 48 % of Americans are against same-sex marriages and that North Carolina , a swing state he barely won four years ago , just voted against marriage equality and civil unions , with a vote of 61 % to 39 % .

But because of that , Obama further separates himself from his opponent -- whose biggest weakness has been his perceived lack of conviction about matters of importance -- and moves closer to the Abraham Lincoln , FDR , John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson realm of presidents : Men who risked a great deal personally to move the country forward socially . And given the fact that he can point to the 12 consecutive months of job losses before taking office and the 26 consecutive months -LRB- and counting -RRB- of job growth since 2010 , there 's no reason to believe the economy will cease to be his campaign 's top focus .

As it should be .

We 'll find out if the GOP agrees .
