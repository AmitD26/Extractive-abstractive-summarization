-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` A nation 's joy , a husband 's nerves , '' exclaimed Britain 's Daily Mail newspaper , as it contrasted Prince William 's anxious wait at his pregnant wife 's bedside with the excitement generated by news of her impending motherhood .

The revelation that Catherine , the Duchess of Cambridge , was pregnant came after she was admitted to hospital in London on Monday afternoon suffering acute morning sickness .

The newspaper said the royal couple had hoped to keep their baby news under wraps until Christmas Day , when she had passed the 12-week mark in her pregnancy .

`` Kate expectations , '' declared popular British tabloid , The Sun , with an article detailing the treatment that Catherine , 30 , was receiving for hyperemesis gravidarum , a condition that causes more severe nausea and vomiting than typical morning sickness .

The newspaper said even senior royals , including Queen Elizabeth II , were taken by surprise as the couple had yet to break the news to family .

The Sun 's graphics department produced composite images of what they speculated the royal baby would look like as a baby of either gender , while the Mail ran mock-ups created by a U.S. forensic artist imagining how the child might look as a young boy or girl .

The Times also led with news of Catherine 's hospital dash , splashing a picture across its front page of a concerned William leaving London 's King Edward VII hospital last night . The paper also joined the rush of feverish debate about the future royal 's sex , potential name and position in the royal line of succession .

Boy or girl , the new baby will be third in line to the throne , behind William and his father , Prince Charles , who will become a grandfather for the first time . The Times explained that an imminent change to the law means that if Catherine has a girl , the child will make history by being the first British princess not to suffer discrimination because of her sex .

UK tabloid the Daily Express , in a `` royal souvenir special '' edition , ran a piece speculating that it was more likely that Catherine was carrying a girl , or twins , citing research that linked those outcomes to morning sickness .

Bookmakers also look set for a royal bonanza , with Victoria , Frances and Mary among the frontrunners for the most likely girl 's name , though the odds that William 's first-born child will be named after his late mother , Diana , Princess of Wales , have been judged at between 9-1 and 12-1 , The Times said .

However , Elizabeth is the hot favorite at 8-1 , according to leading British bookmaker Ladbrokes . Brooklyn and Chardonnay were listed as long shots by bookmakers .

Ladbrokes has Charles and John at 10-1 when it comes to boy 's names , but Harry , the name of the baby 's uncle , is a distinct outsider at 33-1 .

Bookmakers are also taking bets on the baby 's hair color , with one offering brown at 6-4 and red at 8-1 , and another offering odds on the likelihood of an albino royal baby .

Bookmakers were also taking bets on the child 's birth weight , and the identity of the godparents .

As expected , the name game is a white-hot pastime on social media , with #royalbabynames and #royalbaby among the biggest trending hashtags on Twitter . Among the more amusing suggestions were Cheryl and Jedward , reflecting Britain 's recent obsession with television talent shows .

Twitter was also a popular destination for celebrities and public figures alike to voice their happiness at the news . British Prime Minister David Cameron was swift to offer his congratulations .

Businessman Richard Branson joined the well wishers .

Former Wimbledon tennis champ Boris Becker tweeted a picture of himself giving two thumbs up with a message of congratulations .

The news prompted responses from U.S. celebrities as well , with reality TV star Kim Kardashian tweeting her delight at the reports .

News of the royal baby also grabbed column inches internationally .

`` Royal baby a bonus for special editions , '' declared The Australian , as it predicted that Australian women 's magazines would now go into coverage hyperdrive with a series of royal specials .

`` Royal Baby a ` Delight , ' Especially to Britain 's Tabloids , '' ran the headline in The New York Times . The paper 's Sarah Lyall observed that `` speculation began virtually the moment Kate Middleton said ` I will ' to Prince William in April 2011 , leaving an industry of tabloid newspapers and gossip magazines with a big black hole where their wedding coverage used to be . ''

Lyall said those who had previously -- and incorrectly -- guessed something was afoot because Catherine was drinking water instead of wine at some official dinner could now finally claim to be right .
