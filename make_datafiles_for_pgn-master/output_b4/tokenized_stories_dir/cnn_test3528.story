Sanaa , Yemen -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Days after a prominent Yemeni human rights activist became the first Arab woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize , dozens of women were injured after gangs attacked during a march in her honor , witnesses in the city of Taiz said Monday .

Thousands of women gathered in the southern Yemeni city to celebrate Tawakkol Karman 's honor Sunday . Demonstrators also called on the international community to support a revolution in Yemen , witnesses said .

At least 38 women were injured by rocks and batons when pro-government gangs attacked at Sunday 's march , said Yasser al-Nusari , a medic in Taiz 's Freedom Square . Abdulhaleem Al-Madashi , a spokesman for the protest movement there , corroborated that account .

The Yemeni government did not immediately respond to requests for comment .

Abdullah Sabri , a youth activist in Taiz , said that pro-government thugs using batons and rocks attacked .

`` It 's a shame to attack women ... . Rocks were randomly thrown directly towards the female marchers , '' Sabri said .

Female protesters marched in three Yemeni provinces on Sunday -- Taiz , Shabwa and Sanaa . The largest took place in Sanaa where at least 15,000 females marched down the capital 's Cairo Street .

In Shabwa , thousands of women also march in support of Karman , calling on the United Nations to impose sanctions against President Ali Abdullah Saleh 's ruling family .

Prominent Yemeni human rights activist Khalid Al-Anesi , based in Sanaa , received numerous reports of the attacks and injuries in Taiz and holds Saleh 's regime responsible .

`` They want to make people afraid to demonstrate , '' Al-Anesi told CNN .

`` Women heard that Tawakkol Karman had won the Nobel Prize and they wanted to come out to support her winning . Then more women started planning to demonstrate and women had huge marches yesterday in Yemen , '' he said . `` During the Taiz march , pro-Saleh gangs attacked women marchers and over 20 were injured . This is a way for Saleh 's government to send a message that women should n't demonstrate . ''

At Sunday 's march in Taiz , protesters also called on the United Nations to intervene in forcing Saleh to step down from power and repeated a refrain for Saleh to be tried .

`` Saleh Saleh will stand trial , '' women chanted as they marched for more than three hours , according to witnesses .

Government supporters also verbally harassed some female marchers , witnesses said .
