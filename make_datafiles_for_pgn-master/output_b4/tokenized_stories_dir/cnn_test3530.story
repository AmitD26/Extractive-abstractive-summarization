Seoul , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- North and South Korean officials started talks Saturday on reopening the Kaesong industrial complex , a suspended joint factory that marked a symbol of cooperation between the two rivals .

Each side sent a delegation of three members to Tongilgak , the South Korean Unification Ministry said .

The administrative building is on the North Korean side of the neutral border village of Panmunjom .

Kaesong , which is a bellwether of the two rivals ' ties , was closed this spring -- a casualty of increasing tensions between the two sides .

The agreement to hold talks came after North Korea conceded a demand by the South that contact between the two governments should precede visits to plants in the complex by business people , South Korea 's Yonhap News Agency reported .

Pyongyang had originally invited business people from South Korean companies to return to the zone to check on their facilities and equipment .

The talks `` were in consideration of the damages to the companies operating in Kaesong after three months of suspension and the beginning of monsoon season , '' said Kim Hyung-suk , a spokesman for the South Korea 's Unification Ministry . `` The Kaesong issue can only be resolved through dialogue by government authorities . ''

The operation was completely shut down in May when the last remaining South Korean workers left the facilities , but work had been winding down for about a month amid heightened tensions . In April , North Korea restricted South Korean workers ' access to the zone . Workers had to leave when supplies such as food , water and raw materials were cut off .

The North-South tensions seemed to be easing somewhat after Pyongyang agreed to high-level talks with the South in June . Those talks were called off at the eleventh hour after disagreements over the level of the delegates who would represent each side .

On Wednesday , North Korea also restored the Panmunjom communication hotline with the South , which had been cut off repeatedly over the past four months .

`` North Korea is probably feeling an unprecedented level of diplomatic isolation with pressures coming from the international community . It is also fully aware of the value of the Kaesong industrial complex , which provides a considerable amount of hard foreign currency , '' said Kim Tae-woo , former president of the Korea Institute for National Unification .

`` But stirring tensions , then going back to dialogue , is part of North Korea 's usual tactics . We do n't need to attach too much weight to this easing of tension , '' he added .

North Korea already had barred South Korean workers from entering the complex before May . In 2008 , access was restricted after a human rights group distributed propaganda leaflets via balloon into North Korea . South Korean workers were blocked again in 2009 during an annual U.S.-South Korean military drill .

Some $ 2 billion worth of goods have been produced in Kaesong between initial operations in 2005 and the end of 2012 , according to the South Korean Unification Ministry .

The average wage for North Korean workers in Kaesong Industrial Complex is $ 134 per month , according to the South Korean ministry . North Korean authorities take about 45 % of their wages for various taxes .
