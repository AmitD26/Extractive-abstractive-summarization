Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A third former Fullerton , California , police officer was charged in the beating death of a mentally ill homeless man , the Orange County district attorney said .

Joseph Wolfe , 37 , pleaded innocent Thursday to one count of involuntary manslaughter and one count of use of excessive force in connection with the death of 37-year-old Kelly James Thomas on July 7 , 2011 .

The charges against Wolfe came as a result of a grand jury indictment handed down on Monday , District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in a statement .

Since Thomas ' death , the district attorney 's office `` has actively continued its investigation and legal review and decided to seek indictment against Wolfe following extensive legal and factual analysis and development of evidence , '' the statement said .

Wolfe was released on $ 25,000 bail , according to authorities at the Orange County jail . He faces up to a maximum four years in prison , if convicted .

Wolfe 's defense attorney , Vicki Podberesky , did not immediately respond early Friday to a CNN request for comment .

The indictment against Wolfe comes nearly a year after two other former Fullerton police officers were charged in the case . They were ordered to stand trial in May .

The grand jury heard testimony from 10 witnesses and reviewed 113 exhibits of evidence over three days before handing down the indictment against Wolfe , the statement said . State law requires grand jury transcripts to be sealed for 10 days after the defense has received the documents .

Thomas , a lifelong resident of Fullerton , was shirtless and carrying a backpack , and was wearing long pants and slippers , when Fullerton police were called to investigate a `` homeless '' man looking in car windows and pulling door handles of parked cars at the city 's bus depot last July , according to a lawsuit filed by Thomas ' father .

A security camera at the downtown bus depot provided 16 minutes of video of the officers questioning and then beating Thomas , who was schizophrenic .

Former Officer Manuel Ramos is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter , and former Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force .

Both have pleaded not guilty . A pre-trial hearing is scheduled for November 30 .

Ramos , 37 , a 10-year veteran of the police department , faces a maximum sentence of 15 years to life , if convicted , authorities have said . Cicinelli , 39 , a 12-year Fullerton police veteran , faces a maximum of four years in prison , if convicted .

Recently , Thomas ' mother , Cathy , received $ 1 million from Fullerton 's insurance reserves in an agreement to settle her claim against the city in her son 's death , according to a city statement . Cathy Thomas , who 's divorced from Frederick `` Ron '' Thomas , released the city and its police officers from all potential claims , the city 's statement said .

Thomas ' father , Frederick Thomas Jr. , filed a lawsuit in July against the city , its police chief and the six officers allegedly involved in the fatal incident . The lawsuit seeks more than $ 25,000 in damages .
