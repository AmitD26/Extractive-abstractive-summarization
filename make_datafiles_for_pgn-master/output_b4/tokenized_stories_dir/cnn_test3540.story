-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nothing drives home the luxury lifestyles of the rich and famous quite like images of them lounging on a sun-drenched superyacht .

But even wealthy yacht owners -- who often use their magnificent boats for just a few weeks a year -- are not averse to making some extra cash by renting them out .

And if you 're willing to splash out , you could be cruising the waves in the very same vessels used by A-list pop stars , royalty , and world leaders .

From Beyonce to Grace Kelly , CNN takes a look at the most beautiful celebrity yachts available for hire .

Beyonce on board

When Beyonce performed at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009 , the soulful songstress was left high and dry without a luxury vessel -- until she chartered 30-meter superyacht Asfar .

At $ 109,000 per week , the sleek boat features three elegant suites , with room for 11 guests . Four crew members -- including a chef , a captain and deck hands -- were also on board to cater to their elite guest 's every whim .

`` Beyonce had a great time , sailing around the beautiful west coast of Abu Dhabi , '' said the CEO of an Abu Dhabi charter company which hired out the plush yacht . `` She just wished she could have stayed longer . ''

Old school Grace

From modern day divas to past princesses , you could be sunning yourself aboard Grace Kelly 's iconic honeymoon yacht M/Y Grace -- as it tours the Galapagos Islands .

The charming wooden yacht was given to Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco as a wedding present from shipping mogul Aristotle Onassis in the 1950s , with the royal couple spending their honeymoon sailing it along the stunning Italian coast .

Today the iconic boat has been refitted with nine luxury staterooms and a top deck hot tub . Guests can enjoy fine dining as they meander past Ecuador 's remarkable islands teeming with unusual wildlife such as giant tortoises and marine iguanas . A week in the master suite will set you back $ 6,600 .

P. Diddy 's iPad superyacht

When rapper tycoon P. Diddy goes on holiday , he does n't do things by halves . The Grammy Award-winning musician relaxes on one of the most luxurious and high-tech superyachts in the world -- Solemates -- which even boasts an iPad-controller .

From the luxury of their top deck jacuzzi , guests can control practically everything but the captain 's steering wheel -- all with a leisurely brush of their ipad .

The 60-meter yacht also features an aromatherapy shower , James Bond-style underwater hovercraft , and a gym which converts into a disco . The price is similarly spectacular -- around $ 685,000 per week during the height of summer .

All the presidents ' yacht

When former American President John F. Kennedy wanted a few hours rest from the White House , he would supposedly slip away on the Potomac River for a leisurely cruise on his yacht , Honey Fitz .

Built in 1931 , the pretty wooden vessel has served five American presidents , including Harry S. Truman , Dwight D. Eisenhower , Lyndon B. Johnson , Richard Nixon , and of course JFK -- whose wife Jackie installed the boat 's very first color TV in the 1960s .

The recently renovated 70-passenger yacht is now completing a charity fundraising tour around the U.S. , but is still available for private hire , costing around $ 5,000 for four hours .

Richard Branson 's Belle

If anyone knows spectacular modes of transport , it 's Virgin business mogul Richard Branson . The British billionaire 's 32-meter catamaran -- Necker Belle -- includes four luxury suites , each with its own ensuite and flat screen TV .

Thrill seekers can also enjoy the sleek vessel 's roof-top diving board , scuba diving equipment and three-person mini submarine , dubbed `` Necker Nymph . ''

Guests can cruise the Caribbean in the grand yacht for a cool $ 110,000 per week .
