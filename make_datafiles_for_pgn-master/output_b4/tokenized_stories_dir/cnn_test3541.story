ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Six years ago an ad in the Sunday paper changed a young Pakistani woman 's life and made aviation history .

Seven Pakistani women are trained to fly the country 's F-7 fighter jets -- though none have seen combat so far .

The ad read : `` Pakistan Air Force recruiting females cadets . ''

Back then Ambreen Gul was 20-years old and living in Karachi . Her mother wanted her to be a doctor . She remembers her reaction when she told her she wants to fly .

`` She was like : ` You 're a girl , ' '' says Gul . `` How will you do it ? How will you fly ? ''

The following day Gul took the first step in proving her mother wrong . She was among the first in line at the recruitment center .

For nearly six decades it was only men who had flown Pakistan 's fighter jets . Today Gul is one of seven women who are trained and ready to fly Pakistan 's F-7 supersonic fighter jets .

`` This is a feeling that makes you proud and makes you humble also , '' says Gul .

Humility does n't mean lack of confidence .

`` We can do everything better than the men , '' explains cadet Nida Tariq .

`` We 're more hardworking , more consistent and more patient , '' adds cadet Anam Faiq .

To become a fighter pilot takes three years of training at the Air Force Academy in Risalpur , Pakistan , where the halls are lined with grainy black-and-white pictures of nearly six decades of male graduates who went on to fly for the Pakistan Air Force .

The training is often intensely physical . Here , equal opportunity means equal treatment .

If they are not good enough as per their male counterparts , we do n't let them fly , '' says commanding officer Tanvir Piracha .

Some of Pakistan 's female pilots wear hijabs . Others prefer to go without the Muslim headdress . Most say changing the misconception of Muslim women is just as important as serving their country .

`` Islam gives equal opportunity to females . Whatever we want to do we can , '' says pilot Nadia Gul .

`` To tell you the truth I 've been given equal opportunity or I suppose more than men have been given , '' says Air Force cadet Sharista Beg .

Air Force officials say fighter pilots are playing a vital role in the fight against the Taliban . They 're training in counterinsurgency , collecting aerial intelligence and targeting militant strongholds in the treacherous mountains of Pakistan 's tribal region along the Afghan border . Ambreen Gul says her goal now is to fly in combat .

`` I would give my life for my country , '' she says .

But women rarely fly in combat anywhere in the world and it 's never been done in Pakistan . It 's another barrier Gul plans to break .
