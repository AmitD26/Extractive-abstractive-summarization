-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mark Hasse `` had an absolute passion for putting away bad guys , and he enjoyed nothing better , '' his boss said .

Now investigators are looking into whether that passion led to Hasse being gunned down outside his office in Kaufman , Texas , where he was an assistant district attorney . Hasse was killed in the parking lot of the Kaufman County courthouse Thursday morning , shot several times after `` a very small , very short confrontation , '' Police Chief Chris Aulbaugh said .

`` It was apparent that he was not expecting to have anything happen , '' Aulbaugh said . `` He was on his way to his office . ''

Investigators are looking into whether Hasse 's killing was retribution for any of the prosecutions he led , Aulbaugh said , `` but we ca n't say we 're confident that that 's where it came from . ''

District Attorney Mike McLelland called Hasse `` a stellar prosecutor '' who knew that threats were part of the job , and he vowed to put away the `` scum '' who killed his assistant .

`` I hope that the people that did this are watching , because we 're very confident that we 're going to find you , '' McLelland said at a news conference Thursday afternoon . `` We 're going to pull you out of whatever hole you 're in , we 're going to bring you back and let the people of Kaufman County prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law . ''

Hasse was one of 13 prosecuting attorneys in Kaufman County , each of whom handled between 380 and 390 cases , McLelland said .

`` He was a lot of fun . He was the premier storyteller of the office . He had lots of stories to tell , '' including surviving the crash of a World War II aircraft that left him in a coma , `` caved in half his skull '' and cost him his sense of smell .

`` It was five kinds of miracles he survived that , '' McLelland said .

There have been no arrests , and Aulbaugh and other officials who addressed reporters Thursday afternoon appealed to the public for help . The local CrimeStoppers group and a Kaufman businessman have put up a total of $ 20,000 in reward money for information leading to a conviction , Aulbaugh said .

The Texas Rangers , the FBI and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives have joined the manhunt , and `` we are in the process of running down many leads right now , '' he said .

Kaufman County sheriff 's spokeswoman Pat Laney said investigators are looking for an older-model , four-door sedan , either brown or silver , but it was n't clear whether there were one or two suspects Thursday afternoon , Laney said .

`` We have officers going over all of this case , '' she said . `` Nothing has been identified yet that could have prompted this assault . ''
