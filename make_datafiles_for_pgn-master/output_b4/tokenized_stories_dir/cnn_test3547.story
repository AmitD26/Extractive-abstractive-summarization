-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The J.K. Rowling/Robert Galbraith tale is a great and irresistible publishing story -- but it 's only the second-best I 've ever heard .

You may have read about Rowling and Galbraith last week . Rowling , whose Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies , is the most successful author in the world . Galbraith , whose new detective novel `` The Cuckoo 's Calling '' had been selling dismally , does n't exist .

Rowling is Galbraith .

Fast facts : J.K. Rowling

She wrote and published `` The Cuckoo 's Calling '' under Galbraith 's name , to see what would happen if readers and critics did n't know she was the author . The book received glowing reviews , but few readers purchased a copy .

Then , last weekend , the secret was revealed , and `` The Cuckoo 's Calling '' zoomed to No. 1 best-seller status . Massive reprintings were ordered . Rowling , in a statement , said , `` It has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation , and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name . ''

Yet top-echelon executives at Rowling 's publisher knew all along that she was Robert Galbraith -- that she had written the book . And they presumably knew that , once the word got out , they would have an enormous and profitable blockbuster on their hands .

But what if Robert Galbraith really had been Robert Galbraith ? What if an unknown author by that name had tried to sell `` The Cuckoo 's Calling '' to a publisher ?

Best-selling female authors with male monikers

As good as the book is , would a publisher have taken a chance on it ?

Before you answer `` Of course , '' consider the case of Chuck Ross -- the protagonist of the most instructive , the most damning , and the most hilarious true story about publishing there ever has been .

I interviewed him and reported on his story almost 35 years ago . Ross , in the 1970s , was a young would-be author who was trying with no success to get his first novel published . He was receiving nothing but rejection slips .

He wondered whether his writing really was that unappealing , or if publishers were simply turning him down because he was an unknown .

So he decided upon a clever , if highly unconventional , way to find out .

In those pre-personal-computer days , he sat down at a typewriter and copied every single word of the novel `` Steps , '' by Jerzy Kosinski . `` Steps '' had won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1969 , had received superlative reviews and was a big best-seller .

Once Ross had finished typing up the manuscript , he made sure not to put a title on it . He did put a byline on it : his own .

He made copies , and he mailed them off . The recipients were 14 major publishing houses . Four of those houses had published books by Kosinski . One of them had published `` Steps . ''

The manuscript was turned down by all 14 houses .

None realized that it was rejecting `` Steps . ''

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich , which had published Kosinski 's `` Being There , '' wrote to Ross :

`` While your prose style is very lucid , the content of the book did n't inspire the level of enthusiasm here that a publisher should have for any book on their list in order to do well by it . ''

Houghton Mifflin , which had published three of Kosinski 's books , wrote Ross to say that it did not wish to publish what Ross had sent . Not that the editors thought he was a bad writer -- they said they admired his style : `` Jerzy Kosinski comes to mind as a point of comparison when reading the stark , chilly , episodic incidents you have set down . '' But , they said in their rejection letter , what Ross had sent them `` does n't add up to a satisfactory whole . It has some very impressive moments , but gives the impression of sketchiness and incompleteness . '' They wrote that they would be happy to consider future efforts by him , but that this one just did n't work .

Random House , which had published `` Steps , '' sent a form letter rejecting the retyped `` Steps . ''

Ross thought that maybe the problem was that he was submitting his novel -- that is , Kosinski 's novel -- without the assistance of a literary agent . So he sent the manuscript to 13 top agents , asking if they would represent it .

Not one of them was interested .

Some excerpts from the agents ' rejection letters :

`` I 'm afraid the novel 's episodic nature and the lack of strong characterization would not allow this book to compete in a very tough fiction market . ''

And :

`` From the section I read of your untitled novel , it seems too fragmented and dreamlike to be a good commercial bet . ''

And :

`` Thanks for having sent me your untitled novel . You write clearly and well , but I felt that the novel jumped around so much that it did not hold interest , and I would not be the right agent for it . ''

When Ross went public with what he had done , he expected the publishers and agents to be a little embarrassed that they had turned down a National Book Award-winning novel .

But , he told me when I interviewed him at the time , `` I guess not . I went to the American Booksellers Association convention to talk to the publishers about what I did . They all thought that it was very amusing or silly . They agreed that it probably could happen again tomorrow . But the attitude was , ` So what ? ' ''

As lovely as the J.K. Rowling/Robert Galbraith saga is , what would have made it even better , and turned it into more of a cliffhanger , is if Rowling had gone the Chuck Ross route :

If she had , without revealing her identity , sent `` The Cuckoo 's Calling '' to publishers cold -- if she had submitted it and let them think that it really was by a novice named Robert Galbraith .

Would any of them have snapped it up ?

It may be a terrific book -- but so was `` Steps . '' And without Kosinski 's name on the manuscript , `` Steps '' could n't find a publisher . Or an agent .

Even though it had already won the National Book Award .

What a business . It 's enough to drive even Harry Potter to drink .
