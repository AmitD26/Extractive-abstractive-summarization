Moscow -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There was n't a shadow of a doubt that former presidential aide and interim mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin would win the mayoral race against blogger and anti-corruption activist Alexey Navalny , not as President Vladimir Putin 's hand-picked man .

The only question was by how much . Anything less than 50 % would have meant a run-off election .

Opinion : Putin , a hypocrite on Snowden , Navalny

There will not be a run-off . Sobyanin squeaked by with 51.37 % of the vote . Navalny won 27.24 % .

Calling the preliminary results `` sheer falsifications '' Navalny demanded the annulment of `` off-site '' elections , in which voters are allowed to vote at home , without having to come to polling stations . `` We also demand a second round of voting for the election , '' he said .

Navalny can ask for a re-count but there is little chance he will get a run-off . Putin can rest assured that his man will retain the powerful post of Moscow mayor .

But the opposition are taking heart from Navalyny 's strong showing .

As Ksenya Sobchak , once Russia 's `` Paris Hilton '' and now a vocal member of the opposition tweeted : `` Now , Alexey is a politician of federal standing , and prison is unthinkable . ''

Up to now , Navalyny was known mainly in Moscow and St. Petersburg as a crusader against government corruption , calling out politicians for illegal behavior . He was a leader of the 2012 street demonstrations in Moscow , motivating educated , middle-class young people in Russia 's big cities with blogs and Tweets .

The Kremlin 's game with Alexei Navalny

Kremlinologist Olga Kryshtanovskaya , in post-election Tweet , said `` Navalny 's high results in the election is directly connected to his activity in the social media . ''

In a striking political anomaly , the 37-year-old Navalny ran for mayor as a convicted man , currently on bail after being sentenced to five years in prison for embezzlement . He claims the charges were politically inspired to sideline him from politics and is appealing the sentence .

Before the mayoral vote some observers predicted that , if Navalny 's supporters felt the election had been stolen , they would turn out again for street protests . A demonstration was planned in advance for Monday evening .

But some Kremlin opponents do n't sound that angry ; they 're taking heart from the vote totals .

In another Tweet Ksenya Sobchak said `` It was understood right from the beginning that they would do absolutely everything to avoid a second round , is n't that true ? But the fact that Navalyny got more than 27 % -- that 's cool ! ''
