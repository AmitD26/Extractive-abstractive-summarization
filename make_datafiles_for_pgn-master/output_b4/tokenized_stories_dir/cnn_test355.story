Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- First lady Michelle Obama is a popular American political figure , even more so than her husband . Her name , face and stories of her influence behind the scenes are a constant in the media , and sometimes in not so flattering words and images .

In books , she is portrayed as battling with White House insiders . In magazines , she has been satirized as a militant activist . On TV , she responds to those who see her as an `` angry black woman . ''

But still , she stays centered , focusing on her issues -- health and young children , military families and raising her family inside the White House bubble .

`` The administration is doing everything they can to keep her out in the public eye and remind everyone why they liked this family in the first place , '' said Garrett Graff , editor of The Washingtonian magazine .

But that warm embrace is n't universal , and the first lady made note of it in a recent interview with CBS .

`` There will always be people who do n't like me , '' Obama told Gayle King on `` CBS This Morning . ''

Ever since her husband announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential race , she said some have viewed her as `` some kind of angry black woman . ''

First ladies are always placed under the microscope and often become the targets of harsh critics . Paul Begala , a former adviser in the Clinton administration , said the public is an equal opportunity offender .

`` Some liberals attacked Nancy Reagan unfairly . A whole lot of conservatives attacked Hillary Clinton when I was working for her husband in the White House , '' said Begala , who is also a CNN contributor .

For Michelle Obama the first punch came shortly after then-Sen . Barack Obama decided to run for president . Beaming with pride , she told an audience that `` for the first time in my adult lifetime I 'm really proud of my country . ''

That comment drew fire from conservatives who questioned her patriotism . She was forced to clarify her remarks .

Then there was the portrayal of her on the cover of The New Yorker . A sketch showed her with a machine gun slung across her back , sporting an Afro and wearing combat boots like 1960s activist Angela Davis .

Opinion : Working together for the health of America 's children

The first lady has carved out a public role for herself as a strong advocate for military families and promoter of a healthy lifestyle , especially for children .

At events or in TV appearances , she is only too willing to tout her fitness by joining in jumping jacks or getting down on the ground for push-ups . On `` The Tonight Show With Jay Leno , '' she playfully pressured the late-night entertainer to eat his veggies . She challenged talk-show host Jimmy Fallon to a tug-of-war contest in the White House .

Beyond promoting her initiatives , the first lady also has used the spotlight to pull the curtain back on her softer side .

Whether it 's talking about her role as a mom or trying her hand at acting , such as a recent cameo appearance on the hit Nickelodeon comedy `` iCarly , '' Obama tries to bring humor and personality inside the Washington bubble .

The Washingtonian 's Graff said the first lady plays a unique role in American society . `` We do n't expect them to have the gravitas of the president , and so you can have a little more fun , be in photo opportunities and do things the president ca n't do because of his office , '' he said .

As the president campaigns for a second term , the first lady is also able to do something else .

Her trips often take her to key battleground states , where her message re-enforces the president 's policies and her presence at fundraisers raises campaign cash .

`` I know that if we come together and we do this work , we will elect the president that this country deserves , '' she recently told Obama supporters .

At another event , she pumped up the audience with a call and answer riff : `` Do you have his back ? Are you fired up ? Are you ready to go ? ''

Said Begala , who considers himself an Obama supporter : `` I think the first lady is not only the president 's greatest asset in his political campaign ; she 's his greatest asset in his life . Political hacks like me would like to use her all the time . ''

But Begala warned she should n't be overused or become `` too political '' because that could `` diminish her value . ''

In her supporting role , she is trying to strike a balance as wife , mother and first lady while challenging a lingering negative image that she insists is off the mark .

`` I just hope that over time , that people get to know me , '' she told CBS .
