MOSCOW , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russian energy monopoly Gazprom said Thursday it has cut off supplies of natural gas to Ukraine after a payment deadline expired .

A gas-compressor and gas-holder station in Mryn , Ukraine . Gazprom said it had cut supplies to Ukraine Thursday .

Gazprom had been threatening the move , saying months of negotiations with Ukraine had failed to resolve the issue of outstanding payments . The company says Ukraine owes about $ 2 billion for past natural gas deliveries .

Ukraine also disputes the new price set by Gazprom for 2009 deliveries , which was initially more than double the price from 2008 .

Gazprom has reassured the rest of Europe that its natural gas supply , which runs through Ukraine , will not be affected by the dispute with Kiev . Thursday , a Gazprom spokesman said on Russian state television the company had actually increased the deliveries to the rest of the continent .

`` Gazprom will continue supplying gas for its consumers in Europe at full volume , '' the company 's chief executive , Alexey Miller , said . `` We have an effective transit contract . ''

Without natural gas , some Ukrainians could be in for chilly days and nights . The temperature at midday Thursday in Kiev was 25 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- -4 degrees Celsius -RRB- , with a forecast high of only 32 F -LRB- 0 C -RRB- and snow predicted overnight .

Ukraine 's state-controlled energy company , Naftogaz Ukrainy , said Thursday it is ensuring domestic natural gas needs are covered by taking gas from underground storage facilities .

`` All of Ukraine 's consumers are fully secured , '' the company said in a statement .

In Washington , the White House urged a resolution Thursday .

`` The United States would like to see a restoration of normal deliveries , '' White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said . `` The parties should be resolving their differences through good-faith negotiations , without supply cutoffs . ''

The frigid weather is of particular concern , the White House said . `` We urge both sides to keep in mind the humanitarian implications of any interruption of gas supply in the winter , '' Johndroe said .

Naftogaz Ukrainy also disputed Gazprom 's claim that it owes for past deliveries , saying Thursday it has paid its debt to Gazprom in full , though it declined to give a figure .

Another part of the dispute centers on Gazprom 's price hike for 2009 gas deliveries . Gazprom had wanted to more than double Ukraine 's payments , but Wednesday it offered a lower price .

Ukraine , which currently pays about $ 100 per 1,000 cubic meters , balked at the figure offered , saying it simply ca n't afford to pay the new price .

It is the second time in three years Gazprom has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine . The company made good on its threat on January 1 , 2006 , but turned the supply back on a day later .

Russia is the world 's biggest producer of natural gas and supplies Europe with more than 40 percent of its imports -- mainly via the pipelines through Ukraine .

Naftogaz said in its statement Thursday that it would ensure the uninterrupted flow of Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine , but only under existing arrangements . It indicated some gas deliveries to Europe could be halted in Ukraine if Naftogaz fails to reach a new agreement with Gazprom .

Although gas is still flowing to Europe , there are also concerns in Russia that the amount could be reduced if Ukraine siphons off some of the gas headed to the west .

Naftogaz said it will continue negotiating with Gazprom to address the issues .
