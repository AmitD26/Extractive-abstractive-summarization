-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I 've been in Thomas Hurley III 's shoes .

Hurley is the 12-year-old Connecticut boy whose misspelling of `` Emancipation '' during a Kids Week episode on `` Jeopardy! '' took social media by storm . Fans are sharply divided over whether the show should have accepted his Final Jeopardy answer , even though he would have finished second regardless .

But what we forget is that a young man 's honest mistake was broadcast to millions of people across the United States and Canada . No matter the age , realizing that your `` blooper '' will be seen by many can be very embarrassing .

Twelve years ago , it was me standing below the `` hot lamps '' of a TV studio , appearing on the Regis Philbin version of `` Who Wants to Be a Millionaire . '' It took dozens of phone tests over a two-year period to make my dream of being on a TV game show a reality , and it came crashing down in a matter of minutes .

Social media howls over 12-year-old 's errant ` t ' on ` Jeopardy! '

I was defeated on a $ 500 question on collar stays -- those tiny strips used to keep a shirt collar flat . I always wore dress shirts with the collar buttoned down , so `` collar stays '' were foreign to me . Not wanting to burn my third and final lifeline , I guessed and came up short .

The first few days after that taping were rough . I struggled with sleep , replayed the game over and over in my head , and wondered whether all those years of trying to qualify were worth it . I even apologized to my family and `` Phone a Friend '' lifelines for letting them down .

The episode finally aired , and I did n't bother watching it . The show broadcast around the time I headed to work , so I spent that period walking to the subway , knowing that when I got to the office , my co-workers would have watched the show .

But then something happened .

As I soon as I stepped into the office , my co-workers gave me a round of applause . They told me that they were proud that I got on the show , and that it did n't matter whether I won a million dollars or nothing at all . My boss dropped off one of his collar stays on my desk , with a note that `` you 'll always remember . '' For the next 30 minutes or so , everyone wanted to ask me about the `` Millionaire experience '' : What was Regis Philbin like ? How long does it take to record a 60-minute show ? etc. . It turns out that no one was ashamed at my performance after all . They were just happy that a lifelong dream came true .

Bullying not as simple as good vs. evil

When I got home that morning , there were two messages on my answering machine . The first was from a teen who wanted to remind me what collar stays were -LRB- I expected at least one prank call of that level -RRB- . The second was from what sounded like an older woman who wanted to congratulate me for being a `` good sport '' and a `` gracious loser . '' She said that it had to be tough for me to relive an embarrassing moment all over , but incidents like those only make you stronger . And she was right .

Social media was at its infancy in 2001 -- it was essentially e-mail and Yahoo! message boards for me -- but I heard from others who sympathized with my plight . I was even told of a possible petition to get me back on `` Millionaire '' under the guise that the collar stays questions was `` too hard for $ 500 . '' I asked that the petition drive not take place -- maybe the question was hard , but I lost fair and square .

I eventually did return to `` Millionaire '' for a special series of shows honoring `` zero dollar winners . '' Before the taping , I had to witness my infamous moment over and over again -- my first appearance was looped for editing on the big screen during a contestant run through . I did n't shy away this time . Instead , I laughed and wondered out loud why `` The Weakest Link '' did n't get a hold of us first . Everyone laughed .

Thomas Hurley III will bounce back , just like I did , but it will take some time . This young man got to do something that so many Americans would love to do , myself included : be a contestant on `` Jeopardy! ''

That 's something I would put on my resume or college application , regardless of whether I won or lost . He left the show $ 2,000 richer than he started , and what 12-year-old would n't want to have that much money to play with or save for school ?

And I know that Thomas ' family , friends and social media supporters have to be thrilled that he got a chance to compete on national television . As a father , I think it 's important for parents to keep telling a kid like Thomas that , win or lose , you 're proud of his performance and excited that he took such a big chance . Do n't play the blame game -- saying that Alex Trebek was `` smug '' and that `` spelling rules are silly '' wo n't solve anything . And most of all , tell him to take on the world with his head held high .

Thomas Hurley III may have finished second on that show , but he is a winner just by stepping up to the `` Jeopardy! '' podium and playing the game . It takes a lot of courage to do what he did , and for that I salute him .
