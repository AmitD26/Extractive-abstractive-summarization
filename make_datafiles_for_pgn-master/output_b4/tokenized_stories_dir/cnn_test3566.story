-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tired of seeing developed nations take the lion 's share of profits from his countrymen 's coffee crop , Ugandan businessman Andrew Rugasira decided back in 2003 that it was time for a new business arrangement .

Uganda is Africa 's second-biggest exporter of coffee beans , currently producing around 3.4 million bags per year . Yet instead of being refined locally , the vast majority of the country 's raw beans have been traditionally exported in the consuming countries of the West for processing .

But Rugasira 's vision was to create a quality Ugandan coffee company that would be able to place a finished product on the shelves of both local and international supermarkets .

A trained economist , he devised a business model encouraging local coffee farmers to sell their beans to him at a fair price . His company would then roast , package and brand the final product , whilst the profits would be split 50/50 .

`` The hard part was saying , ` look , I think as Africans we need to begin to look at ourselves as a solution to some of these problems of systemic poverty and underdevelopment . We have blessed soils , you guys have a commodity which is of great value , '' says Rugasira , recalling his first meetings to convince the farmers in Uganda 's Kasese district .

`` We can pay you a premium price ; we can also add value to your knowledge ; we can help train you ; we can set up savings and credit co-ops and we can really work together and begin to own the value chain which is historically being controlled outside the producer country .

`` We needed to change that -- and through trade we could bring prosperity to our farmers and their communities . ''

These words by Rugasira planted the seeds for what went on to become Good African Coffee , a Kampala-based company that has helped transform the lives of thousands of farmers in Uganda .

Over the last nine years Good African Coffee says it has built a network of more than 14,000 coffee farmers , who are organized into 280 farmer groups . The company , which is the first African-owned coffee brand to be available in British supermarkets , has also helped local farmers to set up several savings and credit cooperatives .

'' -LRB- It 's -RRB- about empowerment and it 's also about ownership , '' says Rugasira . `` It 's about owning the value chain , growing the coffee , processing it at source and it 's about exporting a finished product , '' he adds .

`` So we retain the value , which means we can employ people , we can pay taxes , we can prosper our farmers and their communities . And that 's the only sustainable way in which societies have prospered -- by moving from low-value agriculture into high-value manufacturing industrialization . ''

At the heart of all of Rugasira 's efforts is his strong belief in the transformative power of self-help . In trade , and not aid , he says , is where Africa 's future well-being lies .

`` Every society and economy that 's prospered has done it through their own hard work , ingenuity , dedication and commitment , '' he says .

`` Not through charity , not through handouts , and I think that 's a powerful message and it 's a powerful model . It 's not new , but I think it 's one that I think resonates with consumers who are willing to interact with products like that . ''

Rugasira 's philosophy is clearly defined in `` A Good African Story , '' his book published earlier this year chronicling all the challenges he and his enterprise faced -- from gaining the trust of banking institutions to convincing foreign retailers about working directly with an African company .

He says he decided to write the book because just a handful of African businesspeople write about their experiences .

`` All of us have a story , '' he says . `` We need to share that story ; that story edifies , it encourages , it inspires others in our own way and I just found African business does n't really write . ''

By sharing his story with the world , Rugasira wants to help create a new narrative about Africa and inspire the continent 's next generation of entrepreneurs .

`` Seventy percent of our population on the continent are young people -- the same young people that we want to set up businesses , become entrepreneurs , innovators in IT , you name it , '' he says . `` And the only way they 'll be encouraged and inspired is if they read about stories about other African business people .
