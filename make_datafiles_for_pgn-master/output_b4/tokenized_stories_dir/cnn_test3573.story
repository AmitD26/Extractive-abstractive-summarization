-LRB- Financial Times -RRB- -- A diet of drudgery in a takeaway might seem wholesome but it does open the eye to better things .

One evening last week I was in the kitchen fixing myself a cup of tea when my son put his head around the door . I have hardly seen him since he left school last summer as he spends his days working in a sandwich shop and nights taking orders in a fast-food takeaway .

How 's it going , I asked .

Good , he replied .

These jobs of yours , I said . Have they taught you anything interesting yet about or work , or life -- or anything ?

Yeah , he said . They 've taught me I like getting paid .

My question was prompted by a recent Harvard Business Review blog arguing that humble jobs teach young people more about work than any amount of poncing around as an unpaid intern in a film production company . The author , who is now a law school professor , was once a busboy and a cleaner -- jobs which he says taught him lessons that have come in handy ever since .

Already I was seeing the sense in his general argument . My son 's first key takeaway from the takeaway restaurant was spot on :

● Getting paid really is nice . It is a pity most of us get so used to it that we forget to be pleased when payday comes around .

So what else had it taught him ? He said he 'd think about it and tell me later : he had to go or he 'd be late for his evening shift .

This led to the second revelation :

● If you are earning £ 7 an hour you need to work longer than an investment banker to make any money at all .

And that , in turn , led to the third :

● Earning the minimum wage makes you grateful to live at home where there is a warm bed and full -LRB- ish -RRB- fridge . For everyone else , it is a game of survival and he does n't understand how they manage .

Later that evening I got a text from him saying the restaurant was quiet and that we could talk . So I went over to find the place entirely empty apart from my son , who was loafing around by the till . This led to his fourth revelation :

● Doing nothing sucks . It 's the worst thing there is . It makes you so lethargic that when things get busier you can hardly bring yourself to budge .

Is n't he also learning how to be professional , I asked -- leading the witness outrageously .

Obvs , he replied . And then came lesson number five :

● You have to be punctual . And reliable . You must n't swear , or turn your back on customers , or answer them back . If you have a hangover you still have to get to work on time , and you have to pretend that you feel fine .

Listening to him recite this list led me to contribute an insight of my own :

● A fast-food restaurant is an excellent finishing school . It has succeeded in areas where 18 years of liberal parenting and seven years of hugely expensive private education have made little impression .

Yet even though he has learnt how to be civil to customers , he has not learnt to like it . In fact what he has discovered is that :

● Dealing with customers can suck . Some of them are friendly , but there are lots who do n't even look at you . That gets to you after a while .

My son looked anxiously at his watch and said his boss would be in soon . But I thought you told me you liked him , I protested .

He shrugged . `` He 's OK . In the beginning we went for a drink after the shift , but he decides how many hours I work , and he blames me for stuff like not ordering new menus , when that 's not even my job . So drinking with him feels weird . ''

In other words he has learnt invaluable lesson number eight :

● Being friends with your manager is never a good idea .

Before I left him , I told him that his lessons bore no resemblance to the ones drawn by the HBR blogger , whose stint doing humble jobs taught him great truths about humanity : that most people want to take pride in their work , and that everyone has big dreams . What did he think of that ? He pointed out it was hard to take pride in your work when the restaurant is doing badly and the manager does n't care .

But even with good management , some people are still useless moaners , which led him to lesson nine .

● Working with whingers is rubbish .

So what should be done about them , I asked . He looked at me as if I were an idiot .

`` F-ing fire them , '' he said , momentarily forgetting lesson # 5 .

And what about dreams ? `` Yeah , '' he said . `` Everyone here has dreams . ''

Slightly dreading the answer , I asked what were his . To my relief he replied : `` To get into university and to get a skilled job . ''
