-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Houdini would n't speak to me . He refused to say one word . He has n't spoken to anyone for 87 years -- since he died .

Every Halloween , Harry Houdini fans try to prize a few words out of the world 's greatest escapologist .

Before he died , Houdini promised to send a message back from the Other Side .

After his death in Detroit on October 31 , 1926 , his wife , Bess , inaugurated the official Houdini séance .

He has n't been heard from .

Yet .

This year 's séance will be held at the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site .

The citadel is a 19th-century fort . The catacombs are supposedly haunted .

Houdini played Nova Scotia and toured the Canadian Maritimes in 1896 .

The séance will feature performances by local magicians .

Some proceeds will go to the `` Feed Nova Scotia '' initiative , a province-wide food bank . Seating is limited . Admission is $ 45 .

Guests this year include escape artist Lucas Wilson , holder of three Guinness World Records , and the daughter of Jacques Price , one of the three men in the dressing room when Houdini received the fateful punches to his stomach .

The medium charged with getting through to Houdini is Alan Hatfield of Pictou Landing First Nation .

A former truck driver , Hatfield has been a professional psychic since 1988 and has helped on several missing persons inquiries .

He claims to have spoken with victims of the Titanic disaster buried in Halifax 's Fairview Cemetery .

`` I do n't know much about Houdini any more than the casual observer interested in magicians , '' he says . `` I like to have no preconceived information but to begin all endeavors with spirit dialogs from Ground Zero status . It 's a privilege to be asked to be part of the séance . ''

Spirit hotline remains dead

In 2001 , I had the honor of sitting at the séance table in Milwaukee , the first journalist to do so .

Sadly , Houdini did n't show up . Or pick up . The line to the Other Side remained dead .

Hatfield is more confident of success .

`` I 'm not a traditional trance medium , but have had great results , using sweet grass and prayer to open doorways , '' he says . `` And employing EVP -LRB- Electronic Voice Phenomena -RRB- recordings in communion with disembodied souls . ''

Among those joining hands around the table will be historians , collectors and experts such as Bill Radner , whose late father Sid owned the world 's largest Houdini collection .

This included the only recording of the magician 's voice .

The memorabilia was sold at auction in 2004 .

`` We always have the séance handcuffs on the table , '' says Radner . `` Only Houdini knew how to open them . They are similar to those he escaped from in a 1904 challenge in London staged by Britain 's Daily Mirror newspaper . ''

Houdini said he would open the handcuffs from the afterlife , if he could .

`` They were very important to my father , '' says Radner . `` He bought them from Harry 's brother , Theodore , who performed as Hardeen , and were first used in a séance in 1948 . ''

Until 1995 , the official Houdini séance was held at his graveside in New York 's Machpelah cemetery .

It has since taken place around the United States as well as in London and Montreal .

Great escapologist , but he could n't drive

`` Harry was an amazing guy , '' says fan and `` Inner Circle '' member Tom Boldt , a construction executive from Wisconsin .

`` There was n't much he could n't do . Except perhaps drive . He was the first man to fly a plane in Australia . In 1910 . He even toured in Russia .

`` The séance has become part of Americana . It 's an opportunity to retell Houdini 's incredible rags to riches story . And another serious attempt to honor Houdini 's claim that if anyone could return from the hereafter , it would be him . ''

Fellow table member and séance host Bruce MacNab from Dartmouth , Nova Scotia , wrote an award winning book , `` The Apprenticeship of Harry Houdini , '' about The Metamorphosis , Houdini 's tour of eastern Canada .

He spent five years researching it .

`` Houdini spent a month in the area and stayed in the Carleton House in Halifax , '' says McNab . `` He discovered the straitjacket on the tour .

`` His show at Yarmouth was his first one outside of the U.S. And the one in Dartmouth his first international one as a headliner . ''

Along with Frank Lloyd Wright , Senator Eugene Macarthy and Liberace , Houdini is one of Wisconsin 's favorite sons .

His hometown of Appleton , two hours north of Milwaukee and one hour south of Green Bay , offers self-guided walking tours around Houdini-related sites , like the Houdini Elementary School .

The school motto is `` The Magic of Learning . The Magic begins here . ''

There are the Houdini Escape Gastropub and the Stone Cellar Brewpub , which serves `` Houdini Honeywheat '' or `` Weiss '' beer .

From shoe shiner to crowd pleaser

Born Ehrich Weiss in Budapest in 1874 , Houdini spent the first nine years of his life in the Wisconsin town now famous for dairy farming and a fire engine factory .

Appleton boasted the United States ' first enclosed shopping area and the country 's first hotel with electrified lighting . And first hydroelectric plant .

Houdini 's father , Samuel , was the town rabbi . He preached above Heckert 's Saloon , now a carpet shop and bridal outfitter . The family home is now a shopping plaza .

The only physical landmark left from Houdini 's boyhood is the wooden Temple Zion synagogue at 320 North Durkhee Street , which was built around the time Rabbi Weiss was sacked from his $ 750 a year job for not being able to preach in English .

The family moved to Milwaukee in 1883 .

Houdini and his brothers shined shoes and worked as newspaper boys for the Milwaukee Journal .

Their father became a kosher butcher .

Houdini took his name from the French illusionist , Robert-Eugene Houdin .

His first professional performance is thought to have been at the Pasadena Athletic Club in New York .

There 's a small Houdini museum in Scranton , Pennsylvania . The Library of Congress in Washington , D.C. and the University of Texas in Austin hold collections .

There are commercial museums at Houdini 's Magic Shop in Las Vegas and Fantasma Magic in New York . Magician David Copperfield has a private collection .

The Museum At The Castle in Appleton also has exhibits . Its gift shop sells straitjackets . But no butter churns or manacles .

`` We hope to hear from Harry soon , '' says Boldt . `` He might make his comeback if he knows it 's a sellout crowd .

`` He was the ultimate showman . He once said that only when people were sure he was licked would he appear . He was a master of suspense . ''

This year 's Houdini séance takes place October 31 at the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site and is open to the public ; entrance fee $ 45 ; more information at this leading Houdini fan site .

Numerous Houdini artifacts can be seen at the History Museum at the Castle in Appleton , Wisconsin .
