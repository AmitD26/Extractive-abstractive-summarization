Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While reaching out to supporters through one of the latest high-tech means , President Obama expanded his social media experience by holding a Google + video chat room interview Monday afternoon .

In an election year , it 's probably not good politics to talk about what you look forward to doing after your time in the White House , but that 's exactly what President Obama did when asked about the frustrations of living in the security bubble .

`` It 's the toughest thing about being president . Look , this is the greatest job on Earth , and it 's such an honor to serve , but it is true sometimes , you get a little stir crazy , '' he said `` One of the things I look forward to after I 've had this extraordinary honor is just taking a walk or waking up on Saturday morning , not shaving and going to the local Starbucks and not having to worry about it . ''

The president was also asked to sing and dance , -LRB- which he refused -RRB- to say hello to one of the questioners ' young children , and from an Obama impersonator a question about the impact of comedy sketches on the election .

`` I do n't know if any of this stuff affects an election , but I know that it makes our country stronger that you can make fun of the president -- or anybody -- and everybody can get a laugh , '' President Obama said . `` And that also makes sure to remind me that I work for you guys . ''

Most of the forum , which came in the form of live video connections and video YouTube questions , focused on the economy .

`` We 're starting to see some signs that the economy is picking up . We 've created 3 million jobs over 22 months , and we saw the largest boost in manufacturing jobs that we 've seen since the '90s . Best job growth we 've seen since 2005 . But we 've still got a lot more to do , '' President Obama said . `` I have to keep this recovery going , that 's why it 's so important for us to extend the payroll tax cut . ''

The live video chat room included five Americans in cities across the country . Participants were able to follow up with the president after his answers in real time .

Jennifer Wedel in Corpus Christi , Texas , asked the president why the government continues to extend visas for immigrant workers when there are many people , like her husband , who have been out of work .

President Obama offered to look at her husband 's resume to help him find an engineering job . `` Forward me his resume , '' he told her . `` The word we 're getting is someone in that high-tech field should be able to find something right away . I want to follow up on that . ''

The questions were chosen by Google team members from among the most top-rated of those submitted . Google maintains the White House had no role in the selection of the participants .

Obama also held a similar Facebook town hall at the Web giant 's headquarters in Palo Alto , California , in the spring , and a YouTube town hall at the White House in February .
