-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As World Cup openers go , this was about as bad as it gets for Portugal .

Thumped 4-0 by Germany , one key defender sent off , another possibly out of the tournament with injury and its World Player of the Year looking decidedly unfit .

Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo was n't lacking in effort but was as powerless as those around him to prevent Portugal being steamrollered by Der Mannschaft in Salvador .

It started badly for Paulo Bento 's men and got steadily worse as Germany maintained its record of scoring at least four goals in every opening World Cup match since 2002 .

They were 1-0 down after 10 minutes when Joao Pereira was adjudged to have hauled down Mario Gotze . Fellow Bayern Munich star Thomas Muller confidently slotted home the penalty .

It was 2-0 when Mats Hummels thumped a header into the net from Toni Kroos ' corner .

Just five minutes later , Real Madrid defender Pepe tangled with Muller , who sank theatrically to the turf claiming a hand to the face .

Pepe then stood over his opponent and pushed his head towards Muller 's , the referee producing a straight red card .

Muller then struck just before the interval to put the game well beyond Portugal , pouncing on a loose ball inside the area to fire past Rui Patricio .

Portugal made a change at the break , as Ricardo Costa replaced Miguel Veloso , but it made little difference as Germany continued to press home their advantage .

Mesut Ozil , who plays for Arsenal , should have found the net when played through on goal but he hit his shot straight at Patricio .

With Pepe already off the field , another Portuguese defender joined him -- this time through injury rather than red card -- when Fabio Coentrao pulled up with what looked like a hamstring injury and departed on a stretcher .

Germany squandered several counter attacking opportunities before Muller completed a memorable hat-trick on 78 minutes , stabbing a shot into the net after Andre Schurrle 's cross had been parried by the goalkeeper .

The 24-year-old was top scorer at the last World Cup in South Africa , netting five goals in six games . He now has 20 goals in 50 internationals for Germany .

Ronaldo nearly opened his World Cup account in stoppage time but Manuel Neuer saved brilliantly from his fierce free kick .

`` Winning was our only option and the team went out there with that in mind , '' Germany coach Joachim Low was quoted as saying by FIFA 's official website .

`` Thomas -LRB- Muller -RRB- did really well in attack and created a lot of space for us . ''

Iran 0-0 Nigeria

Meanwhile in Group F , Iran and Nigeria shared the first draw of the competition in Curitiba .

It was the 13th match of Brazil 2014 and it proved unlucky for football fans as it finished in a stalemate .

Both teams struggled to create goalscoring opportunities in a drab contest , although Iran missed a golden chance in the first half .

Iran 's first corner gave striker Reza Ghoochannejad the chance to open the scoring , but Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama stretched to save his near-post header .

Nigeria , crowned African champions in 2013 , were expected to win the game comfortably but the `` Super Eagles '' failed to seriously threaten the Iranian goal .

The result leaves Argentina top of the group after a 2-1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina on Sunday .

Iran faces Argentina on Saturday in Belo Horizonte , while Nigeria travels to Cuiaba to play Bosnia .
