-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On a clear dry day , driving 55 mph , it takes long-haul trucker Camille Pask the length of three football fields to stop her fully loaded rig .

`` Just because we have more wheels does n't mean we can stop faster , '' said Pask , whose truck can weigh as much as 80,000 pounds when packed .

This is the busy season for Pask , who will be working through the Thanksgiving holiday to deliver goods for the Christmas shopping season .

It 's also the busiest travel period of the year for Americans , when travel veterans and amateurs converge en route to turkey dinners -- or just another day on the job . About 43.6 million people are expected to travel at least 50 miles from home between November 21 and November 25 for the holiday , an increase of 0.7 % over last year .

More Americans expected to hit the road for Thanksgiving

Everyone wants a safe , happy holiday , so we asked workers on the front lines of the Thanksgiving crush for their hard-earned tips for smooth travels .

As Thursday rolls closer and the roads get more crowded with impatient drivers , Pask would like them to stay clear of larger trucks .

Knowing that 80,000 pounds is barreling along in the lane beside you , why would you ever cut off a semi ?

Another tip : If you ca n't see her mirrors , she ca n't see you . And she ca n't ever see any cars that ride in tandem with her on the right side . `` That 's one of our major blind spots for small vehicles passing us on the right , '' she said . `` It 's a really dangerous spot to be . ''

Leave enough time for traffic jams

With about 39 million drivers hitting the road this holiday , travelers need to leave enough time for unexpected delays . A minor traffic accident can back up traffic for hours on some of the nation 's highways .

During the holidays , `` there are an awful lot of accidents , '' said Fran Ehret , a toll collector on the New Jersey Turnpike for 26 years and now president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 194 , which represents the turnpike toll collectors .

`` Leave enough time to get where you 're going so you 're not having to drive too fast , '' she said .

If you do n't regularly use toll booths and do n't have an electronic pass to pay the toll , pay close attention to the signs directing drivers to cashier-staffed booths .

`` You do n't want to pull into an E-ZPass lane if you 're paying cash , '' said Ehret . You could cause traffic delays , and `` you 'll get a bill with a fee attached to it . ''

And please do n't yell or curse out your toll collector or your fellow drivers because traffic is heavy or lanes are merging into the toll plaza . Pay your toll and drive on !

`` People 's personalities change when they get behind the wheel of their cars . You meet them in their personal lives and they would n't act like that , '' Ehret said .

Research air travel security rules

There is no getting around it : All 3 million travelers flying to their destinations during the Thanksgiving holiday will have to pass through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints . Some of them will be traveling with food for the feast . The TSA has posted special guidance online for travelers toting culinary creations .

More air travel means more airplane maintenance

TSA officers Jackie Fitzpatrick and Charles Link promise they do n't want to take away your pies . Really .

`` We know there 's pressure to make that plane or you 're traveling with family or bringing special foods you do n't want to get squished , '' said Fitzpatrick .

`` It 's all about the pies at the holidays , '' added Link . `` Apple , coconut . Testing will be done , but -LRB- pies -RRB- are allowed . ''

Fitzpatrick and Link , who supervise security checkpoints at New York City 's LaGuardia Airport , are going Italian on Thanksgiving Day and will be making pasta salad and baked ziti , respectively , for staff potlucks .

For travelers working their way toward a friend or family 's table with a tasty contribution , just do a little advance research at the TSA website to know what you can bring and how much you can bring . In the case of your specially made foods , they might need a little extra security , and they ca n't violate the agency 's 3-ounce liquid rules . The agency also has a mobile app that provides information on checkpoint wait times , prohibited items and airport status .

Video games fall under the laptop rule and must be placed in a separate bin as they go through security machines . And snow globes ca n't be larger than a tennis ball .

If you 're getting a head start on Christmas , do n't wrap presents beforehand . The TSA may have to unwrap gifts , which could be sad if your child sees the light saber that Santa is bringing him .

And no toy guns or weapons , please . They wo n't be allowed to pass through security . It does n't matter that they 're not real weapons . Security officials wo n't allow anything weapon-like because it might scare your fellow passengers or the crew .

People with medical issues should call TSA Cares -LRB- 855-787-2227 -RRB- before they travel to see if they need to take any extra steps or if they qualify for extra assistance to clear security .

Do n't overpack

Southwest Airlines flight attendant Barb Pool can spot the travelers who have overpacked and rushed to get to the airport in time .

Pool advises travelers to pack in advance , check as much baggage as possible , research TSA rules about what you can bring , and leave behind contingency supplies that will be available at your destination . -LRB- Southwest allows two free checked bags , JetBlue allows one , and some airlines let frequent fliers and airline credit card holders check a bag for free . -RRB-

`` Do whatever it takes to not stress , '' said Pool , who often celebrates the holidays in advance with her family . `` People get on a plane and are stuck for so many hours . It 's not a fun journey if you 're stressed . ''

Pool tends to find joy in many of her flights , whether it 's holding a baby as nervous parents stow their bags , talking to military personnel heading home on leave , or helping people with disabilities get settled .

`` Most of the time they 're preoccupied , but every once in a while they 'll offer to take you home for Thanksgiving , '' she said . `` Elderly people especially realize you 're not going to be with your family . ''

She also knows that something larger might be stressing out her customers .

`` Everyone 's not always traveling for happy events , '' she said . `` They might be fighting tears . It could be their first year without a spouse or they 're going to a funeral . Everyone 's not going to Grandma 's for dinner . I try to be extra sensitive to it . ''
