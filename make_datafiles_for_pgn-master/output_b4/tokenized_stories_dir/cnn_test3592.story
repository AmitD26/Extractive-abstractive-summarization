-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jason Collins is a big , end-of-bench bruiser who can harangue opposing centers . And he 's gay .

Only one of those things matters -- at least publicly -- to NBA teams that might be considering his services for the 2013-14 season after his highly publicized coming out on Monday .

`` He 's a weird player in a sense , '' said Michael Lee , who covers the Wizards , Collins ' latest career stop , for The Washington Post . `` He 's nothing spectacular , never stood out , but he 's still an effective player in terms of what he does . ''

That rÃ © sumÃ © includes physical defense and an ability to bang in the paint with imposing big men like Dwight Howard and Brook Lopez , as well as a willingness to dish out all six of his fouls , Lee said . It includes a strong basketball IQ , a team mentality and a few other intangibles , such as the ability to set screens .

`` I 've had players tell me , ` When he comes to set a screen , you 're going to get open , ' '' Lee said .

Opinion : Here 's to Collins -- and the NBA

What it does not include is the ability to fill up a stat sheet . Over 12 seasons , he has a career average of 3.6 points per game , and he has n't averaged more than 2 points a games since his 2006-07 season as a New Jersey Net .

Many 7-footers who fill the lane are known for their blocking or rebounding ability , but despite being taken in the first round of the 2001 draft , out of Stanford , Collins has never averaged more than 6.1 rebounds a game -LRB- during the 2004-05 season at that -RRB- , and he 's never been a prodigious shot blocker .

There 's been much talk about what it means for basketball and the LGBT community if he 's not signed after coming out , but Lee said he feels that teams will be more concerned with his 35th birthday coming in December and that he appeared in only six games , averaging 10 minutes per outing , for the Wizards .

He 'll also command almost $ 1.4 million , the NBA minimum salary for a player with 10 or more years in the league .

`` That will go against him more than sexual orientation , '' Lee said .

That 's not to say that there is n't a place for him in the NBA . Even if he is n't picked up ahead of next season , a team may seek his services as injuries pile up and the February trade deadline nears .

Von DuBose , an Atlanta-based attorney and NFL contract negotiator who has represented NBA players in off-the-court matters , likens Collins to Marcus Camby or Juwan Howard , a fraternity of `` bigger post guys who do n't rely on their quicks or perimeter play to survive . ''

Sure , Camby and Howard had more impressive career stats , but as they 've grown older -- Camby is 39 , Howard 40 -- they 've settled into more utilitarian roles , coming off the bench for a few minutes a game .

While most of the reaction to Collins ' announcement has been positive , DuBose said it 's possible his sexual orientation could affect his future , especially if an NBA general manager feels his team is too immature to handle the addition of the league 's first openly gay player .

`` That GM , without divulging publicly that he had considered it , may go in a different direction , '' DuBose said .

Collins needs to go to a team with solid structure and an assertive coach and GM , Lee said . A cast of veterans will also help , as older players are more likely to be focused on winning than on whining about a teammate being gay .

`` It 'll probably have to be a veteran team that just needs a piece at the end of its bench , '' Lee said .

While it 's unclear , despite the myriad messages of support , what will happen if and when Collins next steps into a locker room , Lee said Collins has garnered a lot of good will , credibility and respect during his dozen years in the league . He 's a leader , and his teammates have always liked him , he said .

On the flip side of that equation , Lee and DuBose do n't foresee a team picking up Collins because he 's gay , as that would immediately devalue him among his teammates .

Brazile : But can the dude play ?

`` I do n't think people were tuning in to see Jason Collins play , '' DuBose said . `` They may never see him play anyway . He 's probably not going to get a ton of minutes . ''

For the moment , though , Collins is the subject of intense attention that has nothing to do with his basketball prowess .

`` He 's in the process of taking ownership over the here and now , which is actually coming out , '' Carolyn Moos , a Stanford grad and former WNBA player who dated Collins for eight years , told CNN 's Piers Morgan on Tuesday night . `` And that can be very , I assume , overwhelming . ''

Moos says it will be a process , much like it was for her after Collins called off their 2009 engagement and upon learning -- in calls he made to her starting this past weekend -- that her longtime love , with whom she 'd planned a marriage and a family , was gay .

`` I hope -LRB- it -RRB- is a natural progression for him , '' Moos said , as he becomes more comfortable with himself . I think time will allow more perspective on it as well . ''

Collins newfound stature in the gay rights movement , and the public eye , may open the door to some opportunities , such as off-the-court lessons on inclusiveness , DuBose said .

But he did n't see how that would translate into additional revenue . Wizards spokesman Scott Hall said that while every jersey the club sold Monday had Collins ' name on it , `` it was not a large amount . ''

`` I think it would be a terrible move to try to sign him for financial gain or rating , '' Lee said . `` He has too much respect for himself to be used for something other than what he is , which is a basketball player . ''

At least one NBA executive , Golden State Warriors President and COO Rick Welts , who in 2011 became the first openly gay American sports executive , said he does n't think Collins ' announcement will have any effect on him being signed for the 2013-14 season .

`` I think whatever percentage chance Jason had of being on an NBA roster when he woke up yesterday is probably identical this morning , '' he said . `` Actually , I 'll take that back . ... If he was 7 feet tall yesterday morning , my guess is with the weight that was lifted off his shoulders yesterday , he is probably 7 ' 2 '' , so that might improve his chances . ''
