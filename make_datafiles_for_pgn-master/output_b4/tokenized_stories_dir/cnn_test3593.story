-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There 's some work to be done to get United States airports on par with their global competitors . This is according to President Obama , who highlighted poor U.S. airport rankings during a press conference Tuesday .

`` Just one interesting statistic when it comes to airports . There was a recent survey of the top airports in the country -- in the world -- and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25 . Not one -- not one U.S. airport was considered by the experts and consumers who use these airports to be in the top 25 in the world . I think Cincinnati airport came in around 30th , '' Obama said as he addressed questions about the contentious debate over forced government budget cuts and the recent Federal Aviation Administration furloughs .

Politics aside , the president is correct that Cincinnati 's airport was ranked 30th on a recent list of the world 's top 100 airports . Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport was the first U.S. airport to appear on the list , released earlier this month as part of the Skytrax World Airport Awards .

And the world 's best airport is ...

Singapore Changi Airport took the No. 1 spot , followed by Incheon International Airport in Seoul . Amsterdam 's Schiphol Airport ranked third . Of the top 10 airports , five were in Asia and four were in Europe . Vancouver International Airport , ranked No. 8 , was the only North American airport to make the top 10 .

17 U.S. airports made the top 100 :

No. 30 : Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport

No. 36 : Denver International Airport

No. 40 : San Francisco International Airport

No. 48 : Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport

No. 54 : Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport

No. 62 : Seattle-Tacoma International Airport

No. 63 : New York JFK International Airport

No. 71 : Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport

No. 79 : Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport

No. 80 : Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport

No. 84 : Chicago O'Hare International Airport

No. 86 : Raleigh-Durham International Airport

Skytrax 's World Airport Awards are based on 12.1 million survey questionnaires filled out by passengers covering 108 different nationalities and 395 airports worldwide during a nine-month survey period in 2012 and 2013 . The survey asked travelers about departures , arrivals and airport transit and includes questions about terminal amenities , comfort and cleanliness , security , staffing and other elements of the airport experience .

What do you think ? Are U.S. airports underrated or in need of improvement ? Which airports need the most work ? What specifically needs addressing ?
