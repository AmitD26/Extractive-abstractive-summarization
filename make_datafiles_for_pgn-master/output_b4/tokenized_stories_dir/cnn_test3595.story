-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A French job-seeker has `` sold '' himself with an online resume made to look like an Amazon page , proving that some creativity and attention to personal branding can go a long way .

Philippe Dubost began his trawl for a new job as a web product manager in late December .

Depressed by the thought of sending a regular resume into the ether as part of the usual job application process , he built his to look like an Amazon page , complete with product dimensions , five-star ratings , world-wide shipping and even a gift-wrap option .

`` Amazon 's pages just naturally fit the form of a resume , '' he said . `` I just thought that if a company thinks that this is fun , then that 's a company I would like to work for . ''

`` At first I sent it out as a link with the normal job applications I was sending , but then sent an email to a popular French blog saying ` Hey guys , if you 're bored and have nothing to look at ... ' ''

That was the beginning of last week . From there its journey across blogs and social media has propelled it from around 500 hits a day to over 200,000 , and the page has gained over 27,000 Facebook `` likes '' .

But more than just being a fleeting Internet sensation , Dubost 's Amazon resume has also done what it was designed for .

From the 800 or so messages he has received over 100 have been work-related with job offers coming from across Asia and Europe .

`` Quite a few are great and are really fit what I 'm looking for , '' he said .

Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery and Dubost admits that Amazon is one of the companies he greatly admires and would like to work for . However he remains tight-lipped about how the company has responded , or even if it have contacted him at all .

As well as being a smart piece of design , the creative resume also shows Dubost 's personality , something he believes has helped it reach its target audience .

`` It made me realize how important personal branding is , '' he says .

Whitney Johnson , author and career and life advisor agrees : `` Personal packaging is absolutely vital '' she says .

`` If you think about it , people do n't buy products , they hire them to do a job . You have to figure out a way to make employers believe that you 're the person who can get a job done . It is not the responsibility of any future employer to figure out how the employee can do the job , it 's the employee 's responsibility . ''

Dubost 's advice to others is to do what you can to differentiate yourself from other would-be job-hunters and be creative with it .

`` Although that does n't apply for all industries ; if I was an accountant it 's not the same , '' he says . `` But you can always do something that is relevant to the industry you work in . ''

The overwhelming response to Dubost 's experiment did make him question if he should n't take his career in a different direction instead of just search for a new job .

`` It occurred to me , and many friends said the same , that maybe I should -LRB- do something different -RRB- . But in the end I did this for a job and it has opened up opportunities with companies I really want to work for . I was so completely not expecting this . ''
