-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Never have so many been so outraged by so little .

We live in a time of instant outrage . The explosion of social media and the demands of the 24-hour news cycle let us immediately express our self-righteous anger about any incident , while the content-desperate media eagerly report -- and repackage -- our rage .

Outrage has become conveniently instantaneous . In the years before social media , people who were truly outraged would have to get a piece of paper , type a letter , put it in an envelope , stamp it and drop it in a mailbox . In contrast , today you can use your thumb to type a tweet on your phone and simply click `` Tweet . '' Your rage is communicated to the world .

Just this week , we saw instant outrage on full display in response to Seth MacFarlane 's jokes at Sunday 's Oscars . Amazingly , MacFarlane offended almost every group in America in one show . He was accused of being sexist , anti-Semitic , homophobic and racist . -LRB- It has to be an Oscar record . -RRB- Did Oscar organizers possibly hire MacFarlane to trigger our instant outrage for their own benefit ? After all , they knew he 'd say outrageous things .

Any chance they wanted the public backlash to make the show , which has seen ratings woes in recent years , more relevant ? -LRB- And ratings did rise for Sunday 's Oscar telecast 11 % in the coveted 18-49 age group . -RRB- Make no mistake : Our outrage has value .

More recently , comedian Joan Rivers found herself the subject of outrage for a joke she made this week invoking the Holocaust . The media are now filled with people debating the `` important '' question : Did Rivers go too far ? -LRB- Will the media ever stop asking that tired question about comedians ' jokes ?! -RRB-

Instant outrage , however , is not just reserved for comedians ; it crops up all over the news cycle . We saw it this week over Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer 's new policy banning telecommuting in the company she 's been hired to revive , meaning people have to work from the office every day or quit . Twitter lit up : It 's outrageous !

It even happened to me last weekend when I was on CNN with anchor Don Lemon and playfully joked about Canada . Bingo ! My Twitter feed was instantly filled with Canadians incensed that I had the audacity to poke fun at their beloved country . Just to be clear , I have nothing against Canada . In fact , it 's my third favorite country in North America .

There 's so much more : Beyonce 's halftime Super Bowl outfit ; Hulk Hogan tweeting a photo of his daughter 's legs ; Kim Kardashian tweeting a photo of her diamond-encrusted gun ; NBA star LeBron James wearing a T-shirt that some claim was about devil worship and/or a symbol for the illuminati .

I get it . We all want to have our opinions heard . When we are mad about something , we want others to know about it . When we are offended , we want to call out the person who has offended us . I 'm no different .

But here 's the thing : Why not also unleash our collective fury over issues more meaningful than just a comedian 's joke or a celebrity 's tweet ? I 'm not suggesting we ignore those -- because even if I did , no one would listen . But in addition to those , take a moment to express your powerful outrage over issues that might tangibly benefit your life and the lives of others .

Let 's get collectively angry that every nine seconds , a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten . And let 's get even angrier that three women a day in the United States are killed by domestic violence attacks .

Let 's get really pissed that 22 % of American children are living in poverty . And please save some -LRB- actually a lot -RRB- of outrage for Congress , which has become the political equivalent of Lindsay Lohan : We only see it in media coverage doing bad things .

Sure , go ahead and be outraged over Joan Rivers ' and Seth MacFarlane 's jokes if you must , but let 's show some anger about the fact that almost 10,000 Americans died in gun violence last year and still Congress has n't passed a universal background check to ensure that criminals and mentally ill people ca n't legally buy guns .

So let 's collectively tweet away about the issues that outrage us , be they stupid comments or Syria , comedians ' jokes or the growing income inequality in America . But please do n't just reserve all your outrage for celebrities . They simply are n't worthy of it .
