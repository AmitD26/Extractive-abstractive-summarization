San Salvador , El Salvador -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The plea of a pregnant woman to be granted an abortion has gripped El Salvador for months : She wanted an abortion after doctors told her that her baby would not survive outside the womb and that her life was at risk .

But abortion is illegal without exceptions in El Salvador , and on Wednesday , the country 's Supreme Court denied her petition .

Atttorneys for the 22-year-old woman , known only as `` Beatriz , '' argued that the mother 's life was at risk if the pregnancy was not terminated .

In a 3-1 vote , the justices ruled the risk to Beatriz 's life was not imminent but a possibility in the future .

`` This court finds that the rights of the mother can not be prioritized over those of the -LRB- fetus -RRB- nor vice versa , '' the ruling said .

The ruling found that doctors must continue to monitor the woman and make the best medical decisions that take into account the risks to her life , and to the unborn baby , too .

Beatriz is suffering from lupus and kidney problems , and her unborn child developed without parts of the brain or skull . She asked for an abortion so that doctors could focus on saving her life , but doctors were hesitant to carry out the procedure without assurances that they would n't be prosecuted , her attorneys said . Doctors said they expect the baby to survive only for hours after birth .

She argued that an abortion could save her life and allow her to care for her other child , who is a year old .

Anti-abortion groups countered that abortion-rights advocates were using Beatriz as an opening to push for changes to abortion laws .

`` The constitution makes it clear that life exists from the moment of conception , and anything that tries to end a life is murder , '' lawmaker Rodolfo Parker said after the ruling .

Women 's rights groups who have held rallies in support of Beatriz said they were disappointed by the ruling and criticized the high court for taking weeks to reach a decision .

`` There has to be a prudent period -LRB- to make a decision -RRB- that does n't take practically a month and a half like we waited to have a serious analysis , '' said Ima Guirola of the rights group CEMUJER .

The court 's decision is not the end of the Beatriz 's options . Her family has said she is considering traveling outside the country to a place where an abortion can be carried out legally .
