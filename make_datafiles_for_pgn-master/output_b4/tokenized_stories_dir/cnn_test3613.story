-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It seems George W. Bush can take a joke -- and tell one .

But before the former President sat down with Jay Leno on the Tonight Show late Tuesday , the comedian turned his successor , Barack Obama , into the brunt of his hard jabs .

Leno raked him over the coals over Obamacare .

`` Better him than me , '' Bush quipped afterward , relieved . He 's happy to be out of line of fire .

`` Eight years is plenty , '' he said . `` I do n't miss the spotlight . ''

Bush has largely avoided it since he left the White House in 2009 , and Leno could n't help but immediately pry into the reason why .

Leno told the 43rd president that he was surprised that he agreed to appear this time . It was Bush 's fourth appearance on the show .

Bush used the opening to land the first shot at the late-night host , who will go off the air next spring after 20 years on the tube .

`` You 're about to head out to pasture . Just wanted to see what you look like , before you got to the gate , '' he said to laughs .

Legacy

Then came his serious answer .

`` I do n't think it 's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor , '' Bush said .

As he has often in the past , Bush said that history will judge his legacy . But he did n't appear concerned .

Historians are still preoccupied with George Washington , he said . `` If they 're still writing biographies of the first guy , the 43rd guy does n't need to worry . ''

Leno asked him for some advice to the sitting President on dealing with tough decisions .

`` You have to believe in what you 're doing , '' he said . Family , faith and a good team helped him deal with the rest , when he was President , Bush said .

President Obama 's approval ratings have taken a pounding in the wake of the technical glitches that have plagued the launch of the Affordable Care Act .

Bush knows what public scorn feels like . But he said he did not take opinion poll numbers to heart .

`` The only poll that really mattered was on Election Day . My first election was a little closer than I wanted , '' he said , grinning over one of many moments of self-deprecation .

Retirement

Retirement seems to have afforded Bush opportunities for fun and fulfilling charity work .

He and his wife Laura travel often to Africa , where the Bush Institute runs health initiatives .

Leno showed a video of Bush dancing with locals in Zambia , making them laugh , and photo of the former Chief Executive painting a clinic .

It 's a good message to leaders around the world , Bush said .

`` If it 's OK for the President to be painting and scraping , it 's OK for them to be painting and scraping . ''

Bush joked that he has taken up a new profession since retiring from the Oval Office .

`` I am a painter , '' he told Leno with a straight face . Leno asked , if he would add that to his resume .

`` You may not think I 'm a painter ; I think I 'm a painter , '' Bush added with a sly smile .

Bush made a gift to Leno of a portrait of the comedian , which he painted himself . He has been taking lessons in Dallas , and the results show .

When he first met his teacher , Bush said he told her :

`` There 's a Rembrandt trapped in this body . Your job is to find him . ''
