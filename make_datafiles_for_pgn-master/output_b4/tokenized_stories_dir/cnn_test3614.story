-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Playing professional sport is many people 's idea of the perfect job , but that does n't mean sportsmen are immune to feeling the strain of working life .

Just ask cricketer Jonathan Trott , who has pulled out of England 's tour of Australia because of a stress-related illness .

England lost the first Ashes test against Australia -- one of sport 's great rivalries -- with batsman Trott scoring 19 runs in two innings when he struggled against Mitchell Johnson 's fast bowling .

`` I do n't feel it 's right that I 'm playing knowing that I 'm not 100 % and I can not currently operate at the level I have done in the past , '' said the 32-year-old Trott .

`` My priority now is to take a break from cricket so that I can focus on my recovery . I want to wish my teammates all the very best for the remainder of the tour . ''

England were beaten heavily in the first test -- the tourists suffered a 381-run defeat in Brisbane -- and Australian batsman David Warner labeled their batting `` poor and weak . ''

Warner also claimed England 's batsmen had `` scared eyes . ''

Ashes series are traditionally characterized by gamesmanship and competitive verbal jousting -- known as `` sledging '' -- between the two sets of players .

`` On the pitch it 's pretty much a war , is n't it ? '' said England captain Alastair Cook after his side 's comprehensive defeat .

`` There are always going to be a few battles and a few words , but on the pitch is fine .

`` There were a lot of things said that we think have been disrespectful , but you have to give the Aussies credit for how they played . ''

At one point in the match when James Anderson faced Johnson television stump microphones picked up Australian captain Michael Clarke telling the England bowler to `` get ready for a broken f ****** arm . ''

But Clarke defended the hostile verbal atmosphere that often goes on in a game .

`` I 'm not going to go into what 's been said on the field - I think that 's part and parcel of the game , '' said the Australian captain .

`` I 've heard a lot worse said on the cricket field than anything the Australian players or the England players have said throughout this test match .

`` Both teams want to win so badly . We all respect the traditions of the game - there is a line , and both teams should not overstep that line .

`` I 'm sure there 's plenty of things that are said on the field that you wo n't overhear on the stump microphone . There is certainly no single England player that we have any vendetta against . ''

Trott is not the first England cricketer to pull out of a tour with a stress-related illness .

Batsman Marcus Trescothick left the 2005-06 India tour and the 2006-07 Ashes tour of Australia , while bowler Michael Yardy came home from the 2011 World Cup .

`` Jonathan Trott is an incredibly talented cricketer who has proven himself time and again for England , '' said managing director England cricket Hugh Morris .

`` The cricket side of things is unimportant now , all that matters is that Jonathan is given the time , support and space he needs to recover .

`` We fully support his decision to leave the tour and the ECB will provide all the assistance we can to help Jonathan and his family through this period .

`` Jonathan has asked for privacy while he recovers and I would urge everyone to respect that . ''

Many past and present sports stars were quick to rally round Trott .

`` Feeling for Jonathan Trott , '' tweeted former Australian bowler Shane Warne . `` I hope he and his family are left alone by all media & he 's able to recover quickly & return to the Eng team ! ''

Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville tweeted : `` Hope Trott is OK and back soon . Test Cricket is tough and we are going to see a major Ashes battle in the next few months . ''
