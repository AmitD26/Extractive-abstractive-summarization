Based on Mandela 's autobiography , also called `` Long Walk to Freedom , '' the biopic follows Mandela 's life journey from his childhood growing up in a rural village , through the anti-apartheid struggle and prison years , to his inauguration as the first democratically elected president of South Africa .

The film 's producer , South African Anant Singh , says he first started corresponding with Mandela about the movie 's rights when the iconic leader was still behind bars .

Singh announced Tuesday that the film will be screened at the White House on November 7 .

`` It is an exceptional honor to have the film screening hosted by President Obama at the White House as it is the first for a South African film , '' said the movie producer . `` It is also of special significance as it connects Madiba and President Obama as statesmen who were responsible for major paradigm shifts in their respective countries and who have special places in the hearts of their people .
