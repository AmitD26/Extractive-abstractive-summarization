-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the world says goodbye to Nelson Mandela , the task of ensuring his legacy becomes the world 's responsibility .

His life has been described as an evolution from militant freedom fighter , to prisoner , to unifying figure and eventual elder statesman -- in the process winning the hearts and minds of world leaders and average citizens alike .

In his 95 years he accomplished what many thought impossible . Held prisoner for 27 years and later becoming South Africa 's first democratically elected president , he practiced reflection , negotiation and incredible stubbornness . His capacity for forgiveness and reconciliation made him one of the most remarkable and respected individuals of modern times .

Whether it 's battling racism , offering a helping hand or long-overdue forgiveness , here are several practical suggestions to keep Mandela 's legacy alive .

Make the best of your current situation

`` It is possible that if I had not gone to jail and been able to read and listen to the stories of many people . ... I might not have learned these things , '' Mandela once said in 2000 during an interview with the Christian Science Monitor .

He said reading biographies helped him realize problems make some people , while destroying others .

His mother and eldest son both died while he was imprisoned .

While he had ample reason to remain bitter about his mistreatment , instead he wrote in `` Long Walk to Freedom , '' his 1995 autobiography , `` Prison is itself a tremendous education in the need for patience and perseverance . It is , above all , a test of one 's commitment . ''

Do n't judge a book by its cover

`` I have been surprised a great deal sometimes when I see somebody who looks less than ordinary , but when you talk to the person and he -LRB- or she -RRB- opens his mouth , he is something completely different , '' Mandela said in the same interview about how his prison experience taught him to respect even the most ordinary people .

Anthony F. Lemieux , an associate professor of communication at Georgia State University in Atlanta said avoiding the temptation to put people in narrowly fixed categories is one of Mandela 's greatest legacies .

`` People are complex and dynamic , capable of change and evolving , '' Lemieux said . It would have been easy for Mandela to become and remain jaded after what he had experienced , Lemieux added .

Even for the people who kept Mandela locked up , the former president said they were n't bad people . `` Mr Mandela was at pains to point out that not every prison warder or apartheid official was bad . This view was underpinned throughout by his assertion that to get along in life one should see the good in all people , '' said a Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory statement on a collection of writings about his prison time .

Use your passion to persuade others

`` If you have an objective in life , then you want to concentrate on that and not engage in infighting with your enemies , '' Mandela continued during the interview . `` You want to create an atmosphere where you can move everybody toward the goal you have set for yourself . ''

Remaining focused on a goal despite adversity requires a deep level of commitment . Ask anyone whose ever overcome great odds to achieve their version of greatness .

Lemieux said different situations are going to draw different things out people , but it 's never as simple as distilling the experience down to a `` type of person . '' Practically none of us knows how we will react in complex situations and interactions .

Change yourself first

`` One of the most difficult things is not to change society -- but to change yourself , '' Mandela said in 1999 at a tribute to billionaire businessman Douw Steyn , who had made his Johannesburg residence available to Mandela as a retreat after his prison release in 1990 .

While Mandela clearly fought for change in the world he lived in , he also changed himself .

While imprisoned , he reflected on his `` wild man '' behaviors . He also said he neglected to show any gratitude to those who had helped him when he was poor , after he experienced some success as a lawyer .

Lemieux points out his change from violence to peace was profound . Throughout the violence and chaos , ultimately , `` It was n't the violent conflict that led to social change . ''

Do n't be afraid to acknowledge weaknesses

`` If you come across as a saint , people can become very discouraged . I was once a young man and I did all the things young men do , '' Mandela told the Christian Science Monitor .

`` In his twilight , Mandela was at pains to publish and acknowledge his weaknesses and shortcomings in his family life , in his relationships with women and his first wife , Evelyn , '' John Battersby wrote for CNN . `` He was keen to dispel any notion of sainthood that might be bestowed on him . To this day , Mandela 's weaknesses , his turbulent youth and his sometimes tempestuous relationships with women can still detract from the iconic status that Mandela achieved in his own lifetime .

`` But , the responsible airing of his weaknesses -- including his own acknowledgment -- in fact humanized Mandela and focused on his extraordinary strength of character and commitment in overcoming both his weaknesses and adversity in his own lifetime . It augmented Mandela 's greatness . ''

Get educated -- educate others

`` Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world , '' Mandela said during a speech at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg in 2003 .

Mandela failed twice to complete his bachelor 's degree and readily admitted he was a poor student . Eventually he earned a law degree .

Six weeks after being elected President in 1994 , Mandela called on South Africans to solve the country 's `` profound education crisis , '' Bloomberg reported this year .

`` The task to make South Africa a learning and learned nation belongs to all of us , '' he said in a speech .

But the country 's schools are near the bottom in international rankings . Unqualified teachers , inadequate training and corruption are among the problems . Still , officials say almost all South African children now attend school , Bloomeberg reported .

Look people in the eye and shake their hands

`` Nelson Mandela made such a common gesture something transcendent -- a greeting that crossed all societal barriers , a symbol of reconciliation , even a declaration of victory , '' wrote CNN 's Tom Cohen in his piece , `` Nelson Mandela : Man of many handshakes . ''

Before meeting visiting dignitaries or political adversaries in five-star hotel conference rooms , Mandela made sure to approach the security guards , servers and other workers outside to shake their hands , Cohen wrote .

They went wild when Mandela concluded his final statement during a conference by offering his hand to F.W. de Klerk , South Africa 's last apartheid-era president , as an expression of unity , saying that despite their differences , he was willing to work with his adversary . De Klerk had little choice but to grasp it .

`` I look at not only how people treat me , but how they treat others , '' Lemieux said . `` Sometimes this -LRB- how they treat others -RRB- is more important . ''

A simple handshake , Lemieux said , can convey to others that the person making the gesture is demonstrating the belief that , `` this person has value , has a perspective . ''

Maintain a sense of humor

`` You sharpen your ideas by reducing yourself to the level of the people you are with and a sense of humor and a complete relaxation , even when you 're discussing serious things , does help to mobilise friends around you . And I love that , '' Mandela said in a 2005 interview , published by the Nelson Mandela Foundation .

At election rallies in 1994 , Cohen wrote , Mandela repeatedly elicited trilling howls of ululation from women of all ages when he explained how voters should search their ballots for the picture of the `` very handsome young man '' -- referring to himself -- to mark their support for the ANC .

CNN 's Robyn Curnow examined Mandela 's the importance of his ability to `` charm and cajole . ''

`` The cult of Mandela had become so pronounced that celebrities , world leaders and ordinary people often became tongue-tied and gibbering when they met him , '' she said . `` Self-mockery was a typically savvy Mandela ploy to ensure that people would relax around him . ''

Forgive

`` It enables me to go to bed with an enriching feeling in my soul and the belief that I am changing myself -LSB- by reconciling with former adversaries -RSB- , '' Mandela told the Christian Science Monitor about his experiences with Douw Steyn .

Steyn was a white businessman who befriended Mandela and began sharing his resources with the poor .

`` For someone who had been imprisoned , it -LRB- forgiveness -RRB- was a fundamentally transformative experience , '' Lemieux said . He explained that people unable to forgive may experience an inability to move forward .

Johann Lochner was a Johannesburg police officer from 1986 to 1990 . In an essay submitted to CNN iReport , Lochner describes responding to a shopping mall bombing scene and stepping over body parts .

`` We suspected that the deceased may have been affiliated with the Umkhonto we Sizwe , the militant arm of the African National Congress , '' Lochner wrote . He describes the police department , as well as the city , as `` greatly divided . ''

`` Mandela wanted to find a way to unite all the people of South Africa -- something only the power of forgiveness could produce , '' he said . `` To this day , I am so passionate about the role forgiveness played in Madiba 's life . I remember so clearly how I had to personally take steps to overcome the ingrained apartheid mentality in South Africa . ''

`` It 's almost like a miraculous , supernatural transformation had taken place in Mandela 's life , and consequently , in the whole nation .

`` Forgiveness freed Madiba , '' Lochner said , `` and forgiveness freed his country , ''
