-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A study by the Organization of American States concluded last month that many of the buildings in Haiti were so shoddily constructed that they were unlikely to survive any disaster , let alone an earthquake like the one that devastated Port-au-Prince on Tuesday , the man who supervised the report said Wednesday .

`` You could tell very easily that these buildings were not going to survive even a -LSB- magnitude -RSB- 2 earthquake , '' said Cletus Springer , director of the Department of Sustainable Development at OAS in Washington .

Structures were built on slopes without proper foundations or containment structures , using improper building practices , insufficient steel and insufficient attention to development control , the urban planner said .

Much of the poor-quality work can be traced to the grinding poverty pervasive in Haiti , he said . `` As we know , the poverty in Haiti lends itself to people building where they want , how they can , '' he said . `` It was our experience , especially coming out of Grenada , that in the poorer countries the construction quality standards are pretty lax , ''

`` Unfortunately , the earthquake yesterday has revealed that . ''

After Hurricane Ivan flattened much of Grenada in September 2004 , the OAS carried out a similar research effort , then helped the island nation strengthen its building practices , Springer said .

Within three years , artisans and engineers had been trained to strengthen that island 's building-control systems and procedures , he said . Even financing was addressed . `` We worked with the banks to be sure we could properly vet applications for mortgages . ''

But much of the Caribbean , including Haiti , has no building codes , he said . `` So now we need to work with the Haitian authorities to develop a building code that is suited to Haiti and its peculiar conditions . '' Those peculiarities include its location on a fault line and in the path of hurricanes .

Springer said the country must work with the private sector and the banking sector to devise a low-income building ethic for Haiti . `` Because of the poverty levels , not everybody 's going to be able to build to the exacting standards that a building code would require , '' Springer said .

Tuesday 's earthquake showed that even those buildings that should have been constructed to the highest standards -- hospitals , schools , the presidential palace -- collapsed , he said .

`` Schools , hospitals , all government facilities should be safe so that , in the event of catastrophes like these , these buildings can withstand these things so there can be some continuity in the operations of government and the private sector , '' he said .

`` Going forward , we need to help Haiti to build back better . '' That means building safer homes that can withstand hurricane-force winds and earthquakes of 7 magnitude , he said .

But any such effort will require a great deal of support from the international community and collaboration with universities so that they can train the next generation of engineers , construction workers and masons to help Port-au-Prince rebuild safely .

The report -- funded by the OAS and more than 100 pages in length -- has not been made public , he said . `` It was not produced for external consumption , '' he said , adding that he did not know when parts of it might be released .
