-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lake Louise specialist Aksel Lund Svindal secured his fifth Super-G win at the Canadian ski resort Sunday to put down an early marker in an Olympic season .

The Norwegian made the most of his experience on the lower part of the course to record a time of one minute 28.53 seconds -- 0.38 faster than second placed Matthias Mayer of Austria .

Svindal was winning at Lake Louise for the second straight year and his 22nd World Cup victory has taken him past Kjetil Andre Aamodt 's Norwegian record .

I think it 's cool , '' he said of beating the record .

`` It is something to know that my idol is at home and that I beat his record . I will call him later and I will see what he says . I think he must have some mixed feelings . ''

The win has also left him top of the overall World Cup standings , his cause helped when American hope Ted Ligety skied out on the top part of the course .

Svindal , a four-time World Cup champion in the Super-G , will also be defending his Olympic title in Sochi next February and on this early form will be favorite for gold again .

Only fourth in Saturday 's downhill behind Italy 's Dominik Paris , Svindal was behind Mayer at the mid section before powering to the finish .

Another Austrian , Georg Streitberger , occupied the final podium position .

Six of Svindal 's 22 wins have come at Lake Louise with Super-G success previously in 2005 , 2007 , 2011 and 2012 .

American Bode Miller continued his comeback to the World Cup circuit by taking 24th place , just ahead of Paris , who was unable to repeat his heroics on a technically demanding course , shrouded in fog .

On the women 's circuit , there was a first giant slalom success for 29-year-old Swede Jessica Lindell-Vikarby .

She held off the challenge of precocious American teenager Mikaela Shiffrin by just nine hundredths of a second over two legs at Beaver Creek in Colorado .

The race on the famous Birds of Prey course had a dramatic ending as 18-year-old Shiffrin , second last to go on the second run , took the lead from Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein .

But Lindell-Vikarby kept her nerve to disappoint the home crowd , who included many of Shiffrin 's family .

Earlier , Lara Gut 's bid for a third win of the Beaver Creek weekend came to an end when she skied out in the first leg .

Switzerland 's Gut had won Friday 's downhill and Saturday 's Super-G .
