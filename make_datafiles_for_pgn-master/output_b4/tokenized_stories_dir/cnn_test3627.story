-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The baseball players posed for a team photo of sorts -- but the signs they held had nothing to do with home runs or striking out .

Two of them toted a Venezuelan flag with `` SOS '' scrawled across the top . One knelt in front with a sign that said `` Pray for Venezuela . '' Another held a banner that read , `` Lejos pero no ausentes '' -LRB- far away but not absent -RRB- .

The Detroit Tigers teammates snapped the photo last week in a locker room in Lakeland , Florida , their spring training base .

A group of New York Mets posed for a similar shot this week , holding Venezuelan flags as they stood beside a baseball diamond in Port St. Lucie , Florida .

They may be rivals on the field , but the players from both teams share something in common : concern about events unfolding in their homeland , more than 1,500 miles away .

Weeks of massive street protests in Venezuela have left at least 13 people dead , more than 100 injured , and dozens detained after clashes between members of the opposition , backers of the government , law enforcement and armed groups .

`` We are really worried about what 's going on there , '' said Wilmer Flores , a 22-year-old infielder for the Mets . `` I have all my family there . All my friends are there . ''

He hails from Valencia , Venezuela , where the death of a beauty queen who was shot in the head during protests made international headlines .

He said he 's warned his family members not to go outside as protests rage .

`` From here , supporting VENEZUELA , '' Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera -- who 's from Maracay , Venezuela -- posted as he tweeted the photo with his teammates .

`` From here all united for Venezuela , '' Tigers infield coach Omar Vizquel wrote when he shared the photo .

Baseball is also a national pastime in the South American nation . And statistics show that Venezuelans represent the second largest group of foreign players in Major League Baseball .

The Mets have three Venezuelan players and a coach . On the Tigers ' 40-man roster this year , 10 players are from Venezuela .

And when the players speak out , people listen .

The Tigers photo has been re-tweeted nearly 10,000 times since Cabrera shared it , and more than 16,000 times from Vizquel 's account .

Some praised the players for their courage . But not all the responses were positive .

Some described them as hypocrites , slammed them for seeming to take sides or criticized them for not taking a firm enough stance .

In the polarized world of Venezuelan politics , there are no referees who step in to break up a fight .

`` Now no one can have an opinion . If you support someone , others attack you , and vice versa . And if you are neutral , you are not Venezuelan , '' Cabrera wrote back in response . `` What a sad reality . ''

Some players ' online posts have included the #SOSVenezuela tag used by members of the opposition to draw attention to Venezuela 's crisis . Others have said they are n't taking a political stand -- just pushing for peace .

The posts have drawn a response from Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro himself . In televised remarks , he implied that players were n't expressing their true feelings .

`` Venezuelan Major League players are being pressured to appear in portraits that say SOS Venezuela , '' Maduro said . `` The owners of the Major League teams have pressured our men . ''

Vizquel did n't mince words when he fired back on Twitter .

`` The only pressure we have is winning games , hitting and catching , '' he wrote . `` Sensibility and feelings are not pressured . ''

The face of one Mets coach , Edgardo Alfonzo , normally lights up when he talks about his home country . But now , weighing the situation , he says he 's overcome with sadness and feeling tense .

`` We never thought we were going to get where we are today . ... You feel so impotent not being able to do anything from here , just supporting our families and the Venezuelan people . And really , for all these people who have lost family members , it is so hard , '' he said . `` Everyone is worried . It 's like a ticking time bomb . Really , you do n't want it to continue . You want it to stop , once and for all . ''

It 's not just baseball players and coaches speaking out about Venezuela .

Miami Heat basketball player Chris Bosh tweeted a photo of his shoes during a game on Sunday , with `` SOS Venezuela '' written in white above the Nike swoosh .

Bosh told Bleacher Report he 'd been discussing the crisis with his wife , who 's half Venezuelan .

`` Kind of brushing up on it in the past week , '' he said . `` Crazy . Government kind of stopping everything . Inflation . Exports and imports have pretty much stopped . I know a couple of people that just came down from there , and work for me , and it 's just bad . You go to the grocery store , and there 's no groceries . No medicine . ''

Many Venezuelan baseball players say they hope to use their popularity and the popularity of their sport to send a message of peace that goes beyond politics .

They believe baseball is a sport that can bring people together , and they hope that their message is heard by the international community , as well as back at home .

`` We 're trying to promote peace , '' Alfonzo said . `` Because , to be an athlete , I think a lot of young people look up to us . That 's the way we can help . ''

There 's only one thing Alfonzo says he wants for his country : peace .

`` Just pray for Venezuela , '' he said . `` That 's all we ask . ''
