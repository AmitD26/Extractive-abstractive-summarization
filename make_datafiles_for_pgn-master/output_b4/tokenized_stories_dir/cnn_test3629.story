-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Not long ago I received a complaint from a co-worker that I had used the f-word in a tweet . I was quoting a lyric from the band Vampire Weekend : `` Who gives a f -- about an Oxford comma ? '' My answer was , of course , `` I do . '' The full quote , without the fig leaf , appears in my book `` The Glamour of Grammar . ''

I come by my f-wordiness honestly . My grandmother used it easily and could swear in three languages . My mother -- at the age of 94 -- drops an f-bomb in every telephone conversation . During a trivia game at her assisted living home , she could not think of the name of Peter , Paul , and Mary 's magic dragon , so she blurted : `` F -- the Magic Dragon , '' which now has become the family 's official title for the song .

The f-word is almost everywhere . While still not fit for polite society , it no longer carries the depth of taboo attributed to it in 1978 by that hero of foul mouthery George Carlin , who said in a comic monologue : `` The big one , the word f -- , that 's the one that hangs them up the most . ''

Its common usage in popular culture today may have transformed it into one of the most versatile words in American English . It might qualify as the word of the new century .

But is that a good thing ?

Setting records on screen

The recent opening of the Martin Scorsese film `` The Wolf of Wall Street '' has inspired critical and popular complaints about its excesses , including its language . I have not yet seen the film , but am grateful to the dirty word counters , who have recorded a total of 506 uses of the f-word in the three-hour movie . Wikipedia , Variety , Time and various other sources cite this as a record for a non-documentary film , beating Spike Lee 's `` Summer of Sam '' -LRB- 435 -RRB- , and two earlier Scorsese projects : `` Casino '' -LRB- 422 -RRB- and `` Goodfellas '' -LRB- 300 -RRB- .

Versions of the f-word appear so often in `` Wolf '' that an accurate count might be impossible . Slate 's total comes in at 544 . -LRB- I hope I do n't see a Politifact report contesting these numbers . -RRB-

-LRB- `` Summer of Sam '' appears to keep the record for most fpm : f-words per minute , at 3.1 . `` Wolf '' does beat `` Casino '' on this metric . In his mischievous book of lists , Karl Shaw calculates that a viewer of `` Casino '' will hear the f-word on the average of 2.4 times per minute . For `` Wolf '' it 's 2.8 times . -RRB-

How things have changed .

I remember with surprising clarity the first time I used the f-word . One of the Masterson brothers told me a joke , and he thought it was so funny I ran home to tell my mother . She did n't laugh and made me repeat it to my father . It was 1956 or so . I was , maybe , 8 years old . Things did not go well .

I went to work with my dad one day , a United States Customs officer on one of the New York piers . A group of men stood inside , including some rough-looking longshoremen , who dropped the f-word loudly and often into their gritty conversation . Several men , alerting them to my presence , told them to stick a cork in it . Even in their gruffness , they looked sheepish and apologetic .

First encounters

I remember exactly where I was standing the first time I heard a girl my age use the f-word . It was 1967 and I was a sophomore in college . She sat on the ground , a hippie chick , smoking and grousing about her inability to score tickets for the Newport Folk Festival .

And I know exactly where I first encountered the f-word in print . I was a freshman in high school , and the book was called `` The Catcher in the Rye , '' a work on many lists of the most often banned books . J.D. Salinger uses the word five times in `` Catcher '' with great power and specificity . I still own the book where I underlined each use of the word .

I remember the teachers who tried to convince me that the main problem with the f-word was not its power to offend , but the evidence it gave of your limited vocabulary . I blew that criticism off back then , but I 'm beginning to think they were on to something .

Not that the f-word is n't an amazingly versatile piece of our four-letter Anglo-Saxon heritage . Think about it . It can express surprise , outrage , anger , humor , delight or desire . And it can stand in for several parts of speech : noun , verb -LRB- in any tense -RRB- , gerund , participle , imperative , interrogative , interjection , to mention just the most common uses .

It can be used with other little prepositional helpers . You can f -- with someone 's mind . You can be too f -- ed up to walk . You can get f -- ed over by the IRS .

A rare language form

Let 's not forget use of the f-word as one of the rarest of language forms , the infix . A prefix comes before a word . A suffix comes after . An infix appears in the middle of a normal word or phrase , as in `` You are damn f -- ing right . '' Or `` un-f -- ing-believable . '' Or as they like to moan in Boston when thinking of the New York Yankees victory in the 1978 playoff game : `` Bucky F -- ing Dent ! '' It was the light-hitting Dent 's timely home run that ruined the Red Sox season .

All this and more is chronicled in the recent 270-page lexicon titled `` The F-Word , '' by Jesse Sheidlower , editor at large of the Oxford English Dictionary . Lex meets sex .

Perhaps the ultimate expression of the f-word 's versatility comes in a famous scene from David Simon 's HBO series `` The Wire '' in which two detectives explore a crime scene .

The scene takes less than four minutes , during which the cops use versions of the f-word , by my count , 34 times . It is the only word used in the scene .

As they look at crime scene photos of naked and murdered women , the word expresses disgust . As they examine the conflicting evidence , the word describes frustration . As they begin to piece things together , it describes mounting excitement . When they find a key piece of evidence , it is a word of celebration .

Offensive from the beginning

The f-word has a long history , and , unlike some other taboo words , seems to have been offensive from the start . Just as newspapers and this website put a veil over the word by eliminating some letters , the earliest known version of the word in English was written in code .

According to the American Heritage Dictionary , an English poem dated about 1500 makes fun of clerics who do n't keep their vows , including a line that translates : `` They are not in heaven because they f -- wives of Ely '' -LRB- a town near Cambridge -RRB- . In the text , the f-word appears in the form of a letter substitution code .

Though still considered vulgar slang , the f-word is more prevalent than ever , and is often cited as evidence of the coarsening of our culture . The publisher of `` The Naked and The Dead '' asked Norman Mailer to substitute `` fug '' in 1947 . Six decades later , the f-word is a staple in hip-hop music , stand-up comedy routines , locker room harangues , pornographic repartee , and any movie or cable television series that tries to portray gritty , realistic dialogue . Cops use it , thugs use it , even grads with Ph.Ds use it .

I am making the case that , given its ubiquity and versatility , the `` f-word '' is one of the most important words of the 21st century , which is why we should pay close attention to how it can be used well .

In previous essays on language , I have offered these justifications for dropping the occasional f-bomb :

1 . As an authentic expression of realistic human speech .

2 . As a single , shocking , almost-out-of context blow to the solar plexus .

3 . As a neutralizer to the poison of piety , fastidiousness and erudition .

4 . As a way of defining character .

None other than Theodore Bernstein , the influential style czar of The New York Times , once published this opinion : `` There is not ... a single transitive verb in respectable or even in scientific language that expresses the idea of the slang verb f -- . ''

Using and overusing the f-word

Perhaps the most moving use of the f-word I ever encountered came in the documentary 9/11 by two French brothers , who were telling the story of a firehouse in New York . During the filming , two jetliners flew into the Twin Towers , changing the way Americans look at the world . Even though the show ran on commercial television , we were given a chance to hear , uncensored , the rough emotional language of a fraternity of brave men facing their greatest challenge . Real life .

There is a numbing quality to overuse of the f-word . Shock and stark realism can be created without it . You wo n't find it in the novel `` The Great Gatsby , '' or the recent film version , which , like `` Wolf , '' stars Leonardo DiCaprio . I do n't remember hearing it in a Jerry Seinfeld monologue .

I like it best when it is used rarely and in a perfect context , as when it comes out of the mouth of the character Walter White , the high school chemistry teacher who becomes the drug lord of `` Breaking Bad . '' When he first utters it in rage and frustration at a moment of great pain , it has as much power as a gun blast .

It works best when delivered at just the right dramatic moment . To keep up with the Scorsese rate , the characters in `` Breaking Bad '' would have to utter the f-word about 140 times -- in each 47-minute episode .
