-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian President who will sit with U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday to discuss the state -- and the fate -- of Secretary of State John Kerry 's peace process is a good man and most likely the best partner for peace negotiations that Washington , this Israeli government or any other is likely to have . He 's rational , enlightened and a leader who eschews both violence and the dream that somehow , sometime , the armed struggle , or demography will deliver Palestinians their state .

But there 's only one pesky problem : Under current circumstances , he can not deliver his side of a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel .

Here 's why .

The Palestinian consensus

Abbas is in a bind . He 's trapped by traditional Palestinian negotiating positions and a narrative that is almost impossible to alter . These positions include : June 1967 borders with minor territorial adjustments , a capital in East Jerusalem , security arrangements that do n't suck every bit of sovereignty out of Palestinian statehood , and an acceptable answer to the question of what to do about the volatile issue of `` right of return . ''

To diverge significantly from them would end his political viability and perhaps his life . Even the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat -- whose power , authority and legitimacy conferred some discretion and flexibility -- would n't agree to anything short of this consensus . I once heard Arafat remark , at the Camp David Summit : You wo n't walk behind my coffin . And Abbas has little of Arafat 's street cred . He is head of the Palestinian Authority , and the Palestinian Liberation Organization 's executive committee , but is master of none .

Not enough urgency

The idea that you could reconcile this Palestinian consensus with Benjamin Netanyahu 's bottom lines -- assuming you could identify them -- is fantastical . And his self-image is not to become the midwife or father of a Palestinian state based on Abbas ' requirements or needs ; it is to water them down with U.S. help . Even then the idea that he 's prepared to yield to Abbas on borders or Jerusalem is highly improbable .

The history of peacemaking on the Israeli side is , to be sure , a history of transformed hawks -LRB- see Menachem Begin , Yitzhak Rabin , Ehud Barak , Ehud Olmert -RRB- . But Netanyahu is different , and circumstances have changed . The region is in turmoil , and Iran is his real priority . There is neither enough pain nor prospect of gain for him to urgently make this deal .

Divided Palestinians

Hamas has been greatly weakened . The ouster of Egypt 's Mohammed Morsy , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's troubles and Hamas ' need to distance itself from Syria have blocked its options . But , between Fatah and Hamas , the Palestinian national movement is still badly divided and resembles a kind of Palestinian Noah 's Ark : There are two of everything : statelets , security services , patrons , constitutions and visions of what Palestine is and even where it is .

The real problem is that any reconciliation of the two factions will likely further harden Palestinian positions , creating a `` tradeoff '' : internal peace in the Palestinian ranks but more tension with Israel , and probably the United States , too . And yet , unless the Palestinians find a way to assume control over the forces of violence in Palestine -- in short , one authority and one gun -- it 's hard to see how Israel , even if it could be persuaded to withdraw from the West Bank on paper , would ever do so in practice .

The Obama administration understandably can not deal with the Hamas issue now . Instead , it seems to subscribe to the `` Field of Dreams '' school of diplomacy : If you build it , they will come . According to this logic , an agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority would leave an already weakened Hamas no choice but to put up or shut up . The only problem is that for that to work , the `` it '' that they build would have to be an agreement so compelling that the vast majority of Palestinians would rally around it . That 's very hard to see now .

No help from Obama

The President would like to be a historic peacemaker . And he made clear in his 2012 interview with Jeffrey Goldberg that he is very frustrated with Prime Minister Netanyahu . But to have a fight with this Israeli Prime Minister over the possibility of a long-shot Israeli-Palestinian deal does n't add up . A productive fight with Israel that ends up producing a historic peace deal where everyone wins is one thing . But right now that deal is nowhere in sight .

Indeed , right now Obama 's priorities are Ukraine , Iran , preserving a domestic legacy and maintaining Democratic control of the Senate in the upcoming midterm elections . He has little incentive or capacity to forcefully press Netanyahu for a deal .

People may think that a second-term president freed from the need for re-election is free to take a big gamble . But it has really never been the absence of political constraints as much as it is the presence of real opportunity that drives presidents . Obama does n't want to fail .

No cause for alarm ?

The odds of a conflict-ending agreement between Netanyahu and Abbas in which the core issues that drive the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are resolved are slim to none . Think outcomes , not solutions .

But this is n't a cause for despair . Kerry 's relentlessness and skill in engaging the parties have created a process that will at least survive the U.S.-imposed April deadline for a peace deal and live at least until year 's end . Nobody wants to be blamed for the demise of the Kerry process , and both Netanyahu and Abbas likely wonder -- and worry about -- what will happen if there is no process .

Israel probably does n't have a Plan B. And Abbas ' fallback -- to go to the United Nations and rely on the international community and the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement -- does n't offer much promise without Washington pressuring Israel .

And so Abbas ' meeting at the White House will go well enough . The President deeply cares about the Palestinians and their cause . And while Abbas wo n't betray Palestinian positions for Obama 's legacy , neither will he humiliate the President . Kerry may yet squeeze out enough from the two sides to produce a piece of paper .

In any event , it wo n't be the Palestinians who spoil the party . President Abbas will almost certainly tell the President , paper or not , deadline be damned , let us continue the important work of Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking . Peace may not be around the corner , but more negotiations almost certainly are .
