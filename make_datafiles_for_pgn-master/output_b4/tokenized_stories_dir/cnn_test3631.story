-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gil Scott-Heron , dubbed the `` godfather of rap '' for his mix of poetry and music , died Friday in New York , his publicist at XL Recordings said . He was 62 .

It was not immediately known what killed Scott-Heron , who was best known for the 1970 song `` The Revolution Will Not Be Televised , '' a politically and socially charged song that examined the African American condition in America at the time . The song was banned by some radio stations .

Scott-Heron died at 4 p.m. at a New York hospital , said Lisa Gottheil , his publicist at XL Recordings .

Scott-Heron defined the genre , long-time friend and former bandmate Charlie Saunders told CNN . Saunders worked on Scott-Heron 's 1970 debut album `` Small Talk At 125th & Lenox . ''

Saunders , a percussionist , said the last time he saw Scott-Heron was about two years ago when he needed a place to stay .

`` He came by our house to get himself together . He spent 4 to 5 days and then moved on , '' Saunders said .

Much of Scott-Heron 's poetry and music reflected his struggles with drugs and alcohol .

Born in 1949 , Scott-Heron first gained fame for his poetry and spoken word performances in the late 1960s . By the mid-1970s , he had published two books of poetry and recorded four albums , including `` Small Talk At 125th & Lenox . ''

His early albums , `` Pieces of a Man '' and `` Winter in America , '' have been credited with influencing other musical genres , such as hip hop . But it was the song `` The Revolution Will Not Be Televised '' that put Scott-Heron on the musical map .

His music has been sampled by everyone from Kanye West , who sampled `` Comment # 1 '' for his 2010 song `` Who Will Save America , '' to Common 's sample of `` No Knock '' on his 2008 hit `` Universal Mind Control . ''

After a 13-year hiatus from making music , Scott-Heron put out a new album last year called `` I 'm New Here . ''

In a 2008 interview with New York magazine , Scott-Heron revealed he had contracted HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , after years of battling drug and alcohol addictions . In 2001 and 2007 , he was jailed on drug charges .
