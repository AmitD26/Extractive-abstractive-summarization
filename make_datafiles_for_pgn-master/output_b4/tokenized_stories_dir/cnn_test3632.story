-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- New ships , expanded technology and pop culture phenomena are some of the factors making 2014 an alluring year for a vacation at sea .

January through March is known as `` wave season '' -- when cruise lines roll out perks and promotions to entice travelers . But do n't fret if you 're not ready to plunk down your credit card . Experts are predicting more year-round savings at sea .

The traditional wave season booking window can be a great time to snag a deal such as 2-for-1 fares , on-board credits and suite upgrades , according to online cruise guide Cruise Critic , but it does n't always reflect rock-bottom pricing .

Cruise Critic Editor-in-Chief Carolyn Spencer Brown says that she 's expecting this year to bring `` especially competitive pricing '' in the Caribbean , because of an influx of ships plying those waters . And if Alaska is on your cruising bucket list , she says now is a great time to book and take advantage of discounts for travel in April or May .

Blood Falls and other natural oddities

`` The first tip for saving money is not to primarily focus on saving money , '' Spencer Brown says . Good value comes from not only getting the right price but also in finding the right trip for your vacation needs and preferences .

To that end , Christine Duffy , president of Cruise Lines International Association , says online research is fine , but ultimately working with a trained agent will get you the best prices because cruises are `` much more complicated than booking a flight from point A to point B. '' Agents familiar with all the options can help with cabin selection , shore excursions and even packaging airfare to get the lowest price .

Follow your preferred cruise line on social media to keep up with flash sales and seasonal specials .

Once you 're on board , amazing add-ons can boost your experience , but they usually come with a hefty price tag . Check to see if your cruise line offers any advance-purchase deals for dining , alcohol or spa treatments . And `` keep an eye out for specials advertised in the daily program , '' Spencer Brown advises , as those can be big money savers .

12 months , 12 amazing adventures

Stick to a set budget for a la carte purchases for a vacation free of financial surprise and use the on-screen feature on your cabin TV to track your daily spending . `` Be sure to resolve any concerns before the final day , '' Spencer Brown says .

Cruising in 2014 is a far cry from the lazy stereotypes of bygone years ; today 's cruiser can plan on zip lining and skydiving between meals shared with `` The Cat in the Hat '' or a favorite musician . Pop culture has invaded the oceans .

Here are five things cruise lines are doing to lure new and repeat cruisers :

Creating exotic and intimate experiences

Cruise ships are getting a warm welcome in Asia , where Cruise Lines International Association says 3.7 million passengers per year are expected by 2017 . From the wilderness of the Russian Far East to ports in Myanmar and Malaysia , there 's an emphasis on taking passengers to places far off the beaten path . Singapore , Hong Kong , Thailand and Japan are also beckoning cruise ships .

What 's more , exotic destinations can also equal top cruising value , according to Spencer Brown .

`` Destinations like Japan , Norway and Australia offer exceptional value for money , as exploring them by land tends to be extremely expensive , but traveling by cruise ship costs much less and is often more convenient , '' she says .

The Cruise Critic editor also flags the Panama Canal as a hot spot ; it turns 100 this year , with a new visitors ' center ready to welcome cruise passengers .

The rivers of the world are also commanding more attention , with tailored itineraries and smaller , luxury vessels attracting globetrotters . River cruising is the fastest-growing segment of the cruise industry , says Duffy , with eight of the 17 new ships due out in 2014 destined for river journeys .

Offering shorter -- and longer -- voyages

To attract first-timers wary of an entire week at sea , cruise lines are offering more weekend-length cruises .

At the same time , lines have realized that sometimes , the typical shore excursion does n't allow enough time to revel in all that a port has to offer , so itineraries have changed . For example , Norwegian and Royal Caribbean spend more than a day in Bermuda , Carnival ships stop overnight in Nassau , Bahamas , and a Seabourn sails with a three-day stopover in St. Petersburg , Russia .

Improving connectivity

Connectivity is at an all-time high on the high seas , with bow-to-stern Wi-Fi and less expensive communication services than in years past . Cruise lines have spent millions revamping their wireless infrastructures , increasing bandwidth for faster connection speeds and even offering perks such as 500 minutes of free Wi-Fi that 's given to concierge-level cruisers aboard Regent Seven Seas Cruises . These are especially appealing to the social media-loving millennial crowd , who ca n't wait to share their vacation experiences via Twitter and Instagram .

Harnessing the power of pop culture

The `` wow '' factor of cruising is still strong , with ships constantly trying to outdo each other , not only with bigger and better berths but also with unique activities and elite celebrity associations . This year marks the debut of `` Seuss at Sea , '' a family program on Carnival Cruise Lines , featuring Dr. Seuss-themed fun including `` Green Eggs and Ham '' breakfasts , costume parades and character events .

Adults will have no problem finding their pop culture fix afloat , thanks to programs such as `` Dancing With the Stars at Sea '' competitions on Holland America , which will lead to a complimentary seven-day `` champions cruise '' for 15 finalists and their guests in December . For the less competitive , every Holland America cruise offers free dance classes based on routines from the hit TV show .

Rolling out new ships

Every year brings new vessels designed to convince landlubbers of the advantages of a journey at sea . While this year brings fewer `` mega ships '' than in the past , innovation remains in the forefront on ships of all sizes .

Here is a handful of this year 's newcomers :

• Quantum of the Seas : This Royal Caribbean ship gets the `` wow factor '' award , with a skydiving simulator , bumper cars , an aerial viewing pod and inside cabins with `` virtual balconies '' thanks to giant LCD screens showing an ocean view .

• Norwegian Getaway : The Broadway musical `` Legally Blonde '' will be on board as well as the line 's signature special-effects magic show . Miami pop artist David `` Lebo '' Le Batard was commissioned for the ship 's impressive hull art , which features a whimsical mermaid .

• Costa Diadema : Diadema is Italian for tiara , and this ship will be the largest and most modern built for Costa Cruises . Set to launch in late 2014 , it will hold more than 3,700 passengers and feature public areas that resemble a beachfront resort .

• Avalon Waterways ' Illumination : This is one of three Avalon Suite Ships coming out in 2014 ; each features two decks of panorama suites with wall-to-wall windows , complimentary Wi-Fi and alfresco dining options .

• Viking Cruises Longships : Fourteen of these will launch from Avignon , France . Each will hold fewer than 200 passengers and offer five cabin sizes , including massive 445-square-foot Explorer Suites with balconies off the bedrooms and living rooms .

• Regal Princess : An adults-only pool , a glass-enclosed `` SeaWalk '' extending 128 feet over the water and balconies for all outside cabins are among the highlights on this 3,560-passenger vessel .

• Pearl Mist : All 108 staterooms have private balconies on this new luxury ship being built for Pearl Seas Cruises . What 's more , a dozen of the cabins were built for solo travelers .
