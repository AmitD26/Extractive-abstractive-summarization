-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A superpower needs a super attention span . Unfortunately , Americans seem to take little interest in the troubles of the world around them , even when those troubles threaten soon to vex Americans themselves .

Americans fought two world wars -- and faced nuclear annihilation in a protracted Cold War -- to defend the freedom of Europe . In the thrilling days of 1989-91 , four generations of American sacrifice were magnificently vindicated . The communist regimes of central Europe collapsed . The Soviet Union itself broke apart into smaller and less threatening pieces .

For four centuries , the rulers of Russia had sought security for themselves by dominating first their own people , then their neighbors , then their neighbors ' neighbors , then their neighbors ' neighbors ' neighbors ... until their power extended from Berlin to the Pacific Ocean .

Then , abruptly , that imperial project broke apart . Subject nations regained their freedom . The Russians themselves gained a new opportunity -- perhaps the first in their national existence -- to choose a government that served its people .

The former rulers , unfortunately , had other ideas . Democracy did not take root in Russia after 1991 . How and why it failed is a long story , with many villains , but let 's cut to the end result : A former top officer of the KGB maneuvered his way into the Russian presidency in 1999-2000 . Vladimir Putin restored to power the old secret police apparatus .

Since then , Putin and his coterie have attempted to reconstitute as much of the old Soviet Union as they could , while plundering Russia 's wealth for themselves .

One step to that reconstitution of the Soviet Union was absolutely indispensable : Reasserting Moscow 's power over Ukraine .

No nation suffered more from Soviet communism than the Ukrainians . Ukrainian farmers lost their lands and homes to Soviet collectivization in the 1920s ; millions died in the man-made famine that followed in the 1930s . Their language and culture were stunted under Moscow rule ; their intellectuals and writers were suppressed , banished , murdered , and defamed . In 1991 , Ukrainians seized their chance to build a country of their own .

Ukrainian independence liberated not only the Ukrainian people , but all Europe . Russia without the nearly 46 million people and vast natural resources of the Ukraine is a large and powerful country , but it is no superpower .

Since Putin 's entry into power , Russia minus Ukraine has sought to influence and corrupt the democracies of Europe . A Russia that reintegrated Ukraine would possess the power -- like the Soviet Union of old -- to intimidate and bully democratic Europe . Russia minus Ukraine can aspire to become a normal nation state , a democracy , even a liberal democracy . A Russia that holds Ukraine by force must forever be a militarized authoritarian regime , a menace to its own people as much as to the rest of the European continent and the democratic world .

Upholding Ukrainian independence is thus a deep concern , not only to the Ukrainians , but to all the free countries of Europe -- and thus to the United States , free-Europe 's security and trading partner .

Vladimir Putin understands all this too , and he does n't like any of it . Since he came to power , he 's worked to undermine and subvert Ukrainian independence . He has been successful . Ukraine imports its oil and natural gas from Russia , and Putin has used energy dependency to sway Ukrainian politics and bribe Ukraine 's dauntingly corrupt leaders .

But every once in a while , Putin goes too far . He went too far in 2004 , collaborating with Ukrainian former communists to rig a presidential election . Blatant fraud inspired Ukraine 's famous `` Orange Revolution '' -- and a temporary swing in Ukraine 's political orientation to the West .

Now Putin is trying again -- and again he is meeting massive resistance in the Ukrainian streets . Over the past years , the European Union negotiated a trade pact with Ukraine . The pact would enrich ordinary Ukrainians , today the third poorest people in Europe , after the Kosovars and Moldovans . The pact would lessen Ukraine 's economic dependence on Russia -- and prepare the way for Ukraine 's own eventual membership in the EU .

Under extreme Russian pressure , the Ukrainian president -- the very same man whose election fraud triggered the Orange Revolution nine years ago -- has repudiated his own treaty , and his country 's best hopes .

Tens of thousands of protesters have filled the streets and squares of the capital , Kiev , two weekends in a row . Police have suppressed the protests brutally , injuring many people . The regime 's controlled courts have banned any further public demonstrations until January .

German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed disappointment in muted tones after a November 28 summit with the Ukrainian leadership : `` Unfortunately not all expectations have been fulfilled . We will make very clear here that the EU is ready to accept Ukraine as an associate member , to sign the association treaty . Then we will see . We have no hope that it will happen this time , but the door is open . ''

Do n't be fooled by the muted words , however . What 's at stake in the streets of Kiev is the future of the European continent -- and American prosperity and security . An inward-looking America is averting its attention from its own most important interests and highest ideals .
