Srinagar , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Indian security forces Friday enforced a strict curfew in Srinagar and other major towns of Indian-administered Kashmir to stymie protests sparked Thursday when four civilians were shot and killed by the paramilitary border security force .

Kashmiri separatists had called for a strike and Friday post-prayer protests in reaction to the deaths in the mountainous village of Gool in the Ramban district , 190 kilometers north of the city of Jammu .

Early Friday , thousands of police and paramilitary troops fanned out in Srinagar and other towns to enforce the restrictions on movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic .

The security forces had erected barricades at road intersections . Coils of razor-fitted wire also were used to enforce the curfew .

Nonetheless , people staged protests at several places , sometimes clashing with the security forces . Two people were wounded in the clashes and were evacuated to hospital , according to police .

The shooting erupted after scores of protestors attacked a security force camp Thursday morning , said the minister of state for home , Sajjad Kichloo .

In addition to the four killed , 40 people were reported wounded .

The villagers were protesting the alleged beating of the imam of a local mosque by the security force , officials said .

India 's home minister , Sushil Kumar Shinde ordered an investigation into the incident after the state chief minister , Omar Abdullah , spoke to him .

`` It is highly unacceptable to shoot at unarmed protesters just because they were reportedly protesting manhandling of an imam of their area , '' Abdullah said in a prepared statement . `` There is no justification or rationalization of this deplorable act . This shocking act warrants and demands the severest of condemnation in the strongest possible terms . ''

On Friday , Abdullah , chaired a Cabinet meeting that sanctioned an extraordinary ex-gratia relief payment of `` rupees five lakh , '' or more than U.S. $ 8,000 , to the next of kin of each of those killed .

The Cabinet , apart from `` extending condolences to the bereaved families and sympathies with those injured in the firing incident , condemned the excessive use of force . ''

Traffic on the lone highway connecting the landlocked Kashmir valley to rest of the country remained suspended Friday , according to traffic police .

In a separate incident , a leading cardiologist , Sheikh Jalal , was wounded in a militant ambush that left his two police guards dead Thursday in the south Kashmir town of Pampore , a police spokesman said .

Jalal was shot and is being treated at a hospital .

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack .

Militant attacks in Indian Kashmir have seen a sudden surge recently in the capital city , Srinagar , and other towns .
