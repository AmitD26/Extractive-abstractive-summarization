-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In his first television interview , Ariel Castro 's son said Monday that his dad belongs in prison for the rest of his life and he does n't plan on ever visiting him .

Last week , Ariel Castro pleaded guilty in an Ohio court to 937 counts , including murder and kidnapping , in connection with imprisoning three women in his home for nearly a decade .

Castro is set to be sentenced Thursday . A plea deal he agreed to recommends that he get life in prison without parole . The deal would allow Castro to avoid the death penalty .

Anthony Castro , in an exclusive NBC `` Today '' show interview , said he thinks that sentence is `` the best possible . ''

`` I think that if he really ca n't control his impulses and he really does n't have any value for human life , the way this case has shown , then behind bars is where he belongs for the rest of his life , '' the son said .

NBC 's Savannah Guthrie asked the son what he would have thought about his father receiving the death penalty .

`` It would 've been tough to accept just because death penalty cases are ... you end up in court a lot ... and so they come back a lot more often . I think this way is a lot better , because , you know , he 's put himself away , and he will be away for the rest of his life , '' Castro responded .

Anthony Castro went on to say that his father `` has been lying to his family for the past 10 , 11 years , at every possible turn . ''

`` I have no trust in him , '' the son said . `` I ca n't see myself going to visit him and giving him the opportunity to face me and lie to me again . ''

The abductions and escape

Castro abducted Michelle Knight , Amanda Berry and Georgina `` Gina '' DeJesus separately in a two-year period starting in 2002 , authorities say .

The women and Berry 's 6-year-old daughter were held in Castro 's 1,400-square-foot home . DNA tests have confirmed that Castro is the child 's father . They were freed in May after one of the women shouted for help while Castro was away .

Neighbor Charles Ramsey said he heard their cries as he was sitting down to eat .

`` I see this girl going nuts trying to get out of a house , '' he told CNN affiliate WEWS . `` I go on the porch and she says , ` Help me get out . I 've been in here a long time . ' ''

Finally free , Berry pleaded for a phone .

`` Help me , I am Amanda Berry , '' she frantically told a 911 operator . `` I 've been kidnapped , and I 've been missing for 10 years . And I 'm here , I 'm free now . ''

Thankful for support

Lately the women have spoken out .

In early July , Berry , DeJesus and Knight released a YouTube video offering their thanks to all those who have helped them since they were freed .

`` I want to thank everyone who has helped me and my family through this entire ordeal . Everyone who has been there to support us has been a blessing , '' Berry said in the video . `` I 'm getting stronger each day . ''

DeJesus talked to CNN affiliate WEWS on Sunday . She was excited that the last pieces of wood were being placed on a privacy fence around the DeJesus home .

`` I really wanted it . It meant a lot to me , '' the young woman said .

`` The difference is privacy , of her being able to come out , walk out and do what she wants . '' DeJesus ' grandmother Nancy Ruiz told the station . The fence was donated .

Also over the weekend , Berry surprised concert-goers in Cleveland when she took the stage with family and friends and waved to a cheering crowd . Rapper Nelly dedicated his hit song , `` Just a Dream , '' to her , HLN reported .

Happiness gives way to disappointment

The news of the women 's freedom initially made Anthony Castro happy , he said on NBC on Monday . He was like many in Ohio familiar with their longstanding disappearances .

But when his father 's name and photo made media reports , and he heard Berry say his father 's name , he was stunned and shaken .

`` I was shocked because of the magnitude of such a crime , '' Anthony Castro said . `` I do n't think I can imagine anyone doing that , let alone to find out it was my own flesh and blood , my father . However , I did grow up in a house with a lot of fear and a lot of violence . And so , the fact that this was a violent case , no , it did n't surprise me . ''

Guthrie pointed out that Anthony Castro has spoken out about abuse that he and his mother suffered at the hands of his father .

Ariel Castro was `` incredibly strict , '' Anthony Castro said .

`` He had a temper . He was n't a monster 24/7 , but if you crossed him , there would be consequences . And those , more often than not , would be physical consequences .

`` I remember crying myself to sleep when I was a kid because my legs were covered in welts from belts . Seeing my mom getting beat up in our own home , and no one should ever have to see their mom crumpled up in a corner on the floor the way I did so many times . ''

In a way , his father 's imprisonment is a kind of justice for his mother , he said .

`` I think that she will be there the first morning he wakes up in prison ... and the sun shines down -- that 's going to be her justice . ''

Mixed emotions : horror , gratefulness

Had Anthony Castro been inside the house where the women were held ? Had he seen any signs ? Anthony Castro had been in the house , and he always entered through the back door . `` That 's where my father would flag me in , '' he said .

There were locks on the doors to the attic and basement , and the windows were nailed shut , Anthony Castro said . But that was n't unusual . There were places he just was n't allowed to go , he said . But he and his dad would talk in the kitchen for a short while , he said .

His family has endured a `` nightmare '' since May , Anthony Castro said , but he was quick to add , `` nothing to compare to what the girls went through . ''

`` What 's horrifying is I have the same first and last name , '' he said . `` I look in the mirror and I see the resemblance and I think about what he did and how horrible it was , and I just ca n't help sometimes just being overcome . ''

Anthony Castro wants his friends and co-workers to know that 's he 's grateful that they 've supported him .

`` Because of all this , my father will never be able to hurt anyone again , '' he said . `` I have nothing to say to him . ''
