-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The bright yellow front wall of the compound is lined with perfectly pruned palm trees .

Our hosts open a metal gate and usher us inside to a large yard with a fresh-cut lawn , more palm trees and a circular pool in the middle .

The house itself is a two-story dwelling , also painted in bright yellow with white accents and double-paned windows with arched tops and red tile roof .

In any large American city , this house would be a suburban , upper-middle class home -- but here in the town of Antunez , located in a mainly rural area of the Mexican southwestern state of Michoacan , it seems much grander , certainly in stark contrast with the adobe houses next door .

`` This is now our barracks , '' says a vigilante who spoke to us on condition of anonymity . `` Some of our guys sleep and eat here . Some took the weapons that used to belong to the trafficker . '' When we visited , half-a-dozen vigilantes stood guard outside .

Our hosts are a group of local men who rose up in arms against the Knights Templar , a rather romantic name for a criminal organization known not only for drug trafficking , but also for terrorizing people in this part of Mexico through extortion , executions , rape and murder .

The drug war in Mexico , which has been raging since former President Felipe Calderon started fighting back against the cartels in 2006 , has claimed 100,000 lives . States like Michoacan are largely in the control of the cartels : 90 per cent of the cocaine that enters the U.S. does so through Mexico . The country is also a major supplier of marijuana , methamphetamine and , more recently , heroin .

The mansion 's owner , Efrain Isaac Rosales , also known as `` El Tucan '' -LRB- The Toucan -RRB- , fled on January 10 when the town rose up in arms against him and his gunmen . They say he left so fast that he even abandoned some of his weapons in the house .

Rosales is a lieutenant under the leadership of Servando Gomez , also known as `` La Tuta , '' the head of the Knights Templar cartel . Some 20 towns have been retaken from the drug gangs , according to the vigilantes , but Gomez , the former schoolteacher-turned-cartel leader , still holds a tight grip over Michoacan , ruling with intimidation and violence . He makes occasional public appearances , handing out money to the poor -- he considers himself an altruist -- and loudly trying to justify his presence in the state .

'' -LSB- The Knights Templar -RSB- are a necessary evil , '' he once told an assembled crowd . `` Fortunately -- or unfortunately -- we are here . If we were n't , another group would come . ''

On a decorative opening in the foyer of his lieutenant 's former residence , standing next to a modern art statue , is a mini 14 , an assault rifle that fires .223-caliber bullets like an AR15 , left behind by Rosales when he fled . This one had a 30-round magazine . The rifle sits next to a bulletproof vest .

From the foyer , a hallway connects to a living area with a large , dark brown leather recliner in the middle . On the wall , there 's a rack for a large flat screen TV ; but the vigilante groups have looted the house already and many pieces of furniture are missing , giving the residence the feeling of a house whose owners have just moved out .

It 's still clean , with the exception of the bathrooms , but the beds are unmade and there are pieces of furniture and objects in odd places .

The vigilantes are giving us access to what was believed to be Rosales ' `` family home . '' It 's hard to miss that the house shares two walls with the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe . The church is also painted in similar colors : bright yellow and white .

This is not the only property the vigilantes have occupied that used to belong to the cartel lieutenant . He also owned a nearby ranch called `` La Ilusion '' -LRB- The Illusion -RRB- , which is surrounded by grapefruit trees and hundreds of hectares of avocado trees , the fruit of which has made the state of Michoacan known around the world .

The vigilantes also confiscated a couple of vehicles that were left at the property : a white , late-model , Dodge Ram pickup truck and a modified truck painted matt black . The latter was fitted with half-inch steel plates and shooting portals in the double cabin and in the back . It had signs of having been in a shootout , riddled with bullet holes on the driver 's side , the hood and the windshield .

The property also features a shed with white pillars and red tile roof covering a living area with grills and chairs leading to the lawn connecting to the two-level circular pool divided in the middle .

The vigilantes have been accused of looting the properties they have confiscated , and indeed some have been charged with excesses . But they are , by and large , treated as heroes by the people they have agreed to protect .

A vigilante in the nearby town of La Huerta , who covers his face with a ski mask and identifies himself as `` Juan , '' says they say they had no option but to rise up in arms to protect their people and lands . `` If the government ca n't help you , you have to help yourself , '' Juan says . `` All we want to do is just pick up the arms so that we can drive them away . After that we 're just going to put them down again . ''

Juan speaks English with a southern American accent . He says he lived in North Carolina from the time he was eight years old and returned to Mexico when he was 20 . He 's now 24 and a married father of two .

The federal government 's attitude towards the vigilante groups appears to be changing too . Once the army and police would round up the irregulars : now the authorities appear to want to legalize them , freeing them up to fight the cartels .

Hipolito Mora , the leader of yet another vigilante group in the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto , says they have kept the movement against organized crime with the same resources the Knights Templar used to attack them in the past .

`` With the same resources that used to belong to the Knights Templar , their ranches and properties , we 're financing this movement , '' Mora says . `` We did it at first and we continue to do so . ''

He remains philosophical about the dangers in which he has placed himself . `` I am not afraid . We are all going to die anyway . ''

The vigilantes are also returning property they say the Knights Templar stole from local people including ranches , lime orchards , wells , farming machinery and vehicles .

The same morning we spoke to Mora , Grace Villa , a town resident , visited to personally thank him for allowing her and her family to recover their lime orchards .

`` I think they 're doing the right thing , '' Villa says , `` I think it was a very brave thing to do because they stood up for everybody . ''

Her family , Villa says , had to flee after 30 armed men showed up at their property demanding the title . `` They wanted to charge the people who picked lemons and they wanted to charge people who owned houses . The drug cartels were just sucking the money out of everybody and it was just going too far . ''
