-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was discharged from a New York hospital on Wednesday , three days after she was admitted for treatment of a blood clot in a vein between her skull and brain , the State Department announced .

`` Her medical team advised her that she is making good progress on all fronts , and they are confident she will make a full recovery , '' Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines said in a statement announcing her release .

Clinton walked out of New York Presbyterian Hospital accompanied by her husband , former President Bill Clinton , and daughter , Chelsea , for a brief period earlier Wednesday afternoon . The appearance led to speculation about her release , which was announced a couple hours later .

She had been admitted Sunday , after doctors found the clot during a medical test related to a concussion she suffered in December .

The secretary is being treated with blood thinners to dissolve the clot , which has not resulted in a stroke or any neurological damage . Doctors expect her to make a full recovery .

Clinton 's future ` as good as her past , ' docs say

Earlier , State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters that Clinton was in communication with aides and there was nothing new on her condition or treatment .

Clinton `` has been quite active on the phone with all of us , but she also made some calls on Saturday to a couple of foreign officials , '' Nuland said .

Those official calls came before the blood clot was disclosed Sunday . The first , to the joint special envoy on Syria , Lakhdar Brahimi , lasted a half hour . The second was to the prime minister of Qatar , who is also the foreign minister .

`` She has begun to pick up her regular phone contact with some of her counterparts , '' Nuland added .

Clinton , 65 , has not been publicly seen or heard from in more than three weeks since falling ill with severe stomach flu and a subsequent concussion that occurred when she fainted because of dehydration , officials said .

Questions also have been raised as to why there was almost a day 's delay in explaining the precise location of the clot and why she was administered an MRI , which revealed the problem .

Nuland said officials have been `` extremely forthcoming '' about Clinton 's health .

`` We will continue to keep you updated as we have new information to share , as we 've been doing all along , '' Nuland said . `` I think that was eighth statement in some three weeks so please bear with us . ''

Asked how Clinton 's illness might affect her plans to testify on Capitol Hill about the deadly September terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi , Libya . Nuland did not directly say whether Clinton would appear .

`` She has said that she is open to going up to the Hill . We are working with them now on their schedule because there 's also a question of when they are going to be in and we will let you know when we have something to share , '' Nuland said .

Clinton , a former first lady , New York senator and presidential candidate , does not plan to stay on for President Barack Obama 's second term , but prefers to remain until her replacement is in place .

Some senators have said they would delay confirmation hearings for her proposed successor , Sen. John Kerry , until Clinton has testified on the Libya attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans .
