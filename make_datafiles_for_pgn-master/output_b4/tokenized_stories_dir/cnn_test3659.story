WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One day after President Obama ripped Wall Street executives for their `` shameful '' decision to hand out $ 18 billion in bonuses in 2008 , Congress may finally have had enough .

`` You ca n't use taxpayer money to pay out $ 18 billion in bonuses , '' an angry Sen. Claire McCaskill says .

An angry U.S. senator introduced legislation Friday to cap compensation for employees of any company that accepts federal bailout money .

Under the terms of a bill introduced by Sen. Claire McCaskill , D-Missouri , no employee would be allowed to make more than the president of the United States .

Obama 's current annual salary is $ 400,000 .

`` We have a bunch of idiots on Wall Street that are kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer , '' an enraged McCaskill said on the floor of the Senate . `` They do n't get it . These people are idiots . You ca n't use taxpayer money to pay out $ 18 billion in bonuses . '' Watch McCaskill 's heated words ''

McCaskill 's proposed compensation limit would cover salaries , bonuses and stock options .

On Thursday , Obama said the prospect that some of the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout could end up paying for bonuses to managers of struggling financial institutions was `` shameful . ''

The president said it was the `` height of irresponsibility '' for executives to pay bonuses when their companies were asking for help from Washington .

`` The American people understand we 've got a big hole that we 've got to dig ourselves out of , but they do n't like the idea that people are digging a bigger hole even as they 're being asked to fill it up , '' Obama added .

McCaskill 's proposal comes three days after struggling banking giant Citigroup -- which has taken about $ 45 billion from the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program -- reversed plans to accept delivery of a $ 42 million corporate jet . The company changed its mind under Treasury Department prodding .

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended corporate bonuses Friday , saying that cutting them also means slashing jobs in the Big Apple .

`` If you somehow take that bonus out of the economy , it really will create unemployment , '' he said on CNN 's `` American Morning . '' `` It means less spending in restaurants , less spending in department stores , so everything has an impact . ''
