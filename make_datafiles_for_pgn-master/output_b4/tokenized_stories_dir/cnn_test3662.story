-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The 2014 MTV Movie Awards in Los Angeles Sunday were filled with laughs , standout fashion and rocking musical performances .

Host Conan O'Brien kicked off the show with a record 50 celebrity cameos and an unexpected musical number , Lupita Nyong ' o donned an eye catching pleated dress in dozens of colors from Karl Lagerfeld 's Fall 2014 collection , and viewers got a sneak peak at the hottest upcoming action-adventure films with exclusive clips from `` X-Men : Days of Future Past '' and `` The Amazing Spider-Man 2 . ''

Viewers voted for their favorite onscreen performances this year in out-of-the-box categories like `` best fight , '' `` best scared s ** tless performance , '' and `` best WTF moment . '' The winner and musical performers took the stage at the Nokia Theater , leading to the top five memorable moments of the night :

No. 5 : Rita Ora rips off Zac Efron 's shirt

Several sculpted actors were nominated for `` best shirtless performance , '' including Chris Hemsworth , Leonardo DiCaprio , Sam Claflin , and the lone female Jennifer Aniston for her strip tease in `` We 're the Millers . ''

But the prize went to a fit Zac Efron for a bedroom scene in `` That Awkward Moment . '' Presenters Jessica Alba and Rita Ora warned that the winner better show off the assets and come up onstage sans top . But Efron ignored the mandate and began accepting his award very much covered by his shirt -- that is until Rita snuck up behind him and ripped open the front of his blue button-up . The `` Awkward Moment '' actor played along , pulling his shirt off while blowing kisses to the audience who were n't disappointed with the reveal of the tan and toned 6-pack that won him the prize .

No. 4 : Seth Rogen shares a smooch with his mom

Dave Franco , Seth Rogen , and Zac Efron took the stage to present the steamy category of `` best kiss . '' To kick off the smooching shenanigans they held their own kissing contest , where they announced that three lucky audience members had a golden ticket that won them some lip time with the stars .

Two beautiful young women bounded to the stage to claim their kisses with Franco and Efron ... but the third woman looked a little too familiar to Rogen . `` Wait a minute , that 's my mom ! '' he yelled . `` Mom , no , go back to your seat Mom ! '' Yet with all three women onstage , the men delivered and Rogen , not one to back down on his word , completely sucked face with his mother on live national television . Or , at least the woman pretending to be his mother .

Jennifer Aniston , Emma Roberts , and Will Poulter were awarded the golden popcorn for `` best kiss '' for their three-way make out session in `` We 're The Millers . ''

No. 3 : Channing Tatum and Mark Wahlberg take home two big prizes

Two of the evening 's biggest honors went to leading men Channing Tatum and Mark Wahlberg .

Tatum won the Trailblazer Award for his diverse roles in funny , romantic , and action-packed films . As his buddy Jonah Hill said while presenting Tatum the award , `` What 's more trailblazing than an attractive man becoming a movie star , eh ? '' Tatum danced his way up to the stage to accept the honor , and gave a heartwarming speech of sincere thanks -- until he was silenced -- by Conan O'Brien 's picture of his privates . Yes , the comedian found a way to keep chatty celebrities quiet ; loading a dirty picture of himself smiling and pantless into the teleprompter .

Mark Wahlberg was honored with the `` Generation Award '' for his varied work over the course of his career . During his acceptance speech , the 42-year-old former rapper brought back his bad-boy side by dropping an F-bomb whenever he could . Joking that the `` Generation Award '' meant he was past his prime and too old for a comeback , Wahlberg quipped , `` This is not the Channing Tatum ` You 're dancing around , chicks want you ' award . This is the ` You 're f *** g-done award . But look , it was a great run ! ' ''

But his career is not really over yet . The cast of `` Entourage '' presented Wahlberg with his award , and the new `` Entourage '' movie hits theaters in 2015 .

No. 2 : Eminem and Rihanna give a ` Monster ' performance

Even though the MTV Movie Awards are all about the silver screen , Rihanna and Eminem 's musical performance of their hit `` The Monster '' had viewers and stars alike buzzing . Rihanna kicked off the smash hit backed by a live band , wearing an all-white dress and a FEAR headband . She was soon joined by Eminem , who made his entrance onstage amongst flashing red lights . It was the first time Slim Shady and the Barbados Babe have performed their smash hit on television , offering a sneak peak of their upcoming mini-tour set to hit New York , Los Angeles , and Detroit this summer . Other performances of the night included Ellie Goulding , Zedd , and twenty one pilots .

No. 1 : ` Catching Fire ' takes top prize

The biggest honor at the MTV Movie Awards is the `` Best Movie of the Year , '' and this year the golden popcorn statuette for the prize went to `` The Hunger Games : Catching Fire . ''

Johnny Depp presented the award to `` Catching Fire '' stars Sam Claflin and Josh Hutcherson . Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence , who did not attend , also took home Best Male and Female Performances . After winning the top prize of the night , Claflin thanked all the fans of the franchise , while Hutcherson went on to acknowledge the hundreds of people whose hard work went into making the blockbuster . He also acknowledged his fellow cast member , Philip Seymour Hoffman , who died of acute mixed drug intoxication in February .

`` I know if Philip were here , he 'd think this was really cool , '' Hutcherson said . `` He 's one of the actors I look up to most in my life , so wherever he is , this goes out to him as well . ''
