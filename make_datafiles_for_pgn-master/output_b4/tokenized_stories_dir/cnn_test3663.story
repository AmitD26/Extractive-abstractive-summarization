-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of a Yale pharmacology student who was killed by a lab technician shortly before her wedding day has sued the university , saying it failed to protect women on its campus .

Annie Le , 24 , was reported missing on September 8 , 2009 . Her strangled body was found stuffed inside a wall of a campus lab building five days later .

Former Yale University lab technician Raymond Clark III has been sentenced to 44 years in prison after pleading guilty in March to the murder and attempted sexual assault of Le .

Both Yale University and the Yale School of Medicine are named as defendants in the lawsuit , filed Tuesday in New Haven Superior Court in Connecticut .

`` Prior to September 8 , 2009 , Yale had long taken inadequate steps to ensure the safety and security of women on its campus , '' the complaint states . `` Sexual attacks on and harassment of women at Yale had been well-documented and longstanding problem , and there was a widespread belief that Yale repeatedly failed to impose meaningful discipline on offenders . As a result , Yale created a culture of tolerance that allowed and encouraged aggressive male behavior towards women . ''

The suit also cited a Title IX complaint filed by students against the university `` which highlighted Yale 's failure to adequately prevent and respond to sexual harassment and sexual assaults on female students at Yale . A federal investigation of Yale 's conduct in this regard is ongoing . ''

But the university said the suit has `` no basis . ''

`` Yale had no information indicating that Raymond Clark was capable of committing this terrible crime , and no reasonable security measures could have prevented his unforeseeable act , '' Yale said in a statement .

`` Annie Le 's murder shocked and deeply saddened the entire Yale community . As a community we united to support and comfort her family and loved ones , and create a lasting memorial to her life . This lawsuit serves neither justice nor Annie 's memory , and the University will defend against it as appropriate . ''

Le had planned to marry Columbia graduate student Jonathan Widawsky on the day her body was found .

Clark was not a Yale student but had worked as a lab technician at the university since 2004 , after graduating from high school . He lived with his girlfriend , who also was a Yale lab technician , according to police .

A Yale faculty member had described Clark 's job as maintaining colonies for animals used in research .
