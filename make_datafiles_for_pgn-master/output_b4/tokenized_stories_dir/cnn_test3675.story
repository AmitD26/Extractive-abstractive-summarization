NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ben Folds did n't realize how great his music was until he heard a bunch of college students singing it .

Ben Folds was so impressed by a cappella groups ' performances of his songs , he made a record with them .

The singer-songwriter says he was beyond impressed when he stumbled across videos of university a cappella groups singing covers of his songs on YouTube .

`` I was really moved , '' he says . `` I thought it was better than what I had done when I first heard it . That 's how it struck me because it was so fresh . ''

And so an idea was born : Folds would travel to university campuses around the country and record an entire album of a cappella covers .

The North Carolina native picked 15 ensembles from 250 submissions for `` Ben Folds Presents : University A Cappella ! '' -LRB- Epic -RRB- , which came out Tuesday . And to give the music a `` field recording '' feel , he kept the process simple : Each performance was recorded using six wide-range microphones , and most of the groups got it down in one or two takes .

`` It 's a completely different point of view , '' says Folds , 42 , of the students ' renderings of his tunes . `` They 're not signed singers and artists that have their egos to contend with . And sometimes they 're not thinking about the song that much , which I think is kind of cool . ''

But not wanting to have the thunder completely stolen from him -LRB- and probably to entice his loyal fans to shell out for the album -RRB- Folds sings two a cappella tracks himself : `` Boxing '' from his Ben Folds Five days , and `` Effington '' from his 2008 solo album `` Way To Normal . ''

`` It was really difficult because we were doing my tracks from the bottom up , '' he says . `` We did n't have a bunch of people to work with and I just about gave up . ''

Ben Folds spoke to CNN about his youthful-sounding new release , why being married four times is n't much of a drama and why he faked an album leak . The following is an edited version of the interview .

CNN : Is this the one and only Ben Folds greatest hits album ?

Ben Folds : I think it naturally kind of is . I mean I was looking for something like that -- to possibly do a live orchestral album where the best material would kind of float to the top .

But then again , someone 's going to want to release a greatest hits soon , so this is the other greatest hits .

CNN : Did you learn anything from the students ?

Folds : Yeah . I relearned a lot of stuff . ... This is all so old school . I mean these guys , they 'd just do a live take and they just do n't know that the pros do n't do it that way . I mean , professional singers are a nightmare . You 've got ta tune every syllable , they have to do it 10,000 times . These guys just did it .

CNN : And you went around each campus to record each track ?

Folds : We kept them in what I would say is their natural habitat . I was really into the field recording idea . When you start messing with it and putting everyone on separate tracks you 've lost the event and you 've gained some sense of maybe perfection , but when it comes to the human voice , even-tempered piano tuning sounds incorrect to me . I think that people have a natural tuning mechanism .

CNN : You 've always been very Internet savvy . You 've embraced MySpace . Do you Twitter ?

Folds : I 'm not sure what that is .

There 's always something new . I think that my fans knew how to use computers before most people 's fans . I remember when everybody was talking about the possibility of downloading , and I was already having kids walk up with CDs they had burned for me to sign . This was like 1999 . I was signing burned CDs more than I was signing my own . So I think they get it .

CNN : Why did you decide to leak a fake version of your 2008 album `` Way To Normal ? ''

Folds : Well , I think that we get very uptight when it comes time to record because there 's a process , an imminent process that has to do with just selling the record , mostly . And it also has to do with people 's general take on music and how it 's framed . I felt if something went out that was a joke and it was riding on the press of a new album , that we would be forced to go in and do something so quickly that we could n't monitor ourselves .

So while I thought it was funny , I really liked the idea of going into the studio and making six songs in one day . So we wrote and recorded six songs in a day , mixed that day while we played our gig that night . And then it was mastered the next day . And then we leaked it the third day .

So in three days we wrote , recorded , mixed , mastered , distributed and did press on an album . I think things were kind of cool .

CNN : You 've been married four times . Is that helpful for singer-songwriter purposes ? I mean , that 's a lot of drama .

Folds : Well , it was n't a lot of drama , really . ... Everyone 's life is different and I think the pace at which I 've lived and the way that I tend to take a risk all contributes to the way that I write . ...

If you 've got kids it is a drama . But it 's the kind of drama you want to not write a song about . Because one , the kids will hear it and secondly , I do n't like country music .

CNN : How has having kids changed your outlook on music ?

Folds : I have to work more quickly and more efficiently .

CNN : Who are you listening to at the moment ?

Folds : I 'm in a habit of buying old 78 -LSB- rpm -RSB- records and I 've got a little record player I 'm carrying with me .

CNN : That 's heavy .

Folds : Yeah , that 's heavy , dude .

CNN : I meant physically heavy -- to carry around a record player .

Folds : Oh , that too . I would n't know about that with my -LRB- jokingly flexes muscles -RRB- -- it does n't really occur to me , those things .
