Philadelphia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Philadelphia abortion provider who killed babies by cutting their spinal cords with scissors was found guilty of first-degree murder on Monday .

The conviction on three counts of first-degree murder means Dr. Kermit Gosnell , 72 , could be sentenced to death .

Assistant District Attorney Joanne Pescatore sobbed after the verdict in the high-profile case was announced . Gosnell appeared shocked . He let out a sigh and shook his head back and forth .

Defense attorney Jack McMahon told CNN it 's too soon to tell whether he will appeal the conviction .

`` We were disappointed . We put on a vigorous defense . We think it went well for us in the courtroom , '' he said . `` But the jury spoke , and we respect the jury 's verdict . ''

Gosnell also was accused in the death of Karnamaya Mongar , 41 , who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion at his West Philadelphia clinic . In that case , the jury found him guilty of involuntary manslaughter .

Gosnell , who is not a board-certified obstetrician or gynecologist , was also found guilty of 21 counts of abortion of the unborn , 24 weeks or older .

In Pennsylvania , abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake .

Abortion doctor case triggers painful memories for ex-patient

The case next moves to the penalty phase , when jurors will weigh whether to give Gosnell a death sentence . It 's possible the doctor will testify , said William Brennan , an attorney who represented Gosnell earlier in the case .

`` I would think there would be a lot of mitigation in this case and I think probably , and this is a guess , but probably at that time the jury would hear from Dr. Gosnell , '' he said .

Earlier Monday , the jury , after deliberating for two weeks , said it was hung on two counts , and the judge instructed them to continue trying to reach a verdict on them .

Judge Jeffrey P. Minehart also told jurors that their progress showed they were `` considering the evidence seriously . ''

Gosnell 's co-defendant , Eileen O'Neill , 56 , was found guilty of conspiracy to operate a corrupt organization and two counts of theft by deception for operating without a license to practice medicine . O'Neill , a medical school graduate , was not charged with performing illegal abortions .

Both pleaded not guilty .

Eight people involved in Gosnell 's clinic , called the Women 's Medical Society , have pleaded guilty to various charges , including four to murder .

The grand jury report from 2011 says the `` people who ran this sham medical practice included no doctors other than Gosnell himself , and not even a single nurse , '' yet they still made diagnoses , performed procedures and administered drugs .

McMahon , in an impassioned , 2Ã‚ 1/2 - hour closing argument , said that none of the infants was killed ; rather , he said , they were already dead as a result of Gosnell administering the drug Digoxin , which can cause abortion .

Gosnell also was accused of reusing unsanitary instruments ; performing procedures in filthy rooms , including some in which litter boxes and animals allegedly were present at the time ; and allowing unlicensed employees -- including a teenage high school student -- to perform operations and administer anesthesia .

The remains of aborted fetuses were stored in water jugs , pet food containers and a freezer at the clinic , the city 's chief medical examiner Sam Gulino testified .

Former employee Kareema Cross said Gosnell regularly performed illegal late-term abortions that he routinely recorded as `` 24.5 weeks . ''

McMahon , who called no witnesses , accused prosecutors of `` the most extraordinary hype and exaggeration in the history of the criminal justice system , '' even adding that they are `` elitist '' and `` racist . ''

Gosnell has been accused by authorities of preying on low-income , minority women . McMahon argued that Gosnell offered access to health care for people who were poor and without health insurance .

During his closing remarks , Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney Edward Cameron turned to Gosnell and yelled , `` Are you human ? ''

Gosnell smirked at Cameron without speaking . Cameron then continued , declaring , `` It 's time for us to extinguish the fire he created . ''

The doctor was first charged in January 2011 .

The case has drawn national attention and sharp criticism from anti-abortion activists .

But that does n't mean it sets a precedent , CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said .

`` The testimony in this case was so graphic and so horrific . It was described literally as a house of horrors taking place in this Philadelphia clinic , '' Callan said . `` So I think that most objective observers will say that ultimately this will be an isolated case , hopefully , and that it 's simply a case where prosecutors had to act . It had nothing to do with being pro- or anti-abortion . ''

After Monday 's verdict , the leader of one anti-abortion group said justice had been served .

`` Even as we celebrate this verdict , we honor and mourn as well those among our nation 's weakest children who did not receive ` their day in court ' -- and we must remember that Gosnell is not an outlier within the abortion industry , '' Lila Rose , president of Live Action , said in a written statement . `` We can not allow these ` guilty ' verdicts , welcome as they are , to make us complacent when it comes to the continuing abuses happening even now in abortion facilities throughout our nation . ''

More restrictions on abortions will lead to more cases like the Women 's Medical Society , not fewer , abortion rights advocates argue .

`` We thought we had said goodbye to back-alley abortionists , '' said Jessica Arons , head of the Women 's Health and Rights Program at the Center for American Progress .

`` Legal access to abortion helps counteract `` predators '' who `` prey on vulnerable women , '' Arons said .

`` It 's not that we need more laws or stricter laws , '' she said . `` Pennsylvania just did n't do its job in enforcing the laws against him earlier . ''
