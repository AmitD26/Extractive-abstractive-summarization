-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- George Zimmerman , charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin , had a `` little hero complex '' but was not a racist , a Sanford , Florida , homicide investigator told federal agents , according to reports released Thursday .

In an interview with FBI agents in March , investigator Chris Serino told authorities he `` believed that Zimmerman 's actions were not based on Martin 's skin color , rather based on his attire , the total circumstances of the encounter and the previous burglary suspects in the community , '' according to an FBI report .

The reports and other information in the case against Zimmerman were released Thursday by Special Prosecutor Angela Corey to Zimmerman 's attorney .

The U.S. Department of Justice took up a civil rights investigation after allegations that race played a part in the killing of Martin , 17 , in February in a gated community in Sanford , Florida . The reports released Thursday do not draw conclusions in that investigation .

Martin 's family and supporters say Zimmerman racially profiled the teen , describing him as `` suspicious '' during a 911 call and ignoring a police dispatcher 's request that he not follow him .

The 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer has said he killed Martin in self-defense , saying the teen punched him and slammed his head into a sidewalk before the shooting , according to family members and police .

Among the evidence released Thursday are details about federal interviews with more than 30 people , including key members of the Sanford Police Department and Zimmerman 's neighbors and co-workers .

In his interview , Serino explained to the FBI agents that African-American gangs in the community `` typically dressed in black and wore hoodies , '' the report said .

`` Serino believes that when Zimmerman saw Martin in a hoody -LRB- sic -RRB- , Zimmerman took it upon himself to view Martin as acting suspicious , '' the report said . `` Serino described Zimmerman as overzealous and as having ` a little hero complex , ' but not as a racist . Serino explained that on numerous occasions he asked Zimmerman specifically if he followed Martin based on his skin color and Zimmerman never admitted to this fact . ''

In June , Sanford police said Serino had voluntarily asked to be moved from detective to patrol officer . At the time , police Sgt. David Morgenstern said the move was not a demotion and that he did not know why Serino made the request .

Many of Zimmerman 's neighbors , whose identities are redacted , told federal agents they did not know him . Those who did had nothing derogatory to say about him .

Similarly , interviewed co-workers were complimentary of Zimmerman . Several noted an incident in which a lock Zimmerman used to attach his orthopedic chair to his desk was cut , but said he handled it appropriately and professionally .

One apparent co-worker , whose identity was redacted , told agents she saw Zimmerman as he was waiting to speak to human resources the Monday after the shooting and noticed his injuries . The woman told agents that Zimmerman was `` absolutely emotionally devastated . ''

A timeline of events

Another FBI report documents a March 30 interview with a store owner who contacted authorities to say Zimmerman had contacted him about two weeks earlier `` in reference to purchasing a new firearm . '' Zimmerman told the owner , whose identity was redacted , that `` his life is in danger and he needs more guns , '' the report said . It was unclear from the report whether Zimmerman purchased the firearm .

The evidence also included audio of conversations between 911 dispatchers and Sanford police .

The dispatcher tells officers to look for a `` black male , late teens , wearing a dark gray hoodie and sweatpants , walking around , '' adding that the youth was last seen running toward the back of the neighborhood .

Then , says the dispatcher , `` There 's screaming and a gunshot , are you responding ? '' Dispatchers later tell responding officers they have received a total of four calls regarding the incident . `` Someone 's laying in the backyard , '' a dispatcher says .

`` I need somebody ASAP , '' an officer says on the recording . `` I 've got one down with a gunshot wound , and I 've got one secure . ''

Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump told CNN 's `` Erin Burnett OutFront '' on Thursday evening that the question of Zimmerman 's attitudes on race was not pertinent .

`` None of that matters to why this armed watchman with a 9 mm gun got out of his car and chased an unarmed teenager and shot him in the heart , '' said Crump .

`` The fact I wear a hoodie does n't justify you killing me , '' he told Burnett .

Also released Thursday were reports on interviews with agents of the Florida Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco , who arrested Zimmerman in 2005 on suspicion of battery against a law enforcement officer and obstruction of justice . The agents told authorities that Zimmerman did not use racial slurs or discriminatory language during the incident , the reports said .

The charges against Zimmerman , who was accused of pushing an undercover agent , were later dropped after he entered a pretrial diversion program and completed an anger management class .

A report on an interview with Zimmerman 's ex-fiance was also released . The woman told authorities that while she and Zimmerman had physical altercations and at one point filed restraining orders against one another , she never saw Zimmerman exhibit any other violence or exhibit any racial bias .

Additionally , details about Zimmerman 's MySpace account , surveillance video and e-mails between Zimmerman and ousted Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee were released as part of the evidence handover .

On the MySpace account in the name of `` Joe G. , '' Zimmerman , who is Hispanic , recalls moving from Manassas , Virginia , saying , `` I do n't miss driving around scared to hit Mexicans walkin on the side of the street , soft ass wan na be thugs messin with peoples cars when they ai n't around -LRB- what are you provin , that you can dent a car when no ones watchin -RRB- do n't make you a man in my book . Working 96 hours to get a decent pay check , getting knifes pulled on you by every Mexican you run into . ''

Also released were copies of the e-mails between Zimmerman and Lee before the shooting regarding the neighborhood watch program . Zimmerman , in the e-mails , notes there has been a `` spike in robberies and home invasions in the neighborhood within the past two months . ''

He adds that he has not had a positive view of Sanford police because of the `` Sherman Ware incident . '' Ware , a black homeless man , was beaten by a Sanford police lieutenant 's son . Zimmerman was critical of police handling of the case and reportedly worked on Ware 's behalf .

Zimmerman was released on $ 1 million bond last week . An initial bond of $ 150,000 was revoked last month after a judge learned that Zimmerman and his wife failed to disclose more than $ 150,000 in donations from the public .
