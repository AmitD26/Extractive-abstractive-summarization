-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Less than two weeks after she was brutally stabbed , a 12-year-old Wisconsin girl is home recuperating and feeling well enough to tease her younger brother , her family says .

`` Her physical wounds , thankfully , are healing more quickly than anticipated and her pain is decreasing daily , '' the family said in a statement . `` For that , we are so grateful . ''

The family has designated Tuesday as `` Go Purple '' day . It 's the survivor 's favorite color and the family is asking supporters to wear it .

The family has asked that the victim not be named for her safety and because she is a minor .

Purple is also part of the theme of the official #HeartsForHealing fundraiser for the victim and her family .

The campaign has raised more than $ 42,000 toward its goal of $ 250,000 , and has also resulted in an outpouring of homemade purple hearts to be delivered to the girl and her family .

`` The messages that people are including in their hearts , the time and effort that they 're putting into some of these projects , it was absolutely incredible , '' Dana Hoffman , a family friend and spokeswoman and one of the organizers of the Hearts for Healing campaign , told CNN 's `` New Day . ''

The girl 's family said it is `` overwhelmed by the outpouring of love from the surrounding community , across the country , and even overseas . ''

The attack

The ordeal began May 31 when the girl went into the woods near her home in Waukesha to play hide-and-seek with two of her friends .

Authorities said one girl held the victim down while another stabbed her 19 times , allegedly so that the attackers could impress a fictitious character called Slenderman that often appears in horror stories , videos and images .

Who is Slenderman ?

One of the girls encountered the name on a website known as Creepypasta Wiki . One of the suspects told police that Slenderman is the site 's supposed leader , and to climb into his realm , a user must kill someone .

A bicyclist found the wounded girl alive .

The suspects , Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier , were arrested hours later , according to a criminal complaint . They are charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide .

The 12-year-olds are being charged as adults , and bail is set at $ 500,000 for each , Waukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel said .

The recovery

The victim is sleeping better at night , her family said . But she gets tired and overwhelmed easily .

`` Since coming home , our daughter has enjoyed spending time outside and getting fresh air as well as running a few quick errands with her mom , '' the statement said .

`` She spent time watching many episodes of ` Full House ' alongside her ` guard pets ' , which consist of a family dog and two cats . Like any older sister , she has also managed to continue teasing her younger brother . ''

The family has had a few conversations about what happened that day , Hoffman said , mostly focused on how the girl found the strength to crawl out of the woods where she was attacked and seek help .

`` I was taken aback by the strength this little girl has , '' Hoffman said .
