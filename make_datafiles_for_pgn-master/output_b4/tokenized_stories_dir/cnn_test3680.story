Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Supreme Court sided on Tuesday with adoptive parents in a divisive custody fight over a Native American child after the biological father asserted his parental rights .

The justices , by a 5-4 margin , said the adoption by a white couple was proper and did not intrude on the federal rights of the father , a registered member of the Cherokee tribe , over where his daughter , Veronica , 3 , would live .

The court said the father could not rely on the Indian Child Welfare Act for relief because he never had legal or physical custody at the time of adoption proceedings , which were initiated by the birth mother without his knowledge .

Justice Samuel Alito said when `` the adoption of an Indian child is voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights , the -LRB- law 's -RRB- primary goal of preventing unwarranted removal of Indian children and the dissolution of Indian families is not implicated . ''

The appeal was filed by Matt and Melanie Capobianco , who legally adopted Veronica in 2009 shortly after the birth mother agreed to give up the child .

She is known in court papers as `` Baby Girl . ''

The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled last year for the biological father , Dusten Brown , who had sought custody after Veronica 's birth . He is a registered member of the Cherokee Nation and is raising the child in Oklahoma .

The ICWA remains in effect , but the high court majority concluded the biological father could not apply it to his circumstances .

The Supreme Court ruling throws the issue back to the state courts , but it was not clear whether and when Brown would have to turn the girl over to the Capobiancos .

The Charleston , South Carolina , couple said they hope the ruling will prevent disruptions of other adoptions .

`` We are very happy with the ruling today . The Supreme Court gave us everything that we asked for , '' Melanie Capobianco told CNN affiliate WCSC . `` They made it very clear that Veronica would have never been taken from her home and from her family and that the adoption would have been approved . ''

She and Matt Capobianco said separation from Veronica has been difficult .

`` We are looking forward to seeing her again soon when we have the opportunity to do so , because we miss her so very much , '' said Melanie Capobianco .

Christinna Maldanado , Veronica 's birth mother , also expressed satisfaction .

`` Matt and Melanie are part of my family , and they have treated me like part of theirs . I 'm hopeful that we will all be reunited with Veronica very soon , '' the statement said .

There was no immediate reaction from Brown , or the tribe . But Native American groups remained hopeful he would still keep custody .

`` While we are pleased the court has upheld ICWA , we 're very disappointed for Dusten , Veronica , and the Brown family that the court has ruled to send the case back to the South Carolina courts on a technicality , '' said Jefferson Keel , president of the National Congress of American Indians .

`` However , the courts in South Carolina have previously affirmed that Dusten Brown is Veronica 's father and that he is a fit parent . We are confident that his parental rights will be upheld and that Veronica will stay with her family , '' Keel said .
