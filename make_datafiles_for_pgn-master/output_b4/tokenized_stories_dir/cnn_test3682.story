-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Turkey fired on Syrian government targets in response to the shelling of a Turkish border town in which five civilians were killed Wednesday , according to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's office .

The town of Akcakale `` was hit by artillery fire belonging to the Syrian regime forces , '' a statement from Erdogan 's office said , in the first clear assertion of blame for the shelling .

`` Our armed forces on the border responded immediately to this atrocious attack within the rules of engagement , and points in Syria determined by radar were hit with artillery fire , '' it said . `` Turkey , within the confines of the rules of engagement and international law , will never leave these types of provocations aimed at our national security unanswered . ''

The retaliatory artillery fire marks a significant increase in tension between the two countries , and CNN affiliate CNN Turk reported that witnesses observed intermittent artillery fire from Turkey into Syria continuing into the early hours Thursday .

Syrian authorities are `` offering sincerest condolences on behalf of the Syrian government to the family of the deceased and the Turkish people '' and are investigating the source of the gunfire , according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency -LRB- SANA -RRB- .

`` In case of border incidents that occur between any two neighboring countries , countries and governments must act wisely , rationally and responsibly , particularly since there 's a special condition on the Syrian-Turkish borders in terms of the presence of undisciplined terrorist groups spread across the borders who have varying agendas and identities , '' said Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi .

Opposition groups in Syria said artillery fire from Turkey fell on a government military center near Tal Abyad in northern Syria 's Raqqa province . Turkish military reinforcements are deployed near the border , they added .

The artillery shell fired into Turkey came from Tal Abyad , according to Turkey 's semiofficial Anadolu news agency .

The North Atlantic Council , NATO 's most senior political governing body , said it stands by Turkey .

The alliance `` demands the immediate cessation of such aggressive acts against an ally , and urges the Syrian regime to put an end to flagrant violations of international law , '' the council said after an emergency meeting . The Syrian government has a recent pattern of `` aggressive attacks '' at NATO 's southeastern border , it said .

Akcakale Mayor Abdulhakim Ayhan said earlier that three children , their mother and a female neighbor died when a house was hit . Two police officers were among those hurt , he said .

Nine people were injured when the shell landed on the town in Sanliurfa province , near the Syrian border , the Turkish prime minister 's statement said .

Relations between Turkey and Syria were already under strain over Damascus ' response to an 18-month-long uprising against the government of President Bashar al-Assad .

Civil war in Syria

A senior U.S. defense official said the Pentagon is watching the situation with some degree of concern , `` but at this point , there 's nothing to suggest it 's going to become a broader conflict . ''

The official said the reciprocal fire appeared to be a smaller-scale border skirmish rather than a large-scale aerial bombardment .

`` We think this is Turkey basically saying , ` Do n't mess with us . Whatever is going on inside Syria , do n't mess with us , ' '' the official told CNN .

Both nations would have an interest in not allowing the conflict to escalate , according to the official .

`` In some ways , Turkey would have more to lose in that kind of fight than Syria . They 've already got a potential refugee problem coming from Syria , and a fight would only make that worse , the official said , adding that `` Syria has so many problems right now , the last thing the government needs is to add another . ''

Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to express his government 's `` deepest concern '' about the shelling , U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said . Before launching its military strike against Syrian targets Wednesday , Turkey reached out to NATO and U.N. chiefs .

Ban issued a statement expressing condolences to the shelling victims in Turkey . He called on Syria to respect the territorial integrity of its neighbors .

The U.N. Security Council privately discussed the situation .

`` The secretary-general has repeatedly warned that the ongoing militarization of the conflict in Syria is leading to tragic results for the Syrian people , '' Ban said . `` Today 's incidents , where firing from Syria struck a Turkish town , again demonstrated how Syria 's conflict is threatening not only the security of the Syrian people but increasingly causing harm to its neighbors . ''

Musa Ozer , who lives next to the house where the artillery shell landed , was crying as he spoke on the phone with CNN in the aftermath of the attack .

`` The bomb fell on us . My head 's really not in the right place right now , '' he said . `` My uncle was injured and his wife died . What am I to make of this ? ''

Ayhan said the shell landed on one house but debris from the impact scattered across a wider area , leading to the high number of injuries .

He also voiced the concern felt by residents of the southeastern town . `` The people of Akcakale are rising up against this . They live in fear , '' he told CNN Turk . The mayor said the shell that caused the deaths was the second to land Wednesday on Akcakale .

Salih Aydogdu , a local neighborhood mayor , called for authorities to act to prevent such incidents .

`` Over the last month , we 've had these types of incident five or six times . This is a small place ; every time it happens , we can hear it . We are right on the border with Syria , '' he said . `` The people of Akcakale are upset . We want the governor and the police to take precautions . This was Turkey 's most peaceful and tranquil area . Now we have neither peace nor tranquility . ''

For the past two weeks , schools have been closed in the town , and the teachers have left , he added .

Akcakale has been rocked by previous fighting just across the border in Syria .

Last month , Turkish residents watched as Syrian shells crashed into Syrian territory , barely a stone 's throw away from the Turkish border fence .

The close artillery barrage forced Turkish authorities to temporarily shut schools in Akcakale and close off roads leading to the Syrian border .

Rebel leadership announces move from Turkey to Syria

Only two years ago , Syria and Turkey enjoyed cozy bilateral relations . The neighbors had instituted visa-free travel for their citizens , and cross-border trade was booming .

Diplomatic relations ruptured , however , months after the Syrian uprising began . Last March , Turkey shuttered its embassy in Damascus and the Syrian government declared Turkey 's ambassador , Omer Onhon , persona non grata .

Erdogan has repeatedly denounced Syrian President al-Assad , publicly calling on him to step down after accusing him of massacring his own people . The Syrian government , meanwhile , has accused Turkey of arming and funding Syrian rebels .

CNN journalists have witnessed light weapons in the form of assault rifles , rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns coming from Turkey to Syrian rebels .

In addition , Turkey is currently hosting more than 93,000 Syrian refugees in camps . Turkish officials estimate another 40,000 to 50,000 unofficial refugees live in Turkey outside refugee camps .

This is not the first deadly cross-border incident between the two neighbors .

On Tuesday , Turkish officials announced at least two suspected Kurdish fighters were killed after a clash broke out along the border in Turkey 's Mardin province .

In June , the Syrian government announced it had shot down a Turkish military reconnaissance jet after it crossed into Syrian airspace .

Two Turkish pilots were killed in the incident . The Turkish government continues to insist the jet was shot down by a surface-to-air missile after it left Syrian airspace -- claims that the Syrian government denies .
