-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Deep in my heart , I do believe that we shall overcome someday : This is the refrain that guided the hearts and hands and voices of the '60s generation . At the LBJ Library , April 8-10 , the Civil Rights Summit will begin -- the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the passage of the great 1960s civil rights laws .

It was legislation that changed America forever and for the better .

There were four great laws , each building upon the other . The 1964 Civil Rights Bill , also known as the Public Accommodations Act , ensured that people of color could use the same water fountains , toilets , public transport and seats in restaurants and hotels as white people .

The 1965 Voting Rights Act ensured people of color the right to vote . The 1968 Fair Housing Act made it possible for people of color and all religions to be able to buy a house where they could afford to . The 1968 Immigration Act eliminated racial and ethnic quotas .

These laws opened the doors of liberty and justice for all as never before . No matter how imperfect they were , they made ours a more just society . For me it was all so very personal .

My father , President Lyndon Baines Johnson , signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act on my 17th birthday . The only handwritten note I have from my father was his birthday letter written at 12:10 p.m. that day . Daddy did n't have time to go to the pharmacy to buy a Hallmark card . At 6 p.m. , he was signing a bill into law that would liberate my generation from the shackles of legalized apartheid . It was the best birthday present anyone could ever receive .

Many doubt 1964 Civil Rights Act could pass today

When I questioned why he gave the first pen used to sign the bill to the Republican leader Sen. Everett Dirksen instead of one of the great civil rights leaders , he shook his head in disappointment that I had n't gotten the obvious lesson .

He told me , `` Luci Baines , I did n't have to convince one of the great civil rights leaders to be for that legislation . They were already for it . But because of Everett Dirksen 's decision to support this law and bring his supporters with him , the great civil rights leaders and I have a law , not just a bill . That 's why Senator Dirksen got the pen . He deserved it . ''

When I questioned why we had gone to the Capitol Rotunda for the signing , Daddy shook his head in disappointment again . `` Luci Baines , we have to go to the Rotunda of the Capitol .

`` There will be many brave men and women not returning to these hallowed halls because of their courageous stand for voting rights . And there are many brave men and women who will be able to serve here only because of the courage of this Congress . That 's why we must go to the Rotunda to let the world know how grateful we are to this Congress . ''

I was on `` Daddy duty '' on August 6 , 1965 , and stood behind him in the Rotunda as he signed the Voting Rights Act into law . That day he taught me not only about the justice of the act ; he taught me the importance of his favorite biblical passage , `` Come , let us reason together . ''

These lessons of social justice have changed our country forever , for the better , although their work is far from done . The lessons of coming and reasoning together remain a cry we need to answer now more than ever .

It was all so very personal .

I grew up in Washington in an area fondly known as `` Hanukkah Heights . '' We lived in `` Hanukkah Heights '' because there were no restrictive covenants as there were in other areas that discriminated against buyers based on their color or religion . My first employer and forever friend was one of the first Jews able to buy a home in what had been a restricted neighborhood . The Fair Housing Act was not just a bill for justice to me . It was all so very personal .

There are 25 members in my immediate family . We are of mixed race , mixed ethnicities , many nationalities . We are Catholics , Protestants , Jews and others . We are a family of immigrants with all the diversity that Lyndon Johnson celebrated .

At the head of the stairs in the LBJ Library is one of my favorite quotes of my father . `` Until justice is blind to color , until education is unaware of race , until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men 's skins , emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact . ''

Much was accomplished when our nation `` came and reasoned together . '' But there are still laws that make it harder for the poor to have access to the voting booth . And there are laws that still exist that bar equality based on whom you love . There remains much to be done .

Generations of Johnsons are so grateful that four presidents are coming to the LBJ Library to celebrate this Civil Rights 50th anniversary with a new generation committed to social justice .

It is our hope that by coming and reasoning together once more , we can renew our commitment to making ours a country `` blind to color , where education is unaware of race and opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men 's skins . ''

Only then will our proclamation for emancipation become a fact . Only then will we overcome the bondage of social injustice that hurts us all . But with a new renewal to the needs of social justice , I do believe , deep in my heart that we shall overcome someday !
