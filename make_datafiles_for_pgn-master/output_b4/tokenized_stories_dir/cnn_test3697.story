TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad heads to Pakistan and India this week to put the finishing touches on a controversial deal to build a pipeline that would deliver Iranian gas to both countries , Iran 's semi-official Fars news agency says .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad waves as he arrives Monday in Islamabad , Pakistan .

Ahmadinejad arrived in Islamabad on Monday for a four-hour visit with newly elected Prime Minister Reza Gilani and President Pervez Musharraf , according to Pakistan 's information ministry . Later in the day , he heads to Sri Lanka before traveling to New Delhi late Tuesday for a short visit , according to Iran 's state-run news agency IRNA .

The pipeline , if built , would be about 2,700 kilometers -LRB- 1,674 miles -RRB- long .

Pakistan and India , both key U.S. allies , are under pressure from the United States not to sign any kind of agreement with Iran .

Some observers have called the project `` the peace pipeline '' because of its perceived impact on reducing tension between India and Pakistan , nuclear neighbors that have fought three wars , two of them over the disputed Kashmir region . Watch Ahmadinejad arrive in India ''

The gas pipeline project , which has been in discussions for over a year , is aimed at supplying Iranian natural gas to Pakistan and India . The pipeline would run from Iran to India , cutting through Pakistan .

According to Fars , Ahmadinejad 's visit comes after Pakistani and Indian energy ministers signed an agreement last week , once they had resolved a major `` bone of contention '' regarding the route of the gas pipeline .

`` Now that all sides have calmed down , President Ahmadinejad will discuss the ` Peace Pipeline ' at the highest levels during his visit to the Sub-Continent , '' Fars said .

Under the agreement , the pipeline will run through 1,100 kilometers -LRB- 682 miles -RRB- of Iran , 1,000 kilometers -LRB- 620 miles -RRB- of Pakistan and 600 kilometers -LRB- 372 miles -RRB- of India , according to Fars .

`` The pipeline will be capable of daily transporting 150 million cubic meters of gas to Pakistan and India -- 90 million cubic meters will go to India and the rest will go to Pakistan , '' Fars said .

`` The pipeline project was initially estimated to cost $ 4.5 billion , but the cost has been revised to around $ 7 billion . ''

The United States recently tried to scuttle the pipeline by offering India advanced nuclear technology to make up for the loss of Iranian gas . But Fars reported that India recently declared its readiness to participate in the discussions on the pipeline after more than a year .

China -- Iran 's largest trade partner followed by India -- has previously said that it would negotiate in India 's place if New Delhi withdraws from the project , according to Fars . China borders Pakistan to the north .

A top adviser to the Iranian president spoke on the eve of Ahmadinejad 's visit about the importance of oil and gas when it comes to putting Western powers `` in their place , '' according to Fars .

`` Oil and gas are two elements of power at the disposal of the Muslims , '' Gen. Yahya Safavi said Sunday , according to Fars .

`` If it -LRB- the power -RRB- be viewed properly -LRB- with wisdom -RRB- and within the framework of the interests of Islam and Muslims , one can then put the hegemonic powers back in their place . '' E-mail to a friend
