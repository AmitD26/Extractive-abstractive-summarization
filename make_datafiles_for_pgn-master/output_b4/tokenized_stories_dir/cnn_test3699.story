CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Today 's show is dedicated to Ms. Willard 's world geography classes at Lumberport Middle School in Lumberport , West Virginia ! Welcome everyone !

First Up : Financial Markets

AZUZ : An overhaul of the rules for the country 's banks . President Obama says that 's what 's needed to avoid another economic crisis . He made the statement during a speech on Wall Street yesterday . But some lawmakers and economic experts disagree with some of the president 's proposals , like a federal agency that Mr. Obama says would be responsible for protecting consumers . Ben Bernanke , who heads up the country 's central bank , says that 's what his organization does , so a new agency is n't necessary .

The timing of the speech came on the one-year anniversary of the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history ! President Obama says America 's financial industry needs to learn from past mistakes to avoid future crises .

U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : One year ago , we saw in stark relief how markets can spin out of control , how a lack of common-sense rules can lead to excess and abuse , how close we can come to the brink . One year later , it is incumbent upon us to put in place those reforms that will prevent this kind of crisis from ever happening again , reflecting painful but important lessons that we 've learned and that will help us move from a period of reckless irresponsibility , a period of crisis , to one of responsibility and prosperity .

H1N1 Vaccine

AZUZ : From regulation to inoculation , health officials say a vaccine for the H1N1 virus , also known as swine flu , could be ready in a few weeks . That 's earlier than expected . More good news : Researchers say one shot should be enough ; originally , they thought it would take two . Experts say certain groups , including students , should get the vaccine . It takes a little more than a week for it to take effect .

Shoutout

GEORGE RAMSAY , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Time for the Shoutout ! Which of these bodies of water is located in northern Israel ? If you think you know it , shout it out ! Is it the : A -RRB- Sea of Galilee , B -RRB- Dead Sea , C -RRB- Red Sea or the D -RRB- Caspian Sea ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! You 'll find the Sea of Galilee in the northeast part of the Middle Eastern nation . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout !

Ancient Discovery

AZUZ : And that 's where archaeologists have made a religously significant discovery . Today , the Galilee region is known as a tourist spot with a lot of resorts . But a couple thousand years ago , it played a big role in two world religions . And now , scientists have uncovered a piece of that history . Here 's Paula Hancocks ...

PAULA HANCOCKS , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : On the shores of the Sea of Galilee , a discovery that should excite both Jews and Christians . Israeli archeologists say they 've found one of the world 's oldest synagogues , from the time of Jesus and in the neighborhood of Jesus .

DINA AVSHALOM-GORNI , EXCAVATION DIRECTOR : It is possible to think that Jesus was sitting here with his community in this synagogue , praying together with Mary Magdalene .

HANCOCKS : The Bible documents Jesus ' time at the Sea of Galilee , and Mary Magdelene is believed to have lived close by this site . The ruins date back some 2,000 years , and may not have been unearthed at all if it were n't for construction starting on the foundations of a hotel planned for this spot . For these archaeologists , the date is crucial , as they believe this synagogue was operational at the time of the Second Temple , the main synagogue in Jerusalem , and has a preserved , seven-branched menorah .

AVSHALOM-GORNI : We can see very nicely the curve of the menorah , which would presume exactly in the right temple , at the temple at this time .

HANCOCKS : Excavation is continuing , and already plans are underway to open the synagogue to the public .

YOSSI STEPANSKI , ARCHAEOLOGIST : This is certainly the most elaborate one , with a mosaic floor with frescoes . We have walls here that are painted with frescoes . This is really the first time that an elaborate , beautifully decorated synagogue from that time has been discovered .

HANCOCKS : Building plans for the hotel have obviously had to change , but this discovery could well attract far more visitors than a hotel ever could . Paula Hancocks , CNN , Jerusalem .

Word to the Wise

RAMSAY : A Word to the Wise ...

matriculation -LRB- noun -RRB- enrollment , especially in a college or university

Detour to College

AZUZ : This year , matriculation has come at a higher price , literally . The average cost of tuition at a four-year public college is up more than six percent . Public versus private , in-state versus out-of-state : Different schools come with different price tags . And for many families , college choices can mean tough choices . Fredericka Whitfield has one student 's story .

-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB-

FREDRICKA WHITFIELD , CNN ANCHOR , CNN NEWSROOM : Move-in day for college freshman Pressley Chakales to a place she never expected would bring so much happiness and harmony .

PRESSLEY CHAKALES , UGA FRESHMAN : I 've been working all day getting my room together . But I like it , I 'm excited

WHITFIELD : Also excited : her parents Peter and Ann .

PETER CHAKALES , FATHER : This is like a ride to a suburb when you live in Atlanta , so she 's close .

WHITFIELD : But the hour-long ride to the University of Georgia in Athens did n't come without detours . Like thousands of American households on tighter budgets , savings and 401Ks taking double digit losses , family plans are forced to be flexible .

PRESSLEY CHAKALES : I was really , really completely set on going out of state .

WHITFIELD : Oh , we remember . We first met the Chakales last spring . College acceptance letters were coming in , along with the prospect of a full scholarship available to Georgia students with a 3.0 GPA or higher planning to attend an in-state school . But at the time , Pressley and her parents were not seeing eye to eye .

WHITFIELD : So , your heart tells you one thing , but the purse strings tell you another .

PRESSLEY CHAKALES : Yeah , definitely .

WHITFIELD : So , what are these conversations like with mom and dad when you all try to come to grips about a happy medium ?

PRESSLEY CHAKALES : They can get heated .

WHITFIELD : That was last March . Now ?

PRESSLEY CHAKALES : I ended up getting into UGA off the wait-list , and my decision immediately changed to back in-state , because I was going to UNC Wilmington , but I switched back to UGA to save an indescribable amount of money .

WHITFIELD : A huge relief for her parents . Even though they spent years saving for her higher education , the thought of unloading at least $ 25,000 a year for four years of out-of-state undergrad was stressful beyond words .

PETER CHAKALES : Well , it would have been very tough . It was frightening . The financial part was absolutely frightening .

WHITFIELD : Staying in-state , able to benefit from that Georgia full academic scholarship cut their expenses by more than half . Out of pocket now : $ 10,000 a year for Pressley 's housing , books and other fees . The benefits of their family decision : endless .

ANN CHAKALES , MOTHER : I think she 'll be able to study abroad for a semester if she wants to , and that probably would not have happened if she had gone out of state .

WHITFIELD : The Chakales are confident Pressley will maintain a 3.0 or better to keep the state scholarship until graduation . But the family savings plan continues . In three years , it 'll be Pressley 's younger brother 's turn .

ANN CHAKALES : We will probably start prepping our son a little bit earlier .

WHITFIELD : In hopes that he , too , qualifies for the same kind of in-state help . Fredricka Whitfield , CNN , Atlanta .

Public Outbursts

KANYE WEST : I 'm really happy for your , I 'm gon na let you finish , but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time !

AZUZ : The most talked-about moment from the MTV Video Music Awards was not part of the script : Kanye West interrupting Taylor Swift 's acceptance speech to announce who he thought should have won . The backlash against West has been fast , and heated . This is n't the only recent outburst from people in the public eye . You might have heard about tennis star Serena Williams being docked a point for her outburst during the U.S. Open , and U.S. Representative Joe Wilson yelling out during President Obama 's recent address to Congress on health care reform .

Promo

AZUZ : All three have apologized ; Kanye did it on his blog . But what we 're asking on ours is , are these outbursts appropriate ? Are they disrespectful ? When and how is it okay to express your disagreement with something ? Tell us your opinion at CNNStudentNews.com .

Before We Go

AZUZ : Finally , mark your calendars : CNN Student News is celebrating its 20th anniversary on September 25th . As a sneak preview for you , here 's a look back at the past two decades .
