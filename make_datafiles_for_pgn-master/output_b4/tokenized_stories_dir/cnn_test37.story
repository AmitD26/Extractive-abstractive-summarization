Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As President Obama announced the first national HIV/AIDS strategy earlier this week , outside the gates of the White House , 3 percent of the District of Columbia 's population continues to live with the disease .

HIV/AIDS rates in the district are `` on par with Uganda and some parts of Kenya '' where the disease has raged for years , says Shannon Hader , Washington 's former HIV/AIDS administration director .

Three percent of Washingtonians live with HIV/AIDS , according to a study released by the district in 2009 . The accepted threshold for a `` generalized and severe epidemic , '' according to the study , is 1 percent .

Flanked by national health care administrators and community activists , Obama said his national strategy is to increase prevention and improve treatment while reducing disparities among groups hardest-hit by the disease .

In Washington , that 's the African-American community , according to activists .

`` In Washington , D.C. there 's a huge disparity through race . The African-American community bears a huge burden of HIV in D.C. -- way above and beyond the proportions of the demographics of the D.C. area , '' says Justin Goforth , who works with the Whitman-Walker Clinic , a health center specializing in HIV/AIDS care .

And it 's estimated that a third to half of Washington residents living with the disease do n't know it , Goforth said .

Part of the problem is the stigma in the African-American community related to the disease , he said .

Guy Jenkins was 17 when he was infected with the virus that causes AIDS . Now 28 , the gay African-American man has become an advocate within his community , speaking to groups whenever possible . But he believes the best way to reach his peers is through faith-based organizations , to stop the stigma related to testing and having the disease .

`` It 's a religious thing , mainly a lot of the churches do n't tend to back it -LSB- HIV/AIDS testing and education -RSB- and because they do n't back it and -LSB- the church -RSB- is the backbone of the black community , we find ourselves hiding behind doors . ''

`` We do n't tend to take to homosexuality or HIV/AIDS very well , '' Jenkins says . `` It 's always a tendency to put the blame on someone else . ... We tend to say it 's another person , they did n't tell us , they did n't let us know what was going on . It does stand true to this day . ''

It 's something Jenkins knows first-hand .

`` For me , it took a long time to get over the stigma , get out of the closet , to stop hiding behind my status . ''

Goforth also believes faith-based initiatives would be helpful . His organization has worked to identify area churches where regular testing and counseling could occur .

He says the effort has yielded some positive results .

`` I think in the last three or four years in this community , we slowed the freight train down and we now are looking to turn that freight train around . ''

Both men are hopeful that more federal dollars might help .

`` Money makes the world go round , '' Jenkins said .

But more important , they agree the money must be carefully targeted to the communities hardest hit .

`` Federal dollars need to pour to those communities , to do education , to do outreach , to do testing campaigns , and to aggressively link those people to care . It really is to get people to medical care and to treatment , '' Goforth said .

Obama told the crowd assembled at the White House , `` We 're here because we believe that while HIV transmission rates in this country are not as high as they once were , every new case is one case too many . ''

For Goforth , who tested HIV positive 18 years ago , the daily battle to reduce infections is more than just a job .

`` I have a very personal stake in my career , '' he says .

`` I sometimes say , I come to work to save myself every day . ''
