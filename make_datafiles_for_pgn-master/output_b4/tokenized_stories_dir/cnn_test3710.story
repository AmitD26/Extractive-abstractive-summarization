-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's crazy golf on an insane scale -- a putting green swimming in a giant bowl of noodles and chopsticks , the Great Wall of China for a hazard , a fairway threading through Mayan ruins and a panda-themed hole .

China is getting into golf in a big way ahead of the sport 's reintroduction to the Olympics in 2016 , and even its take on the mini version of the game is larger than life .

`` Traditionalists will probably hate it , '' says design guru Brian Curley , principal partner in Schmidt-Curley , the company behind the 22 courses that make up the Mission Hills complex in Hainan Island .

`` But this is real golf , with real clubs on real fairways , '' he told CNN .

Just about everyone has tried their hand at crazy or mini-golf , a scale-down variant of the game which has the ability to delight and infuriate in equal measure .

Usually situated at seaside resorts or other leisure locations , the prerequisites for success are a modicum of actual golfing skill , the ability to putt in a straight line or at unlikely angles off prominent obstacles -- and a large slice of luck .

President Barack Obama , who takes every opportunity to hit the fairways when not leading the Western world , even tried his hand at crazy golf while on holiday with his family in Florida in 2010 .

Making a par on his opening hole , he then had to watch as his nine-year-old daugher Sasha made a hole in one , besting her dad in front of the gathered ranks of the world 's media .

Obama might well be tempted to put his handicap on the line at the ground-breaking new course being constructed at Curley 's Mission Hills Haikou development .

Combining the wacky elements of mini-golf with the `` grown-up '' version of the game , the proposed 18-hole layout would leave little chance of aces by nine-year-olds -- but still plenty of chances of humiliation for the average golfer .

Fantasy golf

Mindful of the impression that there is a `` sameness '' to the courses being churned out in their droves in the fastest expanding golf market in the world , Curley and his team wanted to come up with something that he felt would appeal to the wider Chinese public and other visitors to the resort .

So instead of bunkers , rough and trees , the players will be faced with a replica of the Great Wall of China winding its way the length of a 400-meter par four hole .

It also has a hole to rival the infamous `` island green '' seen at TPC Sawgrass in Florida , home of the the U.S. PGA Tour 's Players Championship .

That tricky 17th sees the best in the world attempt to hit their ball onto a tiny green surrounded by water , and spectators delight in seeing the likes of Tiger Woods find the lake .

At Mission Hills ' new course , set to open in 2014 , the water is replaced by an 80-meter wide noodle bowl with 50-meter giant chopsticks .

Standing on the tee , players will not know whether to laugh or cry , and the degree of difficulty may not end there .

Wind machine

Curley is promising the addition of `` man made '' gale force winds on each tee , adjustable depending on the standards of the players and available by hitting a red button .

There is a par-5 threading its way through Mayan ruins , while another green is created in the image of the `` Birds Nest '' Olympic Stadium in Beijing . Another hole is styled after China 's favorite animal , the panda bear .

On a conventional golf course , the degree of difficulty is often dictated by which tee the player chooses to play from . Leading professionals play from the tees furthest from the hole , while higher handicappers can opt to hit their first shot from much closer .

On the Chinese fantasy course , one of the par-3s will give golfers the choice of hitting their ball onto a tiny green surrounded by lava rocks .

In true mini-golf fashion , the other easier option at the volcano theme hole will let players hit towards a mound from which the ball will be whisked nearer the hole down a pipe .

Curley and his team needed the permission of the owners of the complex before committing to the costly project , but Mission Hills ' chairman Dr. Ken Chu is an enthusiastic backer .

`` This will be a fun alternative for families , novices and children on holiday , '' he was quoted in the Asian edition of Golf Course Industry International .

Only time will tell if Chu 's faith in the project proves founded , but the Mission Hills group has already established itself as a host venue of leading professional tournaments .

Last year the Hainan Island development staged the World Cup teams event for the first time , taking over from the Mission Hills complex at Shenzhen .

This year Shenzhen was the venue of the prestigious HSBC-World Golf Championship event , won by Englishman Ian Poulter .

The Ryder Cup hero conquered the conventional bunker-bound Olazabal course in 21 under par , but knowing Poulter 's reputation as a golfing trendsetter , he will probably be itching to test his mettle on Curley 's new wacky creation at the first opportunity .
