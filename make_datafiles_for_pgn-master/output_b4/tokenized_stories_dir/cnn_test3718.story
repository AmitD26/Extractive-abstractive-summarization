Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- July 1 , 2014 , the 17th anniversary of Hong Kong 's return to Chinese rule , is set to be a hot , possibly stormy day .

But the suffocating weather wo n't stop pro-democracy Hong Kongers -- possibly hundreds of thousands of them -- from filling the streets , beginning at 3 p.m today . Activists are openly challenging China 's vision for the city 's political future , and they believe the public is on their side .

In a recent unofficial referendum organized by pro-democracy activist group Occupy Central with Love and Peace -LRB- OCLP -RRB- , 787,767 Hong Kongers voted in support of free elections for the city 's next leader .

The almost-800,000 figure represents about 22 % of registered voters in Hong Kong , out of a total of 3.5 million registered voters , according to government figures . Before the vote began ten days ago , organizers were hoping around 100,000 people would participate .

Benny Tai , a co-organiser of OCLP , said Hong Kongers were `` using this opportunity to at least show Beijing how determined we are for universal suffrage . ''

Hong Kong 's former second-highest-ranked official , Anson Chan , echoed the sentiment in an interview with CNN on Monday .

`` Whatever Beijing says in public now I think it can hardly afford to ignore the voices of 780,000 people . ''

But the Chinese government 's reaction was decidedly more frosty , with the government declaring the poll `` illegal '' and its results `` invalid '' even before the ballots were counted .

Rimsky Yuen , Hong Kong 's Secretary for Justice , has previously said there is no legal basis for the vote .

Yuen , as well a number of other , pro-establishment voices , declined to speak to CNN .

A recent Chinese state media editorial said the poll was a `` farce . '' Searches for the referendum have also been heavily censored on the Chinese internet .

Showdown over democracy

The city 's pro-democracy camp wants fully democratic elections for the city 's next leader , while China insists it will only allow elections in which it gets to approve the nominees . Specifically , Beijing says it will only allow candidates who `` love China . ''

The Occupy Central referendum outlined three plans to reform the upcoming election . All three plans proposed that candidates be nominated publicly , regardless of whether the candidates have Beijing 's blessing .

42 % of participants picked a proposal by the Alliance for True Democracy , which said candidates for Hong Kong 's chief executive should be nominated by the public , and conditions such as requiring candidates to `` love China '' should not be allowed .

Another question asked if Hong Kong 's legislature should veto any nomination process that did not meet `` international standards . '' This was overwhelmingly approved in the referendum .

The high numbers are a sign that Hong Kongers are not about to back down , said Tai .

`` We have an offer and we have a baseline , and this is the thing we will give to the -LRB- Hong Kong government -RRB- , '' he told CNN . `` I think a responsible government must respond to that . I can not see any reason for refusing to meet with us . ''

But if negotiations fail , and no progress is made through legal means , then the group is prepared to disrupt the city to make their statement heard . As a final strategy , Tai says his group may marshal 10,000 people to sit and peacefully block traffic in downtown Hong Kong as a way to pressure Beijing into allowing Hong Kong to exercise `` genuine universal suffrage . ''

`` We will only resort to the civil disobedience action as our last resort , '' said Tai . `` Only after exhausting all the legal means and still fail to achieve our goals will we resort to civil disobedience . ''

Grassroots support

The city is politicized like at no other time in its recent past . While the July 1st anniversary of the handover has always brought demonstrators out onto Hong Kong 's hot , crowded streets , often numbering over 100,000 , this year protests are expected to be super-sized .

Many Hong Kongers are enraged after the recent publication of a white paper by the Chinese government which declares Beijing 's `` comprehensive jurisdiction '' over Hong Kong .

Chan said the white paper violates the `` one country , two systems '' principle enshrined in Hong Kong 's constitutional Basic Law , which lets the city maintain high autonomy despite being a part of China .

The white paper `` makes it quite clear that whatever autonomy we enjoy is for the central government to give and to take away at its pleasure , '' she said . `` I think this has caused real concern . ''

The inflammatory document came days after 100,000 people showed up to an annual candlelit vigil for the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown .

'' -LRB- The white paper -RRB- has spectacularly backfired , it 's made people even more angry , '' Chan said .

What 's next ?

The situation in Hong Kong is volatile . Some activists fear a crackdown on freedoms by the Chinese central government , and others look nervously to the possibility of unrest at tomorrow 's mass protest .

Michael DeGolyer , Director of the Hong Kong Transition Project , an independent organization that monitors governance in the territory , said the future is incredibly difficult to assess because no one is totally sure what China 's officials are thinking .

`` We 're in a situation where we have a new regime in power and much more volatile circumstances , and we have groups that are much more separatist , challenging the legitimacy of the central government altogether , '' he said .

`` In these circumstances , it is extremely difficult to tell what the central government intends and what they 're thinking and how they 'll react . ''

But despite the uncertainty , Hong Kong 's democracy supporters remain hopeful .

`` I do not think Beijing has made up its mind on universal suffrage , so let 's see what happens in the months ahead , '' said Chan .

`` The government stance has a little bit softened in the last few days . There 's a chance there , '' said Tai . `` After -LRB- the July 1 protest -RRB- , we may be able to see whether there 's any change in the stance of the Chinese government . ''
