Last month , at least 208 Iraqi soldiers , police officers , and -- mostly -- civilians were killed in attacks , according to figures compiled by Iraq 's Interior , Defense and Health ministries .

The uptick in violence has coincided with three weeks of demonstrations in Sunni provinces , including Anbar and Mosul , with protesters demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq 's Sunni community .

Sunnis largely boycotted Iraq 's 2005 elections , leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government . The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected , which contributed to years of bloody insurgency and sectarian warfare .

These protests were triggered last month when Iraqi security forces arrested bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafie al-Essawi , a Sunni . Al-Essawi on Monday escaped a roadside bomb attack on his convoy near Baghdad .

CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq reported from Iraq and Mark Morgenstein contributed from Atlanta .
