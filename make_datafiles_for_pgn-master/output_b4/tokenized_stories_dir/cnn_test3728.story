Gaza City , Gaza -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Each one bears his own scar .

This close-knit band of paramedics and ambulance drivers risk their lives saving others on the front lines of Gaza 's wars .

Paramedic Alaa Abu Sheir has a shrapnel wound to the arm . But that 's not the one that cuts the deepest .

When we find him , he 's washing the blood off a stretcher in his ambulance .

That 's the blood of 24-year-old Mohamed Hamdan , who was reciting the Quran when a missile from an Israeli drone struck him Monday .

Abu Sheir and his colleagues scraped together the unconscious and broken Hamdan . He tells CNN how he and his colleagues struggled to plug the holes in the man 's body with gauze to stop him from bleeding to death -- all while the ambulance races toward Gaza 's main hospital , Shifa .

It 's back at the ambulance depot that we catch up with Abu Sheir and more than a dozen of his colleagues . It 's here where the tragic cycle begins again .

It all starts with a phone call -- the emergency number in Gaza is one , zero , one . At the ambulance dispatch center located in Jerusalem Hospital in Gaza City , workers from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society monitor phones , maps and computers while they wait for the inevitable . A board illuminated with red numbers tallies 193 dead and 1,481 injured as of Tuesday afternoon .

A job that requires a lot of risk

The head of emergency services in Gaza , Dr. Bashar Mourad , directs the nearest ambulance to the latest Israeli airstrike .

The fight between the Israeli military and Gaza militants began over a week ago . It 's not the first time .

Mourad has a deep , personal understanding of the importance of a quick response . In the December 2008 to January 2009 war between Israel and Hamas , a war that was code-named `` Cast Lead , '' shrapnel injured Mourad 's then 10-year-old son . `` Time is a matter of life or death , '' says the doctor .

But he 's also acutely aware that every dispatch puts his paramedics in harm 's way .

In Cast Lead , he says he had more than 30 paramedics killed and almost all of his ambulances destroyed . In 2012 's conflict , he says , one paramedic was killed and 7 were injured . This time around , he says , he 's been lucky : only 15 paramedics have been injured .

Back at the ambulance depot , exhausted shift manager Ayman Shahwan takes incoming calls . Paramedics work 24-hours on , 24-hours off . It puts a strain on their nerves .

`` Everything is bad in the war . We do not like war , '' says Shahwan . `` We want this war to stop . '' The phone rings once again , when suddenly the building shutters and windows rattle . A large bomb just exploded nearby .

On the lookout for a second explosion

A controlled panic grips the station as ambulance after ambulance races toward the rising plume of black smoke . They stop short of the crater . Experience has taught them that there could be a second bomb . Paramedics and firefighters wait in the periphery until they get the all clear . This time nobody was injured .

They return to base , where Abu Sheir and other paramedics sit with a feast of rice , lamb , dates and juice . Night is just beginning to fall and the ambulance men are getting ready to break their fast . This is the Islamic holy month of Ramadan , during which the faithful abstain from eating or drinking between sunrise to sunset . They joke around about being tempted to break it too early ; something frowned upon .

The levity is needed to dispel the day 's morbid encounters . War affects each man a different way . But they say it 's the emotional scars that are the hardest to bear .

`` The anger boils inside us as the pressure grows , knowing our actions are a matter of life or death . '' says 39-year-old Yassin Mutier , the station chief of Tel El Hawa ambulance station . `` Unfortunately , we carry those emotions home and fight with our families . ''

39-year-old Ra'aid Shaheen talks about how the 20 to 30 trips a day can be dangerous . He recalls once when he `` had finished dropping off a victim and was driving past a police station while on our way back to our station . Rockets started raining down on the police and the shock wave tossed our car like a toy . ''

Another call haunts him , too .

`` We heard two kids selling ice cream were hit in Al Shajaya neighborhood , '' he says . `` The only thing we could do for them was to collect the pieces of their bodies . ''

False hope and a realization

Then there is 50-year-old Jihad Seleem . There 's not much this paramedic of 17 years and father of two has n't seen . But even this stoic man has trouble talking about his worst encounter .

He arrived on scene of a smoldering car hit by a bomb . `` We saw kids meticulously collecting body parts and trying to aid the injured , '' says Seleem . `` They felt it was their duty to help . ''

But late Monday it seemed like their nightmare was about to be over . The room erupts into cheering and song as the radio announces that the Egyptian government has proposed a cease-fire between Israel and Gaza militants for the following day .

Relief spreads across their faces with knowledge that they may have survived another war . By the following day , they realized that would n't be the case . The militants rejected the cease-fire call by releasing a barrage of rockets . And Israel resumed airstrikes on this coastal strip .

The fighting was about to get worse and the scars were about to cut a whole lot deeper .

Abu Sheir got an update about his wounded patient 's condition -- the young man hit in a drone strike . He did n't make it . He died at the hospital .

How did this happen ? Iraq , Syria , Gaza and Libya all in flames
