-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.N. chief made a landmark visit to Myanmar on Sunday , the latest high-profile official to descend on the nation as it undergoes economic and political reforms .

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived during the day in Yangon , disembarking from a U.N.-designated plane to greet a number of people including Myanmar Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin .

Ban is set to meet President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi , the pro-democracy leader who was subject to house arrest for years but recently won a seat in Myanmar 's parliament .

Speaking last week , Ban had said his visit comes at a `` critical moment '' for the South Asian nation , which is also known as Burma .

`` Myanmar is only at the beginning of its transition , '' Ban said then . `` Many challenges lie ahead . Many concerns have yet to be addressed . Yet I am convinced that we have an unprecedented opportunity to help the country advance toward a better future . ''

The government 's relationship with the international community is thawing after it started implementing economic reforms and opened up dialogue with the West and ethnic minority rebel groups .

Ban applauded several recent reforms , including elections and steps toward reconciliation with the rebels and opposition movements . But he said more needs to be done .

`` Now is the time for the international community to stand together at Myanmar 's side , '' he said . `` Yet we also recognize this fresh start is still fragile . ''

The trip , which follows a series of political reforms in Myanmar , marks the latest step in the country 's international rehabilitation after decades of isolation .

European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton met with Suu Kyi on Saturday .

Ashton will open a new embassy-level office for the European Union in Yangon to `` help support Myanmar/Burma on its path to full democracy . ''

Myanmar 's authoritarian military rulers are loosening their grip on power after decades of stifling dissent and limiting freedoms .

In the past 12 months , the government has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners , secured a cease-fire with Karen rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups .

Suu Kyi and 42 other candidates from her party won seats in elections on April 1 , a result welcomed by the United States and Britain as a sign of progress toward democracy after decades of repressive military rule .

After the elections , Suu Kyi and other newly elected opposition members were invited to attend a parliament session last week , but they demurred , requesting a change in the wording of the lawmakers ' oath .

The tension over the oath marks the first public sign of conflict between the opposition and the reformist government since the elections .

Other high-profile visitors to Myanmar in recent months include British Prime Minister David Cameron and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
