-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It may have taken 260 years but the home of golf is finally preparing to allow women to join its ranks .

The Royal & Ancient Club of St. Andrews , which was established in 1764 and serves as golf 's governing body outside of the U.S. and Mexico , has faced growing criticism for its all-male policy .

A ballot will be held in September , with 2,500 members expected to ratify the proposal .

The R&A says it hopes the resolution will pass with the required two-thirds majority .

`` The club 's committees are strongly in favor of the rule change and are asking members to support it , '' a spokesperson told CNN .

Speaking to CNN in July last year , R&A chief executive Peter Dawson insisted the single-sex policy of clubs such as 2013 British Open host venue Muirfield -- and others -- was a historic hangover .

He told reporters at Wednesday 's announcement of the September vote : `` It 's something that has been expected ; I 'm not going to say overdue but I 'm sure I 'll be asked that question .

`` Early indications from the members are very positive indeed . We have been talking about this for quite a while and it 's our governance role which has been the driving factor .

`` Society is changing , sport is changing , golf is changing and I think it 's appropriate for a governing body to take this step . ''

The Royal and Ancient Golf Club has traditionally been the guardian of the rules of the game since 1754 , although since 2004 it devolved responsibility for the administration of the game and the British Open to the newly-formed R&A .

Last year the R&A was criticized for choosing East Lothian 's Muirfield , which has a male-only membership policy , to host Europe 's only major -- and Scotland 's First Minister Alex Salmond refused to attend the tournament .

The move by the R&A brings it in line with Augusta National , which allowed female members to join the prestigious U.S. club for the first time in 80 years in 2012 .

Augusta , which hosts the Masters , faced years of protests with President Obama also adding pressure on the organization .

Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore became the first women to be admitted as members .
