Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sen. John McCain called Monday for the United States to lead a military coalition to help the Syrian opposition rid the country of President Bashar al-Assad .

`` The Syrian opposition needs to know that the United States stands with them and that we are willing to take risks to support them when they need it the most , '' the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank in Washington . `` Inaction denies us the opportunity to have influence with forces in Syria who will one day inherit the country , ceding that to foreign states that may not always share our values . ''

McCain took aim at what he said is the Obama administration 's toothless policy of calling for al-Assad to step aside .

`` To say they are leading from behind is too general , '' he said . `` That suggests they are leading . They are just behind . ''

The Obama administration and much of the rest of the world have put their hopes of ending the 15 months of bloodshed on a peace plan put forth by U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy Kofi Annan . But that has failed to achieve results .

The Republican senator from Arizona accused the administration , `` in its desperation , '' of now appearing to be placing its hopes on persuading the Russian government to push al-Assad from power . President Obama was meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday at the G-20 meeting in Los Cabos , Mexico .

`` Russia is unlikely to ever support a policy of regime change in Syria , '' he said .

The opposition , without help from the United States , has recently improved its military abilities and appears to be well enough organized to make use of outside support , he said .

Though some foreign military assistance appears to be reaching the opposition , it is not enough to be decisive , and may just prolong the crisis , which could prove detrimental , McCain said . `` Nearly every Syrian I speak with tells me the same thing : the longer this conflict drags on , the more radicalized it becomes and the more it turns into an escalating civil war . ''

Failure to act could result in Syria becoming a failed state , riven by extremist violence and sectarian conflict , he said .

McCain said any military aid should not include U.S. ground forces , but should include military might from allies of the United States , such as European and Arab countries .

Already , some analysts say that opposition forces may be creating some areas of de facto control , along the border with Turkey and in eastern Syria , McCain said . One option would be for the opposition to declare those areas liberated , then call for external support in defending them , he said .

`` Once defended , these safe havens could become platforms , staging areas for armed opposition groups , '' he said .

McCain rejected characterizations of the current state of affairs inside Syria as a civil war . `` It 's not a civil war because all the military strength is on one side , and not the other , '' he said . `` At least we ought to give them a chance to have a fair fight . ''
