London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The reason for model Peaches Geldof 's death is still not clear , with an autopsy turning up inconclusive results , UK police said Wednesday .

Authorities are still waiting for toxicology reports , which could take several weeks , police said .

Geldof , the 25-year-old daughter of Irish musician and Live Aid organizer Bob Geldof and TV presenter Paula Yates , was found dead Monday at her home in Wrotham , Kent , southeast of London .

Her sudden death prompted shock in the entertainment world and an outpouring of tributes from family , friends and fellow celebrities .

According to Kent Police , it is being treated `` as a non-suspicious , unexplained sudden death . '' Officers are continuing to investigate the circumstances , the force said .

Geldof , who was married with two sons under the age of two , was only 11 years old when her own mother died of a drug overdose .

In a poignant column for Mother and Baby magazine , published with the blessing of her family a day after her death , Geldof had written of the huge change her `` two fat little cherubs '' had brought to her life .

She had `` lived a life of wanton wanderlust '' as she partied from Los Angeles to London , `` lost in a haze of youth and no responsibilities , '' she wrote .

`` But it was becoming boring . I wanted an anchor -- I craved it . And , when I had two wailing , smiling , joyful little blobs of waddling pink flesh , they became my entire existence , and saved me from one of pure apathy . ''

The transition could be tough , she said , but it was worth it . `` I had the perfect life -- two beautiful babies who loved me more than anything . It was , and is , bliss . ''

Her widower , rock musician Tom Cohen , said Monday he would bring up their sons , Astala and Phaedra , `` with their mother in their hearts every day . ''

In a statement , Bob Geldof said his family was `` beyond pain '' and would cherish Peaches ' memory forever .

A host of celebrities also paid tribute . TV mogul Simon Cowell tweeted his condolences : `` The few times I met Peaches she was a sweet , funny warm person . Much love to her family she has left behind . ''

CNN presenter Myleene Klass said : `` The news of beautiful Peaches is utterly devastating , God bless her babies . RIP mama xxx . ''

Geldof was the second daughter of Yates , who rose to fame in the 1980s as presenter of music show `` The Tube . '' She died from a heroin overdose in 2000 , aged 41 .

Yates had divorced Boomtown Rats singer Bob Geldof in 1996 after starting a relationship with INXS frontman Michael Hutchence .
