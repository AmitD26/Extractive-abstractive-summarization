-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A tea party leader tied to alleged political dirty tricks that rattled Republicans in Mississippi and beyond is dead -- shot once in the head in an apparent suicide , according to police .

Police officers in Ridgeland , Mississippi , found Mark Mayfield 's body shortly after 9 a.m. Friday on the floor of a storage room in his garage .

`` Because all of the indications , it appears to be suicide , but we still got some things to look into , '' Ridgeland police Chief Jimmy Houston told CNN . `` He left a suicide note , and we are verifying its validity . ''

Authorities have n't disclosed the contents of that note or why Mayfield might have taken his life .

Yet the lawyer and Mississippi Tea Party leader has been under fire for the past month , having been charged with three others -- according to The Clarion-Ledger newspaper -- in connection to a blogger accused of taking a picture of Sen. Thad Cochran 's wife in her nursing home bed . This came a week after the blogger , Clayton Kelly , was himself charged .

All were apparent allies of conservative state Sen. Chris McDaniel , who was then engaged in an ugly primary battle to see who would be the GOP Senate candidate from Mississippi .

The photo of Cochran 's wife -- who suffers from dementia and has lived in a nursing home for 14 years -- surfaced in a political attack ad on YouTube that aimed to smear Cochran , The Clarion-Ledger reported . It 's unclear how the photo was used because the ad was removed within hours of being posted , according to the newspaper .

This episode and others further inflamed the rhetoric in the primary fight . Cochran 's spokesman Jordan Russell , for example , said last month that Mayfield and the others ' arrests `` raises even more questions the McDaniel campaign needs to answer . ''

But on Friday , Cochran -- who narrowly edged McDaniel in Tuesday 's primary -- and his team showed only sympathy upon hearing about Mayfield 's death .

`` This is very much a tragic and sad situation , '' said Austin Barbour , a senior adviser to Cochran 's campaign . `` Mark was a really good guy . On behalf of Sen. Cochran and all of us for the campaign , our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and his friends . ''

Report : Mayfield faced conspiracy charges

Mark Mayfield leaves behind his wife and two children .

He also leaves a legacy in Mississippi in other ways , as a lawyer and a political leader . The Mississippi Tea Party remembered him as one of its founding members `` and one of our biggest cheerleaders . ''

`` He had a patriot 's soul , and a smile that was as big as day , '' the group said on its website .

Outside Mississippi , Mayfield became part of a bigger national story one week after authorities arrested political blogger Clayton Kelly for allegedly exploiting a vulnerable adult and illegally and improperly obtaining a photo of her without her consent for his own benefit , according to the Madison , Mississippi , Police Department .

Mayfield was later arrested along with Richard Sager , an elementary school P.E. teacher and high school coach , according to The Clarion-Ledger newspaper . Police also charged a third individual , John Beachman Mary , but did not take him into custody because of `` extensive medical conditions . ''

All three face conspiracy charges , the newspaper reported .

Mayfield 's death came two days after the runoff to decide his state 's GOP Senate nominee -- an election necessitated since neither Cochran nor McDaniel cracked 50 % in the June 3 primary .

Cochran won the latest contest by fewer than 7,000 votes , aided by African-American Democrats who were actively courted during the runoff campaign by pro-Cochran forces .

According to Mississippi law , voters are not required to register with a political party , and anyone who does n't vote in a primary election can cast a ballot in either party 's runoff .

McDaniel repeated his vow to use every legal maneuver available to fight the runoff results .

Lawyer , friend : ` My heart is completely broken '

Still , while that political fight continues , the focus Thursday was on Mayfield and his family .

His wife Robin was the only other person at the family 's Ridgeland residence at the time , and also the one who alerted authorities .

The 57-year-old Mayfield was found dead of a lone gunshot wound , alongside a large caliber revolver .

Mayfield 's attorney , Merrida Coxwell , said in a statement e-mailed to CNN that he was a client `` but more importantly , he was a friend for almost 34 years .

`` My heart is completely broken . This is beyond tragic and the people of this community and state have lost a good man and citizen . ''

In a phone call with CNN , Coxwell added , `` It 's not important to me how it happened . It happened today . Mark 's wife called and texted me that Mark was deceased . ''

And McDaniel posted a statement on his Facebook page saying that , `` regardless of recent allegations made against his character , Mark Mayfield was a fine Christian man who was always respectful and kind . ''

`` He was one of the most polite and humble men I 've ever met in politics , '' the state senator added . `` He was a loving husband , father , a pillar of his community , and he will be missed . ''
