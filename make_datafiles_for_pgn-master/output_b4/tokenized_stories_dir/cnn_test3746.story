Nanjing , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Off-camera , I 'm getting parenting advice from China 's first athlete to win gold in any sport at the Winter Olympics .

`` Your daughter should go for ice skating , '' Yang Yang advises me . `` It 's great for her balance ! ''

My five-year old is more swimmer than skater but I appreciate Yang 's words and especially her intention . She 's encouraging me to share the life-changing benefits of sport , not to necessarily groom a future Olympian .

Yang herself is a product of a vigorous state system that created elite national athletes . She brought home that long-awaited gold medal in short-track speed skating from the Salt Lake City Olympiad in 2002 .

To realize her dream , Yang tells me she skated for 23 years , six days a week , for almost 12 hours a day .

`` Once you become an athlete , you want to win . That 's the most important thing , '' she says .

Kids driven away

While Yang says there is nothing wrong with winning , Tom Byer , who works as a coach and educator in a grassroots football program , says that winning has become so overly emphasized that it discourages children from sport .

`` Winning of course is a natural response for every athlete , '' Byer says . `` But it can also get in the way . And this is what 's happening in grassroots sports all over China , is that the winning has become so important , it drives kids out of the sport . ''

China may have taken gold in plenty of Olympic events , from speed skating to gymnastics , but it struggles to simply qualify for the World Cup or generate mainstream interest in its bid to host the 2022 Winter Games .

Byer blames a fixation on training elite champions in select sports and an education system that considers sports a luxury and not a priority .

`` In the West , we look more at physical education as part of education , whereas here , for many years , the educators have tried to keep sport out of education , '' he tells me .

Presidential backing

But Olympic chief Thomas Bach assures me that will change .

`` I had the opportunity to meet President Xi Jinping twice , '' says the International Olympic Committee President . `` You see clearly the government has realized that sport must be part of education and that sport helps in education . ''

Byer is doing his part as the Head Technical Adviser to the Chinese School Football program , a project that works with two million children in more than 6,200 schools across China . His success at teaching football skills to students in Japan earned him stardom there , and an invitation to bring his technical magic to China .

But while charismatic coaches fan out across China 's schools -- and Xi proclaims his love for football -- it could take years to change the nation 's attitude toward sport ... and for China to build an industry around it .

Shanghai-based Sheng Li is one of China 's top sports agents . He laments how professional sports in China lack the infrastructure to make more money for his clients , like professional boxer and Olympic gold medalist Zou Shiming .

`` If you come through the national system , you have the coach and the training system , '' Li says . `` But there 's a whole system behind a -LRB- professional -RRB- athlete : the PR , the brand , the corporate sponsorship , helping them find the best coaches outside the system .

`` That 's a whole new system we 're starting to build . ''

Olympic bid

Yang is supporting China 's athletes after their Olympic dream with the Athlete Career Program she started as part of her foundation .

She 's also getting more children interested in sport with a new skating school in Shanghai that is open to everyone .

On top of that , she 's leading the charge for China 's bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games . China , along with Kazakhstan and Norway , is a finalist to host the event .

Winning the bid and hosting the games would transform the sport scene in China , sparking greater interest in winter sports like snowboarding , skiing and skating .

More than a decade ago , Yang was in it to win it . Today , she 's using her Olympic legacy to bring a love of her sport to the masses .

At the other end of the scale , sport is not considered a part of your education in China
