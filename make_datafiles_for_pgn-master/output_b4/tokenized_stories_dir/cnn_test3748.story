-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Historically , surveillance was difficult and expensive .

Over the decades , as technology advanced , surveillance became easier and easier . Today , we find ourselves in a world of ubiquitous surveillance , where everything is collected , saved , searched , correlated and analyzed .

But while technology allowed for an increase in both corporate and government surveillance , the private and public sectors took very different paths to get there . The former always collected information about everyone , but over time , collected more and more of it , while the latter always collected maximal information , but over time , collected it on more and more people .

Corporate surveillance has been on a path from minimal to maximal information . Corporations always collected information on everyone they could , but in the past they did n't collect very much of it and only held it as long as necessary . When surveillance information was expensive to collect and store , companies made do with as little as possible .

Telephone companies collected long-distance calling information because they needed it for billing purposes . Credit cards collected only the information about their customers ' transactions that they needed for billing . Stores hardly ever collected information about their customers , maybe some personal preferences , or name-and-address for advertising purposes . Even Google , back in the beginning , collected far less information about its users than it does today .

As technology improved , corporations were able to collect more . As the cost of data storage became cheaper , they were able to save more data and for a longer time . And as big data analysis tools became more powerful , it became profitable to save more . Today , almost everything is being saved by someone -- probably forever .

Examples are everywhere . Internet companies like Google , Facebook , Amazon and Apple collect everything we do online at their sites . Third-party cookies allow those companies , and others , to collect data on us wherever we are on the Internet . Store affinity cards allow merchants to track our purchases . CCTV and aerial surveillance combined with automatic face recognition allow companies to track our movements ; so does your cell phone . The Internet will facilitate even more surveillance , by more corporations for more purposes .

On the government side , surveillance has been on a path from individually targeted to broadly collected . When surveillance was manual and expensive , it could only be justified in extreme cases . The warrant process limited police surveillance , and resource restraints and the risk of discovery limited national intelligence surveillance . Specific individuals were targeted for surveillance , and maximal information was collected on them alone .

As technology improved , the government was able to implement ever-broadening surveillance . The National Security Agency could surveil groups -- the Soviet government , the Chinese diplomatic corps , etc. -- not just individuals . Eventually , they could spy on entire communications trunks .

Now , instead of watching one person , the NSA can monitor `` three hops '' away from that person -- an ever widening network of people not directly connected to the person under surveillance . Using sophisticated tools , the NSA can surveil broad swaths of the Internet and phone network .

Governments have always used their authority to piggyback on corporate surveillance . Why should they go through the trouble of developing their own surveillance programs when they could just ask corporations for the data ? For example we just learned that the NSA collects e-mail , IM and social networking contact lists for millions of Internet users worldwide .

But as corporations started collecting more information on populations , governments started demanding that data . Through National Security Letters , the FBI can surveil huge groups of people without obtaining a warrant . Through secret agreements , the NSA can monitor the entire Internet and telephone networks .

This is a huge part of the public-private surveillance partnership .

The result of all this is we 're now living in a world where both corporations and governments have us all under pretty much constant surveillance .

Data is a byproduct of the information society . Every interaction we have with a computer creates a transaction record , and we interact with computers hundreds of times a day . Even if we do n't use a computer -- buying something in person with cash , say -- the merchant uses a computer , and the data flows into the same system . Everything we do leaves a data shadow , and that shadow is constantly under surveillance .

Data is also a byproduct of information society socialization , whether it be e-mail , instant messages or conversations on Facebook . Conversations that used to be ephemeral are now recorded , and we are all leaving digital footprints wherever we go .

Moore 's law has made computing cheaper . All of us have made computing ubiquitous . And because computing produces data , and that data equals surveillance , we have created a world of ubiquitous surveillance .

Now we need to figure out what to do about it . This is more than reining in the NSA or fining a corporation for the occasional data abuse . We need to decide whether our data is a shared societal resource , a part of us that is inherently ours by right , or a private good to be bought and sold .

Writing in The Guardian , Chris Huhn said that `` information is power , and the necessary corollary is that privacy is freedom . '' How this interplay between power and freedom play out in the information age is still to be determined .

Schneier : Government and corporate surveillance used to be very different

He says today NSA can piggyback on corporate surveillance ; they 're like partners

Schneier : We need to decide whether data is a societal resource or a commodity
