-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Severe thunderstorms ripped through central Oklahoma Monday triggering vicious flash floods that left 136 people injured , roads and cars submerged , and thousands without power , authorities said .

None of those injured required hospitalization , according to Michelann Ooten , information officer for the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management .

Meanwhile , thunderstorms continued to roll across the southwestern and south-central part of the state Monday evening , sparing Oklahoma City more rain that would have likely worsened the flooding there .

A state of emergency has been declared in 59 of Oklahoma 's 77 counties , at the request of Gov. Brad Henry , who is out of town . Lt. Gov. Jari Askins , who approved the emergency paperwork , commended the state 's emergency crews , saying , `` Once again , our heroic responders have demonstrated the Oklahoma Standard . ''

The National Weather Service said that almost 10 inches of rain fell between 2 a.m. and 11 a.m. Monday . A flash-flood watch was extended across central Oklahoma through 7 a.m. CT -LRB- 8 a.m. ET -RRB- Tuesday .

CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said the damage Monday morning was caused by `` backbuilding thunderstorms , '' a series of heavy rain cores without intermittent periods of let-up .

The American Red Cross opened a center for any victims displaced by the storm at an elementary school in nearby Edmond , according the Ooten .

According to Oklahoma Gas & Electric 's website , close to 1,500 customers were still without power by 8 p.m. Monday , including 1,300 in the Oklahoma City metro area .

It 's a `` bad situation throughout the entire county , '' said Oklahoma County Sheriff 's Office spokesman Mark Myers .

Some washed-out Oklahoma City metro highways and ramps remained closed Monday night , including parts of Interstate 40 , according to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation . Department officials urged drivers to be alert and warned them to avoid driving through water-covered roads .

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported getting about 180 calls related to the flash flooding . Troopers worked nearly 30 crashes , with a total of six injuries .

According to Ooten , several state buildings in the metro area were damaged in the deluge . Those affected agencies either closed or reduced their services because of the flooding .

Standing flood waters also can be dangerous , the Oklahoma State Department of Health warned . They urged residents to avoid the water as it can contain snakes , insects , sharp objects , oil , gasoline , and in some case raw sewage .

Glynda Chu , a police spokeswoman in nearby Edmond , said it was the worst flooding that city has seen in 25 years .

CNN iReporter Jennifer Oliver , who lives in Edmond , says there 's normally a little creek with a 20-foot waterfall behind her house , but by late morning , she could n't even make it out . `` Never seen anything quite like that , '' Oliver said .

KOCO broadcast pictures of a car submerged almost to its windows . Dive teams navigated the raging waters to get to the scene and then rescued the car 's occupants by boat . CNN affiliate KFOR showed another water rescue , with crews ferrying people to safety .

It 's a dangerous situation for rescue crews as well . CNN affiliate KWTV showed gripping video of a woman trapped in a tree , struggling through the rushing water in search of stronger branches to hold . Oklahoma City Fire Battalion Chief Kirk Wright said the first rescue boat sent her way got stuck , stranding the three would-be rescuers . Another team set off for the scene and returned safely with all four people .

Oklahoma City Fire Department Deputy Chief Marc Woodard estimated that there were 20 to 30 rescues of people stranded in cars , homes or businesses Monday morning .

CNN iReporter Sarah Burris , who lives on the northwest side of Oklahoma City , said leaving her neighborhood was n't even an option , with every way out under water . Burris said backlogged drains were regurgitating water into the streets .

The National Weather Service was issuing flood warnings across the breadbasket region Monday . Most of Nebraska and southeastern Kansas were under advisories Monday afternoon .

The Weather Service said 3 inches of rain had fallen in both Tulsa , Oklahoma , and Kansas City , Missouri , which experienced flash floods Monday morning . But Morris said the Kansas City overflow had affected only low-lying areas and did n't look like a threat to homes or businesses .
