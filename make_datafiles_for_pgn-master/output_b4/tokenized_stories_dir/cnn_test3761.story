Sanford , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of a teenager shot to death last month by a neighborhood watch volunteer -- a case that has sparked national debate and concerns about racial profiling -- will address a Sanford , Florida , city meeting on Monday , officials said .

Trayvon Martin , 17 , was killed February 26 as he walked back to his father 's fiancee 's house in Sanford after a trip to a convenience store . Police say he was unarmed , carrying a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea ; he was shot by George Zimmerman , who claims he was acting in self defense , according to authorities .

The city of Sanford appealed Sunday for `` civility and calm '' during the `` City Commission/Town Hall Meeting for Trayvon Martin . ''

Worshippers in cities nationwide wore hoodies to church services Sunday to honor Martin , who was wearing a hoodie when he was killed . Zimmerman has not been charged in the case .

Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta and Middle Collegiate Church in New York were among the churches honoring the teen .

`` All of us have a stake in this , not just black people , '' said the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock , of Ebenezer , according to CNN affiliate WXIA . `` We are Americans , and we expect the system to work . ''

Warnock preached Sunday wearing in a maroon Morehouse College hoodie , the network reported .

In Sanford , a `` prayer for peace '' and a candlelight vigil will take place Sunday evening . Another candlelight vigil will take place at the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery , Alabama .

`` The public has had enough of the police and prosecutors operating in secrecy when it comes to people of color , especially African-Americans , '' said J. Willie David III , president of the Florida Civil Rights Association , the group planning the Sanford vigil .

The case has sparked a national debate over the Florida law and concerns about racial profiling . Martin was black and Zimmerman is white Hispanic .

The attorney for Martin 's family , meanwhile , said bringing a federal hate crime charge against Zimmerman will be `` a challenge , to put it lightly . ''

Family of Martin to pursue civil case

Daryl Parks told board members of the National Association of Black Journalists -LRB- NABJ -RRB- on Saturday that prosecution on the state level stands a better chance .

`` Most state laws tend to be better for the prosecution of state crimes . And that 's why we see the federal authorities expressing , although gently , in their statements that they can only do so much if there 's some type of race statements involved . The state officials do n't have that problem , '' Parks said .

`` I think the focus is not necessarily a federal arrest over a state arrest . We want an arrest , period . And I think that the state aspect of that is the one that 's most feasible , most attainable in this matter . ''

Parks said there is evidence that the Twin Lakes homeowners ' association told residents who saw suspicious activity to call Zimmerman if they could not contact the police , according to an NABJ statement .

The Martin family plans to pursue a civil case against the homeowners ' association , Parks said .

Demonstrations have taken place nationwide over Martin 's death .

`` We as a nation have become much too violent , '' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Sunday . '' ... If it 's black on white , it 's jail time . If it 's white on black , it 's revolt time . If it 's black on black , or white on white , or brown on brown , it 's Miller time . ''

In response to an Orlando Sentinel report that Zimmerman worked at the Maitland , Florida , office of Digital Risk , a spokeswoman for the the risk mitigation and surveillance company said Sunday she could not comment on Zimmerman 's current or future employment status , but `` we can confirm he is not at the building , nor has he been since the incident . ''

`` Our utmost concern is for the safety of our employees , specifically based on the potential turmoil that could arise from the recent announcement of a bounty for his capture , '' spokeswoman Brandie Young said in a statement .

Zimmerman 's attorney said Sunday that after reviewing Florida 's `` stand your ground '' law , he believes it applies to the situation and that his client is innocent .

Initially , lawyer Craig Sonner said last week the law was `` not really applicable to this case . The statute on ` stand your ground ' is primarily when you 're in your house . ''

`` This is self-defense , and that 's been around for forever -- that you have a right to defend yourself , '' Sonner said earlier . `` So the next issue -LRB- that -RRB- is going to come up is , was he justified in using the amount of force he did ? ''

The 2005 law allows people to use deadly force anywhere they have a right to be if they have reasonable fear an assailant could seriously harm them or someone else .

It also eliminated a long-standing `` duty to retreat '' in the face of imminent harm , asserting that would-be crime victims have the right to `` stand their ground '' and `` meet force with force '' when attacked .

Noting that 23 states have some version of the `` stand your ground '' law on their books , Sen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , called Sunday for the Justice Department to investigate `` whether these laws are creating more violence than they are preventing '' and whether some deaths go unprosecuted `` because the laws place unintended additional burdens on local police and prosecutors that encourage dismissals of otherwise problematic cases . ''

`` These laws seem to be encouraging vigilantism by allowing individuals to use deadly force as a first resort , '' Schumer wrote in a Sunday letter to Attorney General Eric Holder .

The Sanford Police Department said officers were prohibited from arresting Zimmerman the night of the shooting because physical evidence and testimony supported his claim that he acted in self-defense in accordance with Florida law . The police department gave the explanation to City Manager Norton Bonaparte , who included it in a letter to the community about the case , posted on the city 's website .

Zimmerman said he was driving in his gated community when he saw Martin walking and called 911 to report a suspicious person .

Zimmerman told the dispatcher he was following the boy , but the dispatcher told him that was n't necessary . Moments later , several neighbors called 911 to report a commotion outside , and police arrived to find Martin dead of a gunshot wound .

Sonner says his client was injured that night and went to the hospital with a broken nose and a serious cut on the back of his head .

Sanford police said Zimmerman did not indicate a chase , telling them instead that `` he had lost sight of Trayvon and was returning to his truck to meet the police officer when he says he was attacked by Trayvon , '' the police said in the letter posted by Bonaparte .

Florida Gov. Rick Scott has formed a task force to review the law in the wake of the shooting . Scott told CNN 's `` State of the Union '' on Sunday that he met with Martin 's parents Thursday to `` let them know that I appointed a new state attorney and introduced them to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents that are working on the case . ''

`` Your heart goes out to them because ... no family ever imagines this could happen to their child , '' the governor said .
