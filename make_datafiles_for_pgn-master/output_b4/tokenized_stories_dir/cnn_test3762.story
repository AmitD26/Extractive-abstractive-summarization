-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- These are n't your typical Southern escapes .

An African safari-style tent in the middle of Texas Hill Country . Skeet shooting from a former Coast Guard station 34 miles offshore . Remote treehouses in the middle of a blackwater river .

Heck , they 're not your average vacations anywhere in the world .

Here are five unusual summer getaway ideas for travelers headed to the U.S. South , also featured in the summer issue of Garden & Gun magazine hitting newsstands May 16 .

The Southern lifestyle magazine does n't feature that many gardens or guns , although there 's usually some kind of sport and garden in every issue . Borrowed from a 1970s Charleston disco called the Garden & Gun Club , the title is more a metaphor for the Southern lifestyle , heritage and land .

`` People who remember it -LRB- the club -RRB- still speak of it with a dreamy look in their eyes , '' says editor in chief David DiBenedetto . Just like you might after one of these unusual trips :

Frying Pan Shoals Light Station , Southport , North Carolina

Once a light station that marked the shoals off the coast of Southport , North Carolina , for ships , the two-story Frying Pan Shoals Light Station now houses a bed-and-breakfast perched on a platform 32 miles off the coast of Cape Fear . The main level is 85 feet high , the helipad is at 95 feet and the top of the lighthouse is 130 feet high .

Built in 1964 for the U.S. Coast Guard and auctioned to new owner Richard Neal for $ 85,000 in 2010 , the light station was typical of those stations built in the mid-1900s to replace light ships . The use of GPS in shipping made the stations obsolete .

Gatsby glam : 8 grand estates

Now the 5,000-square-foot space can host up to 14 guests in eight bedrooms . It 's equipped with Wi-Fi , hot water , a driving range -LRB- with ocean-friendly biodegradable golf balls -RRB- , a skeet range , spectacular fishing and incredible views .

It 's a labor of love for Neal , who is still restoring the platform and raising funds to do more . That means some parts will be off-limits , and you 'll sign a waiver before setting foot on the platform . Book your own transportation via helicopter , chartered boat or take your own boat to the station or pay for an all-inclusive package that includes transportation via boat .

`` You 're living and sleeping on top of a wild coral reef , '' says DiBenedetto . `` Dolphin , tuna and whales come by . There is water as far as you can see . It 's pretty wild and different . ''

6 hot resorts for adults only

Edisto River Treehouses , Canadys , South Carolina

For an experience truly detached from the modern world , consider a stay at the Edisto River Tree Houses . Built on an island in the middle of a private wildlife refuge along a free-flowing blackwater river , the treehouses are a 13-mile paddle downriver .

The color of a blackwater river is because of the tannic acid in the water , which is leached from the leaves of fallen trees along the river 's edge . South Carolina 's blackwater rivers start at springs in the Sandhills area of the state and meander until they empty into the Atlantic Ocean .

`` It 's like paddling back in time , and the river is slow moving , so it 's an easy paddle , '' DiBenedetto says . Keep your eye out for alligators . Some canoeing experience is helpful to navigate fallen trees , which are often but not always cleared by volunteers taking care of the river .

This is a truly rustic stay : You have to bring your own sleeping bag , towels , food and water in the canoe . While the treehouses have cooking equipment and sleeping lofts , there 's no electricity . Guests can cook on an outside grill and can use candles and torches at night .

Serenbe , Chattahoochee Hills , Georgia

A 1,000-acre community in Georgia 's Chattahoochee Hill Country , Serenbe is dedicated to sustainable principles .

The land , southwest of Atlanta , is protected from urban sprawl and its 170 residents embrace walkability , preservation and community living . Serenbe offers visitors access to a working farm , wonderful restaurants , a farmers and artists market and for overnight visitors , The Inn at Serenbe . Enjoy hikes , hayrides and horseback rides there .

`` You can enjoy all the benefits of being a farmer without having to do the backbreaking labor , '' says DiBenedetto . `` It 's a great escape , especially for the family . ''

Sinya on Lone Man Creek , near Wimberley , Texas

If you want to go on an African safari but ca n't make the trip all the way to Africa , the safari-style tent at Sinya on Lone Man Creek may be for you and your beloved .

Located on a ridge overlooking Lone Man Creek in the Hill Country of Texas , Sinya is the spot for luxurious relaxation after a day of bird watching , hiking or fishing . Treasure hunters can poke around at the artists ' booths at the nearby First Saturday Market or make the 40-minute drive to the big city lights of Austin . Dine out at restaurants in the nearby town of Wimberley or pick up provisions at the local market to cook your own dinner at Sinya .

Whatever your day , you can sit back on your veranda as the sun sets and enjoy a glass of local wine . You two will be all alone -LRB- no other tents or guests to distract you -RRB- to fall asleep in the king-size bed with goose down pillows and comforter . Wake up to the sounds of nature just outside your tent .

The Moorings Village & Spa , Islamorada , Florida

Set aside thoughts of a stereotypical Florida Keys vacation , crowded and overly touristy .

A coconut plantation in its former life , The Moorings Village & Spa is for guests who want an Old Florida experience in the Keys . The resort has 18 cottages , a private beach open only to guests , dockage , a heated lap pool , spa services and yoga classes , kayaks and bicycles . You can also book a fishing , diving and snorkeling trip .

`` You 're at a first-rate resort with first-rate amenities , and the architecture of the cottages is beautiful , '' says DiBenedetto .
