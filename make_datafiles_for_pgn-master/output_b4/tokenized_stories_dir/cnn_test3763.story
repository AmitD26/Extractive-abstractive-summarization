-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Martin Kaymer built upon his record equaling opening round of 63 at Sawgrass Friday to head the Players Championship at the halfway stage .

The German carded a three-under-par second round of 69 to take his overall tournament score to 12-under-par .

Kaymer , an early starter on Friday , leads the way from Jordan Spieth in second place at 11-under-par and Russell Henley three shots further back at 8-under par .

Jim Furyk , Lee Westwood , Gary Woodland , Justin Rose and Sergio Garcia are all tied for fourth place at six-under-par .

`` It was very difficult today , a little bit tougher -LRB- than yesterday -RRB- , '' Kaymer told Sky Sports after reaching the clubhouse . `` When you shoot such a low round your expectations are very . ''

Kaymer , a former world No. 1 , has not won a tournament since November 2011 and struggled throughout 2013 .

Yet he become only the fourth player in TPC history to shoot a 63 -- the others being Greg Norman , Fred Couples and Roberto Castro .

The 29-year-old never come close to replicating this thrilling form on Friday but remained content with a steady showing that featured five birdies and two bogeys .

`` 69 was a very good score but it was a little bit more tough -LRB- today -RRB- . The pins were in some corners and it was a little bit more windy so I 'm pleased . ''

Kaymer started the day two shots ahead of Henley but will be looking over his shoulder from the start on Saturday after a barnstorming second round from Spieth .

The 20-year-old Texan has yet to card a bogey in 36 holes at the famous Sawgrass course and produced a near majestic display again Friday , holing six birdies to secure a second round score of 66 .

Any of the group at six-under-par , meanwhile , will fancy their chances if they can put an run of form together over the weekend .

Elsewhere on the course , former U.S. Masters PGA Championship winner Rory McIlroy just made the cut after a birdie on the last secured a round of 74 .

The Northern Irishman had been five-under-par after just 11 holes on the opening day before fading badly .

One man not so lucky at the 18th , however , was Phil Mickelson . The five-time major champion missed a birdie putt that would have seen him make the cut but will now be forced to take the early flight home instead .
