Pinar del Rio , Cuba -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On Yosvany Concepcion 's ramshackle farm , there is little to suggest that he is producing a highly sought-after luxury item .

The buildings on the farm look like a strong wind could carry them away . There is virtually no machinery .

But Concepcion grows the tobacco leaves that are transformed into Cuban cigars . And much of the allure of these legendary , expensive cigars is that they are still made entirely by hand and in places , like Concepcion 's farm , that seem trapped in time .

`` As you can see , we do things the traditional way , '' Concepcion said , gesturing to the barn where green tobacco leaves are hung to dry before being rolled into cigars .

He and the rest of Cuba 's tobacco farmers might soon have their work cut out for them .

Executives from Habanos , the Cuban-British joint venture that distributes Cuban cigars , announced at their annual festival last week that sales were up over 9 % in 2011 . That growth , executives said , could indicate that the market for luxury goods is rebounding despite a still-shaky world economy .

The festival was also bursting at the seams , with 1,500 attendees from 60 countries paying top dollar to taste Cuba 's best smokes .

`` Things are going well , '' said Rodrigo Malmierca DÃƒaz , Cuba 's trade and foreign finance minister , as he toured the festival in Havana . `` The cigar has been appreciated since Columbus landed here . And it will continue to be , because they are very good . ''

As good as they might be , Cuban cigars are illegal in the United States because of the U.S. trade embargo with Cuba .

`` The embargo is something that affects everyone , '' said Jorge Luis Fernandez Maique , co-president of Habanos . `` It affects us as a country , as a business , and it affects the American consumer . They ca n't buy directly from Cuba , so they have no way of knowing if they are buying genuine Cuban cigars . ''

Many of the Cuban cigars that are available on the black market in the U.S. are probably fakes , cigar experts say . Cuba is also awash in knockoffs . Tourists on the island receive near-constant offers from peddlers selling imitations at prices far below what the government stores sells genuine cigars for .

`` Smoke a fake cigar , and you will not find the right blend , '' said Ana Lopez , Habanos ' director of marketing . `` You are going to find something totally different , and probably -LRB- you -RRB- will be disappointed . ''

Cigar makers responded last week by unveiling security measures , such as holograms and serial numbers , on the labels of some premium brands .

`` We have included a number of security elements into the band which makes them unique and impossible to copy , '' said Henk Nota , president of Vrijdag Premium Printing .

Cigar distributor Angela Giannoulis has traveled from Canada more than 10 times to attend the Habanos festival . She said she is brought back by her love of cigars and desire to stay up to date on the industry .

`` You get to try stuff before anyone else , so that 's a nice perk , '' she said . `` And it 's people united by the same passion . You can smoke anywhere , you can get them fresh out of a roller 's hands . It really is an art to be appreciated . ''
