-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Werewolves are usually the stuff of B-movies and bad novels , but last year British author Glen Duncan did the unthinkable in literary circles , crafting a howling good tale out of the weary werewolf myth . The result was the best-selling thriller `` The Last Werewolf . '' Critics and readers happily devoured the darkly comic novel .

In the book , Jake Marlowe , a 200-year-old lonely lycanthrope , believes himself to be the last of his kind until he meets Talulla Demetriou . It 's your classic tale of boy meets girl , except this pair turn into werewolves , battle vampires and fall in love . While their relationship came to a tragic and bloody end , Demetriou returns in Duncan 's eagerly awaited sequel , `` Talulla Rising . ''

Hitting bookshelves this week , the supernatural story picks up soon after where `` The Last Werewolf '' left off . Talulla is grieving the loss of her werewolf lover ; she 's on the run and about to give birth to Jake 's child , under a full moon no less . To give away any more would spoil the surprise for fans , but suffice to say Talulla turns into a monstrously protective mother .

Adventurous readers who are looking for a break from the usual beach read should consider this alternately horrifying and humorous , imaginative and energetic novel . CNN recently spoke to Duncan by telephone from his London home about the new book . The following is an edited transcript :

CNN : What was the spark that led you to write `` The Last Werewolf '' and `` Talulla Rising '' ?

Duncan : A combination of mercenary pragmatism and drunken inspiration . After seven novels which , though well-received , had n't made paying the bills any easier , I decided to write something my agent could sell as a book with commercial potential . Cut to New Year 's Eve 2009 . A party , friends , everyone drunk . We 've had the forced-down champagne and abused fireworks on the roof terrace , and are now taking stock of what we 've done in the last year -- and what we plan to do in the new one . Pretty much ex nihilo I said : `` I 'm going to write a novel about the last surviving werewolf . '' The idea met with feeble unanimous approval . So I woke up the next morning and started work .

CNN : Talulla is such a compelling character , was there a big difference between writing her voice and Jake ?

Duncan : Yes . Jake is just me . Or , rather , me in his predicament : not very difficult to write . With Talulla I did n't have the crutch -LRB- ahem -RRB- of my own gender and personality to lean on . There 's no way of knowing if the imaginative projection is a success except in so far as readers find Talulla a convincing female . Let 's see .

CNN : How did you develop the werewolf mythology behind your story ? Were there traditional elements you wanted to keep , change or explore further ?

Duncan : I just kept the parts of the traditional mythology I liked , or that served my thematic purpose , and ditched whatever I did n't . Death by silver , I liked , so it was in . Ditto visceral antipathy to vampires . Some versions of the myth allow for the lycanthrope 's voluntary metamorphosis -- but that 's not as rich a moral quandary as being forced to change , whether you like it or not , every full moon .

CNN : Do you have a favorite werewolf story and why do you think they have appealed to readers for so long ?

Duncan : I 've never read a werewolf story in my life , but my favorite werewolf movie is , of course , `` An American Werewolf in London . '' -LRB- Closely followed by the brilliantly mad `` Dog Soldiers . '' -RRB- Myths of metamorphosis are as old as the human ability to tell stories , and survive because they express something fundamental to the psyche . In the case of werewolves , the fear of the beast within , and the desire to be liberated into it .

CNN : You 've unleashed your writer 's id in these novels . There 's lots of sex and violence , definitely not for the faint of heart . Was it fun to write ?

Duncan : For me writing a novel is n't fun , no matter how much sex and violence it contains . It 's satisfying , yes , to get something right at the level of the sentence , and it 's fun to have finished writing the thing . ... But the actual writing ? No . It 's agony , every day , an endless search for reasons to not start writing . I wish it were otherwise , but there you are .

CNN : What would you like readers to take away from `` Talulla Rising '' ?

Duncan : The feeling of having just read the best werewolf novel -LRB- along with its predecessor -RRB- the world has yet produced -- what else ? Or , more reasonably : It 's not so different for girls after all .

CNN : Is there anything you 've read recently that inspired you ?

Duncan : I 'm not reading much contemporary work at the moment -LRB- not until the third werewolf book 's done , in fact -RRB- , but I 'm a couple of hundred pages into `` Don Quixote '' -- which is absolutely hilarious . That 'll last me through summer . Especially if it 's an English summer .

CNN : Without giving too much away , it feels like you 've set things up quite nicely for a trilogy . Any hints you can give us about your next novel ?

Duncan : Impossible without spoilers . But multiple narrators -- including a vampire -- and a myth of origin for werewolves . Sex , violence , jokes , philosophy , love , death . Business as usual .
