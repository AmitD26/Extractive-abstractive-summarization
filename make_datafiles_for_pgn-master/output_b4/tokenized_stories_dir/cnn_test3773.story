-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Southwest Airlines flight landed safely at a military base in Yuma , Arizona , on Friday with what passengers described as a 3-foot hole in the fuselage of the Boeing 737 .

`` I heard a loud popping sound about three or four minutes before it blew open on us , '' passenger Greg Hansen told CNN .

'' -LRB- Then -RRB- a big explosion happened . A big noise , and from there , you felt some of the air being sucked out . It happened right behind me , in the row behind me and it covers about two and a half rows , '' he said from seat 11C .

Hansen , 41 , a regional sales manager for a biotech company , was flying home to Sacramento from a business trip . Some people panicked and screamed as the blue sky and sun began to shine through the cabin in mid-flight , he said .

`` Most people were just white knuckles holding onto the arm rests . The pilots did a great job and were under control to get us to a manageable level , '' he said .

But just behind him , Hansen says he could see the jagged edge of the aircraft where the rivets used to be .

`` You can see the insulation and wiring . The interior ceiling panel was bouncing up and down with the air , '' he said .

`` It was surreal , when you 're riding in a modern aircraft . You 're used to being enclosed and not having the window rolled down , '' he said .

Hansen described the hole as being about 3 or 4 feet long and about a foot wide .

Hansen said that he and the rest of the passengers were still on board Southwest Flight 812 , after making an emergency landing at Yuma Marine Corps Air Station/International Airport at 7:07 p.m. ET .

The FAA said the captain made a rapid controlled descent from 36,000 to about 11,000 feet after the cabin lost pressure . Investigators are en route to the base , the FAA said .

`` We do not know the cause of the decompression , '' said Ian Gregor of the FAA .

Southwest said in a statement that the flight crew `` discovered a hole in the top of the aircraft . ''

A new aircraft is en route to the base with maintenance , ground crew and customer service agents `` to assess the damaged aircraft and support the 118 customers aboard . ''

Hansen said the incident took place about 35 minutes into the flight . He says that it took about 45 seconds or a minute before the oxygen masks came down after the hole blew open .

`` The crew was pretty calm about it . They walked around and checked on everyone , '' he said . `` But it was n't like the movies where papers get sucked out of the hole , but you could feel it and hear the noise . ''

Hansen said that most of the passengers were complaining of a pain in their eardrums from a rapid descent .

Southwest Airlines said only one injury is being reported .

`` There are no reported customer injuries , '' reads a statement released by the airline . `` One of the flight attendants , however , received a minor injury upon descent . ''

Hansen said one male flight attendant appeared to fall , and was bleeding from a facial injury .

An airport official told CNN that passengers will remain on board the damaged plane to ensure their safety , until the new replacement plane arrives .

`` They have been tended to and are being given refreshments because the temperature on the tarmac is near 100 degrees , '' said Yuma International Airport spokeswoman Gen Grosse .

One of the passengers told CNN affiliate KOVR that the incident occurred shortly after flight attendants took drink orders .

`` I heard a huge sound and oxygen masks came down and we started making a rapid decent . They said we 'd be making an emergency landing , '' said the passenger , identified only as Cindy . `` There was a hole in the fuselage about 3 feet long . You could see the insulation and the wiring . You could see a tear the length of one of the ceiling panels . ''

A spokeswoman for Boeing declined to comment on possible causes of the incident .

`` The 737 has an outstanding safety record , '' said Julie O'Donnell . `` We are in communication with the -LRB- National Transportation Safety Board -RRB- and stand ready to assist . ''
