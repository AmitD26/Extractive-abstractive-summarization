London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prince William 's younger brother Prince Harry will be his best man when he marries Kate Middleton in London in April , Clarence House announced Monday . Middleton 's sister Philippa will be her maid of honor .

William , who is second in line to the throne , is due to marry his long-time girlfriend April 29 at Westminster Abbey . Prince Harry is currently third in line of succession .

Royal protocol states that the groom should have a `` supporter '' rather than a Best Man and speculation was rife that Prince Harry would be named supporter , and another friend of Prince William announced as his best man .

Prince Charles elected his brother Prince Andrew to be his `` supporter '' when he married Diana , Princess of Wales in 1981 .

Naming Harry best man is a break with protocol , and is being taken as an indication of William and Kate 's more modern approach to their upcoming wedding , which is taking place at Westminster Abbey on April 29 .

Harry will be organizing the Prince 's `` stag '' or bachelor party . Meanwhile Philippa , or `` Pippa , '' will be expected to pull together Kate 's `` hen '' or bachelorette party .

William 's office at Clarence House also announced that there will be four bridesmaids and two page boys , including two of William 's godchildren .

They are Grace van Cutsem , 3 , and Tom Pettifer , 8 . Pettifer is the son of Tiggy Pettifer , William and Harry 's former nanny -- an important figure in the young Princes ' lives , especially following the death of their mother in 1997 .

Lady Louise Windsor , 7 , the Hon. Margarita Armstrong-Jones , 8 , and Eliza Lopes , 3 , will be the other bridesmaids .

Lady Windsor , is the daughter of the Earl and Countess of Wessex as well as being the Queen 's granddaughter , while Armstrong-Jones , Prince William 's second cousin , is the daughter of Viscount and Viscountess Linley .

Lopes , meanwhile , is the granddaughter of Prince William 's stepmother , the Duchess of Cornwall .

William `` Billy '' Lowther-Pinkerton , 10 , the son of Prince William 's private secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton , will be the other page boy .

Details regarding the Bridesmaid 's dresses and Page Boys ' uniforms will remain a secret until the day of the wedding , Clarence House said .

Notable royals who have been left off the list include the Prince 's cousin , Zara Phillips , who also announced her own engagement last year .
