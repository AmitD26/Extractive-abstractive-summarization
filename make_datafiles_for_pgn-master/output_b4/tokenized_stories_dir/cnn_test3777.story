-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He said he was little . And that turned out to be a big problem , according to prosecutors .

Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia unsealed an indictment Friday accusing 45-year-old Eric C. Opitz of bilking Medicare out of more than $ 535,000 by claiming he was a dwarf who needed human growth hormone .

In reality , according to the indictment , Opitz was 450 pounds and 6 feet , 3 inches .

That 's a nearly 1Ã‚ 1/2 feet taller than what the support group Little People of America says is the cut-off for dwarfism .

But for nearly a year , a pharmacy filled the physical trainer and body building consultant 's prescriptions for as much as 8 milligrams of growth hormone per day -- 40 times the FDA 's recommended maximum dose , according to prosecutors .

Medicare footed the bill through a prescription drug benefit program , according to prosecutors . Opitz had claimed his only source of income was $ 950 a month in Social Security benefits , according to the indictment .

So what did the big guy do with all that growth hormone -- which some athletes and bodybuilders use to increase muscle mass ?

He sold , it , prosecutors say , at something like $ 450 for each kit . He found his customers through a brazen ad on Craigslist , according to the indictment .

Read the indictment

`` Do not wait , a lot in stock from pharmacy but it moves fast , '' Opitz wrote in the ad , according to the indictment .

He got customers from all over the United States , but it turns out a handful were undercover investigators .

Opitz was charged with health care fraud , mail fraud and illegal distribution of human growth hormones and anabolic steroids .

Authorities arrested Opitz , then released him pending a detention hearing scheduled Friday afternoon , according to Patty Hartman , a public affairs specialist with the U.S. Attorney 's Office .

If convicted , prosecutors say Opitz faces `` substantial '' prison time .
