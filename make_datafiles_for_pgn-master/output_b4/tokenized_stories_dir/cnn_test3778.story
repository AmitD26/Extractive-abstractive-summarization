-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A malware attack hit Yahoo 's advertising server over the last few days , affecting thousands of users in various countries , an Internet security company said .

In a blog post , Fox-IT said Yahoo 's servers were releasing an `` exploit kit '' that exploited vulnerabilities in Java and installed malware .

`` Clients visiting yahoo.com received advertisements served by ads.yahoo.com , '' the Internet security company said . `` Some of the advertisements are malicious . ''

Fox-IT , which is based in the Netherlands , focuses on cyber defense . It estimates that tens of thousands of users were affected per hour .

`` Given a typical infection rate of 9 % , this would result in around 27,000 infections every hour , '' the company said . `` Based on the same sample , the countries most affected by the exploit kit are Romania , Great Britain and France . At this time it 's unclear why those countries are most affected , it is likely due to the configuration of the malicious advertisements on Yahoo . ''

If a computer infected with malware is connected to a network , attackers can often access other connected systems and servers .

Yahoo said it is aware of the attack and is monitoring and blocking such advertisements .

`` At Yahoo , we take the safety and privacy of our users seriously , '' it said in a prepared statement Monday . `` From December 31 to January 3 on our European sites , we served some advertisements that did not meet our editorial guidelines -- specifically , they spread malware . On January 3 , we removed these advertisements from our European sites . ''

The attacks did not affect North America , Latin America and the Asia Pacific region , Yahoo said .

`` Additionally , users using Macs and mobile devices were not affected , '' it added .

Fox-IT said it is unclear who 's behind the attack , but it appears to be `` financially motivated . '' It did not provide details .
