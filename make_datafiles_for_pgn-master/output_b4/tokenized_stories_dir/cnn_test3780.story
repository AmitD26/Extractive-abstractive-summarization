-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The epiphany occurred at a baptism .

With more than 800 people waiting , Pastor Rick Warren took them one by one and immersed them in the church 's baptism pool . During this spiritual rite at Saddleback Church , the pastors hold the people briefly underwater , and then pull them out .

`` On that particular day , I was baptizing 858 people , '' Warren told his congregation last fall . `` That took me literally four hours . ''

`` As I 'm baptizing 858 people , along around 500 , I thought this ... ` We 're all fat . ' ''

Warren turned his realization to himself .

`` But I thought , I 'm fat , '' he said . `` I 'm a terrible model of this . I ca n't expect our people to get in shape unless I do . ''

Warren , considered one of the most influential pastors in the country , delivered the inaugural prayer for President Obama in 2009 and wrote the best-selling book `` The Purpose Driven Life . '' Now , he was embarking on a new mission : Curbing the obesity epidemic at church .

Warren seems like an unlikely man to lead an anti-obesity crusade . A ruddy man with plastic frame glasses , he has admitted to gaining 90 pounds over the last 30 years and failing at various yo-yo diets . He declined an interview for this story .

Based in Lake Forest , California , Saddleback is one of the largest churches in the United States and has eight locations throughout Orange County . Warren has a casual style in his ministry , usually preaching in jeans .

Since January 2011 , Warren has been shrinking . He gave up carbonated drinks , dairy and fast food , he told the church . He works out twice a day , according to his trainer , Tom Wilson . Warren shed 60 pounds on a diet-lifestyle program devised at Saddleback Church called the Daniel Plan .

The program 's name comes from the biblical story about Daniel . In the story , Daniel and his friends , who are Israelites living in Babylon , refuse to consume royal food and wine . By eating vegetables and water , `` they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food , '' according to Daniel 1:15 in the Bible 's New International Version .

The Daniel Program , which started at Saddleback Church last January , advises how to eat healthier foods , encourages workout routines and urges participants to join small groups . The program was free .

Warren recruited three doctors to develop the plan : Daniel Amen , a psychiatrist ; Mark Hyman , a family doctor ; and Mehmet Oz , a TV host and cardiac surgeon .

`` The secret sauce of Saddleback is we do this as a community , '' said Amen , one of the medical contributors . `` It 's very different than most health plans where you do it with yourself or your wife . You get to do this with a whole community . ''

Studies indicate that people who try to lose weight or adopt healthier habits in groups are more likely to be successful than individuals working independently .

The small groups have health and spiritual curricula , and provide a support network . Saddleback was the ideal place , because small groups already existed at the church and Warren had `` instantaneous capacity to make this happen , '' said Hyman , another contributor to the Daniel Plan .

`` The church was the perfect incubator , '' he said . `` This was a way of leapfrogging and getting a social experiment done . ''

Chiquita Seals , a member of Saddleback , said that having a small group was instrumental to her 125-pound weight loss . Her group met twice a month to discuss their health , and they also hiked together . Each small group has a health champion , whom Seals credits with `` helping me emotionally , physically . ''

`` The health champion guides the group -- ` This is what we 're cooking , this is what we 're doing ' -- and cheers you on and helps you out . It 's not just the food you 're eating , it 's also mental gain , '' she said .

The church held a race , cooking demonstrations and various workout classes led by Tae Bo founder Billy Blanks . It overhauled the menus and vending machine products sold at church and placed symbols to indicate which choices were healthy . Doughnuts often given to the congregation were replaced with trail mix . The church developed a website with recipes , advice on physical activity and health information .

`` It 's not a diet , not a healthy quick scheme , it 's designed to be a way to create health , '' Hyman said .

At the end of the first year , about 15,000 people had registered for the program and 250,000 pounds were lost , according to Saddleback Church . The Daniel Plan is a program the founders intended to spread to different faith communities across the globe , Hyman said .

But many at Saddleback wondered why the church would get involved in health and weight loss .

`` I wondered whether this was something church should be doing , '' said Julie McGough , a member of Saddleback Church for 18 years .

McGough and her husband decided to try the plan , because they had gained weight during his illness with multiple sclerosis . Between his doctor 's visits , hospital appointments and busy schedule , the family came to rely on fast food as their staple .

The couple and their two kids , ages 10 and 16 , cleaned out their pantry , gave up the In-N-Out burgers and started cooking as a family activity . They started eating chicken , broccoli , squash and a variety of vegetables , and in smaller portions . They bought a trampoline for the kids and also started hiking .

One year later , McGough has lost 28 pounds . Her husband has lost 55 pounds and stopped taking as many medications .

`` This is what we should be doing , '' McGough said about the church 's involvement in the health plan . `` I am far more able to serve God because I 'm healthy . ''

Warren said in several speeches to the congregation that he never paid much attention to the perils of obesity such as diabetes and heart disease . But when he heard that obesity could affect a person 's brain power , it snapped him into action . Growing evidence indicates that obesity is associated with impaired cognitive function , such as attention and memory problems .

Warren often repeats the same phrases when discussing the Daniel Plan . `` The Father made your body , Jesus paid for your body , the Spirit lives in your body . You better take care of it . ''
