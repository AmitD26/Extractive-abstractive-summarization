-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prepare a pot of damn fine coffee and enjoy a slice of cherry pie : `` Twin Peaks '' is coming back .

The offbeat TV series , created by David Lynch and Mark Frost , will be returning to television in 2016 , according to a strange -LRB- of course -RRB- video posted on Showtime 's YouTube channel . The original show ran on ABC in 1990 and 1991 and spawned a 1992 theatrical film directed by Lynch , `` Twin Peaks : Fire Walk with Me . ''

`` Dear Twitter Friends ... it is happening again ... #damngoodcoffee , '' Lynch tweeted .

According to a press release from Showtime , `` Twin Peaks '' will be a limited series of nine episodes . Lynch and Frost will write and produce each one and Lynch will direct all nine .

When it debuted , `` Twin Peaks '' was like nothing else that had ever aired on television . Lynch -LRB- then best known as the director of `` Eraserhead '' and `` Blue Velvet '' -RRB- and Frost -- who had written for `` Hill Street Blues '' -- created an eerie story starring Kyle MacLachlan as FBI agent Dale Cooper , who had come to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer .

The murder mystery was only the entry point into a bizarre world , one that was alternately drily witty and brutally violent . The straight-arrow Cooper was fond of a diner 's `` damn fine coffee '' and pie to an almost absurd degree . The show featured a one-armed man , a dancing dwarf , rumblings at the local lumber mill and a malevolent spirit named BOB .

The tone was set with Angelo Badalamenti 's ghostly theme music .

In addition to MacLachlan , the show starred Ray Wise , Lara Flynn Boyle , Peggy Lipton and Joan Chen .

`` Twin Peaks '' started off a huge hit , but as the plot became more obscure and the mood became darker , the audience dwindled , especially in the second season . However , those who stayed with it were a hardcore bunch , enough to prompt the theatrical film so Lynch could tie up some loose ends -LRB- or not , being Lynch -RRB- .

Despite diverse reviews , the show remains one of the most influential in television history , with its involvement of a noted movie director , its willingness to take audiences to far-out places , its deliberate pace and its obsessed-about plot points and character tics . In many ways , it was ahead of its time .

Showtime plans to show the entire run of the TV series before the premiere of the new `` Twin Peaks '' episodes .

`` What more can I say -- ` Twin Peaks ' with David Lynch and Mark Frost on Showtime in 2016 ! '' said Showtime President David Nevins . `` To quote Agent Cooper , ` I have no idea where this will lead us , but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange . ' ''
