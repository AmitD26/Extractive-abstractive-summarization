-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The toughest conditions she has ever played in . That 's how one of tennis ' biggest stars described this year 's scorched Australian Open .

And it 's not hard to see why .

With temperatures in excess of 40 degrees , and after four days of players fainting , vomiting and tirelessly icing themselves to keep cool , Li Na was feeling hot and flustered .

The fourth seed , a runner-up at last year 's Melbourne grand slam , was facing match point and a shock early exit at the hands of world No. 26 Lucie Safarova .

But the Czech sent a backhand five centimeters long of the baseline , letting Li back in to take a second-set tie break and then take advantage of the extreme heat contingency plan .

In light of the oppressive weather , tournament organizers have allowed for an extra 10 minutes between the second and third sets of women 's matches , a break which rejuvenated the 2011 French Open champion .

`` After the second set , lucky thing we had the 10 minute break , '' China 's Li told reporters after her 1-6 7-6 -LRB- 7-2 -RRB- 6-3 victory set up a fourth round match with Russia Ekaterina Makarova .

`` I think five centimeters saved my tournament . If she hit it in , I think me and my whole team would be on our way to the airport now .

`` At least I won the match , and I 'm still in the tournament now . It was a difficult day for me but I was really happy with the way I was fighting on the court from the first point until the last point . ''

While Li Na went to cool down , tournament doctor Tim Wood had defended organizers ' refusal to halt play during the sunniest parts of the day , saying that , while playing in the heat might be terribly uncomfortable , human beings `` evolved on the high plains of Africa chasing antelope for eight hours under these conditions .

`` There will be some players who complain and no-one is saying it is terribly comfortable to play out there , but , from a medical perspective , we know that man is well adapted to exercising in the heat . Whether it is humane or not is a whole other issue , '' Wood told the BBC .

Words that might not be music to Britain 's Jamie Murray 's ears , who was treated for heatstroke .

Whatever the conditions , world No. 1 Serena Williams continues her peerless dominance of the women 's game .

The top seed has now won more matches at the Australian Open than any other woman in history after registering her 61st success at Melbourne Park by beating Daniela Hantuchova 6-3 6-3 .

`` I feel good to have gotten through that one because it was tough conditions out there , but I was happy to win , '' said the 32-year-old .

`` Today actually was n't as hot . I think it was hotter yesterday . So it was n't as bad today . Honestly , on the one end I felt it was like a cool breeze coming over , so that was a good sign . ''

Williams ' fourth round opponent will be the resurgent Ana Ivanovic , who reached the fourth round after coming from one set down to end Australian Samantha Stosur 's hopes of a home grand slam triumph .

In the men 's draw , defending champion Novak Djokovic remained on course for his fourth Australian Open title in a row as he eased into the fourth round with a 6-3 6-3 7-5 victory over Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan .

`` I feel better on the court as the tournament is progressing , '' Djokovic , who played under the cool conditions of the Rod Laver Arena 's closed roof , told reporters .

`` Of course , I played three matches in different conditions . The roof was closed and the temperature dropped by at least 10 degrees , and you could feel that . It affected the play , it was much slower . ''

Victory for the Serbian , who won his first grand slam in Melbourne in 2008 , sets up a meeting with his old friend Fabio Fognini , after the Italian beat American Sam Querrey .

`` I 'm going to try to win against him regardless of whether he 's a friend or not , '' Djokovic continued . `` I have a real friendship with him for more than 10 years but once we get on court we 're both professionals and we want to win . ''

Spanish third seed David Ferrer , Tomas Berdych , the Czech seventh seed , and South African Kevin Anderson also booked their places in the next round of the sizzling Australian Open .
