-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A fan of Dutch football team Ajax is in a serious condition in hospital after falling from the stands of the club 's Amsterdam ArenA stadium on Tuesday .

The fan is said to have fallen while celebrating Ajax 's second goal , scored by Danny Hoesen , during a 2-1 European Champions League win over Barcelona .

Amsterdam Police confirmed on Twitter that the supporter who had fallen approximately five meters and had been taken to hospital where he was in a serious condition .

From the same account the police later denied social media rumors that the fan had died .

The Ajax press office was not immediately available for comment , though the club 's Twitter feed sent the fan its best wishes .

Pictures on social media appear to show the man lying motionless in a pool of blood .

The incident comes days after a similar event at the Oakland Raiders vs. Tennessee Titans National Football League game on Sunday .

A 61-year-old Marine veteran used his body to break the fall of a woman who had seemingly thrown herself from the third level of the Oakland Coliseum .

The woman suffered a head wound while the man sustained non-life-threatening injuries .

European football 's governing body UEFA stipulates that all Champions League matches must be played in all-seater stadia .

Ten-man Ajax 's win over Barcelona handed the Catalans their first defeat under coach Gerardo Martino .

After beating Celtic in Glasgow AC Milan remain second in Group H with nine points behind Barca , who have already qualified for the knockout stages , but Ajax are now only one point behind the Italian side on eight .

The Dutch side will qualify for the last 16 if they can beat Milan at the San Siro stadium in the final round of Group H matches on December 11 .
