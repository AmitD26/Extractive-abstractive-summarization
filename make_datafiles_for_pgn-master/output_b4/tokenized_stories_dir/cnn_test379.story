-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian , the Michigan pathologist who put assisted suicide on the world 's medical ethics stage , died early Friday , according to a spokesman with Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak , Michigan . He was 83 .

The assisted-suicide advocate had been hospitalized for pneumonia and a kidney-related ailment , his attorney had said .

He had struggled with kidney problems for years and had checked into a hospital earlier this month for similar problems , his lawyer , Mayer Morganroth , said . He checked back into the hospital in the Detroit suburb on May 18 after suffering a relapse , Morganroth said .

Kevorkian , dubbed `` Dr. Death , '' made national headlines as a supporter of physician-assisted suicide and `` right-to-die '' legislation . He was charged with murder numerous times through the 1990s for helping terminally ill patients take their own lives .

He was convicted on second-degree murder charges in 1999 stemming from the death of a patient who suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , commonly called Lou Gehrig 's disease . He was paroled in 2007 .

After his release , he said he would not help end any more lives .

Morganroth told CNN Friday that he was summoned to the hospital Thursday night , with doctors telling him `` the end was near '' for Kevorkian .

`` The doctors and nurses were extremely supportive , '' Morganroth said . They played music by Kevorkian 's favorite composer -- Bach -- in his room , and Kevorkian died about 2:30 a.m. , Morganroth said .

Attorney Geoffrey Fieger , who was Kervorkian 's lawyer on several assisted-suicide cases , described Kevorkian as a `` historic man . ''

`` He simply felt that it was the duty of every physician to alleviate suffering , and when the circumstance was such that there was no alternative , to help that patient to end their own suffering , '' Fieger said in a statement .

In an interview with CNN 's Dr. Sanjay Gupta last year , Kevorkian said he had no regrets about his work .

`` No , no . It 's your purpose -LRB- as a -RRB- physician . How can you regret helping a suffering patient ? '' he said .

In that interview , Kevorkian said that he had three missions in life and that he himself was not ready to die .

One of his missions was to warn mankind of `` impending doom '' that will come from the culture of overabundance .

`` I 'm not going to be too popular for that one , '' he said .

His second mission was to educate people about assisted suicide , and his belief that in states where assisted suicide has been legalized , it is not being done right . He believed that people should n't have to have a terminal condition in order to qualify for help in ending their own lives .

Kevorkian 's third stated mission was to convince Americans that their rights are being infringed upon by bans on everything from smoking to assisted suicide .

In 2008 , at the age of 80 , he failed in a run for Congress in Michigan .
