-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Who shouts `` Ebola '' on a crowded airplane ?

The same person who yells `` fire '' in a crowded theater even when there are no flames .

The worldwide panic around the Ebola virus and its mostly deadly consequences is starting to inspire tricksters , hucksters and attention hogs to test the limits of the people around them .

While these agitators are finding zero tolerance for that kind of speech , people 's daily lives and travels are being disrupted by the fear and panic surrounding the virus .

Already , it 's cleared a courtroom , emptied a city bus and frightened passengers on several aircraft .

It clears the room

Joseph Britton shut down the courtroom at Broward County , Florida 's main jail with his Friday morning claim that he had Ebola , according to the Sun-Sentinel . Britton made the claim to Broward Judge John `` Jay '' Hurley , who was holding bond hearings from the main county courthouse via closed-circuit television .

The jail was placed on lockdown while Britton 's claim was investigated . Officials do n't think he has Ebola , but such claims tend to ratchet up the government 's response . Britton was taken the hospital to be tested , and the areas where he had been located were being disinfected .

Want to bet that Britton , who was arrested Thursday on charges of battery , disorderly conduct and other offenses , may get in even more trouble ?

Ebola on a plane

Do n't joke about having Ebola on an airplane , especially after passengers who contracted Ebola were known to have flown after getting infected .

A U.S. Airways passenger who made that joke last week received a special escort when he landed : Four officials in blue plastic hazmat suits boarded Flight 845 to retrieve him after it landed in the Dominican Republic .

`` I was just kidding , '' he could be heard saying in a video posted to social media .

It can be illegal

A public bus driver in Los Angeles was placed in quarantine and his bus removed from service after a masked person yelled `` Do n't mess with me , I have Ebola ! '' as he left the bus .

County health officials , who think it was a hoax , are investigating the incident as a terrorist threat , spokeswoman Sarah Kissell Garrett told the Los Angeles Times .
