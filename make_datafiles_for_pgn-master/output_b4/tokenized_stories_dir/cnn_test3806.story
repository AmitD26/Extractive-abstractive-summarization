-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A couple accused of kidnapping of two Amish girls in upstate New York last month was indicted on federal sex exploitation charges Thursday .

Nicole Vaisey , 25 , and boyfriend Stephen Howells II , 39 , were named in a five-count indictment in Syracuse .

The charges included conspiracy to sexually exploit the two Amish girls along with a third female minor , according to a statement released by U.S. Attorney Richard Hartunian .

Howells also was charged with possession of child pornography .

The pair had previously been charged with the kidnapping of the two Amish girls -- ages 6 and 12 -- about 50 miles from the Canadian border on August 13 .

`` This indictment charges Howells and Vaisey with enticing and coercing children to engage in sexual conduct and making a video recording of it , '' Hartunian said in a statement .

Vaisey and Howells both face a maximum of 30 years in prison on the sexual exploitation charges against children . Howells faces a maximum of 20 years on the child pornography charge . If convicted , both could be fined up to $ 250,000 on each count .

The pair also faces criminal court charges of first-degree kidnapping after luring the young Amish girls into a car with a puppy , authorities in New York 's St. Lawrence County said .

Details about the abduction in Oswegatchie emerged during a preliminary hearing in St. Lawrence County in August . Detective Sgt. Brooks Bigwarfe detailed the couples ' alleged plan and kidnapping of the girls , as related to him by Vaisey .

Vaisey told investigators that she and Howells were on a `` shopping trip '' for `` slaves '' when they allegedly kidnapped the girls .

`` They had been planning this for several weeks , '' Bigwarfe said .

The girls were picked up at a vegetable stand outside a family farm .

Howells and Vaisey pulled up to the stand in a location where they could n't be seen , and waited for the girls to approach the car , Bigwarfe said . Howells allegedly scouted out the stand the previous week .

Howells asked the girls whether they wanted to pet the dog , a Doberman pinscher-golden retriever mix named Kaleidoscope , police said . When the older child grew suspicious , Bigwarfe said , Howells pushed the girls into the back of the car .

`` When he started forcing them into the vehicle , they were both screaming and yelling , '' Bigwarfe said .

The girls were held captive for nearly 24 hours , during which they were handcuffed together , shackled to a bed and sexually abused , according to the sheriff 's department .

With widening media coverage , a large police response in the area and an Amber Alert , the couple began to worry and decided it was too risky to keep the girls , he said .

Howells abandoned the two girls in an isolated area 12 miles from where they were being held , Bigwarfe said .

Attorneys for Vaisey and Howell did not immediately return calls seeking comment .

After her August arrest , Vaisey 's attorney , Bradford Riendeau , told CNN that his client was allegedly in a master-slave relationship with Howells and that she was not the mastermind of the planned kidnapping .
