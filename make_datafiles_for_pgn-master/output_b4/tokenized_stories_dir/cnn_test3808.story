-LRB- WIRED -RRB- -- The tributes to Dennis Ritchie wo n't match the river of praise that spilled out over the web after the death of Steve Jobs . But they should .

And then some .

`` When Steve Jobs died last week , there was a huge outcry , and that was very moving and justified . But Dennis had a bigger effect , and the public does n't even know who he is , '' says Rob Pike , the programming legend and current Googler who spent 20 years working across the hall from Ritchie at the famed Bell Labs .

On Wednesday evening , with a post to Google + , Pike announced that Ritchie had died at his home in New Jersey over the weekend after a long illness , and though the response from hardcore techies was immense , the collective eulogy from the web at large does n't quite do justice to Ritchie 's sweeping influence on the modern world .

Dennis Ritchie is the father of the C programming language , and with fellow Bell Labs researcher Ken Thompson , he used C to build UNIX , the operating system that so much of the world is built on -- including the Apple empire overseen by Steve Jobs .

`` Pretty much everything on the web uses those two things : C and UNIX , '' Pike tells Wired . `` The browsers are written in C . The UNIX kernel â € '' that pretty much the entire Internet runs on -- is written in C. Web servers are written in C , and if they 're not , they 're written in Java or C++ , which are C derivatives , or Python or Ruby , which are implemented in C. And all of the network hardware running these programs I can almost guarantee were written in C.

`` It 's really hard to overstate how much of the modern information economy is built on the work Dennis did . ''

Even Windows was once written in C , he adds , and UNIX underpins both Mac OS X , Apple 's desktop operating system , and iOS , which runs the iPhone and the iPad . `` Jobs was the king of the visible , and Ritchie is the king of what is largely invisible , '' says Martin Rinard , professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory .

`` Jobs ' genius is that he builds these products that people really like to use because he has taste and can build things that people really find compelling . Ritchie built things that technologists were able to use to build core infrastructure that people do n't necessarily see much anymore , but they use everyday . ''

From B to C

Dennis Ritchie built C because he and Ken Thompson needed a better way to build UNIX . The original UNIX kernel was written in assembly language , but they soon decided they needed a `` higher level '' language , something that would give them more control over all the data that spanned the OS . Around 1970 , they tried building a second version with Fortran , but this did n't quite cut it , and Ritchie proposed a new language based on a Thompson creation known as B.

Depending on which legend you believe , B was named either for Thompson 's wife Bonnie or BCPL , a language developed at Cambridge in the mid-60s . Whatever the case , B begat C.

B was an interpreted language -- meaning it was executed by an intermediate piece of software running atop a CPU -- but C was a compiled language . It was translated into machine code , and then directly executed on the CPU . But in those days , C was considered a high-level language . It would give Ritchie and Thompson the flexibility they needed , but at the same time , it would be fast .

That first version of the language was n't all that different from C as we know it today -- though it was a tad simpler . It offered full data structures and `` types '' for defining variables , and this is what Richie and Thompson used to build their new UNIX kernel . `` They built C to write a program , '' says Pike , who would join Bell Labs 10 years later . `` And the program they wanted to write was the UNIX kernel . ''

Ritchie 's running joke was that C had `` the power of assembly language and the convenience of ... assembly language . '' In other words , he acknowledged that C was a less-than-gorgeous creation that still ran very close to the hardware . Today , it 's considered a low-level language , not high . But Ritchie 's joke did n't quite do justice to the new language . In offering true data structures , it operated at a level that was just high enough .

`` When you 're writing a large program -- and that 's what UNIX was -- you have to manage the interactions between all sorts of different components : all the users , the file system , the disks , the program execution , and in order to manage that effectively , you need to have a good representation of the information you 're working with . That 's what we call data structures , '' Pike says .

`` To write a kernel without a data structure and have it be as consist and graceful as UNIX would have been a much , much harder challenge . They needed a way to group all that data together , and they did n't have that with Fortran . ''

At the time , it was an unusual way to write an operating system , and this is what allowed Ritchie and Thompson to eventually imagine porting the OS to other platforms , which they did in the late 70s . `` That opened the floodgates for UNIX running everywhere , '' Pike says . `` It was all made possible by C. ''

Apple , Microsoft and beyond

At the same time , C forged its own way in the world , moving from Bell Labs to the world 's universities and to Microsoft , the breakout software company of the 1980s . `` The development of the C programming language was a huge step forward and was the right middle ground ... C struck exactly the right balance , to let you write at a high level and be much more productive , but when you needed to , you could control exactly what happened , '' says Bill Dally , chief scientist of NVIDIA and Bell Professor of Engineering at Stanford . '' -LSB- It -RSB- set the tone for the way that programming was done for several decades . ''

As Pike points out , the data structures that Richie built into C eventually gave rise to the object-oriented paradigm used by modern languages such as C++ and Java .

The revolution began in 1973 , when Ritchie published his research paper on the language , and five years later , he and colleague Brian Kernighan released the definitive C book : The C Programming Language . Kernighan had written the early tutorials for the language , and at some point , he `` twisted Dennis ' arm '' into writing a book with him .

Pike read the book while still an undergraduate at the University of Toronto , picking it up one afternoon while heading home for a sick day . `` That reference manual is a model of clarity and readability compared to latter manuals . It is justifiably a classic , '' he says . `` I read it while sick in bed , and it made me forget that I was sick . ''

Like many university students , Pike had already started using the language . It had spread across college campuses because Bell Labs started giving away the UNIX source code . Among so many other things , the operating system gave rise to the modern open source movement . Pike is n't overstating it when says the influence of Ritchie 's work ca n't be overstated , and though Ritchie received the Turing Award in 1983 and the National Medal of Technology in 1998 , he still has n't gotten his due .

As Kernighan and Pike describe him , Ritchie was an unusually private person . `` I worked across the hall from him for more than 20 years , and yet I feel like a do n't knew him all that well , '' Pike says . But this does n't quite explain his low profile . Steve Jobs was a private person , but his insistence on privacy only fueled the cult of personality that surrounded him .

Ritchie lived in a very different time and worked in a very different environment than someone like Jobs . It only makes sense that he would n't get his due . But those who matter understand the mark he left . `` There 's that line from Newton about standing on the shoulders of giants , '' says Kernighan . `` We 're all standing on Dennis ' shoulders . ''
