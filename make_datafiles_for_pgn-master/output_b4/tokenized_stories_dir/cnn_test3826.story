Bel Air , Maryland -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man who jumped the White House fence Wednesday night suffers from mental health problems , and has been arrested in a previous security breach there , according to his father .

Dominic Adesanya , 23 , of Bel Air , Maryland , barely made it onto the lawn before he was subdued as he fought off two police dogs , the Secret Service said .

`` Dog got him , '' a Secret Service spokesman said .

Adesanya has been charged with two counts of felony assault on a police officer for attacking the K-9 dogs , four counts of resisting and unlawful entry , and one count of making threats , said Brian Leary , a Secret Service spokesman .

Authorities said he was unarmed at the time of his arrest .

His father , Victor Adesanya , said his son is paranoid and hears voices .

Adesanya was arrested near the White House about two months ago and charged with a misdemeanor , his father told CNN affiliate WMAR .

`` He had done it before , '' the father said . `` He did n't cross the fence . He was at the gate , fussing at the people , wanting to talk to the President to tell the President about his situation . ''

He said his son has been experiencing a downward mental health spiral after he was prohibited from trying out for a college football team at Stevenson University in Westminster , Maryland . He dropped out of school in November .

Doctors have diagnosed him with paranoia and schizophrenia , and have prescribed antidepressants and other drugs .

He was fighting the dogs because he thinks `` he 's got to prove he 's this phenomenon athlete , '' his father said .

`` He does n't understand , you know , his problem is not the President , you know , his problem is in his head , '' Adesanya told CNN outside the family home north of Baltimore . '' And he do n't want help ... we think he needs to be forced to get the help . ''

The father said they 've asked the government for help , without any success .

`` It 's hard to be in your house and not know if the person you 're living with is trustworthy and to know they 're mentally disturbed like he is , '' the father said .

Before officers moved in , Adesanya kicked a K-9 unit dog and punched another one . The two dogs -- Hurricane and Jordan -- were treated by a vet for minor injuries and cleared for continued duty by the Secret Service on Thursday morning .

Wednesday 's incident is the second time someone has jumped the fence at the White House in the last month . This time , the President was in the residence when the intruder jumped over the fence .

In September , a man -- whom police identified as Omar Gonzalez -- scaled a fence armed with a knife and made it into the White House before he was detained .

Gonzalez 's indictment has been delayed until he undergoes a full mental competency evaluation .

The Secret Service used its Twitter account later Thursday to show pictures of the two dogs involved in the incident ready to return to work .
