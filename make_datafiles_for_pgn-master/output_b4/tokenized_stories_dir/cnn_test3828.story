-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Brazilian striker Brandao has been handed a one-month jail sentence for headbutting an opposing player , with the severity of his punishment linked to the footballer 's role model status , according to one of the lawyers involved in the case .

The judicial punishment follows a six-month sporting ban given to Brandao , who plays for French Ligue 1 side Bastia , following the August incident when he assaulted Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta .

`` This is an extremely severe sentence compared to the criminal record of my client , '' Brandao 's lawyer Olivier Martin told CNN affiliate BFMTV after the three-judge panel 's ruling , which also included a $ 25,000 fine .

`` It 's all the more severe because of the motivation that was raised by the President of the Court to justify the sentence , '' added Martin . `` He referred to the violence in football stadiums . ''

Brandao headbutted the Italy international in the tunnel of PSG ' s Parc des Princes stadium following the match which the Parisian club won 2-0 .

The 34-year-old can be seen on CCTV waiting around before striking Motta and then running off out of shot with Brazilian-born Motta following in hot pursuit .

Motta 's lawyer Francois Klein said `` the court wanted to mark the occasion , '' as Ligue 1 players were considered role models to many people .

`` Because these images are widely circulated ; it gives the youth an absolutely regrettable idea , '' said Klein .

`` It 's well known that in many stadiums , suburban or elsewhere , there are similar events that may occur , and it is necessary that professional players lead by example . '' Neither of the two players involved were present at the Paris court for the trial .

The court was particularly annoyed by the absence of Brandao , who was having surgery in a Saint Etienne hospital Thursday .

Brandao is expected to `` benefit from a sentence adjustment , '' meaning he would serve his punishment through a community service rather than in jail .

Against PSG , Brandao was playing in only his second match for the Corsica-based club after joining from Saint Etienne in the summer . He was initially suspended for four weeks following the attack which broke Motta 's nose .

Last season , he was banned for three matches for elbowing another PSG player , Yohan Cabaye , in the head .

`` Brandao will be available to play again on Feb. 22 , 2015 , '' the French league 's disciplinary committee said in a statement following his September punishment , meaning the striker will miss 24 league matches in total .
