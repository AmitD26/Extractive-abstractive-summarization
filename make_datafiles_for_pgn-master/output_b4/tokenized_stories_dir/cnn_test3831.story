-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We all know long haul travel stinks , but when we finally step off the plane and inhale those heady aromas of our destination , it somehow stinks a little less .

Fragrances , apparently , help create some of the best memories we take home from our vacations .

With this in mind , the UK 's Heathrow Airport has installed a `` Scent Globe '' to try to cheer up departing passengers with a squirt of the exotic smells awaiting them at their destinations .

The globe , positioned in the newly opened Terminal 2 , offers whiffs representing five nations -- Brazil , China , Japan , South Africa and Thailand .

`` These specially created scents will give passengers traveling through Terminal 2 an exclusive preview of destinations that only Heathrow connects to -LSB- from the UK -RSB- , '' says Normand Boivin , the airport 's chief operating officer .

So what do these countries smell like ?

Design in Scent , the team behind Heathrow 's globe rely on complex odor infusions to bring them to life in a nasal-compatible form .

` Mystical temple incense '

South Africa 's fragrance `` captures the adventure of safari with notes of tribal incense , wild grass and musky animalics through the scent of Hyraceum . ''

Brazil `` embraces the scents of its rich rainforest fauna with a palette of coffee , tobacco and jasmine . ''

Japan `` is brought to life through cool , oceanic tones with a mix of seaweed and shell extracts , green tea and Ambergris , capturing the essence of small coastal villages so synonymous with the great Pacific Island . ''

China 's features `` mystical temple incense and subtle Osmanthus Fragrans flower '' while Thailand 's uses `` an appetizing mix of lemongrass , ginger and coconut . ''

Leaving aside the fact that the true scent of intercontinental travel is actually a warm blend of stranger 's armpit infused with essence of brutally stewed airline food , pairing countries with odors is an entertaining idea .

Above are a few we came up with .
