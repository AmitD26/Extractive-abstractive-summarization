-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Confidence -- on the court and off it , Venus Williams is finding her mojo again .

A year ago the tennis star was diagnosed with a debilitating auto-immune disease during the U.S. Open , but next week she will step back on the courts of her home grand slam tournament boosted by her recent results and the relaunch of her fashion label .

Williams defended her women 's doubles gold medal at the recent Olympic Games alongside younger sister Serena , who has roared back from her own health problems to win both the Wimbledon and London 2012 singles titles .

`` The Olympics really built my confidence , '' the 32-year-old Venus told CNN . `` I was n't able to play a lot of matches beforehand -- just three matches in about two months , which is not a lot .

`` So going to the Olympics I did n't have a lot of matches , but I made the best of it and I played I think some of my best tennis of the year . ''

The former world No. 1 's passion , fashion , is also on the upswing following the recent relaunch of her label EleVen at an event in New York -- which also hosts the U.S. Open .

`` EleVen is about being better than a 10 , '' said the current world No. 47 . `` So it 's about being a personal best , it 's about not accepting any limits , that anyone puts on you or that you can even put on yourself , because sometimes we do .

`` It 's about expressing yourself for who you are . So EleVen means a lot of things but it just means bringing out the best in you .

`` I feel that when I wear EleVen , I feel my best . So I want people to feel their best when they wear EleVen , confident and good about themselves . ''

Throughout her career , the seven-time grand slam champion has been as well known for her striking outfits as she has her powerful tennis strokes .

Some of them pushed the boundaries of sporting design , and Williams said she is reining in her more experimental urges .

`` Some of my favorite things were the goddess dress that I wore at Wimbledon , I think it was 2007 , '' she said . `` And one of the craziest ones was the can-can dress .

`` That was my idea of having lace on skin . For me it was fun , and it was experimental because at that time it was just me wearing it . But at that time I was like , ` What can I do that can be worn on the court ? Can you wear lace ? Yes . Can you wear fringe ? '

`` Because I did this fun dress after Tina Turner , and it was so fun , but at this point the experiments are over and it 's about bringing classic designs . ''

Williams ' obsession with design is such that she took time away from playing tennis to gain a fashion degree .

`` To get my degree was important to me , mostly because of how I grew up -- my parents always chose education -- so for me it felt like an achievement to be able to do that , '' she said .

`` But also I love fashion , and I knew it was something that I wanted to do , and I wanted to bring credibility to it , and I have to say the education helps a ton , so it 's served me very well . ''

Williams said she is excited about all the elements of her life coming together again .

`` I 'm very excited about my game , I 'm excited about tennis , I 'm excited about wearing all the new EleVen clothes , '' she said .

`` There are so many wonderful things coming up so I think between great tennis and great fashions on the court , it 's going to be an amazing U.S. Open for me . ''

Williams is , however , still coming to terms with her battle against Sjogren 's Syndrome -- which can cause extreme fatigue among its symptoms .

`` I 've come a long way , and I 've gone through a lot of ups and downs for sure , '' she said .

`` When you have an auto-immune disease , you ca n't expect everything to be the way it was before . You have to take the set of circumstances you have , and work with those .

`` I 'm working on it every day , but I know that I can live this dream and I think it gives a lot of other people hope , because it 's not easy , but you know I 'm working on it . ''

The story of the Williams sisters ' rise to prominence , their dominance of the women 's game and the struggles they have both experienced in recent years -- with Serena surviving potentially life-threatening blood clots -- has captivated tennis fans .

They have won a combined total of 33 singles and doubles grand slam titles , so what lies ahead as they approach the twilight of their tennis careers ?

`` There 's a lot more clothes to design , '' Venus said . `` Serena and I both want to play the Rio 2016 Olympics , we think that 'd be a great place to shine for us and for the U.S. and everything .

`` So we 're not done yet , we still have great tennis in us , and it 's amazing to do this every day . ''
