-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- People smugglers accused of causing the deaths of hundreds of migrants when they deliberately rammed and sank their boat in the Mediterranean must be found and punished , the U.N. human rights chief said Friday .

Up to 500 people on board are thought to have died after the boat went down last week .

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called on Egypt and other North African and European states to track down those responsible for this `` atrocious incident '' and hold them accountable .

`` All the countries in the Mediterranean must make a concerted effort to clamp down on the smugglers who are exploiting one of the most vulnerable groups on the planet and endangering their lives , virtually on a daily basis , purely for financial gain , '' Zeid said .

`` The callous act of deliberately ramming a boat full of hundreds of defenseless people is a crime that must not go unpunished .

`` If the survivors ' accounts are indeed true -- and they appear all too credible -- we are looking at what amounts to mass murder in the Mediterranean . ''

Zeid also called for nations to tackle the root causes that led people to undertake such dangerous journeys in a bid to reach European shores .

` They were laughing '

Eleven survivors of the sinking , rescued by authorities in Italy , Malta and Greece , told interviewers from the International Organization for Migration earlier this week that the people smugglers were Palestinian or Egyptian .

Those on the boat included Syrians , Palestinians -- many of them from Gaza -- Egyptians and Sudanese , as well as Palestinians , the witnesses said .

Two Palestinian survivors explained that they 'd paid $ 2,000 -- money they 'd gotten after receiving grants to rebuild their homes -- at what they called a `` travel '' office in Gaza for their voyage to Italy , according to the IOM .

They had packed into a boat in Egypt 's port of Damietta and left on September 6 , they said . They estimated at least 400 men and women , in addition to as many as 100 children , were on board .

Five days later , the smugglers allegedly rammed their boat far out to sea between Malta and Greece , causing it to sink , after the migrants refused to move onto a smaller boat they judged to be unseaworthy . They 'd already been forced to transfer vessel several times , the survivors said .

`` After they hit our boat they waited to be sure that it had sunk completely before leaving . They were laughing , '' one survivor told the IOM .

As many as 300 people were reportedly crammed into a lower deck of the boat , many of them children , while another 200 were on the sun-baked top deck , the IOM said . A week later , only 11 survivors have been found .

Zeid urged the Greek , Maltese and Italian authorities to share information on the identity of the smugglers with the Egyptian authorities , who he said should also launch a thorough investigation .

`` You can not transport large quantities of foreigners in buses into a major port and cram them on board a ship without the port authorities and other witnesses being aware of what is going on , '' Zeid said .

` This summer 's recipe for death '

According to the IOM , the latest reported sinking would take the death toll off Europe 's shores this year to nearly 3,000 . In 2013 , the organization 's Missing Migrants Project estimated the total for the year to be 700 deaths .

In a news release Friday , the group said the reported 500 deaths were `` merely the latest chapter in a horrible story unfolding on Europe 's doorstep .

`` Criminality , on top of desperation , has been this summer 's recipe for death â € '' even murder , according to eyewitness accounts . ''

The IOM called for an end to a culture of impunity , fed by poverty and lawlessness , that has allowed criminal gangs to prosper , particularly in Libya .

And it urged European nations to reform immigration laws to allow refugees safe , legal migration to Europe .
