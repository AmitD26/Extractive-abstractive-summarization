-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Alligators can dance .

They and their relatives -- crocodiles , caimans and gharials -- can also sing , much like birds do , although most of them sound more like diesel engines or chainsaws being started . Some crocodilians , the order that includes all of these animals , can even put small sticks on their snouts to lure egrets looking for nest building material .

In the eight years I 've been studying crocodilians , my research has taken me to 26 countries on five continents . I enjoy both the animals and the travel , studying the difficult-to-observe aspects of the life of well-known creatures and exploring the remotest corners of the world in search of more enigmatic species .

Crocs hunt with sticks , Dinets and other researchers say

Here are a few of the best spots to see rare animals in the wild . Some are very easy to visit , while others would require a certain adjustment if you have Western standards of safety , personal comfort and hygiene .

Everglades National Park , Florida

Have you ever seen an alligator dance ? Millions of people visit this national park to see alligators and crocodiles , but some secrets of these animals were n't known until just recently . In my first week of research for my PhD in 2005 , I discovered `` alligator dances , '' nighttime courtship gatherings of up to a hundred gators . I call them `` dances '' because they remind me of village dance parties , where people come alone or with their partners to communicate , flirt , shake their booties , show off , pair up and sometimes fight .

Where to go : These dances can be often seen late at night in late April . Just walk to the end of the park 's Anhinga Trail boardwalk with a flashlight .

10 places that can change your child 's life

Monterey Bay Peninsula , California

The Monterey Bay area , which includes the city of Monterey and other small towns on California 's Central Coast , is the best place to see marine mammals outside the Antarctic . You can see elephant seals , harbor seals , sea lions , whales , dolphins , porpoises , sea otters and more -- over 20 species of marine mammals if you are lucky . The ocean is calm in August and September , and huge herds of whales move in to feast on krill .

Where to go : In the city of Monterey , you can walk to the ocean to look at sea otters , harbor seals and sea lions . You can also take a whale watching tour to look at gray whales -LRB- in winter and spring -RRB- , blue whales and humpbacks -LRB- in summer and fall -RRB- , and with some luck , killer whales , dolphins , porpoises and whatever else comes by . Go to AÃ ± o Nuevo State Park to see elephant seals and Point Lobos State Park for more seals and sea otters .

Eastern Quebec , Canada

This is a stunning part of the continent , where I 've dived with giant Greenland sharks , petted a seal pup , paddled around a colossal meteor crater and watched a huge gannet colony at arm 's length . July and August are good for diving and birding , November is good for aurora spotting , and seal pups appear in March .

Where to go : The best places to visit are Ile Bonaventure , with the largest gannet colony in North America and good summer seal - and whale-watching ; Iles de la Madeleine , where you can take a helicopter tour to see harp and hooded seal pups in March ; Baie Comeau for diving , and the road to Goose Bay for Arctic scenery , wildlife and the Manicouagan Crater .

Ranch Karanambu , Guyana

This is my favorite corner of the Amazon , where I studied caimans in 2007 , and it 's beautifully preserved . It has miles upon miles of Victoria regia water lily-covered lakes , pristine forests , tranquil rivers and lush savannahs .

Where to go : Karanambu Lodge is a private reserve with almost no hunting , so monkeys , birds , giant otters , anteaters and other wildlife are tame and easy to watch .

10 ultimate adventures around the United States

Etosha National Park , Namibia

Etosha is my favorite place in Africa to see wildlife . It 's especially good if you have kids because it 's easily accessible ; the camps are very comfortable and safe ; there 's a big store with all kinds of supplies and the animals are always present in huge numbers .

Where to go : In August and September you can sit on a bench facing a watering hole , and watch countless herds of antelopes , zebras , elephants , giraffes and other animals walk in from the desert . It 's a better wildlife spectacle than the more popular Serengeti migration .

Masoala Peninsula , Madagascar

Madagascar has so much biodiversity that biologists think of it as a small continent rather than a big island . Masoala has the largest remaining lowland rainforest there , still relatively pristine and containing a lot of yet undescribed plants and animals , as well as the most beautiful lemurs , the weirdest geckos and chameleons the size of a match .

Where to go : Visit Masoala National Park , where you can arrange a variety of hikes , walking tours or overnight camping trips .

Chukchi Peninsula , Russia

Chukotka is one of my favorite places to watch animals in Russia . The remotest and most fascinating part of Siberia , I explored it as a student during summer breaks , then led bird-watching tours there .

Where to go : The gateway to the peninsula is the city of Anadyr , where you can snorkel with beluga whales and see lots of rare birds just outside the airport . There is almost no infrastructure , but if you manage to get away from populated areas , it 's wonderful .

6 places where cats outshine tourist attractions

Karakoram Highway , China/Pakistan

The world 's most scenic road , Karakoram Highway crosses an area of stunning cultural diversity . It is not always safe to visit , but whenever it 's safe , it 's a great adventure . I explored the Chinese side in 1993 during a four-month hitchhiking trip around China and visited the Pakistani part in 2004 to look for the woolly flying squirrel , the largest and rarest squirrel in the world . I eventually found it one magical winter night in the snow-covered forests of Nanga Parbat , the westernmost Himalayan peak .

Where to go -LRB- if you dare -RRB- : This is n't always a safe trip . From the Pakistani part of the road , I like to travel to Nanga Parbat Base Camp ; to ancient castles of Hunza Valley ; or up one of the numerous glaciers that terminate near the highway . In China , the area between Muztagata and Kungur Peaks has several lakes with splendid views of both peaks , and a camp where you can stay in a Kyrgyz yurt . The border crossing area is a nature reserve with lots of ibex , giant Marco Polo sheep and snow leopards . The Chinese side of the nature reserve is Taxkorgan Nature Reserve . The Pakistani side is Khunjerab National Park .

Afar Desert , Ethiopia

Perhaps the world 's hottest desert , Afar is also difficult and dangerous for travelers . Afar is also known as the place where the Earth 's crust is breaking as Africa is slowly drifting away from Asia . I made a side trip there while crisscrossing Ethiopia in search of crocodile study sites .

Where to go -LRB- if you dare -RRB- : It has a boiling lava lake in the crater of Erta Ale Volcano , the world 's weirdest hot springs at Dallol Volcano and beautiful waterfalls hidden in remote canyons . Looking for these watering holes in a roadless desert is a fun game of treasure hunt , but you can die if you fail . Plan accordingly .

Democratic Republic of Congo

Africa 's most biologically diverse country , it 's full of mysterious wildlife such as bonobos , okapis , African peacocks and hero shrews . Large animals keep being discovered there , but some , such as the aquatic genet , have never been observed in the wild . I 've been at the edges of this fascinating realm , and hope to explore it thoroughly someday .

Where to go -LRB- if you dare -RRB- : Virunga National Park has a boiling lava lake and both lowland and mountain gorillas . Ituri Forest has okapis and other rarities and Itombwe Mountains has lots of unique plants and animals . But keep in mind the violent political conflict in the Congo makes it a difficult place to visit for tourists .
