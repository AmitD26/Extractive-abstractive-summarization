Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Justice Department plans to expand a ban on ethnic and religious profiling in federal investigations , ending an exemption for national security investigations , sources tell CNN .

But the Obama administration 's plans to have a government-wide policy are on hold because the Department of Homeland Security wo n't adopt the new rules for its agencies , which include Immigration and Customs Enforcement .

In a concession to national security officials , the new Justice Department rules also still would allow federal agents to recruit informants based on ethnic data .

The DHS exemption is a major concession for Obama administration officials and some supporters in Congress who have sought a broader ban on profiling .

The new rules are nearing completion after nearly five years of internal debate , and the Justice Department is expected to announce them in the coming weeks . Two U.S. law enforcement officials familiar with the changes described them to CNN .

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke out against profiling in a recent visit to Ferguson , Missouri , citing his own experience as a young prosecutor when police stopped him in Washington 's Georgetown neighborhood .

The new Justice Department policy would expand the profiling ban to include religion , national origin , sexual orientation and gender .

The Los Angeles Times reported Friday on the near completion of the profiling rules .

The many challenges or replacing Eric Holder

The new policy replaces one put in place in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , which exempted national security investigations from guidelines that generally prohibit profiling .

Holder , who announced plans to resign last week , has made civil rights issues a major part of his legacy .

As Holder pushed for changes to the profiling policy , he faced pushback from the FBI , which reports to him , and ultimately from DHS .

Some FBI agents have said the changes will make their work harder to carry out . But in the end the bureau decided it could live with changes that permit certain agents to target certain communities for recruitment of informants .

Farhana Khera , executive director of Muslim Advocates and a supporter of a broader ban on profiling , says allowing Homeland Security agencies to continue under the old policy would raise concerns .

`` After 9/11 the pendulum has swung too far , '' she said , citing experiences of Muslims , including American citizens , who are questioned at ports of entry . `` There 's been a pattern of incidents in recent years , '' she said .

A Homeland Security official said the agency continues to work with the Justice Department to produce the new profiling policy .
