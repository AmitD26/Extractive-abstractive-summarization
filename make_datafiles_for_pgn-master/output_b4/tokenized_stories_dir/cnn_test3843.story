-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Solange Knowles still is n't saying what prompted her elevator confrontation with her brother-in-law , Shawn `` Jay Z '' Carter , but she will tell you one thing :

She 's at peace about it .

The 28-year-old singer and younger sister of Forbes ' world power Beyonce talks about the altercation in the August issue of Lucky magazine . Without going into detail about the brouhaha , which was caught on elevator surveillance video and dropped a bomb on Beyonce 's otherwise composed and inaccessible public persona , Solange says that she 's not dwelling on the past .

`` What 's important is that my family and I are all good , '' the younger Knowles says . `` What we had to say collectively was in the statement that we put out , and we all feel at peace with that . ''

The now-infamous standoff occurred after the Met Gala on May 5 , when Solange , Beyonce and Jay Z were seen leaving New York City 's Standard Hotel . As security footage released by TMZ showed , Solange Knowles appeared to attack her brother-in-law , taking several swings at him and kicking , while her sister stood calmly next to her .

The speculation surrounding the private moment could fill a book -LRB- or three -RRB- , and in response , the Knowles-Carter family addressed the rumors with a statement declaring their unity .

'' -LRB- T -RRB- he most important thing is that our family has worked through it , '' the statement said of the `` unfortunate incident . ''

`` Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred . They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public . They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward ... At the end of the day , families have problems and we 're no different . ''

In the aftermath of the video , much of the gossip zeroed in on Knowles ' relationship with her sister , as the curious public watched closely for signs of either sibling discord or solidarity .

Yet according to Knowles , she and her sister have held tight to the values that were instilled in them as kids , to love and protect one another through anything .

`` We 've always held each other down no matter what , '' Knowles tells Lucky magazine . `` That 's something I 'm drilling into -LRB- my son -RRB- Julez now . ''
