-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Through sweat , toil and sacrifice , you built your business into a success . Things are looking good . But suddenly , a horrific terrorist group emerges that calls itself the same name as your company .

Do you : A -RRB- Change the name of your business ? B -RRB- Sue the terrorist group for trademark infringement ? C -RRB- Keep your name and hope customers do n't get spooked ?

Businesses across the United States are facing this very dilemma because the word `` ISIS '' is part of their corporate name or product .

According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , more than 270 products or business names among active federal trademarks use `` ISIS . '' They range from pharmaceutical companies to wig makers to phone apps .

OK , so nobody is going for option `` B. '' The most common reaction from business owners is option `` A , '' dropping the ISIS reference . The latest and most visible example is from the hit FX cartoon series , `` Archer . ''

Over the weekend , the show 's creator , Adam Reed , announced that the series would no longer use `` ISIS '' as the acronym for the spy agency `` International Secret Intelligence Service , '' which employs the show 's main characters . Reed , who plans to come up with a story line to justify the name change for next season , commented that ISIS is `` the most awful thing and we did n't want to have anything to do with it . ''

FX has even decided to stop selling ISIS hats and shirts . Of course , you can still get them on eBay .

Just a few months ago , the mobile payment service known as `` Isis Wallet , '' a joint venture with AT&T , T-Mobile and Verizon , changed its name to `` Softcard '' in order `` to avoid confusion and association with a violent Islamic militant group . ''

Small businesses are also being affected . In Queens , New York , the owner of the `` ISIS Hookah CafÃ © '' told the Daily News that he wants to change his name but ca n't afford the costs -- a new sign , documents and all .

This is not just an American problem . Last week the owners of `` CafÃ © ISIS '' in the United Kingdom felt compelled to change their restaurant 's name .

But , OK , can we all take a breath here ? Both business owners and consumers .

Who actually looks at the name of a business with the word ISIS in it and thinks : `` Wow , that terrorist group from the Middle East now opened up a cafe in the neighborhood ! '' Or believes that a new app that helps you pay your bills is part of a terrorist group 's dastardly plan ?

And , yes , I know ISIS is a heinous organization . So understandably , the word ISIS causes a negative visceral reaction . But we need to let fear give way to intellect and not punish American business owners .

Think of the Egyptian goddess Isis -- or the Bob Dylan song from the `` Desire '' album . Or the 1970s children 's TV show the `` Shazam ! - Isis Hour . '' The word Isis should conjure up mythology , not mayhem .

Perhaps an easy answer is for the media to universally start using the name ISIL instead of ISIS . -LRB- My apologies to any `` ISIL CafÃ © '' owners out there . -RRB- That would be accurate because ISIL stands for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . Plus President Obama and many media outlets already use ISIL , including Reuters and the Associated Press .

But what I really hope happens is that more businesses follow the lead of the California company , ISIS Pharmaceuticals , which is keeping its name . As a spokesman for the drug company told The Daily Mail : `` We 've been around for awhile . '' People `` can easily distinguish between us and a Middle Eastern terrorist group . ''

So my advice is , if your company or product is called ISIS , keep the name . Why allow a terrorist group to tell you what you can call your business ?

He asks : Do you change the name because it 's tainted or hope customers do n't care ?

Obeidallah : Many business owners are dropping the reference , but why ?

@highlight

He says terrorists should n't determine a company name , and people are n't that dumb
