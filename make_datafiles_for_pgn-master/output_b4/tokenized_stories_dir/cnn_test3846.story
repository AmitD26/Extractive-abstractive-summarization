-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fox News contributor and Republican as of 2012 , black actress Stacey Dash proves she really was n't acting in the movie `` Clueless . '' Appearing on Fox News ' `` Hannity '' show , Dash called all black people in Louisiana government freeloaders who do n't work .

Sean Hannity asked Dash : `` Has voting with Obama 95 % of the time and Obamacare , has that helped the minority community in Louisiana ? ''

`` No , not at all . It still keeps them stuck . They 're getting money for free . They feel worthless . They 're uneducated . I mean , as long as you are that way , they can keep you under their control ... ''

`` They have a plantation mentality , '' Dash said . `` As long as they give you this much money , you 'll stay right there . You do n't need to know too much because if you do , you might start thinking for yourself . ''

I think Stacey Dash needs to get out more , perhaps visit Louisiana and the rest of America and see that all blacks , myself included , certainly do n't feel `` worthless '' under President Barack Obama 's administration .

Whether Democratic or Republican , scores of black people -- Oprah Winfrey , Allen West , Condoleezza Rice , Ben Carson , Shelby Steele , Bill Cosby , Robin Roberts , and many many others -- are highly educated , gainfully employed , paying their bills and frankly doing quite well . Dash is one of them .

Many black people may want Obama to provide more productive policies , but to suggest , as Dash does , that blacks are largely `` uneducated '' and `` getting money for free '' is a racist narrative that conservatives need to stop perpetuating . That kind of talk is an offensive nonstarter in getting blacks to consider voting Republican . So is the often repeated meme by some black conservatives that blacks `` have a plantation mentality . ''

Whether you 're white or black , it 's never cool to invoke metaphors of slavery , which was a gruesome , painful institution protected by Democrats in America that went on way too long . Conservatives should remind Americans of the history of slavery and how the Democratic Party perpetuates policies of paternalism that do n't benefit blacks .

The `` Hannity '' segment was about the Louisiana Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republicans Bill Cassidy and Rob Maness . Dash and other guests discussed how blacks in Louisiana have voted for Landrieu since electing her in 1997 but have not benefited from it .

Black Republican Deroy Murdock gave a much more reasoned commentary on why black people need to reconsider their blind allegiance to Democrats . Referring to an ad produced by black Republican Louisiana State Sen. Elbert Guillory focusing on Landrieu 's record with blacks , Murdock said :

`` I think state Sen. Guillory has done a tremendous job and service , by asking in this ad a very basic question : What have the Democrats done for us lately ? Black folks show up and vote 95 % for Obama , 95 % for Landrieu and ... what do you get ? Eighteen years of poverty under Mary Landrieu in Louisiana . ''

Murdock said that under Obama 's presidency , black poverty and dependence on food stamps has increased and home ownership has declined . Fact-based comments such as Murdock 's raise eyebrows and invite blacks voting for the Democratic Party to consider voting for Republicans .

Dash 's comments are insulting and give blacks another reason to tune out the GOP and not take our party seriously .
