Editor 's note : Deepak Chopra is the co-founder of the Chopra Foundation and author of `` Spiritual Solutions : Answers to Life 's Greatest Challenges '' , reveals how to find our inner strength .

-LRB- Oprah.com -RRB- -- In an ideal world , the title of this article would be `` 5 Ways to Feel More Powerful . '' But as things stand , many people feel powerless , and the social trends that drain personal power only grow stronger .

Whether you struggle due to the recession , a controlling spouse , or the anonymity of routine work , it 's crucial to find a way to limit that feeling in your day-to-day life .

Before talking about power , let 's clarify what power is n't . It is n't a force that you use like a weapon to get your own way . It is n't a suppression of what you do n't like about yourself to achieve a perfect ideal that does n't exist in the first place .

It is n't money , status , possessions , or any other material surrogate . There are countless people sitting in the lap of luxury who feel even more powerless than the average person does .

This is so because the issues of power are all `` in here , '' where you relate to yourself . Now we can address the five things that help conquer that feeling of powerlessness .

1 . Stop giving away your power .

Becoming powerless does n't happen in a single dramatic stroke , like the barbarian hordes breaking down your door and burning your house . It 's a process , and for most people , the process is so gradual that they do n't notice it .

They are more than happy , in fact , to give away their power by degrees . Why ? Because being powerless seems like an easy way to be popular , accepted , and protected .

Thus you are giving away your power when you please others in order to fit in . Or when you follow the opinions of the crowd . Or when you decide that others matter more than you do . Or when you let someone who seems to have more power take charge of you .

It can often seem right -- or proper -- o sit modestly in the background , holding accepted opinions , living for your children , or letting a controlling spouse run roughshod over you in order to keep the peace .

In small and large ways , however , these kinds of decisions reduce your sense of self-worth , and without self-worth , you can not rid yourself of your powerlessness .

2 . Examine why it 's `` good '' to be a victim .

Once you start chipping away at your self-worth , it 's a short step to becoming a victim . I define being a victim as engaging in `` selfless pain . '' In other words , by telling yourself that you do n't really count , you can make the suffering you endure into a kind of virtue , as all martyrs do .

It 's `` good '' when you serve a higher spiritual purpose -- or so some religion suggest but what if there is no higher purpose ?

Most victims feel good about worrying all the time , but worry makes you far more vulnerable to bad things in general , since worry is so all-consuming that the mind is n't free and alert enough to tell real threats from imaginary ones . Worry feels like a protection -- when it is exactly the opposite .

Victims find lots of other `` good '' reasons for their plight . They are forgiving of an abusive spouse , because forgiveness is considered spiritual . They enable an addict , because tolerance and acceptance of others is equally spiritual .

But if you stand back , you 'll see that victims in such situations are deliberately bringing suffering upon themselves , which not only confirms their powerlessness , it encourages it to grow and grow . The victim is always being acted upon .

There are enough abusers , addicts , rage-aholics , control freaks , and petty tyrants out there to drain the power from anyone who volunteers to play the role of victim .

Having given away too much of themselves , the first step for victims is to realize that their role is voluntary . They are not trapped by fate , destiny , or the will of God . Their role is a personal choice , and they can chose differently . Unleash the Magnificent , Unstoppable Energy Inside You

3 . Develop your core self .

Human beings are the only creatures who do not mature automatically . A baby chick has no choice but to turn into a chicken . But the world is full of people stuck in childhood and adolescence , no matter how old they happen to be .

For us , to mature is a decision : Adulthood is an achievement , one that requires -- and results in -- personal power .

This can takes decades , but it starts with a vision of the `` core self . '' This is the part of you that connects to reality , placing you at the center of experiences that you personally create . To have a core self is to be the author of your own story ; it is the exact opposite of being a victim , who must live a life authored by others .

4 . Align yourself with the flow of evolution , or personal growth .

Once you establish your core self as a goal , your path will unfold and you will evolve . This evolution is wobbly at first ; everyone has at least some elements of ignorance and immaturity . But ' Â ` thanks to free will , you can help guide your own evolution .

The simple fact is that we all desire more and better things for ourselves . If those more and better things are good for our growth , then we are guiding our own positive and powerful evolution . In India they make a distinction between dharma and adharma .

Dharma includes whatever naturally upholds life : happiness , truth , duty , virtue , wonder , worship , reverence , appreciation , nonviolence , love , self-respect .

On the other hand , adharma consists of choices that do not support life naturally : anger , violence , fear , control , dogmatism , skepticism , unvirtuous acts , prejudice , addiction , intolerance , and unconsciousness in general .

For our purposes , dharma is the ultimate power . It easily supports you , a single individual . What is asked of you is that you honestly look at your everyday life and the choices you are making . Ask yourself how to increase the dharmic choices and decrease the adharmic ones .

5 . Trust in a power that transcends everyday reality .

Nothing described so far will come true without a higher reality . For the moment , let 's leave aside religion and any reference to God .

Fortunately , to have even a speck of consciousness is to be connected to the finite consciousness that supports life , evolution , creativity , and intelligence . None of these things are accidental or a privilege handed out to the lucky few .

To use a metaphor , imagine that you are caught in a net . All nets have holes , so find one , and jump through it . I 've known wives of abusive husbands who found a hole through , say , learning to paint .

For them , it was an escape route , and as they made art , their thinking changed from `` I am trapped and can do nothing '' to `` I must be worth more than I imagined , because look at this beautiful thing I created . '' Escape routes exist along the qualities hidden in consciousness . They include :

Creativity . Go beyond by discovery and exploration . This leads to insight . Your inner vision clears . You start to see glimmers of light through the fog of your situation . Something more beautiful starts to attract you , and you want to go toward it .

Intelligence . Let your mind lead the way . You start having newer , more exciting thoughts than the old habitual ones you 've been following . Beliefs are challenged . New points of view attract you , so you move toward them . You 'll want to expand your mind in place of living behind defenses and boundaries .

Love and compassion . Discover that you can forgive yourself and others . Fantasies of hurt and revenge are replaced with emotional softening .

You see that there is untapped love around you , so you move toward it . The fact that you desire to love and be loved starts to motivate you , without excuses about being unworthy .

Quantum leaps . Notice -- and learn -- when you have an epiphany , a moment of dramatic awakening . These are the great `` aha '' experiences that peel away an entire layer of reality . We say that the heavens open , but really it 's a new level of consciousness , one that brings more light .

Devotion . Understand that life is full of awe and wonder . From this you see a reason to revere your own existence . You have been placed in a world where you can be devoted to something , and your worship gives you a sense of worth .

These escape routes all lead back to the person you really are , and that person know that what really counts extends far beyond the individual : the glory of creation , the beauty of nature , the heart qualities of love and compassion , the mental power to discover new things , and those unexpected epiphanies that bring the presence of God -- these universal aspects are your true source of power . They are you , and you are all of them .
