-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Fanny Smith lines up at the start gates in Sochi later this month , she will do so with form and , perhaps , the fates in her favor .

As the reigning women 's ski cross world champion , the 21-year-old will be one of the favorites for gold , but it 's a minor miracle that she is racing at all .

In December 2011 , at the start of the World Cup season , the Swiss athlete suffered a serious knee injury .

`` I broke everything -- my MCL -LRB- medial collateral ligament -RRB- , LCL -LRB- lateral collateral ligament -RRB- , two meniscus in the front of the knee , '' she told CNN 's Human to Hero series .

There was worse news to come when the knee surgeon walked into her room following the operation .

`` He said , ` Fanny , I think you ca n't ski anymore . I think racing is finished for you , '' she recalls .

It was a brutal assessment , but it did n't deter Smith -- who used it as the catalyst for the start of a remarkable recovery .

`` I was so upset . But in my head I said to myself , ` You will see next year and shut your mouth ! ' ''

Eleven long months followed but , with the help of staff at the University of Lausanne , Smith 's defied her doctor 's predictions , returning to action with renewed vigor at the start of the 2012-13 season .

`` Everybody says , after an injury you become more strong . It 's completely true . After my injury was the best season of my life , '' she says .

Smith won the first three races of the year and four overall . With a total of six podiums from 10 starts , she cruised to her first ski cross World Cup title before capping her incredible comeback with gold at the world championships in Voss , Norway last March .

`` You know , being world champion is something on one day , so that 's really , really tough . But to win the other cup , the Crystal Globe -LRB- the prize for the top ranked ski cross racer throughout a season -RRB- , it 's like you 've been carrying on your good races , race after race . So it 's more satisfying , '' she says .

Child 's play

Ski cross -- a madcap race between four skiers over a narrow 1,000-meter course containing turns , jumps and bumps -- made its debut at the 2010 Winter Olympics , seven years after it became an official International Ski Federation discipline .

`` I 'm not old , but it feels like when you are a kid and you race your friends to the car -- the first to this , the first to that . In ski cross , it 's actually completely that , it 's who comes down first , '' Smith says .

She strapped on her first set of skis at the age of two , growing up on the slopes of Gryon and Villars in the Swiss Alps , and tried ski cross for the first time when she was 12 .

`` I fell in love with the sport , '' she says . `` It was the perfect combination of what I like -- alpine spirit and freestyle . You have so many things to do . ''

In 2006 , aged 14 , she won a place at a Swiss sports school in Brig-Glis -- a popular destination with winter sport athletes -- and it was n't long before she began seriously thinking about becoming a professional ski crosser .

`` The first time I actually decided I wanted to ski cross was at a race in Switzerland . It was the day -LRB- November 28 , 2006 -RRB- that ski cross was accepted into the Olympic Games in Vancouver , '' she says .

'' -LRB- Me and my dad -RRB- were up in a gondola and he asked me , ` Fanny , do you want to go to the Olympic Games ? ' So , like a young kid , I was like , ` Yes ! I want to go , ' but you do n't really know what it means . ''

Switzerland had a ski cross team at that time but it was impossible for Smith to commit full time .

`` I was almost the youngest girl to start ski cross -- they could n't carry me . I had no driving license and my parents worked so they could n't drive me everywhere , '' she said .

Sochi : The numbers game

Undeterred , her father set about finding sponsors and a trainer , and by the time she was 16 Smith was part of the Swiss national team . A year later in 2009 , she entered her first World Cup race . It was n't all plain sailing .

`` I broke a tooth so , you know , it was fun . I was laughing and I was like so happy with a big smile . My dad said , ` Are you okay ' and I was like , ` Yes ! I love it ! I want to continue . ''

With her gleaming smile restored , Smith did n't have to wait long before she had secured her first podium . A second place at a World Cup event in Lake Placid in January 2010 was followed by a maiden victory at Innichen/San Candido , Italy the following December .

In between those results , a 17-year-old Smith skied to a seventh place finish in Vancouver -- but fast forward four years and she will be gunning for gold at Sochi Rosa Khutor Extreme Park when the women 's ski cross starts on February 21 .

`` I think the big pressure is from the media and your country and after for me , '' she says . `` I 'm just trying to , you know , be myself , enjoy the present moment of being in the Olympic Games and do my best . ''

Surprisingly , for someone who has spent half a lifetime up a mountain , she draws inspiration from a sporting hero who hails from lower altitudes .

`` I really like the spirit of Roger Federer . It 's not because he 's Swiss , it 's just because I think it is so incredible how he can be at the top and be so good for a long time and have not so much injury , '' she says .

`` He needs to know his body so well . When he 's old he will have a good body and not be in pain . So , I think he 's someone who 's done everything right . ''

Much like the great tennis champion , Smith , it seems , manages to combine a competitive edge -- `` I like to win '' -- with a more relaxed outlook on life away from the frantic twists and turns of the ski cross circuit .

`` I try to always be positive , '' she says . `` Just live your life 100 % and have no regrets . ''
