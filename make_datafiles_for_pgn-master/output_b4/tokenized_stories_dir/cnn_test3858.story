-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Great evil often brings out the best in good men , men like Todd Beamer on Flight 93 , Medal of Honor recipient Michael Murphy in Afghanistan and now the Aurora three -- the three young men , each in different parts of theater nine , who gave their lives to protect their girlfriends .

Twenty-five-year-old Jon Blunk was sitting next to his girlfriend , Jansen Young , at the midnight premiere of `` The Dark Knight Rises '' when the gunman -LRB- who shall remain nameless -RRB- opened fire in the dark theater . Blunk instinctively pushed his girlfriend to the ground and threw his body on top of hers . Blunk , a security guard , served five years in the Navy and was in the process of re-enlisting in hopes of becoming a Navy SEAL , family and friends said . He was killed in the gunfire ; his girlfriend survived .

Twenty-four-year-old Alex Teves dived on top of his girlfriend , Amanda Lindgren , when the gunfire erupted . Covering her body , he took the bullets so they did not harm her . She survived the massacre ; he did not .

Matt McQuinn , 27 years old , threw his body in front of his girlfriend , Samantha Yowler , as the shooting continued . Yowler survived with a gunshot wound to the knee ; McQuinn 's body absorbed the fatal shots .

These men were three of the 12 innocent people killed early that morning . Their incredible sacrifice leaves us asking : Why ? Why would a young man with his entire life ahead of him risk everything for a woman he has no legal , financial or marital obligations to ?

Opinion : Looking into the minds of killers

As Hanna Rosin so eloquently pointed out in a recent article , calling it chivalry would be a tremendous understatement . By all appearances , these men believed that a man has a responsibility to protect a woman , even to the point of death . They believed that there are things in life worth dying for and the innocent woman sitting next to them was one .

They believed , to put it simply , in a code of honor . They put the lives of the women before their own , an old fashioned notion to be sure , but certainly an honorable one -LRB- if you have any doubt , ask the survivors -RRB- . Their instincts were to protect , not run away .

Remembering the Colorado shooting victims

From all accounts , these young men were average , working men in their 20s . -LRB- We know a little about Jon Blunk , but not much , and we know even less about the others . -RRB- Like all men , they had their own struggles . After his death we learned that Blunk had an ex-wife and two children living in Nevada . He was scheduled to visit them to resolve marital issues . This is n't to take anything away from Blunk or the other two heroes , but to illustrate that , in spite of shortcomings , men can still recognize what it means to be a good man and act like one .

Frum : Fear drives gun debate

This is especially important given the state of many men today . Record numbers of men are n't working or even looking for work . Record numbers are n't marrying or even acting as fathers to their children . These men need heroes to imitate whom they can relate to in everyday life , not just make-believe superheroes who catch their imagination for an hour or two . They need heroes like the Aurora three .

While much of the media obsesses over the psychology and motivations of this deranged killer , we should hold the Aurora three high . It is only by telling their story that this code of honor will survive for future generations of men . `` The world is forwarded by having its attention fixed on the best things , '' Matthew Arnold wrote .

In an age when traditional manhood has been increasingly relegated to fiction -- capes , masks and green screens -- these three men stand as real-life heroes . Their actions remind us that good triumphs over evil , not just in movies , but also in reality .
