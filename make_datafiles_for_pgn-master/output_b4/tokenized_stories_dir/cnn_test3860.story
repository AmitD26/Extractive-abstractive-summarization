Tokyo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the outskirts of Tokyo , behind a small government building , underneath a soccer field and skateboard park , sits a remarkable feat of engineering .

It 's an example of how Japan 's capital , which lies in a region at high risk from flooding and tropical cyclones , is trying to figure out how to contain the elements to protect its 13 million inhabitants .

The entrance , which is locked at all times , is so nondescript a visitor may walk past dozens of times without ever noticing it .

But today , we are given a tour down below of the so-called `` Water Discharge Tunnel . ''

Built between 1993 and 2006 at a cost of nearly $ 3 billion , the stunning complex is far more impressive than its name suggests .

Winding down a series of stairs , you soon come upon a massive hall , resembling an underground Parthenon , or a scene out of a science fiction film .

In pictures : Sandy 's trail of destruction

The initial water tank stretches more than 320 feet in length and towers higher than a five-story building .

When you add it all up , the complex features five massive shafts , or tanks , that are able to move water along a tunnel that stretches nearly four miles .

Special : Tokyo battles the elements

In this area of Saitama prefecture , heavy rains would often flood the Naka River Basin . But now , that valuable farmland has an incredible drain system sitting below .

When the tanks and tunnel fill , engineers are able to turn on the heart of the system , which is a series of four turbines powered by jet engines similar to those used in a Boeing 737 airplane . The turbines are then able to rapidly funnel floodwaters to the nearby Edo River .

It 's worth noting that this part of suburban Tokyo can hardly be compared to the dense underground of New York City , which is a maze of subway tunnels , sewage systems and power lines .

The engineers here are the first to point out that their system , while remarkable , is meant to deal with heavy rains -- and that it would struggle to cope with a Sandy-type storm surge coming from the Atlantic Ocean into New York 's Upper Bay .

Still , the underground marvel could inspire engineers to look for new ways to try to contain Mother Nature in the future .

Huge plugs could have spared subways from flooding , developers say
