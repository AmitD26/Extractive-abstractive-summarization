-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When David Kronmiller wakes up and sits down at his computer in the morning , he usually checks the Huffington Post , the Drudge Report , Politico and the polls on RealClearPolitics . But the day after the election , he realized he did n't need to check those polls . There were n't any .

David Kronmiller will focus on writing and filmmaking now that he does n't have election polls to check .

`` There is some sadness to that , '' said Kronmiller , a North Hollywood , California , resident who frequently contributes his views to iReport.com .

Although he supported President-elect Barack Obama since the primaries , the end of the presidential election means he wo n't have a race to follow anymore .

`` I expect serious withdrawal , like , tonight or tomorrow , '' he said Wednesday .

After two intense years of campaign ups and downs for both major U.S. political parties , the nation has finally settled on a president . Although initially , Obama 's victory brings celebrations for supporters , experts say the let-down that voters of each side may feel after the campaign is akin to postpartum depression .

`` There 's this run-up : OK , it 's nine months , and then the baby is delivered , '' said Rosalind Dorlen , a clinical psychologist in Summit , New Jersey . `` All of the waiting is over , and the focus of the attention is no longer on the pregnant woman , but there 's all kinds of feelings about the loss of the pregnancy .

`` Maybe we will have some people who will have post-election depression because they have been expectantly looking forward to this blessed event that they participated in , '' she said .

Nancy Molitor , a clinical psychologist Wilmette , Illinois , started seeing some post-election despair even before the final results came in . Some of her patients wondered what they would do with their time in the absence of polls and campaign coverage .

`` This lady is in her 80s , and she told me she 's never in her life been excited about a campaign as she is about this campaign , and she knows it 's filled this void in her life , '' she said .

Supporters of the winning candidate may feel as if they are going through withdrawal from a drug , Molitor said . They may also develop anxiety over what will change with the new president or become cynical about anything changing at all .

By contrast , someone whose favored candidate lost may go through something similar to grieving : starting with numb disbelief and then moving to anger , sadness and , eventually , recognition of the need to move on , she said .

Mourning over a lost campaign resonates with Donna Brazile , a CNN contributor who worked on Al Gore 's campaign in 2000 . In a column for CNN.com , she recalled feeling lost and disillusioned at first , and had no idea what to do with her life .

`` It hurts like hell , '' she wrote . `` It is like death of someone close to you -- the difference is no corpse or casket to help bring closure , just more election analysis and pundits spewing out what you did wrong . ''

She advises staff members , volunteers and supporters of candidates who lost on Tuesday to let out their grief : `` Grieve . Mourn . Let it out . '' Read Donna Brazile 's ` A letter to the losers '

To combat the letdown of the period after the election , Molitor advises people to put routine back into their lives . Political junkies who lost their sleeping and eating routines should get back on schedule , she said . They should also take part in community activities , such as book clubs or other interest groups .

Even supporters of winning and losing candidates may feel a little off for two weeks or more , she said .

For some , the excitement will continue for a couple of weeks , until the reality sets in that the candidates they elected wo n't be able to do anything until January , said Jana N. Martin , a licensed psychologist in Long Beach , California .

Anyone who feels depressed , hopeless or powerless after the election should realize that they as individuals have the ultimate control over their everyday lives , she said .

`` The president is not going to find you a job ; the president is not the one who manages your individual budgets , '' she said . `` If people want changes , they can do that in their day-to-day lives . They do n't need a candidate to do that . ''

Those who feel truly overwhelmed should see a psychologist who can help them think out loud , she said .

Aric Butler , a Pennsylvania State University student who supported Sen. John McCain , said he 's not upset that Obama won but does feel a sense of withdrawal .

`` I love discussing and debating politics , and now that the election is over it seems like nobody wants to discuss politics anymore , which is very disappointing -LRB- in -RRB- this short -LRB- time -RRB- after the election , '' he said in a recent e-mail .

But for some , the end of the election season brings feelings of relief . Alex Khanye , a student at California State University in Sacramento and a McCain supporter , said Thursday that he feels better now than throughout the campaign because of the bitterness and anger that it sparked in some people . A few weeks ago , when he was at a rally , someone slashed the tires of his car , which had a McCain bumper sticker .

`` We had all kind of accepted that Obama was going to win probably , for the last month for so , so it was n't like we were really that hopeful going into the election , so we had come to grips with it , at least I had , '' he said . `` I 'm ready for everything to kind of go back to normal . ''

Others say the end of the election simply means they 'll have more time to focus on other aspects of their life . Adam Sieff , a Columbia University student who supported Obama , said he 'll now have more time to concentrate on schoolwork and maintains that his `` withdrawal '' will not be of postpartum proportions .

With more free time in the absence of campaign-following , Kronmiller said he 's going to get focused on his own writing and filmmaking . iReport.com : ` Obama won -- now maybe we can move forward '

`` As -LRB- Obama -RRB- said -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- night , it 's time to get to work , and get things moving forward again , instead of all this fighting , all this resistance that we 've had , '' he said .
