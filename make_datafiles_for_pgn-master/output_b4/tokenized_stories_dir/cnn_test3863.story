-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It could be the worst mass poisoning in history . And the terrible irony is that it may all be due to an idealistic push to clean up drinking water for some of the world 's poorest people .

A new study published in British medical journal The Lancet says that up to 77 million people in Bangladesh are being exposed to toxic levels of arsenic , potentially taking years or decades off their lives .

An international team of researchers from Chicago , New York and Bangladesh followed 12,000 people over the past decade , monitoring their arsenic intake and mortality rates from contaminated wells .

By the end of the study , one in five deaths were determined to be directly related to elevated arsenic levels in their system . Stretch that over the entire population that takes its water from wells , and the impact is daunting .

The problem has been known about for years , if not the overall deadly impact .

As far back as a decade ago , the World Health Organization called it `` the largest mass poisoning of a population in history ... beyond the accidents at Bhopal , India , in 1984 , and Chernobyl , Ukraine , in 1986 . ''

Well-meaning development groups had encouraged remote villages across Bangladesh to dig wells over the past decades , rather than rely on potentially contaminated surface water and dirty rivers . But now potentially a much worse problem has been found far below the surface .

Arsenic is a deadly poison with a history of use in intrigue and assassination . Some have even theorized that Napoleon Bonaparte succumbed to long term poisoning with the substance by his enemies while in exile on the island of St. Helena .

But the element and its derivatives are also used in many industries , such as metal smelting and as a component in products ranging from insecticide to micro-chips .

And unfortunately , it is also found in abundance in the soil and rock in Bangladesh . It 's leached up through the water table in tens of millions of water wells across the country .

The study showed that the top quarter of those exposed had a 70 percent higher mortality rate than would be expected in the population as a whole .

The authors hope for more study , and a long term plan to deal with the damage already done . But a solution for those already poisoned may remain decades away .

Other long term health studies have shown it takes 20 years for the negative morbidity effects of arsenic poisoning to dissipate , even after they stopped using contaminated wells .
