-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Liane Moriarty knows playground politics . The Australian author features catty mothers , birthday party snubs and a debauched parental gathering in her latest novel , `` Big Little Lies . ''

Moriarty is familiar with those dynamics herself : she is a hands-on mother to a 4-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son . While Moriarty says her characters come from her imagination , she 's managed to strike a collective nerve among readers around the world .

Her latest bestselling book also turned the heads of Hollywood moms : Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon optioned screen rights to `` Big Little Lies . '' The novel opens with a school scandal , then traces three families through a tumultuous kindergarten year . Anyone who has picked up young children from elementary school will recognize the characters and conversations in `` Big Little Lies . ''

Many of Moriarty 's novels are book club favorites , and not just in her native Sydney . Her novel `` The Husband 's Secret '' sold more than 1 million copies in the United States . She spoke to CNN about putting parenting onto the pages of her novels . Below is an edited transcript .

CNN : How are you able to replicate conversations that so many parents have ?

LM : I guess it just means that we 're all having the same kinds of conversations across the world ... that they 're universal . And , obviously , because I 'm completely in that world right now , it 's really easy to think like that , because that 's the life I 'm leading .

CNN : Did you have any of those conversations ?

LM : They 're still fictional . Although , there might be little phrases taken from real life , but they 're still all fiction . Because it 's my world , the material is at my fingertips .

CNN : How do you find inspiration for your plots and your characters ?

LM : I was inspired by a little story a girlfriend told me when her daughter started school . On the very first day of kindergarten , two little girls came out of the classroom , and they had bite marks on their arms . Because it was the first day of school , no one could say who had done it . They just said a little boy had done it to them .

They actually got the little boys to line up . When this girlfriend was telling me the story , I was just so enthralled by the little drama that went on in the playground , and imagining how you would feel if you were one of the parents , hoping that it was n't your child that had actually done the biting . In the end , the little girls finally gave in and admitted they had bitten themselves . It 's little stories like that -LRB- which inspire me -RRB- .

People tell stories of awful parents , and bullying parents . And you can definitely see the potential , because you do love your child so fiercely . Because it is a little bit like going back to school yourself . It brings out all those insecurities . When all the parties started , and sometimes , I remember hearing about certain parties , thinking , ` My child was n't invited . What does that mean ? ' All those things come out . It 's easy to collect on that material .

CNN : Have you been surprised by how your books have transcended cultural boundaries ?

LM : I think as parents , we 're all leading similar sorts of lives . So really , the differences are small . And I think they 're differences that readers quite enjoy , in the same way that I enjoy reading books set in the U.S. . There are things like trick or treating and Halloween , and little things like that . They 're a pleasure to read , but easy enough to understand , so you do n't feel alienated .

CNN : What are you working on now ?

LM : I 'm just in the very early stages of my next novel . I 've been joking a lot that my next novel will be set on a tropical island . And I 'll have to lots of research to get the setting right . The more I joke , the more I 've started to think , ` Actually , that could work . ' Because I often like to set my books in a confined setting , a little village ... . That 's why a school works so well , because you can control it . So why not a tropical island ?

CNN : Has your success changed the way other parents treat you ?

LM : They tease me . My husband was taking some time off , and announcing he was going to do some more of the pick-ups -LRB- from school -RRB- . And somebody was saying , ` Will you still do some of the pick-ups ? ' Somebody else was saying , ` Of course she will . She needs us for her material . ' They just seem happy for me . It 's not like I 'm a film star . It 's not especially glamorous .
