Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An American man has been arrested in Israel for allegedly acquiring explosives stolen from Israel 's military that he planned to use to attack Muslim holy sites , Israeli authorities said Tuesday .

According to Shin Beit , Israel 's internal security service , Adam Livix , 30 , was arrested in November under suspicion of possessing explosives with the intent of using them in a terrorist attack .

He was taken into custody with `` various types of ammunition and explosives stolen from the IDF '' and admitted under interrogation that he had made preliminary surveys of potential targets , Shin Beit announced Tuesday .

Livix had come to the region in 2013 from his native United States , where he was been wanted for suspected drug felonies , the Israeli security service reports .

The Christian man lived in the Palestinian-controlled West Bank communities of Hebron and Bethlehem , where Shin Beit claims that he rebuffed a Palestinian activist 's solicitation to assassinate President Barack Obama during the U.S. leader 's visit to Israel .

Livix then moved into Israel -- spending more than one year there illegally , since his entry permit expired in September 2013 , according to prosecutors .

In Israel , Livix `` falsely presented himself as a Navy SEAL '' -- an elite U.S. military special operation unit -- and `` dealt with various criminal activities and came up with ideas for a variety of terrorist attacks , '' Shin Beit said .

Livix also `` expressed ... his negative opinion of the Arab population of Israel and his wish to harm sites in Israel holy to Islam , '' Israel 's Justice Ministry said .

The ministry added that , in October , the American man asked his roommate -- an Israeli soldier -- to get him explosives , even paying the soldier for them .

When police were notified and went to search the residence , Livix tried to escape by jumping from a seventh floor window to a balcony a floor below , the ministry said . The Israeli agency added that an Israeli court ordered that Livix undergo a psychiatric examination , at his lawyer 's request .

The U.S. State Department was aware of the reports that an American had been arrested in Israel , but declined to comment on this case .

CNN 's Amir Tal and Ben Wedeman reported from Jerusalem , and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta . CNN 's Elise Labott contributed to this report .
