WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama struck down a rule Friday that prohibits U.S. money from funding international family-planning clinics that promote abortion or provide counseling or referrals about abortion services .

President Obama says he does n't want family planning to be used as a `` political wedge . ''

Obama said in a statement that family planning aid has been used as a `` political wedge issue , '' adding that he had `` no desire to continue this stale and fruitless debate . ''

The policy says any organization receiving U.S. family-planning funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development can not offer abortions or abortion counseling .

`` It is time we end the politicization of this issue , '' Obama said . `` In the coming weeks , my administration will initiate a fresh conversation on family planning , working to find areas of common ground to best meet the needs of women and families at home and around the world . ''

Obama 's memorandum reversing the policy comes the day after the 36th anniversary of Roe v. Wade . The landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision held that a woman 's right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy protected by the 14th Amendment . The ruling gave a woman autonomy over her pregnancy during the first trimester . Watch CNN 's Bill Schneider on how Obama is handling abortion issue ''

The memorandum reverses the `` Mexico City policy , '' initiated by President Reagan in 1984 , canceled by President Clinton and reinstated by President George W. Bush in 2001 .

The policy , referred to by critics as `` the global gag rule , '' was initially announced at a population conference in Mexico City .

Reversing the previous administrations ' stance on the policy was one of Clinton 's first acts as president in January 1993 and the very first executive order issued by Bush on January 22 , 2001 , the 28th anniversary of Roe v. Wade .

Critics , including Planned Parenthood , called Bush 's move a `` legislative ambush . ''

He defended his action , saying , `` It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortion or actively promote abortion . ''

The group Population Action International praised Obama 's move , saying in a statement that it will `` save women 's lives around the world . ''

`` Family planning should not be a political issue ; it 's about basic health care and well-being for women and children , '' the group said .

`` Women 's health has been severely impacted by the cutoff of assistance . President Obama 's actions will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies , abortions and women dying from high-risk pregnancies because they do n't have access to family planning . ''

Republican lawmakers were critical of the new president 's action .

`` Not even waiting a week , the new administration has acted to funnel U.S. tax dollars to abortion providers overseas , '' Rep. Tom Price , R-Georgia , said in a written statement .

`` This is a stunning reversal of course from the president 's campaign statements that he hoped to reduce the number of abortions . Just a day after thousands of Americans came to Washington to celebrate the principle of life , President Obama has made it clear that reducing abortions is not one of his priorities . ''

In his statement , however , Obama said he had directed his staff `` to reach out to those on all sides of this issue to achieve the goal of reducing unintended pregnancies . ''

`` They will also work to promote safe motherhood , reduce maternal and infant mortality rates and increase educational and economic opportunities for women and girls . ''

The president added that he looked forward to `` working with Congress to restore U.S. financial support for the U.N. Population Fund . ''

The Bush administration has repeatedly withheld funding authorized by Congress for the U.N. fund , saying the agency has funded a forced sterilization program in China . The fund has repeatedly denied that accusation .

`` By signaling his intention to restore U.S. funding for UNFPA , the UN Population Fund , President Barack Obama is signaling his re-engagement with the international community on the critical challenge of improving reproductive health around the world , '' UN Foundation President Timothy Wirth said .

`` For the past seven years , UNFPA funding has been a victim of false accusations and misinformation that had everything to do with politics and nothing to do with sound policy , '' he said .

`` Approximately 180 industrialized and developing countries , including all the countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America , contribute to UNFPA . The United States was the only country to withhold funding for political reasons . ''
