Oscar-nominated Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou has been fined 7.48 million yuan -LRB- $ 1.2 million -RRB- for breaching China 's one-child policy , authorities say .

A letter sent to Zhang by the family planning bureau of Binhu District of Wuxi City , Jiangsu province in eastern China on Thursday demanded that he pay a penalty for having two `` beyond-the-quota '' children .

The letter was posted on the district 's official account on Sina Weibo , China 's Twitter-like microblogging service .

The fine comes after Zhang apologized in an open letter for his `` excessive children '' in December . He and his wife , Chen Ting , admitted to having two sons and a daughter .

`` As a film director , it takes a lot of efforts and good movies for people to remember you , but having excessive children had ruined it all , '' he said , according to Xinhua , China 's state news agency . `` I sincerely apologize to everyone on my ` excessive children ' case . I admit it 's my mistake and I wo n't blame others for it . ''

`` I will learn my lessons , and I 'm willing to cooperate with any investigation from family planning commission , '' Zhang said .

Local officials in Jiangsu province calculated the fine based on the couple 's combined annual income , the document stated . Nine investigation teams had been sent to `` collect evidence '' since November .

The couple have to pay the fine within 30 days of receiving the letter , local authorities added .

Zhang 's case comes after China adopted new rules to ease its one-child policy in December .

The Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress passed a resolution to allow couples to have two children if one of the parents was an only child , according to Xinhua .

Previously , a couple was only allowed a second child if both of them were only children .

However , Zhang , best known for movies such as `` Red Sorghum , '' `` Raise the Red Lantern , '' and `` Hero , '' is unlikely to benefit from the change .

Zhang 's breach of the policy has set off a firestorm , especially among some netizens who resent how the rich and famous in China flout rules and policies .

`` Is this really a huge sum ? Do you people know how much he makes from a single film ? Some are saying that the fines are too heavy . All I can say is that this is nothing to him , '' Sina Weibo user __ 729 _ wrote on China 's equivalent of Twitter .

But Zhang also had his defenders .

`` Zhang is a good fellow , '' wrote Sarah2007 on Sina Weibo .

`` Even though the social maintenance fee is a ridiculous and shameless rip off , which no one knows what use it will be put to , he knows he has no choice , as a public figure , but to accept the fines with a with an earnest attitude . ''

The filmmaker also directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics .
