The British businessman accused of ordering a hit on his new wife while on honeymoon in South Africa will appear in a Cape Town court on Tuesday .

Shrien Dewani was returned to the country Monday by UK officials . He denies murdering Anni Dewani , 28 , in November 2010 in Cape Town .

He has avoided extradition for the past three years on mental health grounds , but upon losing his latest appeal , British authorities have agreed to return him to South Africa to stand trial .

The extradition request was approved on the proviso that if Dewani was not fit to stand trial in the next 18 months , he will be returned to the United Kingdom .

Dewani left from Bristol Airport Monday night , according to a statement issued by London 's Metropolitan Police , and is set to arrive in South Africa on Tuesday morning , local time . He is accompanied by `` representatives from the South African authorities , '' and will be taken directly to court to be formally charged when he lands . The court is due to sit at 11:30 am -LRB- local time -RRB- , a few hours after he lands .

Dewani , a millionaire care home owner , is accused of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife during a taxi ride in Cape Town in November 2010 , just over two weeks after their wedding .

Taxi driver Zola Tongo confessed within weeks of the bride 's death that he had hired two men to kill her .

In a plea deal with South African authorities , he said he was paid by Dewani to carry out the hit and to make it look as though the two were the victims of a carjacking as they were driving through a township on the edge of Cape Town . Tongo was subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in the killing . His two accomplices are also serving lengthy sentences for their part in the killing .

In their ruling , the judges at the High Court in London said there was some prospect that Dewani could recover sufficiently to be fit to stand trial . He has been apparently suffering from mental health conditions , including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder . Until his extradition , he had been held at Fromeside Hospital , a secure mental health unit in Bristol .

Upon arrival in South Africa , he is likely to be transferred to the bleak , prison-like Valkenberg hospital , a high security psychiatric facility in Cape Town .

The family of the victim has welcomed the ruling . Speaking at a news conference , her brother , Anish Hindocha said , `` It 's been very difficult . There is no life in our family any more , we struggle very much . With the help of the South African people , with the help of the British people , we are at least trying to cope ... we need justice for Anni ''
