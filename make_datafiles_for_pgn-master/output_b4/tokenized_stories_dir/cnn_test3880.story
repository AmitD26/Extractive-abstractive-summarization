-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- Most people know that condoms prevent the spread of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases -LRB- STDs -RRB- .

Unusual campaigns to promote condom use are being launched in places where condoms are less popular .

But in many parts of the world , condoms are n't very popular .

Here are five novel campaigns launched by nonprofit organizations and condom companies to encourage wider use .

1 . A ring tone to remember

In India , people stigmatize condoms and refuse to wear them because they believe only prostitutes must use prophylactics . Leave it to one of the world 's richest men to find a solution -- the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation donated money for a national condom ring tone .

An a cappella group sings `` Condom , Condom '' -- in the style of doo-wop like the contagious pop song `` Barbara Ann '' -- when one receives a phone call .

Despite its bubblegum sound , officials hope that the people who have the condom ring tone appear smart and responsible .

Since the ring tone 's August launch , more than 60,000 people downloaded it . Yvonne MacPherson , country director of the BBC World Service Trust -LRB- which the Gates foundation funded -RRB- , sums it up best when she said to The Associated Press : `` A ring tone is a very public thing . It 's a way to show you are a condom user and you do n't have any issues with it . ''

Right , nothing attracts the amorous attention like announcing loudly that you have a condom .

2 . Perks you right up

Ethiopians claim they hate condoms because the smell of latex sickens them . To combat the odor , DKT International , a United Sates nonprofit , created coffee condoms .

These dark brown condoms allegedly -LRB- I 'm not testing the products -RRB- taste and smell like the favorite coffee of Ethiopia -- the macchiato , an espresso with cream and sugar .

One college student claimed the smell reminded him of the beauty of Ethiopian women -LRB- it 's not clear if that 's a compliment -RRB- . These condoms bolster national identity because Ethiopians claim to have invented coffee . DKT International also created flavored and scented condoms for Indonesia -LRB- durian fruit -RRB- and China -LRB- sweet corn -RRB- .

3 . Condom trees

In western Australia , the rate of HIV infection is the highest in the nation . When public health nurses were looking for an effective way to distribute condoms , someone suggested trees .

Young people in the countryside hang out under trees , so the shady spots are the perfect places for nurses to hang condom-filled canisters .

Over 3,000 condoms are taken each month . Residents said grabbing condoms from trees was convenient and private .

Additionally , officials in Australia piloted programs where Aboriginal teens sold packets of condoms and kept half of the proceeds . Officials tout these programs as a success because STD rates have fallen , yet nurses wonder how they will convince people that they should n't have multiple partners .

Maybe a monogamy tree is in the Outback 's future .

4 . Scare tactics

Perhaps some safe sex programs skirt the issue -- unprotected sex causes HIV , which leads to AIDS and often death .

It 's not surprising that a condom company would resort to scare tactics . The Tulipan Company launched its `` Be Careful '' ads in Argentina .

Showing skeletons positioned in flagrante delicto , these ads make no bones about how important it is to wear a condom while engaging in coitus .

No word if the skeleton ads have had the desired impact , though the graphic skeletons appear more popular than recent Trojan ads , which depict men as swine .

5 . Spray-on protection

Since his teens , Jan Vinzenz Krause struggled to find a condom that fit correctly . He thought the pursuit of the perfect prophylactic was hopeless -- until he went to the carwash .

Inspired by the spray-on soap and wax , the German Krause developed a spray-on latex condom , which he claims always fits perfectly and feels natural .

However , many men find the design off-putting ; the spray-on condom comes in a hard phallic case .

Men slide themselves into the cylinder and layer on the latex , providing full coverage .

The Jolly Joe , as Krause dubbed it , frightened many men during the testing phase -- they only put the case on their fingers . -LRB- Spray on gloves anyone ? -RRB-

Others felt the loud hissing was n't sexy and the latex takes too long to dry -- three minutes .

Krause explains to Time , `` It needs to be ready in five to ten seconds . '' So for now , Krause is waiting for a quicker-drying latex .
