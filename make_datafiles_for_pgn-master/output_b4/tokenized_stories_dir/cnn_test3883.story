For more than a year the Sudanese government has been bombing and spreading terror in the country 's South Kordofan state , surgically cleansing the land of the Nuba people .

The government of Sudan argues it is fighting a rebellion led by the Sudan People 's Liberation Movement that engineered the secession of South Sudan . Khartoum still struggles to stomach the victory of the Southerners , brought about partly by the large number of Nuba fighters who -- after decades of marginalization and political exclusion -- joined forces with the Sudan People 's Liberation Army .

Accordingly , Khartoum treats the Nuba people as the enemy within -- a foe whose independent spirit has never been tamed

The cost : half a million people have been displaced or severely affected by the conflict , according to the U.N. 's Humanitarian Affairs office .

The most recent rash of bombings is the second time in 20 years that the Nuba people have been targets of the same Khartoum leaders -- President Omar al-Bashir and Governor Ahmed Haroun . Both men are internationally indicted war criminals , although both deny the charges .

Haroun engineered attacks against the Nuba in the 90s , refined his deadly tactics in Darfur in 2004 , and is now back pursuing his murderous agenda against the Nuba with even greater efficiency .

I traveled to Sudan bear witness , as a journalist and a Rwandan , to a people under siege , at the war-torn border between the two Sudans , one of the most isolated regions on earth .

Smuggled into the Nuba Mountains , an area closed to the world , I filmed local activists documenting the attacks being perpetrated by the Khartoum regime .

Despite being bombed several times a day since June 2011 , the activists remain nonviolent . Armed with cameras and the hope for a better tomorrow , they relentlessly scour their homeland collecting the testimonies , pictures and evidence to build up a case against their aggressors : their government .

Our team traveled to a number of villages up to 20 km from the front line . During my time in the region I experienced bombings as regimented as prison meals . We were attacked an average of three times a day . We were filming as the scale of atrocities unfolded with excruciating precision : the bombs falling , the people hiding in caves for safety , the destruction of villages , the casualties .

Every day , we experienced hunger , fear , abandonment , exhaustion and unspeakable harshness , like the Nuba people do . At a moment 's notice , we jumped in and out of foxholes and crawled in caves like they do to survive . Cramped , hot and terrified , we have seen and smelled the death of children , pregnant women and the elderly ; the destruction of villages , crops , schools , water pumps , mosques , churches and hospitals .

In the making of `` Erasing the Nuba '' we were bombed 19 times and lived to tell the story of resilience of a people harassed daily by landmines and rockets , in a region transformed into ghost towns , craters and ruins .

A lingering smell of death and growing despair ushered us out of the Nuba Mountains . Almost 63,000 Nuba have fled to the Yida refugee camp in South Sudan .

There I saw a people left to fend for themselves , a people that know they have no friends , yet determined to face their destiny with the only thing they have left : dignity .

In Yida , I attended a WFP-sponsored food distribution and saw how a 3 kg ration of USAID-produced sorghum was distributed for each family to eat until the uncertain next round of food supply .

In Yida , a mother begged me to take home with me her three-month-old baby , whom she had delivered squatted down under a tree on a rainy afternoon .

I sat with Yida 's oldest resident , a 101-year-old man who journeyed on donkey back for eight days to be reunited with one of his sons . The poor man was so disoriented that he had stopped eating and talking for days at a time . His family feared that leaving him alone might drive him to commit suicide .

In Yida I watched children sitting on the branches of a tree to follow a mathematics class as the open-air `` classroom '' was packed . It struck me to see how one adult volunteer could teach a class of children , without the use of a blackboard and chalk . There is no such thing as pens or notebooks for the thousands of children in need of an education at Yida .

Dreams for domestic reconciliation exhausted after two decades , the Nuba are holding onto the belief that `` the hearts of the international community '' woven into the fabric of our shared humanity `` will hear their cries . '' They say they have been sacrificed at the altar of peace agreements between North and South Sudan and they feel cheated by the world 's inaction .

`` Erasing the Nuba '' has captured the spirit of the Nuba people of Sudan , a minority bowed but not broken -- not by the daily hellish rain of bombs and rockets , nor by the world 's complicit silence .

But for how much longer can they prevail -- hostages of Khartoum and us , the international community ? A group of people and their way of life is being destroyed . Why are the Nuba , the heirs of a civilization that once stretched from Cairo to Lake Victoria , asked to shake hands with Haroun , and his murderous gang of `` Butchers of Khartoum '' ? Would one have asked European nations to make peace with Hitler ?

They have been forced to crawl in caves like beasts , survive on leaves and berries only to be told of a `` Sudan Fatigue . '' Unlike Assad in Syria -- bad as he is -- only one current head of state in the world is indicted officially by a due legal process : al-Bashir . Yet many in the world are advocating the removal of Assad .

Mountains of grudges and greed fuel this conflict , where humanitarian assistance is used as a pawn on the chessboard of peace negotiations .

Beneath the surface , jumbles of players -- local and foreign -- are waging a merciless war against each other for the political , economic and military control of the two Sudans . There can be no peace , no security , no stability , no settlement to this conflict as long as the blood of the Nuba children , women , men and communities will be spilled .

My family falling victim to the Rwandan genocides that started in 1994 , and a commitment to uphold the vow made by those touched by genocide the world over to `` never forget , '' inspired me to bring their story to light .

`` Erasing the Nuba '' is my testimony , as a Rwandan and a journalist , to ensure these people are never referred to in the past tense .
