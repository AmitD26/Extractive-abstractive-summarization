Ladies donning their best black dresses , cowboy boots and pearls stand alongside men wearing khakis with tucked-in button-ups and blazers . Anticipation is in the air and the fervor is growing .

This is n't a fancy event or church service . These fashionable fans are ready to kick off another college football Saturday in the South .

When the University of Alabama and the University of Missouri go head-to-head on Saturday in the Southeastern Conference championship , college fans will no doubt be dressed in their Sunday best .

Whether you are a Georgia Bulldog , a Florida Gator or you 're yelling `` Roll Tide '' after ` Bama scores a touchdown , a Saturday in the SEC normally means you 're in front of a television arguing over commentary or you 're in a stadium , cheering with your friends .

And there 's no way you 're wearing jeans and a team shirt .

We ca n't talk about the importance of fashion in the SEC and not talk about what football means to the South . It 's the game of football you hear a father explain to his son on a cool , autumn morning . And it 's football that has families gathered around the television screaming over each field goal and fumble .

Bleacher Report editor Chris Cornell says college football is a national phenomenon , but it 's like a religion down here . In the South , the added appeal of college football comes from the lack of promising professional teams .

`` Look at Florida . A team like the Dolphins does n't really get much publicity . Atlanta has the Falcons but they are n't really winning enough to keep interest , right ? '' he said .

It 's the college fandom that reaches bigger heights -- heights that come in the forms of boots , pumps and fashionable football attire .

`` We love our teams and want to support them to the best of our abilities . It 's not just about the clothes we wear , but the attitude that we carry as well , '' said Lydia Buckner , a senior at Mississippi State University , where she said game-day prep is a group affair . Buckner and her girlfriends get together to do their hair and makeup , and while the girls are in the bathroom , the guys are watching other college games and cooking out .

`` Coming together like that gets the spirit up and builds on all the excitement , '' she said .

In the South , you dress up for whatever you take pride in . And that could be anything from family dinners to a visit to grandma 's . Add a crowd and there 's all the more reason to look your best .

`` With over 100,000 people around , you never know who you 'll run into , or if you 'll end up on TV , '' said Hayley Taylor , a style blogger and recent Louisiana State University graduate . `` I would n't want to run into a friend looking my worst . ''

Game-day style has given rise to niche boutiques such as Sideline Sweetie , an online store that 's been selling trendy tailgate attire for women since 2011 . Owner Rosanne Nettles says the idea came from realizing there were n't enough places to find cute outfits in school colors that a woman could wear to a game . At the time , she owned three women 's boutique and formal wear stores in Georgia , South Carolina and North Carolina .

Women were tired of jeans and jerseys . They wanted dresses , maxi skirts , and prints galore . Trendy , not masculine .

`` Every social event is a big deal in the South . People love to dress up and we love football , '' Nettles said . `` We realized that we could not keep in stock red and black , as customers were calling from all over for Georgia and Alabama game-day apparel . As we started to introduce more navy , we noticed that Auburn fans started calling also . ''

To keep up with demand , Nettles gave the store 's `` Sideline Sweetie '' game-day collection its own brand and website . The site is busiest from July to November , with Alabama , Georgia , Auburn and Florida fans among her best customers . `` The Northern and Midwest schools are definitely our least popular , '' she said .

When it comes to dressing up for football , there are some crucial dos and do n'ts . Talk to many female college fans and they 'll give you the same advice : Keep it classy . You 're representing the entire university when you step out to tailgate . Always dress in school colors , use accessories to dress up any outfit , and above all , be smart about your footwear , Buckner says .

`` If you ca n't walk a block comfortably , you 're going to regret it -- senior to freshman advice , '' Buckner said . `` Trust me , I know those heels look supercute but your blistered feet will definitely not . You want to be able to cheer and jump without constantly worrying about a wardrobe malfunction . ''
