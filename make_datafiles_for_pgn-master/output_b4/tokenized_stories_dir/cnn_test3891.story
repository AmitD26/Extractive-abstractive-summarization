-LRB- CNN -RRB- Atletico Madrid stunned their city rivals Real after thrashing them 4-0 in what must count as one of the most humiliating derby defeats in recent memory .

The Spanish champions took a first half lead after Real 's goalkeeper Iker Casillas fumbled Tiago 's shot into his own net .

Although there was little Casillias could do about Saul Niguez 's stunning overhead kick that gave Atletico a 2-0 halftime lead .

The visitors had hoped to cement their strong position in this season 's title battle with the return of Cristiano Ronaldo , who had been suspended for two matches following a sending off last month .

But Atletico pushed on in the second half with goals from Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic sealing a historic derby day victory . Atletico are now unbeaten against Real in six matches .

Angry Ancelotti

`` It is easy to analyze this game because Atletico were better in every facet of the game : they fought more , had more quality on the ball , had better organization , everything , '' Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told AFP after the match , calling it `` the worst game we have played since I have been coach . ''

`` We will reflect on it in the coming days with a cool head . We will suffer a lot from this defeat , but we need to change this attitude and avoid it happening in another game in the future , '' he added .

`` We failed at everything , we lost all the tackles , all the high balls . We did n't have one player who played well . ''

Ronaldo unhappy

Equally as unhappy was Cristiano Ronaldo . His return from suspension did little to revive what was a limp and lifeless Real performance .

`` Real Madrid can not lose 4-0 against anyone , '' said Ronaldo .

`` We lacked desire , attitude , everything . The team was n't fresh mentally or physically , but there are no excuses . The damage is done . ''

Atletico coach Diego Simeone , meanwhile , was ecstatic at his team 's performance .

`` I always insist that the players are the most important people , '' he said .

`` Today their capacity to understand what we needed and execute it was fantastic . ''

The victory has revived Atletico 's flagging title aspirations . They sit in third , with Real 's lead at the top cut to seven points .

Barcelona , in second place and four points behind Real , will hope to take advantage Sunday when they play Athletic Bilbao
