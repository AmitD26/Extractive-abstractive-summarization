This is Autism Awareness Month , and it 's a good time to set the record straight on autism and violence .

After Sandy Hook , there was a lot of talk about whether shooter Adam Lanza had Asperger 's syndrome , a form of autism , and , if so , whether that played a role in his violent behavior . The response from people touched by autism and autism professionals was immediate and unequivocal : There is no connection between any autism spectrum disorder and violent aggression .

Unfortunately , stating the facts did little to stop the speculation . It 's almost as if people wanted to `` make it so '' as an easy way to explain the inexplicable . Every new story seemed to mention Asperger 's in the headline or opening lines . The implied connection was unmistakable .

The truth is , people with autism are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators . Even in our supposedly enlightened society , anyone who is different can become a magnet for bullies and predators . Growing up with undiagnosed Asperger 's , I learned that the hard way . So did my son , Jack -LRB- I call him Cubby -RRB- , who also has Asperger 's . I 'd sensed that all my life , but it 's also supported by scientific studies , in both medical and criminal justice research .

Opinion : I have Asperger 's and I 'm just like you

Those of us on the autism spectrum have enough problems simply being different in an often intolerant world . Thanks to our limited sense of the emotions swirling around us , we live in the shadow of often unseen threats , as so many of us have learned to our detriment . The unspoken emotional subtext that most people take for granted is mysterious and invisible to us . Our oblivion leads to bad feeling , and we never know exactly how and where we went wrong .

Media talk of Asperger 's and murder -- even when it 's only speculation -- raises that threat level significantly . Insinuations like this dehumanize people with Asperger 's and label us as `` sociopaths '' or `` future attackers . '' Where does that lead ? Exclusion , bullying and mistreatment , even more than before .

Troubling legacy of Sandy Hook may create backlash against kids with autism

Prejudice affects us in many ways , most all of which are bad . My son found that out four years ago , when a state prosecutor decided that his scientific fascination with explosives was a terrorist threat and only she could `` save '' our community . She charged him with four felonies , carrying a maximum sentence of more than 60 years in prison .

Growing up autistic

Cubby was 17 years old when he was indicted . He 'd never been in trouble with either the law or in school , and was on track to make Eagle Scout , where he taught the chemistry merit badge course .

His only `` crime '' was turning household chemicals into experimental explosives , which he set off and filmed in the woods behind our house . Even the ATF agents who first investigated were impressed by Cubby 's scientific acumen and curiosity and certain that he intended no harm .

It took a year of our lives , $ 100,000 and a weeklong jury trial to set the record straight . At the end the prosecutor just walked away , as do most bullies and predators . Our society can be awful long on prejudgment and woefully short on consequences .

It 's time to change the conversation .

Asperger 's does n't make a person a killer or a terrorist . It 's the disturbing truth that anyone can turn violent or deadly , and it 's proven very difficult to identify who 's vulnerable and what the trigger might be .

Opinion : Leave autism out of mass shootings

Psychologist Phil Zimbardo showed that we all have a dark side , one that can emerge quite suddenly , in his famous Stanford Prison Experiment , which was cut off early when students who played prison guards became sadistic and those who played prisoners became depressed .

Indeed , most of the rampage killers of the past 30 years apparently popped up out of nowhere . What did we miss ? The central question for us as a society should be : How can we identify those people at risk for aggressive violence , and get them support while help is still an option ?

I believe violence should be a research priority at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health . After the fact analysis does n't help anyone , and it wo n't bring back the dead . We need to understand what makes people turn on others and how we can defuse that threat .

Groups : Autism not to blame for violence

At the same time , we must learn to stop the rush to judgment when the person next to us acts `` a little strange . '' Eccentric people have brought humanity some of its greatest gifts and inventions , and we need to encourage difference , not chase it into hiding .

Imagine where we 'd be today if Alfred Nobel , who invented dynamite , had been prosecuted like my son -- instead of praised for his service to humanity .

Having Asperger 's , he says , and being different is bad enough without that myth

We need to stop looking for easy answers and find out what really causes violence , he says
