Being a father has had an unexpected result for best-selling author Khaled Hosseini -- it 's boosted his fan base .

Hosseini explains with a laugh that his 12-year-old son posted a gushing review of his latest book , `` And the Mountains Echoed , '' on Goodreads .

His son is at an age when many children experience what Hosseini calls an awakening into adulthood : They start to realize their parents are flawed .

While there is no inkling of that sentiment in his son 's review , Hosseini remembers that moment in his own life . Coming of age is a common theme in his books .

`` And the Mountains Echoed '' tells the story of two loving siblings ripped apart by their family 's hardship . That rupture affects generations in a story that stretches across continents , and through decades .

Afghanistan provides the inspiration and backdrop for `` And the Mountains Echoed '' as well as Hosseini 's previous novels , `` The Kite Runner '' and `` A Thousand Splendid Suns . '' His books have sold more than 38 million copies around the world .

The author credits his children with making him a powerful writer . Hosseini says when he became a parent , he could empathize with the agonizing decisions his characters face in his novels .

`` There is no question that it has transformed and informed my way of writing , '' he says .

Hosseini yearns to take his son , Haris , and his daughter , Farah , 10 , to Afghanistan . `` That would be my dream , '' he says .

Hosseini lived in Kabul until he was 11 . Since then , the 48-year-old author has traveled to his native country as a goodwill envoy for the U.N. Refugee Agency .

He has not yet taken his children to Afghanistan because he says he worries about their safety . But he plans to bring them to Kabul one day : `` I would love to go back with them and show them around the city , show them where I was raised , where I went to school , so they can see for themselves this place that I keep writing about , '' he says .

In addition to writing , Hosseini dedicates his time to providing shelter for returning refugee families through the Khaled Hosseini Foundation , which funds learning centers for women and helps to protect children involved in the rug-making industry .

`` I see the mission of my foundation to reach out and help people who are exactly like the characters in my books , '' he says .

His travels to Afghanistan not only inform his philanthropic efforts -- they also shape his writing . But he says he does n't intend to travel there to find material for his books .

`` Nevertheless , it seeps into my consciousness , '' he says . `` And when I sit down to write stories what I 've seen in Afghanistan does inform me . ''

He remembers meeting a pair of sisters in the fall of 2009 . They lived in an isolated village , about an hour outside Kabul . The older sister , who was about 6 years old , treated her little sister like a daughter . `` They were strikingly beautiful and extremely sweet-natured , '' he says . `` And they were clinging to each other . ''

As he left , he gave the older sister an apple . She quickly turned around and gave it to her little sister . `` It touched me deeply , and I was very moved by seeing that , '' he says .

That bond between those two sisters became the inspiration for the young siblings at the heart of `` And the Mountains Echoed . ''

Children are often the protagonists in Hosseini 's books . He says he is fascinated with the time when a young person has one foot in childhood and another in adulthood : `` That age of 12 or so , when the foundations of the world as the child has thus far known it are beginning to crack , and the world is revealing itself to be more nuanced , more complicated , more messy , more troubling -LRB- than they imagined -RRB- . ''

Many of his characters go through this metamorphosis . He draws on his childhood to make that journey compelling .

`` All of us grow up with these kind of archetypal notions of our parents and of the people we admire , '' he says . `` And as we grow older , we recognize them to be more fallible than we thought . ''

He recalls his relationship with his father changing when he was a young man . `` Of course , I grew up thinking my Dad was the strongest man in the world . He was the smartest man in the world , '' he says of his father , who died in December 2009 .

`` He was very , very , very dear to me , '' Hosseini says . `` But I do remember getting older and beginning to disagree with my Dad , on important issues : politics and other things . ''

Hosseini and his family came to the United States as asylum seekers . He considers himself lucky . On World Refugee Day last week , he helped to spread awareness about the more than 40 million people who are displaced .

`` Refugees are people , just like us , just like anybody else . They 're not just statistics , '' he says . `` We can all contribute to those essential programs that bring resources and services to some of the world 's most vulnerable people . ''

Hosseini 's work reinforces his message . For many readers , `` And the Mountains Echoed '' will lend faces and emotions to refugees who live in danger of being overlooked .
