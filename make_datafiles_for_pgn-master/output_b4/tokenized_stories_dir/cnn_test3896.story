-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Georgian President has praised the citizens of the former Soviet republic for the `` miraculous transformation '' of the country .

Mikhail Saakashvili said his government had helped , but praised `` the talent and hard-working nature of the people '' for `` an amazing achievement , '' in an interview with CNN 's Jim Clancy .

Asked what Georgia 's greatest resources were Saakashvili said : `` The standard answer would be people and nature , but it is people and nature . This was a country that was considered to be failing years ago and -LSB- now -RSB- it is making it . ''

Saakashvili was re-elected as President of Georgia in 2008 after taking over from his predecessor Eduard Shevardnadze in 2004 following his leadership of the `` Rose Revolution '' protests .

He said Georgia needs to `` bring back the best of the past , but also show the way to the future . ''

`` It 's about education , healthcare , opportunities , democracy , social transformation , meritocracy which can reverse the old corrupt , planned society that we inherited from Soviet times , '' he added .

Georgia gained independence in 1991 but relations with Russia since have been strained .

In August 2008 , Georgian troops entered the breakaway Russian-speaking region of South Ossetia , after sporadic clashes between ethnic Russians and Georgians . South Ossetia had declared independence from Georgia in the early 1990s .

Georgia 's move prompted Russian troops to enter South Ossetia and then push deep into the rest of Georgia . Each side blamed each other for the conflict but an eight-month European Union-commissioned inquiry concluded that both sides shared the blame for the conflict .

Thousands of Georgians remain displaced and there is pressure on Saakashvili to repair relations with Russia .

He told CNN that Georgia `` would be crazy to want hostilities with big , big Russia '' and it was `` the last thing any Georgian would want . ''

Another ongoing problem for the president are the numbers of Georgians -- especially young people -- leaving the country .

World Bank figures record Georgia 's population fell by a constant 1.2 percent -LRB- around 50,000 -RRB- from 2004 to 2008 .

And Georgians have had to endure high levels of depravation for several years with over half the population living below the poverty line .

But this is being addressed Saakashvili says . `` We had 52 percent living in poverty . Now it is 22 percent . ''

Saakashvili says Georgia will soon -LRB- before the end of his presidential term in 2013 -RRB- have visa-free access to the European Union .

`` I 'm not afraid people will leave because I expect more to come back . This is the first former Soviet country where I think the entire political class has been replaced . And from that point of view Georgia is an attractive place for people to stay . ''
