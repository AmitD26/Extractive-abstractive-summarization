A teenager in India , who had more than 200 `` teeth '' growing in his mouth due to a benign dental tumor , has had them removed .

Ashik Gavai , a 17-year-old student from Buldhana , underwent the six-hour operation , which involved four doctors at Mumbai 's J.J. Hospital on July 21 .

The teen had 232 denticles -- abnormal teeth-like growth -- lodged in his mouth due to a complex composite odontoma , a benign dental tumor .

The abnormal teeth were embedded in the bone inside the lower right jaw and were not visible from outside the mouth . Surgeons say the surgery was `` dangerous '' and the patient 's jawbone will take three to four months to heal .

`` It is very common for a person to have a -LRB- small -RRB- number of abnormal teeth , but this many is very rare , '' said Dr. Sunanda Dhiware , head of the Department of Dentistry at J.J. Hospital . She adds that she knows of cases where 40 to 50 teeth were removed .

Gavai 's normal teeth are to remain in his mouth , although the doctors did help to remove a wisdom tooth .

The teen is currently recovering in the hospital and has been put on a liquid diet of mainly coconut water and milk .

According to Dr. Vandana Thoravade , surgeon in the ENT department at J.J. Hospital , the operation could have cost as much as 250,000 rupees -LRB- about $ 4,000 -RRB- , which the Gavai family could not afford . The teen 's father is a farm laborer who earns 150-200 rupees -LRB- $ 2-3 -RRB- a day .

The government 's Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana program -- which supports low income patients -- took care of the bill .

Gavai 's doctors said the denticles likely started to form when the patient was six years old , but Gavai did not notice the abnormal teeth until a month ago , when his mouth began to swell .

The village doctors near his home in Buldhana District , about 500 km from Mumbai , were unable to treat Gavai 's condition , and referred him to the Mumbai hospital .

Doctors say denticles are likely to grow again in Gavai 's mouth , but probably not in such a large number .
