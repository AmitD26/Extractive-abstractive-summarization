Two Palestinian teens killed in the West Bank presented no direct threat when they were shot last week , the United Nations said Friday in a preliminary report .

Nadeem Nouwarah , 17 , and Mohammad Odeh Salameh , 16 , were killed during protests on May 15 on the anniversary of the `` Nakba , '' a day commemorating the displacement of Palestinians that accompanied the creation of Israel after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war .

Six hours of raw video distributed by advocacy organization Defense for Children International and reviewed by CNN shows the boys were shot on the same patch of asphalt . Their deaths were 73 minutes apart .

The boys ' relatives blame the Israeli military for the killings .

`` The killings may amount to extrajudicial executions under human rights law as well as willful killings under international humanitarian law , the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement on Friday .

It called for a prompt , independent , impartial and transparent investigation .

`` Our office has repeatedly raised its concerns about the excessive use of force by Israeli security forces and the lack of accountability for such incident , '' the statement said . `` We also urge Israel to make public the findings of this investigation and any steps regarding accountability that are taken . ''

But an Israeli military spokesman said its forces fired no live rounds during clashes where the boys were killed .

`` During that demonstration that was extremely violent , the Israeli Defense Force used crowd-control methods and riot-dispersal means to prevent and control the overflow of the violence , '' Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said .

`` The preliminary IDF inquiry indicates that no live fire was shot at all Thursday during the riots in Beitunya , and we have to determine what caused this result , '' Lerner added .

The State Department joined several human rights groups calling for an investigation .
