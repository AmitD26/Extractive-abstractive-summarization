Four decades before anyone took an arrow to the knee in `` Skyrim , '' adventurers were sitting down with paper and pencil to battle fantasy monsters and explore rich , new worlds in a different kind of role-playing game .

`` Dungeons & Dragons , '' commonly known simply as D&D , burst onto the scene in 1974 , long before the word `` gaming '' came with the implied word `` video '' in front of it .

In D&D , the brainchild of creators Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson , players could become fighters , magic-users , and clerics , and run through adventures created by a `` Dungeon Master '' or `` DM '' -- the person responsible for controlling nearly every aspect of the game .

Players sat around a table rolling multi-sided dice and visualizing the adventure using just their imaginations -- a far cry from today 's vast , richly rendered video-game worlds .

But four decades later , and with all its high-tech competition , `` Dungeons & Dragons '' continues to grow and evolve . And many of today 's computer games , animated television shows , feature films , novels , and even pop and rock songs owe much to D&D lore .

`` In today 's culture , D&D has found its place as a leader and influencer over storytellers across so many different mediums , '' said Nathan Stewart , brand director for D&D at Wizards of the Coast , the company publishing the game . `` From game designers and musicians , to scores of screenwriters and film directors , D&D has had a profound effect on those who have brought fantasy and geek culture to the foreground . ''

Demon worship ?

Indeed , many creators of fantasy games and stories today probably cut their teeth on D&D as kids , or teens . The game allowed players to tap into their own creativity while socializing with friends .

Or , for some , with their family .

Jerry Holkins , co-founder for the webcomic , `` Penny Arcade , '' said he started playing D&D with his young aunts and uncles , much to the chagrin of his mother .

`` My mom flipped out , of course . The belief that ` Dungeons & Dragons ' constituted some kind of ` satanic ritual ' was a common refrain at my house , '' Holkins said . `` When I got older , I hid the fact that I played it . Where she might have found another young person 's pornography or drugs , she found my DM 's guide . Honestly , I think she would have preferred the drugs . ''

By the early '80s , as the game grew in popularity with wargamers , then college and high school students , it drew the attention of some religious groups that claimed -- as they would with `` Harry Potter '' decades later -- that the game encouraged witchcraft and demon worship .

For others , D&D opened the door to expanding their circle of friends at a time in their formative years when shyness may have otherwise taken over . Video game creator Ken Levine did n't have friends to play D&D with when he discovered the game in 1978 . But a trip to summer camp and a chance meeting with others who played introduced him to many new people .

`` So I went from having no friends and no social circle to an immediate social circle through ` Dungeons & Dragons , ' '' said Levine , who is best known as creator of the `` Bioshock '' series . `` We were playing a module out of the ` Dragon ' magazine called ` The Mansion of Mad Professor Ludlow . ' The Dungeon Master that night is still my best friend to this day . ''

`` Without Dungeons & Dragons , there is a very different person in this chair right now . I just do n't know if I would have made the connection -- the social network with the people I met . ''

By 1981 , the game had more than 3 million players worldwide . By 2007 , that number grew to 6 million , and the numbers keep rising .

Influence on video games

Universally considered the first modern role-playing game , D&D set the benchmark for many future RPG games -- either the table-top or computer variety . Beyond simple game mechanics , the game allowed players to understand how to tell a story or craft an adventure that kept people engaged and entertained .

`` Often times when people think of D&D , they think of the dice , maps and groups of friends sitting around the kitchen table , '' Stewart said . `` But D&D has also been in the video game space as far back as 1982 and has served as the inspiration for a lot of today 's digital games . ''

The influence of `` Dungeons & Dragons '' on video games has been clear from the beginning .

`` D&D was about creativity -- both in terms of the player experience and the Dungeon Master experience , '' Levine said . `` Once I started getting exposed to Gygax 's world -- sitting there and thumbing through the pages of the ` Monster Manual ' over and over again and the other manuals of Advanced D&D , I saw his whole vision . It exposed me to creatively minded people who thought about fantasy and genre things the way I did . It really got the ball rolling for me . ''

In 1988 , the first officially-licensed video game based on D&D was released by Strategic Simulations , Inc. `` Pool of Radiance '' was an adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set , and was generally well received by fans and critics .

More successful video games would follow including the `` Baldur 's Gate '' series and the `` Neverwinter Nights '' collection . Holkins played many of the games and felt the games leveraged the vast settings of the D&D 's campaigns without tying themselves to its specific rules -- thereby leaning more on storytelling rather than combat .

`` As far as it being an influence on videogames , that 's not even a conversation , '' Holkins said . `` In the Western CRPG -LRB- computer role-playing games -RRB- tradition , the lineage is so direct as to be a straight line . ''

And many who play games like `` Diablo , '' `` Dark Souls '' and `` World of Warcraft , '' often connected to teammates and opponents through headsets and computer chat channels , also gather together for the social experience that is an old-fashioned `` D&D '' session .

`` Dungeons & Dragons '' sessions are social , Levine said . `` You are surrounded by your friends and not -LRB- someone -RRB- yelling and cursing at you over their Xbox headset . `` You get to have this really nice experience playing with friends . ''

Holkins agrees .

`` Different groups are all playing the same game , theoretically , but in practice there 's a lot of culture that is n't really portable from table to table and people approach it with their own style , '' he said . `` It would have to be like that , when you think about it . At root , the game is about a group of people who are all agreeing to imagine the same thing . Is ` intimate ' the right word ? I think I could make a case . ''

New D&D rules

The game itself has evolved over many official and unofficial rule changes in its 40 years . From the original rules in 1974 to `` Advanced Dungeons & Dragons '' in 1981 up to `` D&D 4th Edition '' released in 2008 , the idea has always been to give players a framework to create adventures the way they want to experience and enjoy them .

`` There are certain things about the D&D game that transcend generations -- the storytelling aspect , the desire to become something greater than yourself or just something different from yourself , '' said Chris Perkins , senior design manager for story and world building for Dungeons & Dragons . `` I think those experiences have given the D&D game its longevity because they are timeless . ''

Two years and 170,000 playtesters later , those timeless ideals are implanted in the fifth and latest generation of rules which were announced by Wizards of the Coast on Monday . A brand new `` Player 's Handbook , '' `` Monster Manual , '' and `` Dungeon Master 's Guide '' will be released this summer , setting the foundations for the game 's future .

In addition to new rules , the creative team at Wizards of the Coast announced an original storyline that will extend beyond the tabletop and into digital gaming . Tiamat , a powerful goddess that takes the form of a multi-colored , five-headed dragon , is at the core of the new `` Tyranny of Dragons '' tale .

A new module for the D&D online game , `` Neverwinter , '' will launch on August 14 and be `` the premier digital ` Dungeons & Dragons ' experience for players , '' according to a press release .

Two new tabletop adventures will also be released , one on August 19 and the other on October 21 . A new line of miniatures -LRB- figures that represent player characters and others they encounter -RRB- is also planned to be used in conjunction with the fifth edition of core rules .

`` We 're aiming to tell the story not only in the role-playing game , but in other venues so that people can experience it at a number of different levels to a number of different depths , '' Perkins said . `` We have n't really dealt with dragons much in the -LRB- Forgotten Realms -RRB- over the past 40 years . It 's been a long time since we 've had an iconic villain on the order of Tiamat . ''

He said the experience will be different depending on what platform you access the story . Players will have a shared story , but what actually happens during a tabletop game will be different than in the digital games .

While rule changes have usually resulted in the gnashing of teeth and wailing of voices from some players , Perkins said there is flexibility built in to the new edition so players can play and enjoy whatever type of game they want , using as much or as little of the new system as they want .

Perkins acts as the Dungeon Master for the Acquisitions , Inc. , adventures at PAX conventions and plans to show everyone how the new rules can work .

`` When I run the game at PAX Prime this summer , I 'm going to do it even differently , '' he said . `` I 'm going to have ` Theater of the Mind ' elements , but I 'm also going to have very strong visuals and there will be miniatures because I 'm going to try to demonstrate without actually calling attention to it that you can present and play the D&D game in any one of a number of different ways and it is still Dungeons & Dragons . ''

Stewart and Perkins believe the future of stories in games will be best told through a transmedia experience and they hope players will usher in a familiar future for D&D . It is a sentiment shared by Levine and Holkins .

`` Let 's get a group of friends together and have an adventure , '' Levine said . `` In reality , that 's what the future of video gaming wants to be . It wants to be a place where the player has the ability to be more expressive . ''
