U.S. authorities arrested an American man returning from overseas who they say is a sympathizer of the terrorist group ISIS .

Donald Ray Morgan was arrested on August 2 on arrival at New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport from Frankfurt , Germany , according to federal court documents .

A federal grand jury in North Carolina charged him with illegal weapons possession , and prosecutors say he was involved in weapons trafficking in violation of his probation for a previous felony conviction , the court documents show .

The court documents make no mention of the ISIS connection , but U.S. officials say that part of what drew their attention is Morgan 's online activities , making Twitter postings in support of the terrorist group .

Morgan is not thought to be involved in any active plots inside the U.S. or elsewhere and instead may be more of an `` aspirational '' supporter of ISIS .

Still , with the rise of ISIS , and more than 100 Americans believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the ongoing civil war , the FBI is on alert for returning Americans who may be associated with groups fighting there .

The New York Daily News reported Sunday night that at his first appearance in court on August 4 , prosecutors opposed bail , citing fears that he was possibly involved with ISIS , which is fighting to establish an Islamic extremist state in parts of Syria and Iraq . The group calls itself the Islamic State but formerly was known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria .

The Daily News report cited officials alleging that Morgan used the moniker Abu Omar al Amreeki to publish tweets in support of ISIS while he spent time in Lebanon . The newspaper quoted federal prosecutor Nadia Moore as saying in court : `` It 's possible that he traffics in guns to people in this organization -LRB- ISIS -RRB- . ''

Chief Magistrate Judge Steven Gold denied bond based on the government 's argument , saying the tweets had `` clearly implied to me that he is trying to go to Syria or Iraq , '' according to the Daily News .

A public defender assigned to represent Morgan said there was no evidence Morgan tried to support ISIS , the Daily News reported . The public defender did n't immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN late Sunday .

Morgan is being transferred to Greensboro , North Carolina , to face the weapons charge , court documents show .
