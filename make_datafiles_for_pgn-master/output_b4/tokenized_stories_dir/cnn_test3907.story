Espoo is the headquarters for mobile phone giant Nokia and the hometown of Formula 1 racing driver Kimi Raikkonen . The Sello shopping center , one of Finland 's largest , was busy with shoppers when the shootings began at 10:08 a.m. -LRB- 3:08 a.m. -RRB-

`` People saw a gunman , calm , walking out of the grocery store after shooting , '' said Mika Pettersson , editor-in-chief of Finnish news agency STT . `` People first thought it was fireworks that had been exploding , but after they realized what had happened , there was a panic . ''

State-owned Finnish broadcaster YLE said the gunman used a 9 mm handgun .

Restaurant manager Naresh Gaonkar , who runs the Intialainen Ravintola Curry Palace across the street from the mall , told CNN there were police helicopters overhead and many police cars driving past with armed officers after the shootings .

Trains going through Espoo were stopped , Gaonkar said .

Pauli Poutanen , a reporter with CNN affiliate MTV3 , reported employees of the grocery store where the attack happened were evacuated so quickly that they did n't have time to put on their winter weather gear . They were waiting outside in T-shirts in temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius , or 14 degrees Fahrenheit , he said .

Gaonkar said many of them were inside his restaurant to stay warm .

Other lone gunmen have carried out two recent high-profile shootings in Finland .

In September 2008 , student Matti Juhani Saari , 22 , killed 10 people before shooting himself in the head at Seinajoki University of Applied Sciences in Kauhajoki , Finland . Saari , who had been armed with a semi-automatic pistol and Molotov cocktails , posted YouTube videos of himself firing weapons before embarking on the massacre .

Pekka-Eric Auvinen , 18 , killed seven fellow students and the principal at Jokela High School in Tuusula in November 2007 before shooting himself in the head .

Auvinen posted a YouTube video titled `` Jokela High School Massacre '' before the killing spree . In it he warned that he planned to `` eliminate all who I see unfit . '' Brandishing a shotgun , the teenager was seen in the video wearing a T-shirt proclaiming `` Humanity is Overrated . ''

Finland enjoys a strong tradition of hunting and has a high proportion of gun ownership , with 2 million firearms owned in a nation of 5 million people .
