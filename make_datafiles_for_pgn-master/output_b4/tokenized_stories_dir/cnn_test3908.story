French hostage Herve Gourdel was abducted and beheaded , a killing shown on video , French President Francois Hollande told the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday .

`` You will understand that today I am speaking before you with a particularly high level of emotion because one of my compatriots has just been subject of a cowardly assassination , '' Hollande said . `` He was a man who was full enthusiasm . He loved the mountains . He thought he would be able to pursue his passion moving into the Ouzou area in Algeria . ''

Hollande said the attack wo n't affect France 's role in the battle against terrorism .

`` France will never give in to blackmail , to pressure , to barbaric acts . Quite to the contrary , France knows what is expected , '' Hollande said .

Earlier , Hollande expressed his condolences to Gourdel 's family in a news conference at the French mission .

Gourdel was kidnapped over the weekend in Algeria 's Tizi Ouzou region east of Algiers , the French Foreign Ministry said . The video was posted online Wednesday . It shows armed men who claim to belong to Islamist militant group Jund al-Khilafa -- or Soldiers of the Caliphate -- in Algeria . They pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , the leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria .

Titled `` A message of blood for the French government , '' the video surfaced as French Prime Minister Manuel Valls addressed the French National Assembly , the country 's lower house of parliament , about the fight against ISIS .

France is part of a broad coalition that is working with the United States to combat the brutal extremist group .

According to his website , Gourdel was born in 1959 and when he was a teenager decided he wanted to become a mountain guide . He opened a guide office in Saint Martin-Vésubie in 1987 where he spent more than 20 years , the website says . He was also an active member of a mountaineering club that spent time in France 's Mercantour National Park .

The Algerian government called the beheading an act of `` criminals . ''

`` It is with a lot of sorrow and sadness that the Algerian government has learned about the horrible assassination of French national Pierre Hervé Gourdel , an odious and despicable act committed by a group of criminals , '' officials said , according to the state-run Algerie Presse Service news agency .

Hollande said he spoke with Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal , who assured Hollande he would commit a maximum effort to find the killers and Gourdel 's body .

`` We owe it to his family , '' Hollande said .

The video appears to show the latest beheading of a Westerner by an Islamist extremist group . Since mid-August , ISIS has beheaded American journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley and British aid worker David Haines .

The new video came on the same day U.S. President Barack Obama addressed the United Nations , calling for all countries to unite against terrorism and brutality wrought by ISIS . The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria goes against everything Islam stands for , he said . Islam , Obama said , is about peace .

Obama publicly extended the condolences of the United States to the people of France for the death of Gourdel .

The U.N. Security Council issued a statement condemning the `` heinous and cowardly murder . ''
