-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was a success story the White House was eager to highlight : Earlier this year , President Obama attended the graduation of 25 police recruits in Columbus , Ohio , touting it as a victory for the federal stimulus package .

On March 6 in Columbus , Ohio , President Obama touted the jobs the stimulus plan would save .

Without the money , the officers never would have hit the streets . They were to be laid off before their first day of patrol , victims of city budget cuts , until the stimulus money saved the class .

But the White House said the $ 1.2 million grant only guaranteed their jobs until the end of the year . And facing a growing deficit and a fight to pass an income tax hike , Columbus Police on Tuesday announced massive budget cuts that could mean hundreds of layoffs .

Among those who could lose their jobs if voters reject the increase : the 25 new officers who shook the president 's hand .

Despite optimistic national headlines on March 6 , the day of the president 's trip , city officials warned the influx of federal stimulus money was n't going to be enough to end their financial crisis .

Obama acknowledged in his remarks the money was no silver bullet . `` By itself , this recovery plan wo n't turn our economy around or solve every problem , '' he said then , and `` this police force still faces budget challenges down the road . ''

The challenges , including a city deficit that could reach $ 120 million , would mean the loss of 324 officers , more than 15 percent of the force , under a budget unveiled by Chief Walter Distelzweig .

`` This is devastating , '' he told reporters Tuesday . `` None of us signed up for this kind of task . ''

Distelzweig said under the 2010 budget plan , the department will focus on priority calls and maintaining public safety . `` Policing in this city will change as we know it today , '' he said . '' ... -LSB- We 're -RSB- going to do less with less . ''

He stressed the cuts are not final , and city voters are being asked to approve an income tax hike in August . The half-percent increase , if passed , could avoid the firings and furloughs . Distelzweig said the announced cuts are not meant to be a threat to voters . `` It 's math -- whatever money is available , '' he said .

Columbus is not alone , of course , in its budget crisis . To its south , Cincinnati is looking at job cuts and reduction in services because of a higher-than-expected deficit . Smaller cities such as Mansfield , 60 miles to its north , have been forced to lay off up to a third of its officers . CNNMoney.com this week reported 16 states around the nation have raised taxes this year , with proposed increases in 17 others .

Looking at the graduates receiving their diplomas that day , Obama said , `` This economy needs your employment to keep it running . ''

`` I look into their eyes and I see their badges today , and I know that we did the right thing , '' he told the crowd on March 6 . `` These jobs and the jobs of so many other police officers and teachers and firefighters all across Ohio will now be saved because of this recovery plan . ''

The grant did its job and funded the class for a year . But local budget problems took over . And the 25 officers , a hopeful symbol that day for the White House , may turn into a grimmer example of financial realities still facing communities around the country .
