On the Sunday after the Newtown massacre , President Barack Obama traveled to Connecticut to comfort the grieving community . As the president offered what he could to the town , other American communities , in less visible ways , were grappling with their own menace of violence .

In Camden , New Jersey -- a city that has already suffered 65 violent deaths in 2012 , surpassing the previous record of 58 violent deaths set in 1995 -- 50 people turned out , some bearing white crosses , to mourn a homeless woman known affectionately as the `` cat lady '' who was stabbed to death -LRB- 50 of the deaths so far this year resulted from gunshot wounds . -RRB-

In Philadelphia , on the same Sunday , city leaders came together at a roundtable to discuss their own epidemic of gun violence ; the year-to-date total of homicides is 322 . Last year , 324 were killed . Of those victims , 154 were 25 or younger . A councilman at the roundtable asked , `` How come as a city we 're not in an outrage ? How come we 're not approaching this from a crisis standpoint ? ''

The concerns go beyond Philadelphia . In the week following the Newtown massacre , there were at least a dozen gun homicides in Chicago , Detroit , Baltimore and St. Louis alone . In a year of highly publicized mass shootings , inner-city neighborhoods that are plagued by gun violence have continued to be neglected and ignored .

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , large metropolitan areas account for more than two-thirds of deaths by gun violence each year , with inner cities most affected . The majority of the victims are young , ranging in age from their early teens to mid-20s , and black .

To track these violent deaths , many communities and media organizations have set up agonizing online trackers -- homicide watches or interactive maps -- that show each subsequent victim as just another data point . These maps are representative of a set of issues far larger than the nameless dots suggest .

In the immediate aftermath of Newtown , as politicians and public figures across America grapple with the horrible truths of gun violence , far less visible from the national spotlight is the steady stream of inner-city victims .

The media is fixated , and with justification , on the string of high-profile massacres that have rocked the nation in Aurora , Colorado ; Tucson , Arizona ; Virginia Tech ; and now in Newtown . Yet in many of America 's neighborhoods most affected by the calamity of gun violence , there is a warranted exasperation -- residents are tired , tired of the ubiquity of guns , tired of fearing for their children 's safety , tired of being forgotten .

Critiquing a narrow media focus does n't deny the horrible , tragic nature of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School ; mass shootings , however , make up only a small fraction of America 's shockingly high level of gun crime .

In his study `` American Homicide , '' Randolph Roth showed that while the overall risk of being murdered is higher in America than it is in any other first-world democracy , homicide rates vary drastically among groups .

According to Roth , if current trends are maintained , one out of every 158 white males born today will be murdered , but for nonwhite males it is likely one of every 27 born today will be murdered .

The stark difference in these racial trends can be traced to the high levels of racial segregation in America 's cities , which have created a spatial barrier between poor inner-city youths of color and more mainstream America -- a barrier that is often responsible for the lack of media and political attention paid to inner-city problems .

Many experts claim that actually it is the spectacular nature of mass shootings that naturally magnifies media coverage and explains the resonance of these tragedies to the broader public . Inner-city violence on its own , however , does not suffer from a lack of awful , spectacular violence and calamity . In fact , the gruesome nature of violence in inner cities has contributed to widespread social desensitization to gun violence . How then do we explain the differing public responses ?

An indicator of the difference of attention levels lies in the tone of the public rhetoric in the wake of mass shootings : `` This was supposed to be a safe community , '' and `` This kind of thing was n't supposed to happen here . ''

These statements imply that in America 's leafy-green small towns and suburbs , gun violence is a shocking travesty ; it strikes against America 's perception of what is acceptable . In contrast , gun violence in the American metropolis has been normalized , and the public and media display a passive indifference toward the lives of inner-city youths .

This normalization of inner-city violence is due in part , to the isolation and segregation of America 's ghettos from wider America , but it is also due to a sense that the victims of inner-city violence are responsible for their own condition .

As Robert Sampson , a professor at Harvard University , has highlighted , the gun violence in American cities is born out of neighborhood characteristics such as poverty , racial segregation and lack of economic opportunity . This shortened explanation for the high levels of inner-city violence has often been mistaken to imply that it is the direct choice of inner-city residents to remain either in poverty or in their segregated community that leads to their victimization .

In reality , the victims of inner-city gun violence are the victims of a dual tragedy . The first is that the poverty and segregation , which play a crucial role in spurring the downward cycle of crime , are the result of social arrangements predicated on longstanding oppression and prejudice .

Through a complex mix of violence , institutional arrangements and exploitation , black Americans were pressured into ghettos , which are the hotbeds of contemporary gun violence . Their inability to escape their conditions is not a choice but rather the byproduct of continued structural discrimination . Slowing the tide of inner-city deaths through gun control is therefore a modern-day civil rights issue .

If the refusal of America 's national politicians to move on gun control before Newtown represents a political failure and a paucity of American will , then the disregard for the lives of inner-city youths stricken by gun violence on a daily basis is an illustration of the limits of American compassion .

The slaughter of young children en masse should be a moment of reckoning for any society , but there is a day-by-day , child-by-child slaughter occurring in America that has gone on too long and is yet to be reckoned with .

If Newtown should teach us anything , it is that all of us in America share this same short moment of life , and that we all seek to ensure safety , security and prosperity for our children .

As Vice President Joe Biden and the presidential task force meet to negotiate about what new gun laws to recommend , they must look to Sandy Hook Elementary and beyond . We need to protect the children of Newtown from the threat of future gun violence , but the children of Chicago and Camden and Detroit deserve the same long-term security .

We may not be able to ensure absolute security for America 's children , but through smarter policy America can surely save more of its children from gun violence .
