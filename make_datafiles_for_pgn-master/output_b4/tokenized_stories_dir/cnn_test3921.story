Vice President Joe Biden spoke Wednesday night about how , as a child , he stood up to a local bully by smashing the boy 's head and threatening to kill him .

The remarks , which were published by the Daily Beast , came at an event organized by Vital Voices , a women 's rights group , where Biden was recognized as a man who combats violence against women .

Biden set the scene during the speech by detailing how his family would stop by a doughnut shop after Mass every Sunday .

`` We 'd get donuts , and my dad would wait in the car . As I was coming out , my sister tugged on me and said , ` That 's the boy who kicked me off my bicycle , ' '' Biden recalled . `` So I went home , we only lived about a quarter mile away , and I got on my bicycle and rode back and he was in the doughnut shop . ''

Biden then said he walked up behind the boy , who was with his parents , and `` smashed his head next to the counter . ''

When the crowd applauded , Biden said , `` I 'm not recommending it . ''

After the scuffle , Biden says the boy 's father grabbed him . The future vice president then said to both son and father , `` If you ever touch my sister again , I 'll come back here and I 'll kill your son . ''

`` Now , that was a euphemism , '' Biden said , getting to the point of the story . `` I thought I was really , really in trouble . My father never once raised his hand to any one of his children -- never once -- and I thought I was in trouble . He pulled me aside and said , ` Joey , you should n't do that , but I 'm proud of you , son . ' ''

Six times Joe Biden aimed for the truth and caused a headache

Biden has a substantial record of combating violence against women . As a senator in 1990 , he introduced the Violence Against Women Act , legislation that changed law enforcement response and criminal justice sentencing for crimes against women .

The oldest of four siblings , Biden was born and raised in Scranton , Pennsylvania until age 11 . In 1953 , his family moved to the Delaware would regularly make the short trip to visit family in Scranton .

Scranton also appears to have molded Biden into a fighter , too .

` White boy ' Biden calls tea party ` crazy '

In a 2012 interview with the AP , Tom Bell , a Biden childhood friend from Scranton , retold a story about how he asked Biden to beat up a bully next time he was in town . Biden , according to Bell , did just that .

Richard Ben Cramer , in the seminal book `` What It Takes : The Way to the White House , '' also documented Biden 's fighting steak .

`` Once Joey -LSB- Biden -RSB- set his mind , it was like he did n't think at all -- he just did , '' Cramer wrote . `` That 's why you did n't want to fight him . Most guys who got into a fight , they 'd square off , there 'd be a minute or so of circling around , while they jockeyed for position . Joey did n't do that . He decided to fight ... BANGO -- he 'd punch the guy in the face . ''

Cramer noted that this fighting prowess came as much out of necessity as it did out of desire .

`` Joe was kind of skinny , and he stuttered , and the kids called him Bye-Bye , for the way he sounded when he tried to say his name , '' Cramer wrote . `` But Joey would never back down , and he knew how to box , when no one else did . ''
