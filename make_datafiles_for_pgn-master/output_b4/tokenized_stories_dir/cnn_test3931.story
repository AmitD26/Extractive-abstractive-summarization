A new possibility for a diplomatic solution in the standoff between Syria and the United States surfaced unexpectedly Monday as the war-torn country said it supported a proposal to hand over control of its chemical weapons .

But a key question loomed : Is that a viable option or simply a stall tactic as President Bashar al-Assad 's government tries to stave off U.S. military action ?

`` It 's certainly a positive development when the Russians and Syrians both make gestures towards dealing with these chemical weapons , '' President Barack Obama told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer Monday .

Asked whether the proposed idea was enough to avert a military strike on Syria , Obama said , `` It 's possible if it 's real . ''

The U.S. president spoke hours after Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem told reporters in Moscow that his nation `` welcomes '' a proposal that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made during talks on Monday . The idea : put Syria 's chemical weapons under international control to avert a U.S. military response over an alleged poison gas attack last month .

`` I declare that the Syrian Arab Republic welcomes Russia 's initiative , on the basis that the Syrian leadership cares about the lives of our citizens and the security in our country , '' Moallem said . `` We are also confident in the wisdom of the Russian government , which is trying to prevent an American aggression against our people . ''

Secretary of State John Kerry discussed a similar scenario earlier Monday , though the State Department later said that al-Assad could not be trusted to relinquish his country 's chemical stockpiles .

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Washington remained `` highly skeptical '' of the Syrian regime .

`` The only reason why we are seeing this proposal is because of the threat of U.S. military action , '' he said .

Taking a ` hard look '

Obama said the United States will work with Russia and the international community `` to see if we can arrive at something that is enforceable and serious . ''

The United States will take a `` hard look '' at the plan , deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said . But `` we ca n't have this be another stalling tactic , '' she said , adding that the Syrian president 's track record does n't bode well .

`` Everything that Assad has done over the past two years and before has been to refuse to put his chemical weapons under international control , '' she said . `` He has n't declared them . We 've repeatedly called on him to do so . And he 's ignored prohibitions against them . ''

Latest developments

The new possibility of a diplomatic deal appeared to have started with comments from Kerry earlier Monday .

Asked whether there was anything al-Assad 's government could do or offer that would stop an attack , Kerry said that al-Assad `` could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week . ''

Speaking at a news conference with British Foreign Secretary William Hague , the U.S. secretary of state described that as an impossible scenario .

`` He is n't about to do it , '' Kerry said . `` And it ca n't be done , obviously . ''

U.S. official : Kerry `` clearly went off script ''

But as Russia and Syria later suggested that it could be done , one U.S. official called Kerry 's remarks a `` major goof , '' adding that America 's top diplomat `` clearly went off script . ''

`` There is no one in the administration who is taking this Syria proposal seriously , '' the official said .

Several State Department representatives tried to clarify Kerry 's remarks later in the day , calling them a `` rhetorical argument . ''

`` His point was that this brutal dictator -LRB- al-Assad -RRB- with a history of playing fast and loose with the facts can not be trusted to turn over chemical weapons , otherwise he would have done so long ago , '' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said . `` That 's why the world faces this moment . ''

Kerry 's comments caught Russia 's attention

It was n't long before the remarks came up in a conversation between Lavrov and Kerry , who talked on the phone as the U.S. secretary of state flew back from London .

`` I saw your comments this morning , '' Lavrov said to Kerry , according to a senior State Department official .

During a 14-minute conversation that had been previously scheduled , the Russian foreign minister said he would speak out about the issue but played down the idea that a proposal was on the table , the official said .

Kerry told Lavrov that the United States `` is not going to ` play games , ' '' the official said . `` If there is a serious proposal , we will take a look . ''

Hillary Clinton weighs in

Could ` goof ' be solution ?

The comments from Kerry and counterparts in Russia and Syria are the latest twist in an international crisis that has also become a fierce political battle in the United States .

The Obama administration says the al-Assad government was behind an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus . And the U.S. president is seeking congressional approval for a military strike in response .

So far he 's met resistance from lawmakers and the public who are concerned about the United States again intervening militarily in a foreign crisis .

On Monday , Harf said looking at the Russian proposal does n't mean the White House is backing down from its push to get authorization to strike Syria .

`` In fact , the opposite . ... . We think this is why it 's even more important that Congress votes to authorize the president to use military action against Syrian regime targets , because we can be clear that if we do n't give authorization to do so and we do n't respond , then Assad will see that as a green light to continue using these chemical weapons . ''

But could Kerry 's possible gaffe be the key to a diplomatic solution ?

Commentator Andrew Sullivan says he hopes so .

`` We have the possibility of two things : that Russia might actually act decisively to rein Assad in , and also support the only viable policy to accomplish what Obama wants -- protecting the world from these vile weapons , '' Sullivan wrote Monday . `` I have no idea whether this is a serious move by Lavrov -- but it sure seems so , and it presents a fascinating non-binary option . ... Sometimes , it seems , Kerry 's incompetence strikes gold . Here 's hoping . ''

Whatever happens , the prospect of a diplomatic deal is likely going to make the Obama administration 's attempts to make a case before Congress even more difficult , said Michael O'Hanlon , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . Lawmakers who are already debating whether or not to pass resolutions authorizing military action now may want to rewrite them , he said .

`` It 's going to obviously throw a monkey wrench in the gears on a number of things , '' he said .

There 's already been at least one delay .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is holding off on taking steps toward a first vote . An aide said that the Russia proposal is serious and fluid enough that members do not want to lock themselves into a position on Syria just yet .

An initial Senate vote on whether to authorize a military strike against Syria had been expected on Wednesday .

Reaction in the United States , beyond

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the Russian proposal `` deserves a thorough examination . ''

It would be acceptable under several conditions , Fabius said . Al-Assad should immediately hand over control of the weapons and allow their destruction , he said , calling for the U.N. Security Council to pass a binding resolution with `` firm consequences . ''

`` Since the beginning , France has set two goals : punishment and deterrence , '' he said . `` That is why we are now asking specific , rapid and verifiable commitments by the Syrian regime . ''

Sen. Dianne Feinstein , chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said she would `` welcome '' Lavrov 's call for Syria to transfer control of its chemical weapons `` to prevent an international strike . ''

`` I believe that Russia can be most effective in encouraging the Syrian president to stop any use of chemical weapons and place all his chemical munitions , as well as storage facilities , under United Nations control until they can be destroyed , '' the California Democrat said .

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said getting Syria to surrender the stockpiles `` would be an important step . ''

`` But this can not be another excuse for delay or obstruction , '' Clinton said during an event at the White House Monday . `` And Russia has to support the international community 's efforts sincerely or be held to account . ''
