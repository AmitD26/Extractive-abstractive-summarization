Nancy Writebol is a loving mother . A devoted wife . A woman of faith . A missionary who has traveled the world to help others .

And now , the world knows her as an Ebola patient .

Last month , while working in Liberia , Writebol contracted the deadly virus . She 's one of three Americans known to contract Ebola during the outbreak that has ravaged West Africa .

The others are colleague Dr. Kent Brantly and Patrick Sawyer , a naturalized citizen and Liberian government official who died from the disease earlier this week .

The missionary is expected to be picked up in West Africa and flown back to the United States , where she is expected to join Brantly -- who arrived Saturday -- in a special isolation unit at Atlanta 's Emory University Hospital . According to Todd Shearer , a spokesman for the Christian charity Samaritan 's Purse , she should be in Georgia early next week .

The trip will be the latest of many journeys for Writebol , whose other missionary ventures include Ecuador and 14 years ministering to orphans and vulnerable children in Africa .

Since August 2013 , the Writebols have been in Monrovia , Liberia , with the Serving in Mission group , which worked with Samaritan 's Purse .

Nancy guided missionaries and teams and worked with nurses at ELWA hospital , where her husband is the technical services manager , according to the Christian group 's website . Nancy was diagnosed with Ebola on July 25 .

Those who know Nancy best say that she 's motivated not by any quest for personal glory or thirst for adventure , but because she and her husband feel compelled to act because of their faith .

As husband David explained from Africa via Skype to members of Calvary Church in Charlotte , North Carolina , at a recent vigil for Nancy : `` We have been blessed because of what Christ has done for us , -LRB- by giving -RRB- us eternal life and salvation .

`` What else could we do -LRB- but help -RRB- ? ''

The fact the Writebols left the comforts of America to live in an area rife with poverty , instability and disease , the fact they put their lives at risk to assist those suffering everyday , is n't surprising to those who know them .

John Munro , their friend and pastor at Calvary Church , describes the couple as `` the salt of the Earth , '' the kind of people who would n't give a second thought to dropping everything to help .

The only thing perhaps ironic about what 's happening now is how such an `` unassuming '' and `` very humble '' woman has become international news .

`` She is ... not someone who would ever make the headlines , '' Munro said , `` apart from something like this . ''

That does n't change the fact the Writebols have extraordinary lives .

Wherever they 've gone , their lives have been centered on their church and their family , including two now-adult sons who live in the United States .

One of those sons , Jeremy Writebol , told CNN 's Chris Cuomo that the recent ordeal has been hard on his father . Nancy Writebol has been isolated in the couple 's Liberia home ; she and David talk by phone but , given fears she might pass on Ebola to him , they ca n't touch .

`` It 's very difficult , and we feel the emotion of that , '' Jeremy Writebol said of his parents ' physical separation .

Then , of course , there 's the inherent danger of Ebola . The World Health Organization reports that there have been at least 1,322 cases in recent weeks in West Africa , some 729 of which have resulted in death .

Even before it was known his mother would return to the United States , where she 'll get top-notch care at Emory , Jeremy Writebol took solace the mortality rate is n't even higher .

`` We feel like Mom has a chance , '' he told CNN affiliate WCCB .
