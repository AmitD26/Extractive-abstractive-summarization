When R&B singer Seal and Heidi Klum met in a New York City hotel lobby , the supermodel told CNN 's Piers Morgan , `` it was kind of like two magnets . ''

The model-turned-mogul , TV superstar and mother of four is a guest on Friday 's `` Piers Morgan Tonight . ''

Klum said that she was sitting in the lobby with a mutual friend of hers and Seal 's , and that Seal did n't even recognize the internationally famous model . Klum told the story of the couple 's engagement , in which the singer had an igloo built on a mountaintop in the Canadian Rockies , to which he whisked her by helicopter .

`` And then we get there , '' Klum said . `` We hop off and the helicopter leaves , and there we are in the middle of nowhere . It was beautiful . And then he had his guitar with him . And he sang a song for me and he went down on his knee . ''

Klum described the igloo as `` a full-on igloo with a bed inside with pillows and blankets and candles and rose petals . ''

When Morgan asked Klum how the couple manages to sustain such a happy relationship , Klum said `` I just think because we love each other . We have fun with each other . We respect each other . I let him do his thing , even though that 's hard for me sometimes . ''

Klum , 38 , admitted that she had to forgo her propensity for controlling things and `` learned how you have to , like , let him do his creative thing , because I am quite bossy in my industry . ''

When Morgan asked if the couple was planning on having more children , Klum answered , `` No , we have four children , and we 're complete now . ''

With the ninth-season finale of `` Project Runway '' coming up , Klum told Morgan she never imagined the series would last so long .

`` No way , '' she said . `` No . You just do n't when you get into something like that . You know , when we first created ` Project Runway , ' it was Harvey Weinstein , Desiree Gruber , my publicist for the last 15 years and myself , and we just shopped it around . We went to all these different networks and tried to explain to them what we wanted to do was a show about fashion . ''

Klum said that she had a hard time convincing networks that they had a hit for them .

`` Everyone was like , ` Well , why is that interesting ? Why would we want to watch how people make clothes ? ' '' Klum said . When `` Project Runway '' finally found a network to call home , she said , what really led to success was word of mouth .

Klum told Morgan that audiences love the show `` because it 's really about talent . ''

When Morgan asked Klum if she grew up dreaming of being a model , the Germany native told the CNN host that as a child , she did n't even know that modeling was a career option .

`` I did n't even know that that was a job , to be honest , '' she said . `` I wanted to be a fashion designer . ''

Klum called her entr√©e into fashion modeling `` pure luck '' and likened it to `` winning the lottery '' when she told Morgan the story .

`` I entered a competition , '' she said . `` I , literally , out of a fashion magazine , cut out a coupon with my girlfriend , sent some random photos in that she took of me , entered this competition . And it went on for six months . It was a model search . ''

Klum , who also host 's `` Germany 's Next Top Model '' in her native country , told Morgan that she counts getting `` Project Runway '' on the air among her most cherished business successes . She also called designing her real passion and said she continues to design : There 's a Heidi Klum for New Balance line of apparel and sneakers , Wildlife by Heidi Klum is sold on QVC , Heidi Klum on AOL , Shine by Heidi Klum , a fragrance with Coty , and more . Klum , who has lived in the United States since 1994 , became an American citizen before the 2008 presidential election so she could vote for Barack Obama . She holds dual citizenship and remains a German .

`` I 've been paying quite a few taxes in this city -- in this country , '' she said . `` And I felt that it would be right for me to vote for the next president . ''
