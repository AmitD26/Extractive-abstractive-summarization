Demonstrators pack public squares . Flames shoot into the air . Tear gas sends crowds scrambling . Bodies are carried from the streets .

Dramatic scenes are unfolding during anti-government protests in three disparate countries this week , on three different continents .

The images are striking , and things are heating up quickly . What 's happening on the ground ?

Here 's a cheat-sheet guide to the protests in Ukraine , Venezuela and Thailand :

UKRAINE

What are the protesters ' demands ?

Who 's a better economic ally , Europe or Russia ? That 's the key issue at the heart of Ukraine 's protests . Demonstrators want the government to forge closer ties with Europe and turn away from Russia .

But the dispute is also about power . Many in the opposition have called for the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych and the ordering of new elections . And both on the streets and in parliament , they 've also pushed to alter the government 's overall power structure , feeling that too much of it rests with Yanukovych and not enough with parliament .

Who 's protesting ?

An opposition coalition has been leading the charge against Yanukovych and his allies .

On CNN iReport , protesters and onlookers have shared more than 100 photos and videos of clashes between demonstrators and police . The nighttime images are especially striking -- figures are silhouetted against large bonfires set alight in the streets .

When did the demonstrations start ?

In November , thousands spilled onto the streets after Yanukovych did a U-turn over a trade pact with the European Union that had been years in the making -- with Yanukovych favoring closer relations with Russia instead .

What 's the latest ?

Long-simmering tensions exploded anew in Ukraine on Tuesday as clashes between police and anti-government protesters left more than 25 people dead and the capital 's central square on fire .

A shaky truce agreed to late Wednesday disintegrated by the next morning , as gunfire erupted again in the square . At least 100 people have died and 500 have been injured since Thursday morning , the head of the protesters ' medical service told CNN .

The Ukrainian government has not released an updated figure , but the Interior Ministry said earlier that one police officer was among the dead .

Foreign ministers from Germany , France and Poland met with Yanukovych on Thursday and are to meet with opposition leaders too . European foreign ministers convened an emergency meeting in Brussels , Belgium , where they are considering sanctions against Ukraine .

VENEZUELA

What are the protesters ' demands ?

Demonstrators are demanding better security , an end to goods shortages and protected freedom of speech .

They blame Venezuela 's government , led by President Nicolas Maduro , for those problems . Maduro and other officials blame the opposition for the country 's security and economic problems .

Who 's protesting ?

Many demonstrators across the country are students . Prominent opposition politicians have also led protests and joined marches .

Since February 13 , more than 1,100 images have been uploaded to iReport , CNN 's user-generated platform . Many of the videos and photos are gruesome and depict violent scenes between demonstrators and police .

When did the demonstrations start ?

Nationwide student protests started this month . On February 12 , the demonstrations drew global attention after three people were killed .

What 's the latest ?

As throngs of supporters chanted their support , opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez turned himself in to authorities Tuesday .

Lopez remained in a military prison Thursday as the government pressed terrorism and murder charges against him , his wife said . Lopez has denied the charges , which are connected with violence during the protests .

Maduro , meanwhile , has called members of the opposition fascists and compared them to an infection that needs to be cured . Officials have also accused the United States of plotting to destabilize the government .

THAILAND

What are the protesters ' demands ?

Protesters in Bangkok have been calling for months for the ouster of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra , who they allege is a puppet of her billionaire brother , the deposed , exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra .

Who 's protesting ?

Opposition to Thaksin and Yingluck is strongest among the urban elites and middle class . That 's why the demonstrations have been concentrated in Bangkok . The protesters want to replace Yingluck 's government with an unelected `` people 's council '' to see through electoral and political changes .

Thailand residents and visitors have shared dozens of stories of unrest on CNN iReport over the past month . The latest approved photos show demonstrators sleeping in the streets in Bangkok as a form of peaceful protest .

When did the demonstrations start ?

Protests began in November after Yingluck 's government tried to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for her brother 's return to the political fray .

What 's the latest ?

Deadly violence erupted in the heart of Bangkok on Tuesday as anti-government protesters clashed with police , and the country 's anti-corruption commission filed charges against the Prime Minister .
