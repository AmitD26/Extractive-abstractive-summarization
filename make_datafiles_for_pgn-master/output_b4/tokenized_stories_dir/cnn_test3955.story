A child has died after contracting a rare but deadly brain-eating amoeba infection while visiting a home in Louisiana , according to state health officials .

Officials believe the child is a 4-year-old boy from Mississippi who may have come in contact with the waterborne Naegleria fowleri amoeba while playing on a plastic toy water slide , St. Bernard Parish President David Peralta told CNN affiliate WWLTV . Water samples taken from the home tested positive for the amoeba , according to the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals .

The state health department has not released the child 's age or identity .

Out of what officials describe as `` an abundance of caution , '' St. Bernard Parish on Thursday began treating its water system with additional chlorine and flushing any potentially contaminated water from its lines . This treatment may result in changes in the smell , taste and color of the local water , the health department said , but it is still safe to drink .

While initial tests for the amoeba were negative , the health department said tests showed low levels of chlorine in some areas of the water supply .

`` We are working with the parish to make sure precautionary measures are being taken while we await additional test results on samples taken from the area 's water system , '' Assistant Secretary for Public Health J.T. Lane said in a statement .

The health department said the amoeba results may take up to a month to confirm .

The Mississippi boy 's death is the second widely reported loss of a child due to Naegleria fowleri in less than two weeks .

Last month , the same parasite killed Zachary Reyna , a 12-year-old from Florida . A third child , 12-year-old Kali Hardig from Arkansas , survived the infection that struck her after she contracted the amoeba in July .

Between 2001 and 2010 , there were only 32 reported cases of people getting Naegleria fowleri in the United States , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Most of the cases have been in the Southeast .

Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm freshwater , most often in the Southeastern United States . The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain . There is no danger of infection from drinking contaminated water , the CDC said .

`` This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of , '' Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC about Kali 's case . `` Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die . ''

The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection , including headache , fever , nausea , vomiting and a stiff neck , according to the CDC .

`` Later symptoms include confusion , lack of attention to people and surroundings , loss of balance , seizures and hallucinations , '' the agency website says . `` After the start of symptoms , the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days . ''
