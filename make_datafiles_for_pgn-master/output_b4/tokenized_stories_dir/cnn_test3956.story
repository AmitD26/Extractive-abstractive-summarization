One minute , Colin Patterson was watching TV . The next , he saw pianos flying through the air in the shop where he works as an explosion tore through the building .

`` They flew off the ground , '' said the piano technician , who also lives in the building in Manhattan 's East Harlem . He told CNN affiliate WABC that he crawled through the rubble and managed to escape unharmed .

At least four people were killed in the massive explosion and fire Wednesday that leveled Patterson 's building and the one beside it .

Nine people remained missing hours after the blast , city officials said . Firefighters were still frantically picking through rubble in search of survivors .

Authorities say they think a gas leak was to blame , but they have n't determined an official cause yet .

The massive explosion and fire leveled two five-story apartment buildings . At least 63 people were reported injured .

More fatalities appeared likely . Fire officials reported that two survivors suffered life-threatening injuries .

Near 116th Street and Park Avenue , once the heart of New York 's large Puerto Rican community , about a dozen firefighters tore at two-story-high mounds of bricks in a search for survivors from the two buildings , which housed a piano store and an evangelical church in addition to apartments .

As gas and electric utility workers tore up pavement in an effort to shut gas lines , people gathered in the streets , many crying .

`` This is a tragedy of the worst kind , '' New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said , `` because there was no indication in time to save people . ''

Call about gas leak proceeded blast

Con Ed spokesman Bob McGee said the utility received a call reporting a gas leak around 9:13 a.m. . The call came from a resident at one of the newer buildings on Park Avenue . The utility dispatched a truck two minutes later , but it arrived after the explosion , the spokesman said .

Edward Foppiano , the utility 's senior vice president of gas operations , said the cause of the blast was being treated as a gas leak , though there was no evidence of that yet . A routine service check , involving a truck with special equipment , detected no gas leaks on February 28 , he said .

Foppiano said one of the buildings had a gas leak in May 2013 , which was repaired the following month .

A building department official said one of the two Park Avenue buildings that collapsed received a city permit last year for the installation of 120 feet of gas piping . The work was completed last June . In 2008 , owners of the adjacent building , which also collapsed , were fined for failing to maintain vertical cracks in the rear of the building . The condition was not reported as corrected to the buildings department .

There were a total of 15 units in the two buildings , officials said .

Building department records detailed a litany of violations , dating back decades , for one of the collapsed buildings , including a lack of smoke detectors , blocked fire escapes and faulty light fixtures .

The National Transportation Safety Board , which investigates pipeline explosions , said it was sending investigators to New York .

The mayor told reporters that the report of the gas leak , which he said came about 15 minutes before the explosion , was `` the only indication of danger . ''

Longtime resident , public safety officer among victims

Marisela Frias , 44 , tried unsuccessfully to call her 67-year-old aunt , Carmen Tanco , a second-floor resident of one of the collapsed buildings for more than two decades . Frias called and called her aunt 's cell number but got no answer , she said .

`` Always she answers right away and if she misses it because she did n't get to in time , she calls me right back , '' Frias said .

`` Calling nonstop and it goes straight to voice mail , which never ever , ever , ever in my years -- and I 'm 44 -- of knowing her , ever can not get ahold of her . ... All I want to know is she 's OK . ''

Later Wednesday , Frias told CNN that her aunt had died in the blast .

Another one of the victims was a public safety officer at Hunter College , the school said on its website .

`` We are sad to report that , in an explosion that destroyed two buildings in East Harlem this morning , we have lost a member of the Hunter family . Sgt. Griselde Camacho , a public safety officer at Hunter since 2008 , who worked in the Silberman School of Social Work building , died in the explosion , '' the statement said . `` Our hearts go out to Griselde 's family at this terrible time . ''

The name of the other person who died in the blast was not immediately released .

The injured included two FBI agents who were in the vicinity of the explosion , said New York FBI spokesman Chris Sinos . The injuries were not life-threatening .

Blast shook Manhattan for blocks

One woman tried in vain to find her husband , Jordy Salas , who may have been on the second floor of one of the collapsed buildings . She fainted and was taken to a hospital .

`` We 're expending every effort to locate each and every loved one , '' de Blasio told reporters at the scene . `` Hopefully we 'll find that some of them are in other parts of the city and have just not been located yet . ''

Neighbors : Blast sounded like a bomb

Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano said responding firefighters barely missed the blast .

`` If we were here five minutes earlier we may have had some fatalities among firefighters , '' he said . `` Not being here may have saved some lives . ''

A new problem complicated search efforts Wednesday night , as a sinkhole in front of the collapsed buildings stopped firefighters from accessing some of the wreckage .

`` Heavy equipment , required to remove additional debris , can not be brought to the scene unit the sinkhole is mitigated , '' the New York Fire Department said . `` That mitigation is in process and will likely take several hours . ''

Clouds of dark smoke rose over the largely residential area of redbrick tenements and small businesses after the explosion , which some residents said sounded like a bomb .

Hundreds of firefighters responded , many spraying water on the roaring blaze from ladders .

Metro North commuter rail service was suspended as debris from the explosion landed on the elevated tracks across the street , authorities said . Service was restored later Wednesday , with trains running at reduced speed near the blast site .

`` I heard a big explosion , '' said a resident who identified herself as Angelica . `` I did n't know what was going on . ... My neighbors came banging on my door , telling me to get out . I guess they were evacuating the building . And I could n't get out . My door was jammed . Everything on my windowsill fell . I guess the impact of the explosion jammed the door as well . ''

She added , `` It was extremely loud . I could n't even explain it to you , if I could . It was just so loud . It woke me out of my sleep . That 's how loud it was . ''

Molley Mills , who lives nearby , said at the time of the explosion her building rumbled as if the subway was passing beneath it .

`` I went outside my terrace and there was smoke pouring out , '' she said .

The New York police bomb squad responded to the scene , according to a law enforcement source .

Once a predominantly Italian neighborhood , the stretch of East Harlem saw a large influx of Puerto Ricans in the 1950s . It went on to be called Spanish Harlem . In the 1990s , many Mexican immigrants began to move into the area , which has been gentrified in recent years , with many mom-and-pop shops replaced by restaurants and bars .
