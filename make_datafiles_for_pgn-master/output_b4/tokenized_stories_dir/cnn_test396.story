-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. and allied warplanes hit sites near the northern Syrian city of Ayn al-Arab , the scene of fighting between ISIS and Kurdish forces in recent days , U.S. Central Command confirmed Saturday .

A video released by the U.S. military shows a missile hitting a building . U.S. Central Command said it was taken from an F-15E fighter jet that struck an ISIS compound near Kobani , the Kurdish name for Ayn al-Arab .

In other airstrikes near Ayn al-Arab , coalition forces hit two armed vehicles at a border crossing with Turkey , the military said .

Syrian Kurdish fighters in Alishar , a village a few kilometers from Ayn al-Arab , said the airstrike hit an unofficial border crossing near the village .

The strikes are believed to be the first known coalition attacks near the border with Turkey . That country is not participating in the airstrikes and has repeatedly pressed for an international buffer zone separating the combat in Syria from the Turkish border .

A London-based monitoring group also claimed Saturday that other airstrikes may have also resulted in the deaths of six civilians near the Syrian city of al-Hasakah .

CNN could not independently confirm the report from the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights .

U.S. Central Command did say Saturday that airstrikes hit an ISIS vehicle and several buildings that were part of an ISIS garrison near al-Hasakah .

A purported video statement posted online Saturday by Al-Nusra Front , the al Qaeda franchise in Syria , condemns the U.S.-led coalition airstrikes . A man identified as Abu Firas al-Souri , spokesman for the group , denounced the participation of Muslim countries in the coalition .

In addition to U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft , warplanes from Saudi Arabia , Jordan and the UAE participated in strikes in Syria , which also targeted ISIS forces in several other locations , Central Command said .

A Kurdish fighter in the region and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had earlier reported airstrikes in the vicinity of the village of Alishar , west of Ayn al-Arab .

Coalition airstrikes also destroyed ISIS vehicles and a fighting position near Erbil , Iraq , Central Command said .

Kurdish forces have been battling ISIS for days to prevent the fall of Ayn al-Arab . It is the last Kurdish-held city in that region of northwest Syria following a swift ISIS assault that sent some 200,000 people running for their lives to Turkey .

Opinion : Airstrikes will not beat ISIS

At least four mortar rounds believed fired by ISIS forces have landed in Kobani , according to to Alan Minbic , a Syrian Kurdish soldier who was fighting in an area between Ayn al-Arab and Aidek .

A CNN crew witnessed the Kurdish fighters using artillery and heavy machine-gun fire to drive the ISIS fighters back from the ridge line they were occupying .

The developments come as the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS continues to grow . On Saturday , U.K. defense officials announced British fighter jets began flying reconnaissance flights over Iraq less than 24 hours after Parliament voted to approve the country 's involvement .

Denmark and Belgium also signed up on Friday , adding to a list of more than 50 European , Asian and Arab countries that have joined the fight , according to U.S. officials .

Anti-ISIS coalition grows , but that does n't mean victory is near

U.S. forces continue to hunt targets in Iraq and Syria , with aircraft taking off from the USS George H.W. Bush as often as every 55 seconds , according to CNN 's Becky Anderson , who is aboard the aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf .

The United States launched airstrikes against ISIS in August in an effort to stem the group 's breathtaking advance across Iraq . The group , which calls itself the Islamic State , routed Iraqi forces and took over vast swaths of the country . Some analysts warned Baghdad was at risk of falling to the well-armed , organized and funded extremist group without Western involvement .

While the most dramatic advances have been halted , Western leaders have warned of a long fight against ISIS , saying it could take years before the group is fully dislodged .
