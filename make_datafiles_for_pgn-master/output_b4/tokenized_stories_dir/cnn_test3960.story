-LRB- CNN -RRB- Introducing the Latina Meryl Streep , Act I .

When she was growing up in Chicago , that 's what Gina Rodriguez wanted to be . At the time , as the daughter of Puerto Rican migrants , that dream must have seemed unattainable . Now , not so much .

For the last several months , the NYU graduate has been winning praise for her acting chops . And Sunday , she became only the second Latina to ever win a Golden Globe award for best actress , for her role in the television show `` Jane the Virgin , '' which airs on the CW network .

The first was America Ferrera , who in 2007 took home a Golden Globe for her role in the television show `` Ugly Betty . ''

Among the performers in the audience cheering on Rodriguez 's win Sunday night : Meryl Streep .

What turns this from a good story into a great one is that Rodriguez -- recently dubbed the entertainment industry 's `` Next Big Thing '' by The Hollywood Reporter -- is more than just a talented actress .

We 've seen those before . True , given Hollywood 's antiquated predilection toward telling stories in black and white -- to the exclusion of Hispanics , Asians and others who do n't fit into that narrow color scheme -- not enough of the talented Latina actresses who came before got the recognition they deserved or roles that reflected reality . But they were there , on screen and on film .

Many Latinos have had Rodriguez on their radar for the last several months . It 's all because of a series of thoughtful and provocative interviews that she has given about her priorities , world view and career choices .

Read the interviews and you 'll see : What makes Rodriguez special is not that she can play a character , but that she has character . They do n't teach that sort of thing in acting school . You get it from your parents . And , in this case , Rodriguez obviously got it from hers -- Genaro and Magali .

In July , on a panel during the Television Critics Association summer press tour in Beverly Hills , Rodriguez discussed why she had turned down a role in Lifetime 's `` Devious Maids '' where Latinas are cast as -- oh , the suspense -- housekeepers .

She explained : `` I found it limiting for the stories that Latinos have . For the stories that Americans have , I feel like there 's a perception that people have about Latinos in America specifically -- somebody growing up in Chicago , English being my first language , Spanish being my second -- that we are perceived a very certain way . Our stories have been told , and they 're not unmoralistic -- you know , being a maid is fantastic . You know , I have many family members that have fed many of their families on doing that job , but there are other stories that need to be told . And I think that the media is a venue and an avenue to educate and teach our next generation . ''

She turned down a steady paycheck , with no guarantee that something else would come along .

`` I did n't become an artist to be a millionaire , '' she told the gathering . `` I did n't become an actor to wear Louis Vuitton . I have to give this dress back when we 're done . I became an actor to change the way I grew up . The way I grew up , I never saw myself on screen . I have two older sisters . One 's an investment banker . The other one is a doctor , and I never saw us being played as investment bankers . And I realized how limiting that was for me . I would look at the screen and think , ` Well , there 's no way I can do it , because I 'm not there . ' And it 's like as soon as you follow your dreams , you give other people the allowance to follow theirs . ''

When `` Jane the Virgin '' came along , Rodriguez thought the show -- which is loosely adapted from a Venezuelan telenovela -- was the `` most authentic , genuine representation '' of a Latino family that she had ever seen on television , she told The New York Times . It has the alluring spice of cultural references , but not to the point where it overpowers the palate .

`` For once , I was reading a script where they were n't talking about my ethnicity , '' she told the Times . `` They were n't putting a Puerto Rican flag on my shoulder . They were n't putting a taco in my hand . ''

In an industry full of people who are known for being shallow , self-centered and afraid to make waves , Rodriguez is none of those things . She is smart , brave and eager to challenge those in power to confront their prejudices and blind spots .

Oddly enough , these are the kinds of things that are supposed to get you in trouble in Hollywood , where people think of themselves as liberal and do n't much appreciate those who tell them otherwise . Remember the Sony hack story , and how flustered the liberal studio executives , writers , producers and actors became when it was revealed that some of what they say in private is n't very progressive ?

But Rodriguez is n't in trouble . Instead , she 's on the fast track to stardom . And , best of all , she seems intent on taking her community along for the ride .
