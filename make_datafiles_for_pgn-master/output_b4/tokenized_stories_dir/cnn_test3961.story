Ray Nagin came into the mayor 's office in New Orleans as an avowed scourge of corruption and led the city through the worst disaster of its modern history .

He left a federal courthouse a convict Wednesday , after a jury found him guilty of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and other favors from businessmen looking for a break from his administration . Of the 21 counts against him , he was convicted of 20 .

`` He got a lot of media attention as being a reformer , a non-politician , first run for office -- a businessman who was going to come in and get it right , '' said Pat Fanning , a veteran New Orleans lawyer and no fan of the former two-term mayor .

After Hurricane Katrina ravaged the city in 2005 , the onetime cable television executive would reassure people queasy about sending taxpayer money to a state with an epic history of corruption by telling them , `` Google me . You 're not going to find any of that in my record , '' Fanning said , quoting Nagin . `` Well , Google him now . ''

Nagin , who left office in 2010 , had little to say as he left the courthouse Wednesday afternoon , telling reporters only , `` I maintain my innocence . '' A small knot of supporters yelled , `` Keep your head up '' and `` He 's just a patsy , '' CNN affiliate WDSU reported .

His lead attorney , Robert Jenkins , told reporters his client would appeal the verdict .

`` We did the best we could do , '' Jenkins said .

Prosecutors argued the 57-year-old Nagin was at the center of a kickback scheme in which he received checks , cash , wire transfers , personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city . He faces up to 20 years in prison , but Fanning said a 14 - to 17-year term was more likely .

A January 2013 indictment detailed more than $ 200,000 in bribes to the mayor , and his family members allegedly received a vacation in Hawaii ; first-class airfare to Jamaica ; private jet travel and a limousine for New York City ; and cellular phone service . In exchange , businesses that coughed up for Nagin and his family won more than $ 5 million in city contracts , according to the January 2013 indictment .

During the two-week trial , prosecutors brought to the stand a string of businessmen who had already pleaded guilty to bribing Nagin . His defense did little to challenge their stories , Fanning said .

`` It was too painful actually to watch . They just swamped him , '' he said . And when Nagin took the stand in his own defense , `` He did a belly flop , '' often answering questions on cross-examination by saying he could n't recall who paid for a trip or perk .

`` He just looked terrible , '' Fanning said .

The earliest of the charges date from before Katrina , which struck when Nagin had been in office for about three years . The hurricane flooded more than three-fourths of low-lying New Orleans and left more than 1,800 dead across the region -- most of them in Louisiana .

Supporters credited Nagin 's sometimes-profane demands for aid from Washington with helping reveal the botched federal response to the storm -- a fiasco that embarrassed the George W. Bush administration and led to billions of federal dollars being poured into Gulf Coast reconstruction efforts .

But Nagin also had his detractors : Fanning called his performance during the storm `` a meltdown , '' a congressional committee criticized him for delaying evacuation orders , and his frantic description of post-storm New Orleans as a violent wasteland with up to 10,000 dead turned out to be greatly exaggerated .

As he sought re-election in 2006 , with much of the city 's African-American population displaced by storm damage , Nagin was blasted for insisting that New Orleans would remain a `` chocolate '' city .

Nagin won a second term despite the controversies , but left office with his approval ratings in the cellar and told CNN his career in public office was over .

`` I have given my pound of flesh , '' he said .

Nagin sought to have the charges dismissed in October after another federal judge blasted what he called the `` grotesque '' misconduct of prosecutors in the post-Katrina shootings of unarmed civilians by police at the Danziger Bridge .

The judge tossed out the convictions of five cashiered cops after ruling that members of the U.S. attorney 's office tainted their 2011 trial by anonymously posting `` egregious and inflammatory '' comments at online news sites .

Nagin argued that he was the target of the same underground effort , citing `` a continuum of pejorative statements and demeaning racial epithets '' aimed at him . The U.S. attorney 's office said none of the prosecutors involved in the Danziger Bridge case played a role in the Nagin investigation .
