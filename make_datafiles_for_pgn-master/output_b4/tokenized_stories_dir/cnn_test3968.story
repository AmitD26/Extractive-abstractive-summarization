I have an uncle who has always been a robust and healthy guy . He drank a glass of skim milk every day , bragged about how many pull-ups he was doing and fit into pants he was wearing 20 years before . He did n't take a single medication and retired early .

Given that he had no medical problems and ran his own business , he opted to go several years without health insurance . Eventually , when he turned 65 , he picked up Medicare .

What happened next was a little strange . He fell off the wagon . He exercised only sporadically , and paid hardly any attention to what he was eating . One day , I saw him eat an entire bag of potato chips . He bemoaned the fact that he was forced to buy new , bigger pants , and he stopped drinking his milk . For him , becoming newly insured had nearly the opposite effect on him of what we doctors hope to achieve . He 'd become unhealthier .

In many ways , my uncle was demonstrating a concept known as the moral hazard . Two economists wrote about this exact scenario in 2006

They found that many men , at the time they obtained Medicare , started behaving badly . Moral , or morale , hazard is a term largely used by economists to describe the actions of people more willing to take risks because they are insulated from the cost of their actions , in this case because of their recently obtained health insurance .

In the case of these men , when they got Medicare , they took worse care of themselves ; they actually exercised less . Among those who did n't visit the doctor after getting insurance , the effect was dramatic : Their overall physical activity dropped by 40 % ; they were 16 % more likely to smoke cigarettes and 32 % more likely to drink alcohol .

Even if that seems extreme , it 's still worth asking : Does health insurance make us healthier ?

The past five years have seen a tumultuous battle over Obamacare , or the Affordable Care Act , culminating in the bitter recriminations this fall over lost policies and the disastrous launch of the HealthCare.gov website . When I interviewed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at the end of October , she downplayed the concerns and seemed certain the site would be up and running by the end of November .

The website may be working better now , but to me that 's not the most important issue . In my mind , the real suspense comes from whether Obamacare will really make us a healthier America , even if it succeeds in its ambitions to dramatically expand coverage .

A healthier America : That is the goal we should share as Americans , but access alone wo n't get us anywhere close .

This past spring , the New England Journal of Medicine followed up on an important experiment in Oregon .

The state created a remarkable strategy to do a minimal expansion of Medicaid . It decided to conduct random lottery drawings to allocate the limited spots .

While it was controversial in its implementation , the situation was a goldmine for researchers . It offered something very rare in these types of studies : a unique opportunity for researchers to compare the newly insured to their highly similar counterparts , who remained uninsured . The results were surprising , and mostly disappointing .

The newly insured Medicaid population did go to the doctor more often , used more preventive health services and received more medications . Problem was , in nearly every area , they were n't any healthier . The scientists sat down with more than 12,000 people and compared some of the most important health indicators . They found having insurance did not improve measures of blood pressure , cholesterol or how well diabetics controlled their blood sugar . Furthermore , the 10-year risk of having a heart attack did n't change in those who had Medicaid . It was n't at all what the proponents of universal access to health insurance hoped they would see .

The results remind me of a column I wrote a few years ago , shortly after my own marriage . It seemed like a good time to explore the question of whether marriage was in fact good for one 's health . I spent a fair amount of time researching the topic and one of the experts I interviewed gave me an answer I have never forgotten : Marriage is good for your health -LRB- long pause -RRB- ... as long as it 's a good marriage .

It was a terrific answer , and a metaphor for so many aspects of our lives .

As you might imagine , I had quite a bit of fun with that article on marriage , but it taught an important lesson . There is almost always a second beat to any story . Being married all by itself is n't necessarily good or bad for your health . It was the effort required to make it a good or bad marriage that made up the entire difference .

The same can be said about health insurance . In this case , I do n't mean that `` good '' or `` bad '' insurance is the critical factor , but that health insurance alone does n't lead to better health . None of this works unless we all take personal responsibility , and hold ourselves accountable .

To be clear , there will always be some baseline benefit to being insured versus not being insured , even if you account for the moral hazard . A major Institute of Medicine report in 2009 found that uninsured adults are more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage of cancer , more likely to die from a heart attack and less likely to recover from a serious injury .

Even in Oregon , the newly insured enjoyed some benefits . For example , they were nearly a third less likely to suffer from depression , perhaps because they had more peace of mind from being insured . And there were significant benefits in nonmedical areas : Whereas more than 5 % of the uninsured faced `` catastrophic '' medical expenses in a year -- defined as greater than 30 % of their income -- those catastrophic expenses were virtually eliminated in the group on Medicaid .

But strictly in terms of health , insurance , like marriage , does n't guarantee good health . After all , I am sure you can think of people right now who have terrific health insurance and terrible health . It seems the benefits pale in comparison to what we can gain with a few simple personal decisions about our health .

A good example comes from a study in the journal Circulation . Researchers estimated that if all Americans exercised 30 minutes a day , we would reduce the number of cardiovascular events -- heart attacks and strokes -- by a third . A third ! Just 30 minutes a day , and suddenly we are starting to get serious about a more healthy America .

You can break up the exercise into 10-minute chunks , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and you do n't even have to knock yourself out . Just go hard enough that your breathing is slightly labored , enough that it would keep you from singing if you suddenly got the urge .

Problem is that as things stand now , only half of us , at most , exercise that much .

While we are fond of comparing ourselves to France , a place that was ranked as having the best overall health care system in 2000 , according to the World Health Organization , there 's a huge difference between the United States and France that has little to do with the health care safety net .

We Americans are three times as likely to be obese as the average French person -- and obesity is related to just about every chronic disease imaginable .

I think about this all the time , and here is what I tell my own patients . It is time to stop merely playing defense when it comes to your health , and time to start optimizing yourself .

Yes , of course we are desperate to stamp out disease when it occurs , but we are more desperate for those diseases to never occur in the first place . I say that as a neurosurgeon , someone who is often called in to extinguish the brightest of fires . I also say this , however , as a 44-year-old dad who wants to be around for a long time .

I have been fortunate to have always had health insurance , but a few years ago , I decided to strive for something more . I wanted to optimize myself . I wanted to be the best that I could possibly be , instead of waiting around for the seemingly inevitable diagnosis of heart disease or diabetes . I found that it was n't that hard . I became diligent about breaking a sweat every day . I made it as important as a meeting with my boss or a dinner date with my wife .

Also , as a student of neuroscience , I know the brain is n't particularly good at distinguishing thirst and hunger ; so most people eat when they should drink . As a result we walk around overstuffed and dehydrated . Drinking fluids all day long has cut my calorie consumption by a third .

Studies of the mind-body connection also remind us that it takes about 15-20 minutes for the brain to know the stomach is full . Stop eating when you are 80 % full , and you will likely take in the right number of calories . The Japanese call it hara hachi bu . To help , we use smaller plates in our home to trick the brain into believing we are eating more .

We eat meat occasionally , but no longer serve it in our home . I eat seven different colored foods a day , and try to buy locally grown vegetables whenever I can .

These are simple strategies that have made me biologically younger than I was nearly five years ago . At 44 , I have the biological age of someone in his mid-30s .

It is true that the American Medical Association supports the aspects of Obamacare that expand insurance coverage , as do many others in the medical community , even if they are n't convinced that it will reliably lead to better health . It appeals to a sense of justice , and a desire to prevent the awful situation of people being turned away when they need help the most .

But , as we follow the story of Obamacare over the coming years , it 's important to understand and agree on the true measure of success . As a doctor , I think a healthier America is the rallying cry we can all get behind . We have had a rocky , yet still vitally important start , but the point is that access to health care insurance is not nearly enough .

If we are serious about a more healthy America , the real change starts in each and every one of us , and it 's not that hard to do .
