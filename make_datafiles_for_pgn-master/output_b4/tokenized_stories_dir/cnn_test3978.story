Two Spanish journalists held more than six months in Syria arrived home Sunday , Spain 's El Mundo newspaper reported .

El Mundo staff correspondent Javier Espinosa and freelance photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova embraced family and friends during a joyous reunion on the tarmac of the Torrejon de Ardoz military airport in Madrid .

`` We want to thank everyone who has worried about us and who has made it possible for us to return home , and as you can see , we are perfectly well , '' Espinosa told those gathered at the airport .

They were later met with a standing ovation and tears by colleagues in the El Mundo newsroom , according to the newspaper . `` Thank you so much , '' Espinosa said . `` I 'm sorry for what we have made you go through . ''

El Mundo reported early Sunday that the men had been handed over to authorities in Turkey , and showed a picture of them together in apparent good health and spirits at the airport in Beirut . It did not go into detail about how they were freed .

The two journalists were kidnapped in September .

Garcia was traveling with Espinosa but not on assignment for El Mundo .

Espinosa , 49 , and Garcia , 42 , have made numerous trips to war-torn Syria , often together , and they organized their most recent visit together , foreign editor Ana Alonso earlier told CNN . Garcia has also worked with CNN 's Nick Paton Walsh on a number of stories about Syria .

Espinosa was previously kidnapped while covering a conflict in Sierra Leone , and Garcia was kidnapped in 2012 in Syria for about 12 days , said Gervasio Sanchez , a Spanish veteran war photographer who knows both men .

The newspaper reported in December the men were kidnapped at the Tal Abyad checkpoint in Raqqa province , close to the Turkish border , as they prepared to leave Syria after two weeks of coverage .

At the time , the paper said the journalists ' captors were reported to be members of a group linked to the al Qaeda-backed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and had not revealed demands to free the two .

Initially , the captors said they wanted to ensure the two journalists were not spies , El Mundo said .

The journalists were traveling with four fighters from the Free Syrian Army , who were also kidnapped , but released 12 days later . The fighters were supposed to have provided protection to the Spaniards , the newspaper reported .

In 2012 , Espinosa was in the same makeshift press center in Baba Amr , Homs province , where correspondent Marie Colvin of The Sunday Times of London and French photographer Remi Ochlik were killed .
