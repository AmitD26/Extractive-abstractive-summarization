`` I 'm sure that right across the country and indeed right across the commonwealth , people will be celebrating and wishing the royal couple well , '' said British Prime Minister David Cameron .

`` It is an important moment in the life of our nation , but I suppose above all , it 's a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who got a brand new baby boy , '' he said .

The new parents spent some time with their baby before calling family members -- starting with Queen Elizabeth II -- to announce the birth , a Kensington Palace source told CNN royal correspondent Max Foster .

Prince William remained at Catherine 's side throughout the labor and the baby was born vaginally , not via a C-section , the source said .

`` We could not be happier , '' said Prince William , according to the Kensington Palace source .

The royal couple remained in hospital overnight but hopes were high that they 'd make an appearance as early as Tuesday .

A multigun salute is set to happen that day to mark the birth .

`` Both my wife and I are overjoyed at the arrival of my first grandchild . It is an incredibly special moment for William and Catherine , and we are so thrilled for them on the birth of their baby boy , '' Prince Charles and wife Camilla said in a statement .

Earlier Monday , the duchess and Prince William traveled by car from Kensington Palace to the Lindo Wing at St. Mary 's Hospital .

The baby 's name may be announced when the family leaves the hospital , CNN 's Foster reported . Prince William 's name was announced a few days after birth , his brother Harry 's on departure from hospital .

Some British parents have delayed naming their newborns in recent days in hopes of either copying or avoiding the royal name , he said . British bookmakers favor the names James and George .

The child 's title will be His Royal Highness Prince -LRB- the baby 's name -RRB- of Cambridge .

The baby is third in line for the throne now occupied by the queen . Her son , Charles , will succeed her , followed by his son , William .

The queen returned to Buckingham Palace on Monday from Windsor Castle , another of her official residences .

Thanks to a change agreed by the leaders of the Commonwealth countries in 2011 and passed into law this year , the baby 's place in the order of succession would have been the same regardless of sex .

Previously , boys automatically trumped female siblings . So a first-born daughter could be pushed out of line by a younger brother .

The British monarch is also head of state in 15 Commonwealth countries , including Australia , Canada , New Zealand , Belize and Jamaica .

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered his country 's congratulations .

`` The arrival of the newest member of the Royal Family , a future Sovereign of Canada , is a highly anticipated moment for Canadians given the special and warm relationship that we share with our Royal Family , '' he said in a statement .

`` The child enters the world at a time of promise and opportunity for our two nations , '' the president and first lady said in a statement . `` Given the special relationship between us , the American people are pleased to join with the people of the United Kingdom as they celebrate the birth of the young prince .
