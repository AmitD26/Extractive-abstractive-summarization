-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russia approved the use of military force in Ukraine on Saturday , despite warnings of consequences from the West , and Ukraine responded by saying any invasion into its territory would be illegitimate .

The acting prime minister has gone so far as to say that a Russian invasion would mean war and an end to his country 's relationship with Russia .

But there are so many questions as to how Ukraine arrived at this point : Why is Russia so interested in happenings there ? Why does the West want to prevent Russian intervention ? How did we get here ? Why have thousands of protesters staked their lives , seemingly , on their desire for political change ? And why has the government resisted their calls so vehemently ?

Let 's take a look :

1 . Why has Russia gotten so involved ?

Eastern Ukraine and the Crimea have closer ties to Russia , while Western Ukraine is more friendly with Europe . Many Eastern Ukrainians still speak Russian , and the 2010 presidential elections divided the country with Eastern Ukraine voting heavily in favor of pro-Russia Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych . On Saturday , the Kremlin issued a statement that Russian President Vladimir Putin told U.S. President Barack Obama that Russia approved military action in Ukraine because it `` reserves the right to defend its interests and the Russian-speaking people who live there . ''

2 . Has n't Yanukovych stepped down ?

The Ukraine Parliament voted him out of power and he has fled to Russia . However , in a press conference Friday , the former President said -- in Russian rather than Ukrainian -- that he was not overthrown . He insisted he was still the boss and that he wants nothing more than to lead his country to peace , harmony and prosperity . While it 's unclear if he could return to power , Russia 's ambassador to the United Nations blamed members of the European Union for the bloody demonstrations that led to Yanukovych 's ouster .

3 . What will happen in Ukraine if Russia sends troops there ?

Top Ukrainian officials , including the acting President and prime minister , have said they are prepared to defend the country . They 've also said that any invasion would be illegitimate , a response echoed by the United States , which has told Russia to respect Ukraine 's sovereignty .

4 . Would there be international backlash to a Russian incursion ?

The United Nations has warned Russia against military action , while Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told Putin `` dialogue must be the only tool in ending the crisis . '' International leaders have also denounced the prospect of Russian involvement , while Obama has warned there would be consequences if Russia acted militarily .

5 . What sort of consequences ?

Obama has n't been specific other than to say Russia could face `` greater political and economic isolation '' and that the United States `` will suspend upcoming participation in preparatory meetings for the G-8 '' in Sochi . Several Republican leaders in Congress have called on the President to take a tougher stand .

6 . What are Obama 's options ?

Sanctions , of course , top the list of options , but the United States will need to prepare for the backlash . Former presidential adviser David Gergen says Putin would consider any sanctions `` small potatoes '' compared to keeping control of Crimea , while Putin could pull his support for Obama 's initiative to reduce nuclear threats in the world , including in Iran . Christopher Hill , former U.S. ambassador to South Korea , Macedonia , Iraq and Poland , says imposing sanctions also raises the risk of alienating a superpower . `` That means 20 years of trying to work with Russia down the drain , '' he said .

7 . What started the turmoil in Ukraine ?

Protests initially erupted over a trade pact . For a year , Yanukovych insisted he was intent on signing a historical political and trade agreement with the European Union . But on November 21 , he decided to suspend talks with the EU .

8 . What would the pact have done ?

The deal , the EU 's `` Eastern Partnership , '' would have created closer political ties and generated economic growth . It would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion , supporters of the pact said .

9 . Why did Yanukovych backpedal ?

He had his reasons . Chief among them was Russia 's opposition to it . Russia threatened its much smaller neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if Ukraine forged ahead . If Ukraine did n't , and instead joined a Moscow-led Customs Union , it would get deep discounts on natural gas , Russia said .

10 . Were there any other reasons ?

Yes , a more personal one . Yanukovych also was facing a key EU demand that he was unwilling to meet : Free former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko , his bitter political opponent . Two years ago , she was found guilty of abuse of office in a Russian gas deal and sentenced to seven years in prison , in a case widely seen as politically motivated . Her supporters say she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment .

11 . What happened next ?

Many Ukrainians were outraged . They took to the streets , demanding that Yanukovych sign the EU deal . Their numbers swelled . The demonstrations drew parallels to Ukraine 's 2004 Orange Revolution , which booted Yanukovych , then a prime minister , from office .

12 . Who 's heading the opposition ?

It 's not just one figure , but a coalition . The best known figure is Vitali Klitschko . He 's a former world champion boxer -LRB- just like his brother Wladimir -RRB- . Klitschko heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party . But the opposition bloc goes well beyond Klitschko and the UDAR . There 's also Arseniy Yatsenyuk .

13 . How did Yanukovych react ?

In a way that inflamed passions further . He flew to Moscow , where he and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Russia would buy $ 15 billion in Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas . And then , when the demonstrations showed no signs of dying down , he adopted a sweeping anti-protest law .

14 . What did the anti-protest law say ?

The law barred people from wearing helmets and masks to rallies and from setting up tents or sound equipment without prior police permission . This sparked concerns it could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech -- and clashes soon escalated . The demonstrators took over City Hall for the better part of three months .

15 . But was n't the law repealed ?

Yes , ultimately it was . Amid intense pressure , deputies loyal to Yanukovych backtracked and overturned it . But by then , the protests had become about something much bigger : constitutional reform .

16 . What change in the constitution did they want to see ?

The protesters want to see a change in the government 's overall power structure . They feel that too much power rests with Yanukovych and not enough with parliament .

17 . What did the government do ?

In late January , the President offered a package of concessions under which Yatsenyuk , the opposition leader , would have become the prime minister and , under the President 's offer , been able to dismiss the government . He also offered Klitschko the post of deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues . He also agreed to a working group looking at changes to the constitution . But the opposition refused .

18 . Why did the opposition pass on the offer ?

The concessions were n't enough to satisfy them . They said Yanukovych had hardly loosened his grip on the government , nor had he seemingly reined in authorities ' approach to protesters . `` We 're finishing what we started , '' Yatsenyuk said .

19 . Who was to blame for the clashes ?

Depends on whom you ask . The government pointed the finger at protesters . The opposition , in turn , blamed the government .

20 . What 's the takeaway here ?

Street protests that started in November over a trade pact swelled into something much bigger -- resulting in the former President fleeing to Russia for safety while still claiming to be the official leader of the country . With Russian troops rumored to be preparing for hostilities in the Crimea , the future of the region and the resulting effect on U.S.-Russian relations appears shaky .
