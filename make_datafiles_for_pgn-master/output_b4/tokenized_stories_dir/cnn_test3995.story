-LRB- CNN -RRB- Two Japanese hostages , one demand from ISIS : Hand over $ 200 million , or else .

The else being that the pair will meet the same gruesome fate as other captives held by the terrorist group , others who were shown in ISIS videos kneeling in orange jumpsuits in front of masked , black-clad men -- just like the Japanese hostages identified as Kenji Goto Jogo and Haruna Yukawa -- shortly before being beheaded .

In the latest video , a masked man gives the Japanese government a choice to pay $ 200 million -- the same amount of money Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recently pledged for those `` contending '' with ISIS -- to free the Japanese men . That deal holds for 72 hours , which would seem to mean sometime Friday , since the video appeared on social media Tuesday .

Another move that theoretically could change things would be if Japan 's government halts its alliance with those fighting ISIS , which calls itself the Islamic State . Tokyo has n't participated in airstrikes aimed at the Islamist extremist group , though its leaders have supported those who have , as well as the Iraqi government .

`` Although you are more than 8,500 kilometers away from the Islamic State , you willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade , '' the masked man on the video posted Tuesday says , addressing his comments to Abe .

But Abe , who is visiting the Middle East , did n't seem about to bargain Tuesday .

He stood by a pledge , made in a speech at the weekend in Cairo , for funding to help build `` human capacities , infrastructure and so on '' for those affected by ISIS ' armed campaign .

`` The pledge aid is very important to the refugees in need and has nothing to do with the Islamic communities or the radical militants , '' the Prime Minister said . '' ... We will contribute to the -LRB- region 's -RRB- peace and stability , in cooperation with the global community . ''

As to the ISIS threat against two of his nation 's citizens , Abe called it `` unacceptable . ''

`` I feel angry about it , '' he said . `` I strongly urge them to immediately release the hostages without harming them . ''

ISIS has asked for ransoms before , and apparently has been paid them . But rarely are such demands made publicly . Even rarer -- unprecedented , in fact -- is when the militant group puts its captives on video and threatens them , then lets them go .

Instead , ISIS has made a public show out of its threatening and killings of Western hostages , starting with August 's beheading of U.S. journalist James Foley .

Others ' killings were similarly recorded and posted online , including American journalist Steven Sotloff , British aid worker David Haines , British taxi driver Alan Henning and U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig .

While not participating in ground combat , both the United States and Great Britain have taken an active role in the anti-ISIS fight with airstrikes and training , arming and otherwise supporting groups -- such as Iraq 's military , Kurdish fighters and moderate Syrian opposition -- taking on the militants face-to-face .

That 's not the case for Japan , whose post-World War II constitution allows it to use its military only for self-defense . But Tokyo is a strong ally with Western powers , such as the United States , that have been singled out by ISIS .

In his remarks Tuesday in Jerusalem , Abe -- who dealt with another hostage crisis involving Islamic militants in January 2013 , when 10 Japanese citizens were caught up in the terrorist seizure of a natural gas facility in Algeria -- said he had ordered Japanese officials to do the utmost to try to save the two men .

At the same time , the Prime Minister added , `` Terrorists should not be forgiven , for any reason . I criticize -LRB- the taking of hostages -RRB- emphatically . ''

The aim is to safely bring home two men who were in the same war-torn region for very different reasons .

Like Foley and Sotloff , Goto went there to help tell the story of what was happening in Iraq and Syria . In recent months , ISIS militants have managed to take over vast swaths of both countries , ruthlessly going after many in their way who do n't share their extremist interpretation of Islam .

The ISIS video refers to him as `` Kenji Goto Jogo , '' but on his Twitter handle -- and a photograph accredited to him -- he 's just called Kenji Goto .

The freelance journalist reported for various Japanese news organizations about the situation in the northern Syrian battleground city of Kobani , which for weeks has been under siege by ISIS , and other areas .

While it 's not known when he was taken captive , Goto 's last Twitter post was on October 23 .

The man purportedly shown along with him , Yukawa , is believed to have been captured in Syria in August while traveling with rebel fighters , according to the Japanese news agency Kyodo .

The 42-year-old claimed to have set up a company in Tokyo providing armed security services and posted videos online of his activities in Iraq and Syria .

But a report by the news agency Reuters in August portrayed him as a lost soul , who went to the Middle East searching for a purpose after losing his wife , his business and his home over the previous decade .

Kyodo reported previously that Japanese officials in Jordan had being trying to secure his release , including talking to various groups with possible connections to his captors .

Abe spoke firmly Tuesday against the terrorists and their $ 200 million ransom demand .

What he did not do , however , is rule out the Japanese government paying ransom or negotiating with its two citizens ' captors .

Like most countries , Japan has never advertised that it or Japanese companies have paid ransom for hostages . In fact , Japanese government officials have at times denied such a practice , and Japan is a signatory to a 2013 G8 communique that stated , `` We unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists , and we call on countries and companies around the world to follow our lead to stamp this out . ''

One reason for this policy is that ISIS and groups like it can use ransoms to fund their bloody campaigns . Paying ransoms also may give them incentive to take more hostages , thus putting more people at risk . And ransoms might not always work , since ISIS and other hostage takers are n't usually seen as trustworthy .

Still , ruling out ransoms also rules out one peaceful way to free Goto and Yukawa . It 's possible someone else may intervene to negotiate their release , whether out of goodwill or in exchange for something else . Or troops from a Japanese ally could launch a raid to get to them , like the unsuccessful one this summer to free Foley .

Either way , others could play a role in this story before it 's done -- hence Abe 's comment Tuesday that the international community `` needs to deal with terrorists without giving in to them . ''
