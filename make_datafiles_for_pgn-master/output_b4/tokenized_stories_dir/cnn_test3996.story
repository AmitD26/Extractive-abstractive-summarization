-LRB- CNN -RRB- A little more than a minute .

That 's all it took for the exchange to turn deadly .

The Police Department in Bridgeton , New Jersey , released video this week showing the death of Jerame Reid , 36 , who was shot on the night of December 30 .

He was a passenger in a car that got pulled over for allegedly failing to stop at a stop sign .

The dashcam video shows what happened next .

Officer Braheme Days approaches the passenger side door . He asks how the two men inside the car are doing and identifies himself . The conversation is friendly .

Days asks to see a driver 's license .

Suddenly , he steps back from the vehicle and pulls his weapon .

Days shouts over and over : `` Show me your hands ! ... Do n't you f ****** move ! ''

He yells at his partner , Roger Worley : `` Get 'em out the car , Rog . We got a gun in this glove compartment . ''

Days reaches into the car and removes what appears to be a silver handgun . The shouting continues .

`` I 'll telling you , I 'm going to shoot you ! You 're going to be f ****** dead ! '' screams the officer . `` You reach for something you 're going to be f ****** dead . ''

And later : `` He 's reaching ! He 's reaching ! ''

Despite the officer 's entreaties , Reid appears to push his way out of the passenger side door . He gets out of the car with his hands in front of him .

Both Days and Worley open fire . Reid drops to the ground .

The vehicle 's other occupant did not appear to be injured . He got out of the car , lay on the ground and was handcuffed .

A December statement from the local prosecutor 's office did not identify the driver . It said a handgun was revealed and recovered during the stop .

Both officers have been placed on administrative leave , and an investigation into the use of deadly force is ongoing , the statement said .

Bridgeton Police Capt. Michael Gaimari described Days and Worley as `` very good officers '' responsible for `` a lot of key arrests . ''

Another statement released this week said : `` The Cumberland County Prosecutor 's Office is committed to conducting a thorough , fair and impartial investigation into the police-involved shooting death of Jerame Reid . Requests for the release of additional information while the confidential investigation is ongoing stand in the way of completing a neutral , objective and independent evaluation of the facts . This observation is not unique to this matter . ''

Gaimari said Days was one of four officers who arrested Reid last August on charges that included resisting arrest , drug possession , intent to distribute and failure to appear . The disposition of the case was not immediately known .

In addition , Reid had been arrested six times by Bridgeton police since 2009 on charges of making terroristic threats , harassment , burglary , obstruction , marijuana possession and stalking , according to police records . The disposition of each case is unknown . Police and court records list Reid 's first name as Jerome , but the prosecutor 's office listed it as Jerame .

In New Jersey , some local leaders are demanding that the state take over the investigation .

`` Jerome put his hand ups , '' said Walter Hudson , chairman and founder of the National Awareness Alliance . `` You can see Jerome 's hands are clearly up . ''

The Police Department reportedly released the video after a public records request was made by the South Jersey Times .

Does video of police tell the whole truth ?
