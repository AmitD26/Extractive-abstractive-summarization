-LRB- CNN -RRB- Prime Minister Tony Abbott has shirt-fronted the Australian public by awarding a Knighthood to a foreigner who already has a lot silverware in the pool room : Prince Philip , the Duke of Edinburgh .

As the nation choked on its cornflakes , many took to social media to express shock and dismay and repeat the question , `` Is this a joke ? ''

At an Australia Day function in Canberra , Abbott was forced to defend his decision and dismissed the reaction on Twitter as `` electronic graffiti . ''

`` I think that in the media , you make a big mistake to pay too much attention to social media . You would n't report what 's sprayed up on the walls of buildings , '' Abbott was quoted as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald .

Of Prince Philip , Abbott said : `` He 's the patron of hundreds of organizations . He 's the inspiration and wellspring of the Duke of Edinburgh 's Awards which have provided leadership training for tens if not hundreds of thousands of Australians over the years . ''

The 93-year-old duke is the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece , whose ancestors hail from Danish royalty . He married in Queen Elizabeth II in 1947 , who is head of the Commonwealth and is required to sign off on Abbott 's decision , an irony not lost on Australia 's comedians .

Gift for Santa ? More like a gift to Republicans , some said .

Abbott reintroduced damehoods and knighthoods last year , 28 years after they were retired under the leadership of Bob Hawke 's Labor government .

At the time , Abbott said the honor of becoming a `` Knight and Dame of the Order of Australia '' would be extended to `` Australians of extraordinary and pre-eminent achievement and merit . ''

`` My intention is that this new award will go to those who have accepted public office rather than sought it and who can never , by virtue of that office , ever entirely return to private life , '' he said .

So far , only one dame and three knights have been appointed , including Air Chief Marshal Sir Angus Houston , who has most recently led operations to recover lost Malaysian flights MH370 and MH17 .

Opposition leader Bill Shorten said Australia had entered a timewarp to extend the honor to English royalty .

`` It 's not about him , but he 's a British royal -- why would we give him our top Australian honor ? He 's already got a lot of them , '' he said .

Some wondered how Prince Philip would react to the announcement .

For others , it was an opportunity to revive some the Duke 's famous quotes .

Some thought it was sure sign Phil could take some of Australia 's other top honors .

And then there was the lone voice , calling for calm ... sort of .

At the time of writing , Buckingham Palace had yet to release an official statement . Though its Twitter account posted a link to learn more about `` the Australian Royal Family . ''

Abbott did n't take to Twitter to try to stifle the spray of e-graffiti .

His contribution to the great wall of outrage was a simple .

Not likely , ` Straya says .
