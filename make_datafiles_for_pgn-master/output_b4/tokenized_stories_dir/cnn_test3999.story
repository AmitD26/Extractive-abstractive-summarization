To become Google 's first female engineer in 1999 -- and , eventually , one of the most powerful women in tech -- Marissa Mayer had to get comfortable with risk .

`` I always did something I was a little not ready to do , '' she said last year while speaking on her best decisions in a talk with NPR Correspondent Laura Sydell . `` That feeling at the end of the day , where you 're like , ` what have I gotten myself into ? ' I realized that sometimes when you have that feeling and you push through it , something really great happens . ''

If the 37-year-old still makes career moves by her tried-and-true process , then she 's likely anticipating something great to occur in her new role as Yahoo 's CEO .

Mayer 's hiring last summer , which accordng to Fortune made her the youngest head of a Fortune 500 company , came as a surprise , and her high-wire decisions since have spread far wider than Yahoo 's campus .

First , there was her brief maternity leave after she gave birth to her son in September . When the Silicon Valley star first announced that she was pregnant , on the very same day Yahoo revealed she was the company 's new CEO , some saw it as a progressive move and hoped Mayer would set a new standard for mothers trying to balance the competing demands of their corporate and familial roles .

What they saw instead was a businesswoman eager to get back in the office and who said that having a new baby in her life was n't as difficult as she 'd been told .

But the real critiques came last month when Yahoo 's HR department issued an e-mail telling staff that they will no longer be able to work from home , prompting an angry backlash and leading some to question Mayer 's judgment .

While some found her position just , others hoping the new mom would create a more reasonable corporate culture interpreted the move as unfair , noting that Mayer approved the edict while building a nursery next to her office -- not an option for most working parents .

But over her nearly 14-year career in the tech world , Mayer has consistently shaken up expectations . If we 've learned anything about this influential computer engineer-turned-corporate executive , it 's that she plays the game of business by her own rules .

1 . She does n't do stereotypes

Part of the legend of Marissa Mayer is that she does n't fit into our assumptions of what it means to be a tech geek .

Much has been made of her looks , which defy popular culture 's assertion that the best computer scientists are `` people with pocket protectors and thick glasses who code all night , '' Mayer told Glamour magazine jokingly in 2009 . `` I do code all night ! I am the stereotype , but I also break the stereotype . ''

She also did n't grow up immersed in technology . Born in Wausau , Wisconsin , Mayer had a childhood filled with piano lessons , ice skating and ballet , plus debate and math club in high school , Vogue magazine reported in 2009 . The future tech leader told Newsweek the following year that she did n't even learn how to use a mouse until her freshman year at Stanford .

She 's said that she had a natural interest in the brain and how it worked , and at first wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon . When she happened to take a computer science class for non-majors and discovered a major called symbolic systems , she was hooked , she told NPR 's Sydell last year .

Soon she was climbing Google 's ranks , from programmer to vice president of local , maps and location services . But the press and public focused more on her posing for Vogue and reportedly shelling out $ 60,000 at a charity auction for lunch with Oscar de la Renta . A geek who loves fashion ? Who would 've thought ?

But as Mayer told The New York Times in 2009 , `` I refuse to be stereotyped . I think it 's very comforting for people to put me in a box . ` Oh , she 's a fluffy girlie girl who likes clothes and cupcakes . Oh , but wait , she is spending her weekends doing hardware electronics . ' ''

2 . Passion can trump gender

With two degrees from Stanford , including a master 's degree in computer science , and a successful career in a male-dominated industry , Mayer is often held up as a woman to emulate . During her tenure at Google , Mayer 's been described as being a key influencer on products such as Gmail , Google Maps and Google 's minimalist search page .

As a result , Mayer is frequently asked how she made it in an environment that 's seen as a boy 's club .

`` People will say , how can we get more girls into computer science ? And I think that 's a hard question , because just asking the question , I worry sometimes can handicap progress , '' she noted during a 2012 talk at New York City 's 92nd Street Y. `` I was really good at chemistry , biology , physics , calculus in high school , and my teachers were genuinely really supportive of that and they never said anything like , ` wow , you 're really good at this , and that 's unusual for a girl . ' They never really brought up the gender issue ... And I think I 've just always been very gender-unaware . ''

Her advice to other women seeking to follow in her footsteps is to find something that drives them and push past their preconceptions about gender roles .

`` I 'm not a woman at Google , I 'm a geek at Google , '' Mayer told CNN in 2012 . `` If you can find something that you 're really passionate about , whether you 're a man or a woman comes a lot less into play . Passion is a gender-neutralizing force . ''

And when it comes to feminism , Mayer shies away from the phrase .

`` I do n't think that I would consider myself a feminist . I certainly believe in equal rights , I believe that women are just as capable , if not more so , in a lot of different dimensions . But I do n't I think have sort of the militant drive , and sort of the chip on the shoulder that sometimes comes with that , '' she said in PBS and AOL 's `` Makers '' documentary , launching a debate about her remarks .

`` I think it 's too bad , but I do think that feminism has become in many ways a more negative word , '' she added . `` There are amazing opportunities all over the world for women , and I think that there 's more good that comes out of positive energy around that than negative energy . ''

3 . Burnout ? She 's not really buying it

Mayer has long been seen as the employee who can outwork you on your most caffeinated day . But she 's said that she does n't believe in burnout in the typical sense .

`` I actually have a very different philosophy about burnout , '' she told BuzzFeed last year . `` I do n't think that burnout comes from not getting enough sleep or not eating enough square meals . I think that burnout comes from resentment . ... It is possible to work ` too hard , ' but you need to figure out what things it really is you need to stay fueled up , to stay energized , to not get resentful . ''

Mayer 's intensity at the office appears to have held up even as she 's become a mom . Her maternity leave was just a few weeks long , and she worked through it .

Some critics wondered about the standard this might set in the corporate world , considering Mayer has resources that many other working parents do n't .

Yet the Yahoo CEO is n't thinking about anyone else 's standards of parenthood , as she told `` Today 's '' Savannah Guthrie when asked for her thoughts on being seen as a role model .

`` I 've really been focused on the products , what we need to do , '' Mayer said last month . `` There are so many great people at Yahoo , and so many great users that we want to serve well , that I really put my energy there . ''

4 . She welcomes challenges

One of Mayer 's mantras for making decisions in life is to a -RRB- work with the smartest people she can find , and b -RRB- go for a challenge that makes her feel like she 's in over her head . Say , for example , taking over struggling Web giant Yahoo .

Yahoo 's undoubtedly hoping for a turnaround in both its finances and its products , one worth that $ 1.1 million bonus that Mayer was given . Optimistic observers are waiting to see Mayer apply some of the smarts and aesthetic sense she showed at Google .

`` If Mayer were just another savvy Silicon Valley executive who 'd spent most of her career at one outfit and never run a company , she might feel like a quixotic choice for a big , troubled public company like Yahoo , '' Time magazine 's Harry McCracken wrote last July .

`` But she 's Marissa Mayer . She played a key role in making Google into ... Google . She 's famous for her obsessive focus on pleasing experiences , and the lengths to which she 'll go to measure whether something 's working for users or not . ''

5 . If she needs to test 41 different shades of blue , she will

Mayer told San Francisco magazine in 2008 that she 's `` a businesswoman first and foremost , '' but her passion for perfection and focus on data has n't left everyone starstruck .

Former staffer Douglas Edwards , who wrote `` I 'm Feeling Lucky : The Confessions of Google Employee Number 59 , '' recalled feeling perturbed by Mayer 's emphasis on testing and data . He remembered one occurrence when he said she changed the results Google provided so they 'd appear in a sans-serif font , because she 'd seen research that those were easier to read .

The Times similarly picked up on Mayer 's data-driven habits and perfectionism , such as when she wanted to test out 41 shades of blue for the toolbar on Google pages to see which one appealed the most to the user . Her managerial style was said to be so meticulous that Wired magazine put her on its 2012 list of `` brilliant '' but tough tech bosses .

Time will tell if this obsessive attention to detail pays off for Yahoo , and Mayer -- or whether her company 's problems are too big .
