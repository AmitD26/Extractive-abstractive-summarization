-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What if you could change history ? Would you go back and kill Hitler before the Holocaust ? Arrest Oswald before JFK was assassinated ? Stop Bin Laden before the 9/11 attacks ?

Of course you would .

But what if you had to stand by and let those events unfold in order to achieve a more perfect future ? That 's the premise posed in `` The Revisionists , '' a new time-travel thriller from award-winning author , Thomas Mullen .

In the future , there 's no hunger , no war , no crime . At least , that 's what we 're led to believe . It 's Zed 's job to keep it that way .

He 's been sent back in time , to something similar to our present , to protect the integrity of the future timeline . To do that , Zed has to make sure that an imminent disaster of epic proportions , called `` The Great Conflagration '' happens just as history says it will , or does , or did . In his mission , Zed faces off with other time travelers , enemy agents called Hags , short for historical agitators , who want to prevent this apocalypse .

Along the way , Zed crosses paths with an eclectic cast of characters , including a young Washington lawyer seeking answers about her brother , a soldier killed in Iraq ; a disgraced former CIA agent ; and a young Indonesian woman trapped as an indentured servant to a North Korean diplomat . Soon cracks start to appear in the timeline and Zed starts to doubt his mission .

Do n't let the description of the plot mislead you , this is not your typical sci-fi novel .

Mullen is less concerned with the intricacies of time travel , focusing more on the nature of history and how it 's shaped . As the saying goes , `` History is written by the victors '' -- but what if there were no winners in this scenario ?

In `` The Revisionists , '' Mullen presents a compelling and complex page-turner , a paranoid thriller for the post-9 / 11 age . CNN recently sat down with Mullen to talk about his new book ; the following is an edited transcript :

CNN : What was the spark that led to this book ?

Mullen : There were a lot of sparks . It 's a book that involves different narratives . I 'd had the idea of this guy who comes back from the future and has to prevent bad things from happening . He 's justifying his bad means because there 's going to be a perfect end . I just thought that was an intriguing moral angle . I thought it was fun and I thought it had interesting interplay with the idea of intelligence agencies occasionally doing bad things but saying , oh it 's for a good cause .

I 'd heard a story about this issue of domestic servants basically being kept as slaves in these really nice houses in D.C. because their bosses are diplomats who can hide behind diplomatic immunity , and I thought that was a really interesting idea but I was n't sure what I was going to do with it .

I was also interested in the idea of intelligence agents , either governmental or private , following peace activists , because that was happening . It 's not legal , it 's not supposed to happen , but you hear stories about police officers , mysterious agents , agent provocateurs with a group of peace activists , trying to get them all amped up so they would do something wrong so they could get arrested . You 'd like to think these things do n't happen , but you keep hearing about things like that happening . I thought that would be an intriguing story .

So , I was kind of juggling these different ideas , then I put it aside , but I still , every now and then , would work on it . There were a lot of false starts with this . It took me a while to get some of these threads together in a way that I liked them .

There were these different stories that I liked that I wanted to figure out and I asked myself , is this one book ? Do these things go together ; do I need to cut some of them out ? I did end up cutting out some of the activist stuff , but I wanted to find a way to thread these different narratives together and see if it could all come together . It may have been a little messy but I hope in the end it worked .

CNN : You really play with the idea of `` history '' in your book .

Mullen : As somebody who has previously written two historical novels , in a lot of ways this book is a departure for me . At the same time this book is sort of about history , how it 's formed and how we are products of our own history .

The question comes up in the book ; do we control our own fate ? Can we make our own history or are we just pawns ?

That taps into this conspiracist view of the world that created a lot of great fiction and film in the 1970 like `` All the President 's Men '' and `` The Conversation . '' There 's this sense that there 's this vast conspiracy of forces controlling us , that the government is listening to everything we do and there 's nothing we can do about it .

It 's easy to think that way , especially now , but at the same time we also believe we 're a country where a skinny interracial kid ... can become president . You never really know what 's going to happen ; you never know what 's going to be historically important . There 's the butterfly effect where one little thing here could change the world for someone else .

So I was thinking about that a lot and the struggle that we all feel ; how much control do I have over my fate , the country , my community ? Do I really believe in a perfect future ? Some of us would like to think we 're creating a better future , especially if we 're in politics or public service . We 're trying to take a bad situation and make it better . But how much better can we make it ? Are we just pushing a rock up a hill and it 's going to come down and crush us again ? Do we really believe in a perfect society and the idea that America is a noble experiment and we 're still working on it to try and get it right ? Can anything really be perfect and does that road lead to these totalitarian regimes ?

The desire to create a better world is a noble goal and we all have it but it can be taken in scary directions . When you have these totalitarian nations , these communist nations that say they 're creating a perfect society when really most of us would say they 've done the opposite .

Trying to control history , or the lack of control , that 's something the book deals with .

CNN : How did you handle the idea of time travel in your novel ?

Mullen : I did n't want to write a book with some guy zipping in and out of various situations ; I wanted it to be set in the here and now . I liked the idea of a time traveler not just for the moral dilemma but I think he has a great perspective on how he sees our world now , all the tensions in our society , the issues of race and ethnicity . To him he 's coming from many , many generations later . I was influenced by this Time magazine cover story , the face of the future and there was this computer program that melded thousands of faces , many generations later after all the races have mixed , this is what people will look like .

If I want to be realistic about the idea of a time traveler coming from the future , he 's not going to look like us , he 's not going to be a white guy , he 's not going to be a black guy , he 's going to be kind of this amalgam . In any book , it 's not a new idea in a time travel story to have everybody say , wait a minute are you just pulling one over on us , are you crazy , are you a reliable narrator ? That was fun to work in .

CNN : `` The Revisionists '' includes a lot of great detail about U.S. intelligence agencies . Tell me how you researched all of this ?

Mullen : As with a lot of fiction , some of it was smoke and mirrors and the rest of it was basically just doing a lot of reading . I was n't a spy and I do n't have any friends who were spies , as far as I know . The book changed a lot ; I went in different directions because the more I learned I would find a more believable way to advance the story . I think the initial idea I had would n't have worked as well and I do n't think it would have made you think , `` Wow , this guy knows what he 's talking about . ''

I learned as I went and I was able to tell a more realistic story as a result . But I did n't go on any drive-bys with any spies , although that would have been cool .

CNN : What 's next for you ?

Mullen : I 've actually written a lot of my next book already , it 's historical again . I 'm from Boston , Rhode Island actually , but I 'm a Red Sox fan . It 's loosely based on a real story , that I found out about in an offhand mention , about FBI involvement in Boston sports , it 's a legacy that dates back to 1945 when the FBI was following a group of communists who wanted to racially integrate baseball . I thought , Wow ! What 's that story ?

So it 's sort of a spy novel , it 's also got a bit of romance , and even comedy . I 've got an FBI agent , I 've also got a female communist sports writer and I 've got a baseball star of the Negro League back from World War II . I said I was n't going to keep writing in a historical vein but sometimes I see an idea and I think that 's just too cool . It 's been fun to write .
