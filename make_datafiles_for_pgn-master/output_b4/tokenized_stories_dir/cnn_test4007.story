Once known as the deadliest city in the world , the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez deserves a new nickname .

The city -- infamous for tales of unsolved murders and gangland shootings -- recorded 750 homicides in 2012 , a significant drop from the previous year when 2,086 people were killed .

Statistics from the Chihuahua State Attorney General 's Office show that Juarez ended 2012 with the fewest killings the city has seen since drug-related violence encapsulated it five years ago .

Opinions differ on why the homicide rate has dropped so quickly , but one thing is clear : Juarez is now a city where residents feel safe enough to walk the streets and go out with a relative sense of safety .

`` There is no superman , or one person that did all the changes , '' said Arturo Valenzuela , president of the bureau of public safety in Juarez . `` It was a multifunctional process . ''

Between 2007 and 2011 more than 9,000 people were killed , with the peak coming in 2010 , when Juarez saw a record 3,116 homicides , or about 8 murders per day , according to figures released by the attorney general 's office .

No single factor is responsible for restoring relative tranquility , but a key factor was that for the first time there was a team effort and coordination between local police and civil society organizations , Valenzuela said .

`` The players -LSB- that helped bring down the violence -RSB- have also been leaders of the local police and the politicians , '' he said , referring to new government administrations that came to power during this period . In 2010 Mayor Hector `` Teto '' Murguia took the reins from Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz , and the state of Chihuahua also got a new governor .

The withdrawal of federal agents -- often accused of corruption -- in 2011 also brought relative calm to Juarez , Valenzuela said . At the same time , the municipal police received better equipment and salaries under new Police Chief Julian Leyzaola .

The drop in violence is reflected in the city 's economic growth , Murguia said .

At least three new high schools and sports facilities opened in 2012 , and hundreds of businesses -- including restaurants , nightclubs and grocery stores -- reopened throughout the city , Murguia said .

The growth was supplemented by funds earmarked by the administration of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon , he said .

Murguia credits law enforcement , security specialists and `` no one else '' for the changes in Juarez .

But the sentiment among many Juarez residents is more cynical . They say that the bloody turf war between the Sinaloa cartel and the Juarez cartel that was responsible for the carnage has been won by the Sinaloans , led by the world 's most wanted drug lord , Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzman .

Chihuahua state prosecutor Jorge Gonzalez Nicolas disputed that view , saying that the most important factor in 2012 was the arrests of the heads of local criminal groups , including `` El Diego , '' the head of La Linea , the armed wing of the Juarez cartel .

Since October 2010 , there were at least 4,000 arrests , including the detention of 250 kidnappers and 200 extortionists , as well as the seizure of 2,500 guns , Gonzalez said .

The strides made to improve security in Juarez are noticeable , but the city 's homicide rate is still twice as much as it was five years ago . In 2007 , there was an average of about 0.82 murders per day . In 2012 , there were two murders per day , according to the attorney general 's office .
