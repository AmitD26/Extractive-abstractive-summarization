New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After more than 40 years in television , Regis Philbin is retiring from the small screen .

Philbin , 79 , made the announcement Tuesday at the start of the long-running `` Live with Regis & Kelly . ''

`` This will be my last year on this show ... but there is a time , there is a time that everything needs to come to an end for certain people on camera , especially certain old people , '' Philbin said .

The show , now in its 23rd season in national syndication , began as a local morning show in New York in 1983 .

Kathie Lee Gifford joined Philbin in 1985 on the show and it debuted three years later nationally as `` Live with Regis & Kathie Lee . ''

Gifford left the show in 2000 and Philbin was joined by current co-host Kelly Ripa in 2001 .

A choked-up Ripa said Tuesday after Philbin 's announcement , `` I think I can only speak for America and all of us here when I say that it has been a pleasure and a privilege and a dream come true , and I wish I could do something to make you change your mind . ''

No indication was given as to who may co-host with Ripa following Philbin 's departure at the end of the year .

`` It will never be the same , there 's only one Reg , '' said Gifford , who now hosts the fourth hour of NBC 's `` Today '' following her 15-year gig on `` Live . ''

Philbin has been plagued in recent years by health issues , including undergoing triple-bypass surgery in 2007 and a hip replacement in 2009 .

In 2001 , he was awarded Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Game Show Host for `` Who Wants to be a Millionaire '' and Outstanding Talk Show Host for `` Live . ''

Philbin got his start in show business as a page for `` The Tonight Show , '' before hosting his own self-titled show out of San Diego from 1961-1965 .

He served as Joey Bishop 's sidekick on `` The Joey Bishop Show '' and took `` A.M. Los Angeles '' from low ratings to No. 1 in its local market -- perhaps a preview to his success on daytime TV with `` Live . ''

Philbin was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2006 and was given the Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008 .

`` He 's an amazing guy , '' Gifford said Tuesday of her former co-host . `` He is every man to so many people and nobody tells a story like Reg . ''

`` He 's going to be 80 this coming August and I think he just figures it 's time , '' she added .

Philbin and his wife , Joy , have been married for 40 years .
