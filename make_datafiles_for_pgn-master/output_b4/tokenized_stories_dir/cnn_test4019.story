Two prominent newspapers this week used their editorial pages to call for mercy for intelligence leaker Edward Snowden , with one arguing `` he deserves better than a life of permanent exile , fear and flight . ''

The New York Times and The Guardian make the case for some sort of plea deal or clemency that would allow Snowden to return to the United States from Russia , where he was granted asylum .

Mercy or dropped charges have occurred in past cases of other high-profile whistle-blowers , such as Daniel Ellsberg , the military analyst behind the leak of the Pentagon Papers . But in recent years , the United States has aggressively pursued those who leak government secrets .

Here 's a look at how the cases of five prominent leakers -- including Snowden -- have played out :

Daniel Ellsberg

Ellsberg was the military analyst who leaked the 7,000-page Pentagon Papers in 1971 .

The top-secret documents revealed that senior U.S. leaders , including three Presidents , knew the Vietnam War was an unwinnable , tragic quagmire . Further , they showed the government had lied to Congress and the public about the progress of the war .

Ellsberg surrendered to authorities and was charged as a spy .

During his trial , the court learned that President Richard Nixon 's administration had embarked on a campaign to discredit Ellsberg , illegally wiretapping him and breaking into his psychiatrist 's office . All charges against him were dropped . Since then , he has lived a relatively quiet life as a respected author and lecturer .

Chelsea Manning

U.S. Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning , who formerly went by the name Bradley , was convicted of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of classified documents and videos to WikiLeaks , the online anti-secrecy group .

A military judge sentenced Manning to 35 years -- far less than the effective life sentence that was permitted under law -- minus credit for about 3Â 1/2 years time served .

The judge also reduced Manning 's rank , ordered that pay and benefits be forfeited , and imposed a dishonorable discharge .

Manning has applied for a pardon from President Barack Obama .

The Obama administration has said it will handle that request no differently than others . Manning 's defenders , including Ellsberg , said he was a hero .

Julian Assange

Assange is the founder of WikiLeaks , which published hundreds of thousands of secret State Department cables and other information taken by Manning that gave the group global recognition .

Assange 's case remains unresolved .

For more than a year , Assange has been holed up inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another .

Assange has repeatedly said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website . Ecuador 's government granted him asylum , but British authorities have said they will arrest him if he leaves the premises .

Mark Felt

In 2005 , retired deputy FBI director Felt revealed himself to be the whistle-blower `` Deep Throat '' in the Watergate scandal .

He anonymously assisted Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward with many of their stories about the Nixon administration 's cover-up after the June 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters .

The stories sparked a congressional investigation that eventually led to Nixon 's resignation in 1974 . The Post won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage .

Felt was convicted on unrelated conspiracy charges in 1980 and fined . He was pardoned by President Ronald Reagan before slipping into obscurity for the next quarter century . He died in 2008 at age 95 .

Edward Snowden

It 's too early to tell Snowden 's ultimate fate . A contentious debate surrounds his case .

On one side , many see Snowden as a traitor and criminal for unlawfully taking and disseminating National Security Agency files relating to its mass collection of electronic information , including e-mail and phone data .

Others see bravery in Snowden 's actions for bringing a secretive program to light and initiating a national debate about security and privacy .

`` Considering the enormous value of the information he has revealed , and the abuses he has exposed , Mr. Snowden deserves better than a life of permanent exile , fear and flight , '' the Times editorial said . `` He may have committed a crime to do so , but he has done his country a great service . ''

Still , U.S. officials have thus far shown no indication they 're considering clemency .

Last month , Attorney General Eric Holder said the conversation about balance between security and privacy is important , `` but I would not say what he did is worthy of clemency . ''

`` It 's not something that I would support , '' Holder said . `` I think that he has clearly broken the law and harmed the nation that he claims to love . ''
