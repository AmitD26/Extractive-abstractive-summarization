The 2012 London Olympics end Sunday with a music-filled closing ceremony at the Olympic Stadium , but there are still plenty of medals to be won . Fifteen events in 10 sports will take place across the capital on what is the last day of the competition .

Here are five things to watch for Sunday .

1 -RRB- The closing ceremony : Goodbye London , Hello Rio

London Games organizers say musical performances will be the focus of the closing ceremony , titled `` A Symphony of British Music . ''

Among the British acts rumored to be taking part are the Spice Girls and the Pet Shop Boys , singer Jessie J. and rapper Tinie Tempah . George Michael says he will be performing , too , tweeting over the past week that he is `` a bit nervous '' and has been `` rehearsing like crazy '' for the ceremony .

And like the spectacular opening ceremony just more than two weeks ago , which was directed by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle and characterized by a quirky exuberance , the closing will feature thousands of local volunteers and schoolchildren .

At the end will be the traditional Olympic flag handover to the next summer Olympic hosts , Rio de Janeiro . Artistic Director Cao Hamburguer said we 'll see `` eight minutes of Brazil '' with music , dancing and performances by musicians Seu Jorge , Marisa Monte , and BNegao .

The whole show , attended by many of the 10,500 athletes who competed at the Games , will likely be watched on television worldwide by about 750 million people , the London organizing committee says . It begins at 9 p.m. -LRB- 4 p.m. ET -RRB- .

2 -RRB- Men 's basketball : Team USA goes for the gold

In a rematch of its gold medal match in Beijing four years ago , the USA men 's basketball team will play Spain , the current world No. 2 , in the Sunday afternoon final .

The game will pit several NBA players against each other . Spain 's Pau Gasol is playing against his Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant of the USA , while Spain 's Serge Ibaka will play against his Oklahoma City Thunder teammates , Kevin Durant , James Harden , and Russell Westbrook of the USA .

The U.S. men 's basketball team has won gold at four of the past five Olympic Games , with the exception being the 2004 Athens Games .

3 -RRB- The men 's marathon : A scenic tour through London

The men 's marathon begins at 11 a.m. -LRB- 6 a.m. ET -RRB- on The Mall near Buckingham Palace . Its scenic loop along the River Thames will take it past landmarks including the palace , Trafalgar Square , Big Ben , St. Paul 's Cathedral and the Tower of London .

Ethiopia and Kenya , with three runners each , are the favorites to win the race this year . All six athletes have clocked personal bests of 2:05:04 or better , and one of them -- Kenya 's Wilson Kipsang -- achieved his best time of 2:03:42 last year . The International Association of Athletics Federations says Kipsang may be the hottest marathoner in the world this year .

A Kenyan win could pay tribute to Sammy Wanjiru , the 2008 Olympic gold medalist who died in a fall from his balcony last year .

4 -RRB- Men 's boxing : Five golds up for grabs

Five of the 10 gold medals in men 's boxing were awarded Saturday , and the other five will be given out Sunday in men 's fly , light , welter , light heavy , and super heavyweight . Kazakhstan and Great Britain each have two athletes vying for gold .

Ukraine 's Vasyl Lomachenko is seeking to defend his Olympic gold medal in the lightweight battle with South Korea 's Han Soon-Chul .

At 18 , Cuba 's Robeisy Ramirez Carrazana is the youngest of the boxers competing Sunday , battling Tugstsogt Nyambayar of Mongolia in the fly .

The super heavyweight match pits 22-year-old Londoner Anthony Joshua , competing in his first Olympics , against defending Olympic champ Roberto Cammarelle of Italy , 10 years his senior .

5 -RRB- Women 's modern pentathlon : An all-day affair

The first event to start Sunday will also be the last to finish . The women get going at 8 a.m. -LRB- 3 a.m. ET -RRB- in the modern pentathlon , starting with fencing and swimming at the Olympic Park .

They move south of the river to Greenwich Park for riding and the combined event , in which the athletes begin at handicapped time intervals based on their results from the previous events . They must run to the shooting range , hit five targets in 70 seconds , then run 1,000 meters -- and do it three times over .

The first athlete to cross the finish line at the end wins the gold .

Modern pentathlon is the creation of Pierre de Coubertin , founder of the modern Olympics .

`` The choice of the five diverse and unrelated sports that make up the modern pentathlon arose out of the romantic , tough adventures of a liaison officer whose horse was brought down in enemy territory , '' says Pentathlon GB , the national governing body . `` Having defended himself with his pistol and sword , he swims across a raging river and delivers the message on foot . ''

The sport originally took place over five days but changed to one day at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics .
