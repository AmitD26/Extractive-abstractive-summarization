-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mexico saw the first public protests this weekend over the government 's decision to allow cultivation of the first genetically modified corn , which environmentalists and others say could ruin the nation 's native crop .

A Greenpeace banner protesting genetically modified corn hangs on a Mexico City monument on Sunday .

About 45 Greenpeace activists hung a black banner and protest signs Sunday at the Angel of Independence , a victory column in a busy traffic circle on one of Mexico City 's major thoroughfares . It is one of Mexico City 's most recognized monuments .

`` Today , the Angel of Independence is in mourning to demand that the Mexican government protect our principal nourishment -- corn , '' said Aleira Lara , a Greenpeace leader at the protest .

The nation 's agriculture and environment departments approved two permits last week from among 35 applications to grow the controversial crop .

Unlike traditional crops , which are modified through selective breeding , genetically modified crops are engineered by having changes introduced into their DNA .

Genetic engineering can improve desired traits such as nutritional content or resistance to herbicides , pests and disease . The modifications also can increase tolerance for cold and drought .

Other genetically modified crops include soybeans , cotton and papayas .

Critics of the technique say they worry about the effect on consumers , other crops and the environment .

Germany earlier this year banned a genetically modified strain of corn , saying the government wanted to protect the safety of consumers and the environment .

Mexico said the genetically modified crops are in an experimental phase and will be planted on plots controlled by the government and isolated from other crops . The new crops also will be planted in states that do not grow native corn , which is a major staple of the Mexican diet . Corn is grown on about one-third of the country 's cultivated land , mostly in central Mexico .

But the Mexican protesters said they fear the genetically modified corn could harm the nation 's 55 varieties of native corn .

`` Without corn , there is no country , '' some protesters said . The slogan rhymes in Spanish : `` Sin maiz , no hay pais . ''

Two scientific studies have determined that transgenic corn has already contaminated some native Mexican corn fields .

In 2001 , a study in the journal Nature reported that transgenic DNA had been found in traditional corn crops in the state of Oaxaca . Earlier this year , research published in the journal Molecular Ecology also found genetically modified corn contamination of native Mexican corn .

Signs hung on statues at the protest said : `` Our corn first , traitors '' and `` Transgenic corn : End to independence . ''

Greenpeace and other critics say that modified corn would kill off independent growers , because they would have to buy their seed from one of four businesses that own the patents .

`` Farmers will be beholden to those companies when their fields are contaminated and no producer will be able to plant his seed , like they do now , because they will have to pay royalties to those corporations to plant again , '' protest leader Lara said .

In its February article , Molecular Ecology said that most of the current crop in the nation comes from private supplies of seed .

`` Maize is a staple food in Mexico , with a pivotal place in the country 's past and present economic , cultural and agricultural spheres , '' the article says in its introduction . `` In contrast to the United States and Europe , commercial seed sources account for only one-fourth of the maize seed planted in Mexico . Furthermore , Mexican maize is mostly grown by smallholder farmers who obtain seed from their own harvest or from other farmers . ''

Molecular Ecology also points out , though , that the `` introduction of transgenic maize has resulted in an increase in maize production . ''

And it is that increase in production that lies at the heart of Mexico 's decision to allow the two test permits , analysts say .

`` Mexico is a net importer of corn from the United States , '' said Bruce Bagley , chairman of the University of Miami Graduate School of International Studies .

Mexico grows two types of corn : yellow , which is similar to that grown in the United States , and white , which is native to Mexico .

The native white corn amounts to roughly 90 percent of the nation 's production . Yellow corn makes up the remaining 10 percent .

White corn is used for human consumption while yellow corn is used primarily for animal feed . An increase in meat and chicken consumption in Mexico in the past decade has led to greater demand for yellow corn for animal feed . Unable to meet this demand , Mexico has had to import about 89 percent of the corn it needs for feed , says the U.S. Agriculture Department . And 99.8 percent of that corn comes from the United States , the department says .

`` Mexico wants to produce enough crops so they do n't have to import foods , '' said Susan Kaufman Purcell , director of the Center for Hemispheric Policy at the University of Miami . `` Greater yields will lead to not having to import as much food from the United States . ''

There are other factors , such as increasingly common food shortages throughout the world that have driven up prices . The price of corn , for example , has more than doubled since 2007 . That prompted about 70,000 people to take to the streets of Mexico last year to protest the price of tortillas , which jumped through the roof in January 2008 .

`` Mexico is feeling the pangs of food insecurity , '' Bagley said .

Greater corn production and less importation also would ease the nation 's balance of payments .

Bagley also sees another reason why Mexico may have allowed introduction of the genetically modified corn .

The United States has pressured Mexico strongly to accept the modified crop , Bagley said . Mexico has acquiesced due to provisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement .

But if the experimental plots lead to greater contamination of native crops , Bagley said , Mexico could have the legal grounds to refuse widespread importation of the new corn .

Greenpeace does n't want to wait that long . The global environmental organization asked Mexico for an immediate moratorium on the use of the transgenic corn .

There has been no indication they 're likely to get it any time soon .
