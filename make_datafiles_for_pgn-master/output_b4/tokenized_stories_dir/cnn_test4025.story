Investigators are working to determine what caused a helicopter crash in central Peru that killed seven people , including five Americans .

The team was supporting oil exploration operations near Pucallpa , Peru , when the helicopter they were traveling in crashed Monday afternoon , according to Columbia Helicopters , the Portland , Oregon-based company that employed the victims .

Minutes after the helicopter took off from the Pucallpa Airport , authorities lost communication with the pilot , and people in the control tower could see a heavy smoke column in the distance .

A company official said Tuesday that it was unclear what caused the crash .

`` We 've notified all the authorities and are cooperating with everyone fully , and we 'll do everything we can to learn any causes ... of the accident , '' said Michael Fahey , Columbia Helicopters president and CEO .

`` It 's a very sad day for us . We operate globally , but we 're a family and we 're very close to our employees . And I personally knew many of the individuals who died as our other employees know many of them , '' Fahey told reporters in Oregon . `` We 're grieving for them . ''

Columbia Helicopters has dispatched an investigation team to work with Peruvian authorities , Fahey said .

The victims were the aircraft 's pilots and crew . No other passengers were on board , Columbia Helicopters said .

The two Peruvians killed in the crash were Igor Castillo and Luis Ramos . The Americans were identified as Dann Immel , Edwin Cordova , Jaime Pickett , Darrel Birkes and Leon Bradford .

A local police chief said three of the bodies were found away from the site of helicopter 's crash and explosion , and those bodies had no burn injuries , leading authorities to believe the three passengers jumped out before the crash .
