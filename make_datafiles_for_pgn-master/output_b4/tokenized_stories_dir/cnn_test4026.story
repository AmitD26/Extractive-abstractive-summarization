A 20-year dispute between a Nevada rancher and federal rangers over illegal cattle grazing erupted into an Old West-style showdown on the open range this week , even prompting self-proclaimed members of militia groups from across the country to join the rancher in fighting what they say is U.S. `` tyranny . ''

What began as a legal fight between longtime rancher Cliven Bundy and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management has escalated as Bundy kept his cattle on the federal land , and the government has responded by beginning roundups of the livestock .

A confrontation teetered on violence Wednesday when Bundy family members and dozens of supporters angrily confronted a group of rangers holding Tasers and barking dogs on leashes near Bunkerville , about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas .

Federal officials say a police dog was kicked and officers were assaulted .

Bundy family members say they were thrown to the ground or jolted with a Taser .

In the end , the rangers got into their white SUVs and drove away , a YouTube video of the incident showed .

`` Get out of our state ! '' the cheering protesters yelled at the rangers as they departed in several vehicles . `` BLM go away ! BLM go away ! '' they added , referring to the Bureau of Land Management .

The entire incident is now under investigation , Amy Lueders , the bureau 's director in Nevada , said Thursday .

To some , the 67-year-old Bundy is a hero who hails from a long family of ranchers stretching back to the Wild West .

To environmentalists and the feds , however , he 's an outlaw of sorts who owes U.S. taxpayers more than $ 1 million in unpaid grazing fees .

The U.S. government is rounding up Bundy 's cattle that it says have been grazing illegally on public lands in Clark County for more than 20 years , according to the land-management bureau and the National Park Service .

Between Saturday and Wednesday , contracted wranglers impounded a total of 352 cattle , federal officials said . Bundy says he owns 500 of the more than 900 cattle that federal officials are planning to confiscate for illegal grazing , the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported . Bundy told the newspaper that each head of his livestock is worth about $ 1,000 .

Since the roundups began , protesters have been confined to two areas to publicly declare their grievances , but the peaceful protests in recent days `` have crossed into illegal activity , including blocking vehicles associated with the -LRB- roundup -RRB- , impeding cattle movement , and making direct and overt threats to government employees , '' the two federal agencies said in a statement .

On Wednesday , a bureau truck driven by a civilian employee assisting in the roundup `` was struck by a protester on an ATV and the truck 's exit from the area was blocked by a group of individuals who gathered around the vehicle , '' the agencies ' statement said .

In the scuffle with protesters , a police dog was kicked , and officers protecting the civilian driver were threatened and assaulted , the two agencies ' statement said . `` After multiple requests and ample verbal warnings , law enforcement officers deployed Tasers on a protestor , '' the statement said .

The profanity-laced tussle was captured on a video posted on YouTube . A group that said it posted the video did n't respond to requests for comment .

In the video , protesters demanded to know why a backhoe and a dump truck were being used in the roundup -- and whether any livestock were killed . On Thursday , Lueders said the heavy equipment was used for field restoration .

`` No BLM ! No BLM ! '' the protesters chanted to rangers in the middle of a two-lane rural highway .

What sounds likes zapping Tasers can be heard in the video .

In the wake of the publicized protests , members of various militia groups have been traveling from Virginia , Texas , Montana , Idaho and Wisconsin and arriving at the protest site and Bundy 's ranch to support the family , said Stephen L. Dean , 45 , of Utah , a member of one such group called the Peoples United Mobile Armed Services .

`` It 's tyranny in government , '' Dean said when asked what brought him to Nevada .

And , he added , `` stealing people 's cattle . ''

One banner at the protest side stated : `` Has the West been won ? Or has the fight just begun ! ''

In removing Bundy 's livestock from public lands , the park service and land bureau are carrying out two U.S. District Court orders from two different judges .

`` Cattle have been grazing in trespass on public lands in Southern Nevada for more than two decades , '' the National Park Service said . `` The BLM and NPS have made repeated attempts to resolve this matter administratively and judicially . Impoundment of cattle illegally grazing on public lands is an option of last resort . ''

Added the BLM : `` Mr. Bundy has also failed to comply with multiple court orders to remove his cattle from the federal lands and to end the illegal trespass . ''

The bureau does allow grazing on federal lands -- it administers 18,000 grazing permits and leases on 157 million acres across the country , the agency said .

Bundy 's dispute with the government began about 1993 when the bureau changed grazing rules for the 600,000-acre Gold Butte area to protect an endangered desert tortoise , KLAS reported .

Bundy refused to abide by the changes and stopped paying his grazing fees to the federal bureau , which he contends is infringing on state rights . His family has been ranching since the 1800s , before the U.S. Department of Interior was created and endangered species became a federal issue , he said in an interview with KLAS .

`` My forefathers have been up and down the Virgin Valley ever since 1877 . All these rights I claim have been created through pre-emptive rights and beneficial use of the forage and the water . I have been here longer . My rights are before the BLM even existed , '' Bundy told the station .

`` With all these rangers and all this force that is out here , they are only after one man right now . They are after Cliven Bundy . Whether they want to incarcerate me or whether they want to shoot me in the back , they are after me . But that is not all that is at stake here . Your liberty and freedom is at stake , '' he continued .

And Bundy sees it as a state issue .

`` The federal government has seized Nevada 's sovereignty ... they have seized Nevada 's laws and our public land . We have no access to our public land and that is only a little bit of it , '' he said .

This week , Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval told the bureau of residents ' criticism of the roundup .

What Sandoval said he found `` most disturbing '' was the BLM 's use of a `` First Amendment area '' that confined protesters to a designated area .

Such an area `` tramples upon Nevadans ' fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution , '' Sandoval said . `` No cow justifies the atmosphere of intimidation which currently exists nor the limitation of constitutional rights that are sacred to all Nevadans . `` In response , federal officials are allowing the protesters to gather on public lands as long as they do n't impede the roundup , said Lueders , the BLM 's director in Nevada .

Bundy is digging in for a long fight .

`` I 've been fighting this for a number of years . It 's not about my cows , I 'll tell you that much , '' he said at a town meeting on Wednesday night . `` It 's about freedom and liberty and our Constitution ... and above all it 's about our policing power . Who has policing power today ? ''

With the growing controversy , it was uncertain Thursday how long the cattle roundup will now last . At Wednesday night 's meeting , residents gave Bundy a standing ovation when he publicly spoke .

`` I love you people . And I love this land , and I love freedom and liberty , '' Bundy told the crowd . `` I know without doubt that our Constitution did n't provide for anything like the federal government owning this land , and so when I pay my grazing fees -- if I owe any grazing fees -- I will sure pay it to the right landlord , and that will be to Clark County , Nevada .
