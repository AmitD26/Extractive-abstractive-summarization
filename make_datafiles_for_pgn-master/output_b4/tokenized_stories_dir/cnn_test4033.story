-LRB- CNN -RRB- America used to be a place where we said , `` Give me liberty or give me death . '' We live by a credo that `` freedom is n't free , '' and that our Constitution is worth dying for . How inspirational it is to believe that this is the wind of thought that blows underneath the Eagle 's wings .

Unfortunately , whenever that wind becomes just a little too gusty for comfort , we find out just how little relationship our poetic credo has to our collective guts .

The latest example : Nine seconds of video of a number of boys singing an offensive song . Immediately , the University of Oklahoma expelled two of the boys for their speech . Forget whether you like the speech or not . That is not relevant . These boys got kicked out of a public school for singing a song , on their own time , in a privately rented bus , simply because the government did n't like the content of their song .

Opinion : What 's the right way to face racism ?

Censors overstepping their bounds is no surprise . What surprises me is how readily the public supported the expulsions , and how many supposedly intelligent people were willing to turn the First Amendment on its head , because of nine seconds of video .

I do n't like the song or its message either . I ca n't imagine anyone reasonable who would . But I want to live in a country where the government does not listen to my songs and then decide whether or not I should be punished , based on what words I used . That is not freedom .

I understand that most of us hate racism . We are on a mission to eradicate it from all corners . But I am not willing to trade the First Amendment for a society where we do n't need to hear racist words .

In Abrams v. United States , Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a passage that ultimately became the cornerstone of a liberty-based view toward free speech , and which became the dominant theory in First Amendment jurisprudence . In Abrams , Holmes gave us `` the marketplace of ideas . '' And what a brilliant theory it was .

Holmes noted that if someone was completely confident in the belief that they were right , then it would seem logical that they would want to suppress dissenting views . `` If you have no doubt of your premises or your power , and want a certain result with all your heart , you naturally express your wishes in law , and sweep away all opposition . '' Those who wish to eradicate racism are certain that they are right .

I believe in a racism-free world . I have marched in counterprotests against the Ku Klux Klan . I 've stood up in places you do n't want to be , against violent neo-Nazis . And I would do it again .

But I feel no kinship with anyone who would harm the First Amendment to fight racism . Some things are worse than racism -- like a loss of the right to speak your mind and think your own thoughts . Unfortunately , that is a price that too many of us are willing to pay .

I am not . As certain as I am that my views on race are correct , I can not shake Holmes ' wisdom from my mind . He wrote :

`` But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths , they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market , and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out . That , at any rate , is the theory of our Constitution . ''

For that reason , I would gladly protest against the KKK , but I would never abide any government official denying the KKK its right to speak .

I understand those who would wish to do so . They want to eradicate racism , and the end will justify the means . However , we have slowly been descending into a place where we are trading this for freedoms that are far more precious than the freedom to avoid having our feelings hurt by offensive statements .

Of course , some say that these were more than `` offensive . '' The song was a `` threat . '' After all , it did mention lynching black people . But was that really a threat ? An idiotic ditty in an all-white bus ? To call it a threat is disingenuous .

What about the disruptive nature of the song ? Should other students have to go to school with people who clearly despise them , and who carry these offensive racist thoughts ? Yes . They should be free to have these thoughts , they should be free to say these things . If it crosses the line into action , or even imminent incitement to action , that 's another story . In this case , that never happened . The First Amendment prevails here .

Opinion : The danger society does n't talk about

It is easy to claim that these Sigma Alpha Epsilon boys did not deserve First Amendment protection . Many have said so . But , when you hear that , your immediate reaction should be one of skepticism . The First Amendment is not there to serve as a comforting blanket of civility . In fact , it is there precisely to protect the sharp edges . It is there for the KKK , the Nazis , SAE , and you alike . It is there for words that shock us , challenge us , and that bother us .

You should want to protect the SAE boys -- not that they deserve it . You should do so because the day will come that your speech is unpopular .

Once , speech in favor of racial equality was considered to be `` bad speech . '' Once , professors were kicked off campus for not being `` anti-gay enough . '' But , today , the thought of equality and tolerance have won out in the marketplace . Let that victory stand , without trying to cement it with the force of law , and without destroying the very liberty that allowed these `` good thoughts '' to flourish in the first place .
