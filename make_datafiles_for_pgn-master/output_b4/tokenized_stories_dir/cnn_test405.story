London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Coca-Cola -- the world 's ubiquitous brown fizzy drink -- is staying afloat as the soda market shrinks , and many point to a marketing strategy around the so-called `` secret recipe '' as key to its resilience in a struggling industry .

The Coca-Cola Company , which published its full year result Tuesday , recorded a 5 % drop in net income to $ 8.6 billion last year , down from $ 9 billion in 2012 , as it faced `` ongoing global macroeconomic challenges , '' according to its chief executive Muhtar Kent .

Volume grew 2 % for the year , which it said was `` below our expectations and long-term growth target , '' with sparkling beverages recording a slight increase of 1 % -- led by Coca-Cola .

Globally , soda drink sales have been shrinking as consumers turn to water , fruit drinks and healthier alternatives . The trend has hit Coke and other market players such as PepsiCo and Dr. Pepper . And while its primary competitor , PepsiCo , depends on its snack business to buoy the declining soda sales , Coke announced further investment into its marketing .

In a tough market , one strategy that brand experts credit Coke 's relative strength with is the mystery around the much-hyped `` secret recipe . ''

`` The very idea of mystery attracts attention , and is often seen as an element of quality , '' says social psychologist and marketing expert Ben Voyer , lecturer at London School of Economics and ESCP Europe Business School . `` A typical consumer would think that it must be a valuable product if they are doing all these things to protect the recipe . ''

Coca-Cola 's `` secret recipe '' story -- on which it has centered advertising campaigns and built into its corporate museum -- reaches back nearly a century . According to the multi-national 's website , the original recipe was only written down in 1919 , more than half a century after a reported morphine addict and pharmacist John Pemberton invented the drink in 1886 . Until then , it was passed down by word of mouth .

The formula was finally committed to paper when a group of investors led by Ernest Woodruff took out a loan to purchase the company in 1919 . `` As collateral , he provided a written record of the Coca Cola secret formula , '' Coke said in a statement on its site .

Since the 1920s , the document sat locked in a bank in Atlanta , until Coca-Cola decided to emphasize the secret in its marketing strategy . 86 years later , Coca-Cola moved the recipe into a purpose-built vault within the World of Coca-Cola , the company 's museum in Atlanta . The ambiance is made complete by red lighting and fake smoke .

Coca-Cola has always claimed only two senior executives know the formula at any given time , although they have never revealed names or positions . But according to an advertising campaign based around the recipe , they ca n't travel on the same plane .

The vault , like one straight from a film , has a palm scanner , a numerical code pad and massive steel door .

Inside its walls , there 's another safe box with more security features . And inside that , a metal case containing what its owners call `` the most guarded trade secret in the world . '' A piece of paper with , according to Coca-Cola , a recipe inside .

But Mark Pendergrast , author of `` For God , Country & Coca-Cola , '' is skeptical . `` John Pemberton invented Coca-Cola in 1886 , at the height of the patent medicine era , and one of the ironies of that name is that no one actually patented such creations , '' he says .

`` They kept the formulas secret , partly in order to increase sales with a sense of special mystery and to prevent competition , but also to keep people from knowing how cheap the ingredients were and how large the profits , '' he says .

The company has never patented the formula , saying to do so would require its disclosure . And once the patent expired , anyone would be able to use that recipe to produce a generic version of the world famous drink .

'' -LSB- The secrecy -RSB- creates a natural curiosity about the product itself . Consumers are more likely to try to find out the recipe , '' Voyer says , adding it creates a legend around Coca Cola 's flagship drink .

Scores of recipes have emerged through the decades . Their authors usually claim to have cracked the original recipe by getting hold of antique documents . So far , Coke has rejected all of them as fantasy , saying there is only one '' ` real thing ' . ''

Mark Pendergrast 's book includes two versions of the original formula . `` One is a facsimile in the handwriting of Frank Robinson , the ` unsung hero ' of Coca-Cola who named the drink , wrote the famous script logo , manufactured the drink in its early days , and advertised it , '' he says .

Does he think the recipe is genuine ?

`` Yes . I think that both of the Coca-Cola formulas in my book are the ` real thing , ' versions of the original formula for Coca-Cola , '' he says .

`` In the end , the exact formula is n't really the issue , '' he says . Pendergrast reiterates a tale told in his book , in which he speaks to a Coca-Cola spokesperson who points out that even if its competitors got hold of the formula , they would n't be able to compete . `` Why would anyone go out of their way to buy Yum-Yum , which is really just like Coca-Cola but costs more , when they can buy the Real Thing anywhere in the world ? , '' he was told .
