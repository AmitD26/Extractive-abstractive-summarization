New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday endorsed an upgraded U.N. status for the Palestinian Authority , despite intense opposition from the United States and Israel .

The resolution elevates their status from `` non-member observer entity '' to `` non-member observer state , '' the same category as the Vatican , which Palestinians hope will provide new leverage in their dealings with Israel .

Its leaders had been working with dozens of supporting nations to develop a formal draft , enlisting the backing of European countries such as France and Spain .

The vote was 138 delegates in favor of the measure , nine against and 41 abstentions , including Germany .

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the move , which many call symbolic , represents a `` last chance to save the two-state solution . ''

It comes on the heels of an eight-day conflict that raged between Israel and Hamas fighters , where a series of airstrikes and rocket launches drew international attention and threatened regional stability .

`` We did not come here seeking to delegitimize a state established years ago , and that is Israel ; rather we came to affirm the legitimacy of the state that must now achieve its independence , and that is Palestine , '' he said .

But Israel 's U.N. ambassador Ron Prosor said the move largely ignores the specifics of longstanding issues , such as settlements in disputed lands , and can not substitute for direct negotiations between Jerusalem and Ramallah .

This resolution `` does n't pursue peace , '' Prosor said , criticizing Abbas for being unable to represent the Gaza Strip , where a Hamas-controlled government presides .

`` It pushes it backwards , '' he said .

Izzat Al-Rashq , a member of the Hamas ' political bureau , welcomed the decision but made demands reflecting Hamas ' unwillingness to recognize the state of Israel .

`` We need to put this in its normal context as a part of the National Strategic vision based upon the rights and national principles without compromising an ounce of soil from our Palestinian lands extending from the Ocean to the -LRB- Jordan -RRB- river , '' he posted to his Facebook page .

He called for the establishment of a Palestinian state `` with Jerusalem being its capital '' on land that includes what is Israel .

The effort stalled last year when it became apparent that the bid could not get the necessary support in the Security Council . Observer state status does not require Security Council approval , unlike full membership recognition .

The observer status resolution needs only a majority of the U.N. 's 193 members to approve .

The United States and Israel have remained steadfast in their opposition , saying the move will not advance the cause of Middle East peace .

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice said American leaders could not support a measure that circumvents direct talks and cautioned that Thursday 's decision did `` not establish Palestine as a state . ''

Rice urged both sides to the resume direct negotiations without preconditions .

`` Israel is prepared to live in peace with a Palestinian state , '' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday . `` But for peace to endure , Israel 's security must be protected , the Palestinians must recognize the Jewish state and they must be prepared to end the conflict with Israel once and for all . ''

Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev called the resolution `` political theater . ''

Opinion : Why U.S. , Israel should welcome Palestinian move at U.N. .

But Palestinian leaders have said they had the right to go to the U.N. because Israel failed to comply with agreements signed more than two decades ago .

`` It 's about a contract . Our contract is that in five years , we should have concluded the treaty of peace and all core issues . This did not happen , and we 're talking about 20 years later . And going to the U.N. is not a unilateral step , '' Palestinian Authority chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said in September .

The last round of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority was in 2010 .

Erakat said the new status would eliminate Israeli justifications for building settlements in the disputed areas of East Jerusalem and the West Bank .

But Israeli officials disagreed .

`` No decision by the U.N. can break the 4,000-year-old bond between the people of Israel and the land of Israel , '' Netanyahu said .

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , however , threw his full support behind the new status for the Palestinian Authority .

`` What the Palestinians moved to do today in the U.N. , I think is in basic line with the strategy of a two-state solution , '' Olmert told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday .

The peace process is completely stalled at the moment , but Olmert said Israel must move rapidly toward a two-state solution . `` Time is running out for Israel more than for the Palestinians , '' he said .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who supports a two-state solution , said Thursday 's vote `` underscores the urgency of a resumption of meaningful negotiations . ''

`` I urge the parties to renew their commitment to a negotiated peace , '' Ban said .

Meanwhile in Washington , Israel 's Defense Minister Ehud Barak addressed his country 's relations with Iran and expressed doubt about sanctions against that country . The United Nations ' nuclear watchdog has said Iran is cooperating enough in a review of its nuclear programs .

`` I do n't believe that these kinds of sanctions will bring them to a moment of truth where they sit around a table and look at each others eyes and decide that the game is over , they ca n't stand it anymore , they are going to give up their nuclear intention , '' Barak said .

Barak was visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta , who noted how the Israeli defense chief announced his retirement from political life . Panetta praised Barak 's `` brilliant strategic mind '' and `` warrior heart . ''
