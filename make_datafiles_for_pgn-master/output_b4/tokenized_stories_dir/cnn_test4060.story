LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jamiel Shaw was just three doors from his house on March 2 . His father told the 17-year-old high school football star to be home before dark . That is exactly what he was trying to do when , just before dusk , gunshots rang out .

Gang members pulled up in a car and asked Shaw if he was in a gang . Shaw did n't have time to tell them `` no . '' He was mowed down before he could answer , police say .

His dad heard the shots from inside his house and immediately called his son 's cell phone to warn him to stay away . But within seconds , the father realized what had happened .

`` I just ran down there , '' Jamiel Shaw Sr. told CNN . Watch dad describe hearing `` pow , pow '' ''

His son was wearing the same shirt his dad had pressed for him that morning . `` He was laying on the ground and his face was so peaceful . I knew he was dead . ''

`` For three hours , I was just completely blacked out walking . ''

More than 7,500 miles away , Army Sgt. Anita Shaw was serving her second tour in Iraq . Her commanding officer called her into his office and told her to sit down next to the chaplain . He then informed her that her son had been killed on the streets of Los Angeles .

`` I freaked out , '' she said . `` I wanted to run out of the room . I was screaming and kicking . I was shouting , ` No . ' ''

Anita Shaw is now back in Los Angeles to bury her son .

Police announced Tuesday that an arrest had been made in the shooting . Pedro Espinoza , a 19-year-old member of the Hispanic 18th Street Gang , was charged in the killing and could face the death penalty if convicted , the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's Office said . Espinoza is scheduled to be arraigned March 25 .

Espinoza was released from jail -- where he was held on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon -- one day before the incident .

Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton Tuesday called on the community to help police locate a second suspect who was with Espinoza at the time of the shooting .

Hundreds of family members and friends gathered Tuesday at West Los Angeles Cathedral to remember Shaw , a standout running back and sprinter at Los Angeles High School who had good grades and stayed out of trouble despite his rough neighborhood . Among the schools recruiting him was Stanford University . Watch as family , friends remember Shaw ''

Blue-and-white flowers -- his school colors -- adorned his casket , and photos of Shaw over the years were displayed at the service . Eric Clapton 's `` Tears in Heaven '' played as mourners entered the church . `` He was a Christian and I thank God for that because I know he 's in a better place , '' his mom said , trembling as she sobbed . `` He 'd just try all the time to do the right thing . He was so good . ''

Shaw is one of several innocent victims in a horrifying three-week spate of gang-related shootings around Los Angeles . A man was gunned down as he held a 2-year-old baby in his arms . A 13-year-old boy was shot to death last week as he went to pick lemons from a tree . In another incident , a 6-year-old boy was critically wounded when he was shot in the head while riding in the car with his family ; two gang members have been arrested in connection with that shooting , according to police .

`` I think what is particularly unnerving for all of us is just the random nature of these shootings , '' Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said last week .

Bratton and Deputy Chief Kenneth Garner met with community members from the South Side of Los Angeles over the weekend to try to calm tensions between black and Hispanic communities . Among those in attendance were Shaw 's parents and his younger brother .

Bratton acknowledged some neighborhoods are rife with underlying racial tensions that have `` taken too many young lives . '' He said he is in the process of hiring 1,000 new police officers to help combat inner city gang violence . Watch Bratton describe an `` always underlying tension '' ''

`` There 's no denying that some of the crime in this city is a direct result of hatred , animosity , racial animosity , ethnic differences , '' Bratton said . `` We must all work to the best of our ability to try to prevent that . ''

`` None of it is right , '' said Garner . `` We ca n't get so incensed that we lose focus that it 's going on on both sides . ''

He added , `` Wrong is wrong . ''

The killing of Shaw has rallied his neighborhood . Dozens of people gathered outside his home for a vigil last week and placed candles , flowers and blue-and-white balloons at a makeshift memorial . One sign read , `` We love you ! Jamiel Shaw . ''

On the online social networking site Facebook , more than 100 people have joined a page called `` Good people live in our hearts forever RIP Jamiel Shaw . ''

`` Loved you lots babyboi ! Still do ! I know many , many , many people who are missing you right NOW !!! '' wrote Christina Stewart on the Facebook wall .

Another person , Harley Lally , wrote , `` Football will never be the same without you . I miss you every Sunday , and every time I step on that field . ''

Shaw , a junior , carried the ball 74 times for 1,052 yards this season , with an average of 14.2 yards per carry , according to MaxPreps Web site . The longest of his 10 touchdowns went for 75 yards .

He passed the ball one time all year in the last game of the season -- the last game of his career . It was a 60-yard touchdown strike . Watch mom 's Thanksgiving message to son from Iraq ''

But he will be missed for more than his football . The beloved player with the big smile meant so much more .

The father and son years ago had made a pact : Keep focused , stay away from drugs and gangs , and get into college on an athletic scholarship . In return , the dad promised to do everything for his son , nicknamed `` Jas , '' to make that happen .

Breaking down in tears , the father said , `` I guaranteed ` Jas . ' That 's why it hurts so much -- because I told him , ` I promise you , if you sacrifice these years , I 'll sacrifice with you . ' '' Watch Jamiel Shaw Sr. ask mourners to make a difference ''

The dad said more must be done to combat gang violence . `` It 's a gang problem and they have nothing in their heart for people . ''
