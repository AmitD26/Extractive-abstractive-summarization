ORLANDO , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prosecutors will not seek the death penalty for a Florida woman charged with killing her missing 3-year-old daughter , according to court documents filed Friday .

Casey Anthony has been charged in an indictment with the premediated murder of daughter Caylee .

`` It is not in the best interest of the people of the state of Florida to pursue the death penalty as a potential sentence , '' prosecutors concluded , according to the document .

`` Therefore , the state of Florida will not be seeking the death penalty as to Casey Marie Anthony . ''

Anthony , 22 , is charged with killing her daughter , Caylee Anthony , in a case that has received national attention . She was arrested last month and faces charges including first-degree murder in the disappearance of Caylee , who has been missing since June . Watch newly released jailhouse tapes ''

She could face a sentence of up to life in prison .

Anthony waited about a month before telling her family that Caylee was gone . Cindy Anthony -- Caylee 's grandmother and Casey Anthony 's mother -- called the Orange County , Florida , sheriff July 15 , saying her daughter would not tell her where Caylee was .

When questioned , Anthony gave conflicting statements to police , including some that were later disproved , according to hundreds of documents and investigative reports released in the case .

She claimed she dropped Caylee off with a baby sitter , but when police checked out her story , they learned that the address Anthony supplied belonged to an apartment that had been vacant for weeks . The woman Anthony named as her baby sitter told police she did not know her .

Investigators previously have said cadaver dogs picked up the scent of death in Anthony 's car , as well as in her parents ' backyard . They also said air quality tests conducted by the FBI found evidence consistent with human decomposition and chloroform in the trunk of Anthony 's car .

A neighbor told police that Anthony had asked to borrow a shovel . Also , analysis of Anthony 's computer found she had visited Web sites discussing chloroform , as well as Internet searches of missing children , according to information released in the case .

Last month , Florida 9th Circuit Judge Stan Strickland denied prosecutors ' request to impose a gag order in Anthony 's case , saying he could not state that continued publicity would pose a threat to her trial , or even that a gag order would stem the flood of media attention .
