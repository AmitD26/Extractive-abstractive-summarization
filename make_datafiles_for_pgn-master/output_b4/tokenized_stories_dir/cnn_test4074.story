GENEVA , Switzerland -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration has been talking about `` pressing the reset button '' with Russia after relations `` crashed '' when Russia invaded Georgia last August .

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laugh about their `` reset ' button .

When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greeted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday before sitting down to their working dinner , she presented him a small green box with a ribbon . Inside was a red button with the Russian word `` peregruzka '' printed on it .

`` I would like to present you with a little gift that represents what President Obama and Vice President Biden and I have been saying and that is : ` We want to reset our relationship and so we will do it together . ' ''

Clinton , laughing , added , `` We worked hard to get the right Russian word . Do you think we got it ? '' she asked Lavrov .

`` You got it wrong , '' Lavrov said . '' Both diplomats laughed . `` It should be `` perezagruzka '' -LRB- the Russian word for reset , -RRB- Lavrov said . `` This says ` peregruzka , ' which means ` overcharged . ' ''

The question came up at the news conference afterward .

`` In a way , the word that 's on the button turns out to be also true , '' Clinton said . `` We are resetting , and because we are resetting , the minister and I have an overload of work . ''

Asked by a Russian reporter whether he had pressed the button , Lavrov said that he and Clinton did , indeed .

`` It is big and red and I hope that Russia and the United States , and other countries will never press on another button which used to be associated with a destructive war , '' he said .

The `` overload , '' Clinton said , is a broad agenda of issues .

`` We are going to systematically go through each and every one of them , '' she added .

Clinton said the two sides will get to work on re-negotiating a follow-up to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and nonproliferation . On other issues like Afghanistan , the Middle East and Iran , Clinton said , `` We will work through them . ''

On issues where there is disagreement , Clinton said , `` We are keeping those on the list because , we think through closer cooperation and building trust in each other , we can even tackle some of those differences . ''

Lavrov agreed the burden of the agenda for the two countries is `` enormous , '' but added : `` I do n't think either Hillary or I have any desire to be freed from any burden . ''

Clinton called the encounter `` a very productive meeting of the minds . '' She said both Lavrov and she are `` very practical-minded '' and will create a `` specific set of objectives and responsibilities '' to present to presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev before the leaders ' first face-to-face meeting in April at the G-20 meeting in London .

On the START treaty , she said Russia and the United States intend to have an agreement by the end of this year when the treaty expires and are `` going to get to work immediately '' on it .

Lavrov was asked about Russian intentions to install S-300 missiles in Iran . He said the decision `` will be made exclusively on the basis of law in accordance with Russian law , and will be under expert control , which is one of the strictest in the world and of course in accordance with international agreements . '' Lavrov said the weapons Russia provides to its partners are `` nondestabilizing , defensive weapons . ''

In an apparent reference to U.S. military supplies to Georgia , Lavrov said , `` We want our partners to act the same way and show restraint in military supplies to those countries where , including very recently , those weapons have been used very close to our borders . ''

Senior U.S. officials who briefed reporters afterward , however , said they had not read Georgia into the minister 's comments .

They said the discussion ranged broadly over a number of areas and `` we now have a very substantive work agenda that they just outlined . ''

`` It would have been easier and in a first meeting almost natural to be much more general but in this case it was very focused and very productive in laying out steps , '' one official said .

On the proposed missile defense system the United States is considering installing in Poland and the Czech Republic , one official said , `` Minister Lavrov made it clear he had listened quite attentively to Secretary Clinton 's comments about missile defense ... and I think it 's got them thinking .
