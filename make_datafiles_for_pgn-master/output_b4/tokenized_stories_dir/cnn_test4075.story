-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dr. J. Stephen Jones had seven vasectomies to perform in a day .

Some urologists around the country are reporting increased numbers of patients coming in for vasectomies .

The schedule for Jones , a Cleveland , Ohio , urologist , has become more crowded during a recent boom in vasectomies .

`` My staff came to me and said , what 's happening ? '' said Jones , the chairman of the Department of Regional Urology of Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute at the Cleveland Clinic . `` Why are we suddenly having an explosion in guys asking for vasectomies ? ''

They looked at their statistics and realized the uptick started around November as the economic crisis deepened . October went down in the history books as one of Wall Street 's worst months .

Since then , the Cleveland Clinic has seen a 50 percent increase in vasectomies , an outpatient surgery that is the cheapest form of permanent birth control . Vasectomies are less invasive and cheaper than tubal ligation , which involves blocking , tieing or cutting a woman 's fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy .

`` It 's unlikely that some guy read the Dow Jones numbers that day and said , ` Why do n't we have a vasectomy ? ' '' Jones said . `` More likely , people have already been considering it and typically a guy and his wife have spoken a year or two about this . ''

Jones was told by patients that they were getting vasectomies because they were losing their jobs and health insurance , or concerned about being out of work soon .

`` They realize they do n't have the financial security long-term with what 's going on , '' Jones said . `` Several of them have mentioned , ` We ca n't afford to have any more children in this economy . ' My perception is that it 's more of the concept of raising children in an uncertain economic future . ''

Much like Jones , Dr. Marc Goldstein , surgeon-in-chief of male reproductive medicine and surgery at the Cornell Institute for Reproductive Medicine in New York , saw a 48 percent increase in vasectomy consultations compared with the same time last year .

`` I have never seen anything like this , '' said Goldstein , a urologist for the last 30 years . `` When things started to go south in the stock market , then the vasectomy consults went north . ''

Half of Goldstein 's New York patients work in the financial sector . New patients filed into his office in November .

`` I think the situation of finance and the economy is the major reason , '' Goldstein said . `` Some of them have mentioned that , ` It cost $ 30,000 a year to put my kids in private school and I ca n't afford to have another one . ' It 's never the sole reason , but it 's certainly a contributing factor . ''

During the vasectomy , the doctor cuts the two vas deferens , which are the tubes carrying sperm from the testicles to become semen . After the procedure , men can still have sex , but their semen does not contain sperm and therefore they can no longer father children .

Doctors can attempt to reverse the procedure , but vasectomy reversals are expensive and only work half the time in restoring sperm flow .

Carl Haub , a demographer with the Population Reference Bureau , a private research firm , said the National Center for Health Statistics ' data showed that , `` During bad economic times , the Depression and the recession in the 1970s , the birth rate did go down . '' See the chart on fertility rates in the United States from 1917 to 2007 ''

`` Some folks will postpone having kids , '' he said . `` If you had a vasectomy , you 've made a bigger decision that you 're never going to have another child . ''

When people stop having children , it implies a loss of confidence in their future employment prospects .

`` Am I going to have a job in six months or a year from now ? '' Haub said . `` If I 'm concerned about that , people are not going to increase their financial obligations ... It 's na√Øve to say the economy did n't play a significant role in lowering the birth rate . ''

It 's too early to tell whether this recession has crimped the birth rate , Haub said .

At this point , most of the evidence of increased vasectomies has been anecdotal from practicing urologists , because there is no national registry for sterilizations .

The number of appointment requests spiked 30 percent in January 2009 on the Web site vasectomy.com , which links people with local urologists . But throughout the last few months , appointment requests have been fairly level , said Dr. Ted Benderev , founder of the site .

Dr. Lawrence Ross , a professor of urology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and former president of the American Urological Association , said the school 's clinics have seen moderate increases in the last six months to a year and that vasectomies are growing popular among lower-income clients .

`` My guess is that since economic times have worsened , people are concerned about their ability to raise larger families and are opting for more permanent birth control , '' Ross said .

People who are concerned about losing their health insurance are trying to take advantage of the coverage for a procedure they 've long considered .

`` It may have something to do with the economy , '' said Dr. Bryan Kansas , a urologist . `` I ca n't count on my hands , in the last three months , the number of times someone has said they 're about to lose their insurance and ask to squeeze them in . ''

He and his colleagues have seen a similar uptick in their Austin , Texas , practice called The Urology Team .

Throughout March Madness , Kansas ' office has a special on vasectomies called , `` Vas-Madness '' to capitalize on their patient 's obsession with the college basketball tournament .

Patients `` would love to have a procedure , go home and sit there when you 've got all-day programming , watch basketball , '' Kansas said .

After the less-than-hourlong procedure , patients usually spend a day or two recovering , moving gingerly and icing the soreness . Some men time their vasectomies around the time of major sports events such as the Masters Golf Tournament and the NCAA basketball tournament to keep themselves entertained during recovery .

Vasectomies are likely to produce tenderness , discomfort and slight swelling and the patient is usually able to return to usual activities within a week .
