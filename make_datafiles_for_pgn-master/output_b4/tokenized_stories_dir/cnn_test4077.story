ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Imagine the Batmobile busting bad guys in Bismarck , North Dakota , or `` Knight Rider 's '' KITT corralling criminals on the Pennsylvania Turnpike .

Carbon Motors Corp. 's E7 concept vehicle was on display recently near the U.S. Capitol .

Carbon Motors Corp. 's new high-tech cop car prototype might not be quite up to superhero specs , but some police say it could be a welcome addition to their arsenal .

`` I do n't see any downside to this car , '' said Carl Latorre , a Pennsylvania State Police dispatcher who served 35 years as a Philadelphia police officer . `` I am so excited about this car . This car rates up there with cops carrying automatic weapons to combat what the criminals carry now . It 's about time that something like this came about . ''

OK , so it does n't have a nanotech cloaking capability or rocket boosters , but every feature on the Carbon E7 concept vehicle draws on suggestions from more than 3,000 law enforcement professionals .

The result is a futuristic prowler with a 300-horsepower clean diesel engine , flashing lights visible from all angles , an ergonomic cockpit , an onboard computer with voice command and instant license plate recognition , integrated shotgun mounts , and more . -LRB- Weapons of mass destruction detectors are available as an option -- seriously . -RRB- See how the E7 stacks up against KITT and the Dark Knight 's Tumbler ''

The E7 was designed by cops for cops , breaking the tradition of recruiting family sedans into the force , company co-founder Stacy Dean Stephens said .

`` The current vehicles that they -LRB- police departments -RRB- use were designed for driving around , going to the grocery store , taking kids to school -- things like that , '' Stephens said .

`` You do n't have an engineer sitting at one of the other automakers who says , ` Y' know , I think what we need to do is we need to take this car , and we need to run into a curb at 50 miles an hour and see how many times it takes before the wheels and the suspension fails on it . ''

The rear passenger compartment alone is enough to make experienced cops get teary-eyed . The rear-hinged `` suicide doors '' make it easier for handcuffed passengers to get in and out , and the seat is designed so `` guests '' can ride comfortably with their hands cuffed behind their backs .

For officer safety , Latorre likes how the seat belts are anchored in the center of the seat and buckle near the door so the officer does n't have to lean across the prisoner .

`` When you put a prisoner in the back seat , you 're supposed to strap him in , '' Latorre said . `` Nowadays , you have to make sure your gun is n't going close to his hands , and how are you going to strap somebody in doing that ? ''

Perhaps most popular among cops is the rear compartment , which is sealed off from the front and made entirely of seamless , washable plastic , with drain plugs in the floor .

`` Numerous times I 've had less than pleasant experience '' with prisoners vomiting or relieving themselves in the back seat , said Stephens , a former Texas police officer .

The seat innovations are up front , too , where the seats have recesses to accommodate officers ' bulky gun belts .

`` The front seat -- I could n't believe the front seat . They thought of everything , '' Latorre said . `` You do n't know how difficult it is to get out of a car . The first thing you 've got to do is adjust your gun belt . The gun belt should n't be a problem . ''

The E7 can go 0 to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds , has a top speed of 155 mph and can withstand a 75-mph rear impact , according to the company 's Web site . It has bullet-resistant panels in the doors and dash and has push bumpers incorporated into the aluminum frame . The upper flashing lights are integrated into the roof panel , eliminating the need for a bolted-on light bar that causes aerodynamic drag -- reducing fuel economy -- and can lead to rust . Watch police check out the car and hear the engine growl ''

Despite the technological `` wow '' factor and officer enthusiasm , the E7 could prove to be a tough sell .

`` The people are very intelligent and smart that are setting this up , '' said Lt. Michael Arnold , fleet manager of the Bismarck , North Dakota , police department . `` What scares me is they do n't give you a price . ''

Company officials say the price -- possibly around $ 50,000 per unit -- will be `` competitive '' considering the cost of equipping a conventional car for police work and how long each vehicle lasts . The Carbon E7 will be built to last 250,000 miles , compared with 75,000 to 120,000 miles for the typical patrol car , Stephens said .

`` When it 's all said and done it 's a matter of how much it costs per mile , '' said Bismarck Deputy Chief Fred Wooten .

Regardless of how good it looks on paper , a state or big-city agency wo n't be willing to take a chance on a vehicle with no track record , said Detective Mary Wheat , spokesperson for the Portland , Oregon , police department .

`` If they do cost $ 50,000 , nobody 's going to buy them , '' Wheat said . `` Nobody 's going to buy them . No , police agencies ca n't afford $ 50,000 cars . We have huge fleets of cars . We have hundreds of them ; hundreds and hundreds of cars . And we turn them over . I mean , we ride them hard . Those cars are used on a 24-hour basis . That would n't work . ''

But municipalities do n't balk at paying large sums for other purpose-built vehicles such as firetrucks and ambulances , countered Latorre , the Pennsylvania officer .

`` They do n't say , ` Oh , here 's a box truck ; go fight fires with it ' or ` Here 's an E-250 cargo van ; go pick up patients with it , ' do they ? , '' he said .

`` So I do n't see why the municipality would n't say , ` You know what ? This -LSB- police car -RSB- is nothing but a plus for us . ' ''

The company , based in Atlanta , Georgia , does n't yet have a factory , but has named five states where it could locate : Georgia , Indiana , Michigan , North Carolina and South Carolina . Production is scheduled to begin in 2012 , Stephens said .

Carbon does n't expect to take over the market quickly , instead counting on a few `` early adopters '' willing to take a risk on a few vehicles and work out the kinks to everyone else 's satisfaction , Stephens said . Hundreds of agencies already have made online reservations for thousands of Carbon Motors vehicles , putting the company `` very well on our way to selling out our first year , '' he said .

Wheat praised the Carbon team 's entrepreneurship and suggested the company market its car first in smaller towns with less red tape and simpler bidding processes . That works for Wooten , the deputy chief in Bismarck .

`` We 'll be more than happy to field test one , '' he offered . `` If it works as advertised , we 'll probably have a fleet of them someday . ''
