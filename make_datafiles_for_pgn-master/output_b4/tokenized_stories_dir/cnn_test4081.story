WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration is abandoning a controversial plan to charge private insurers for treatment of veterans ' service-connected ailments .

White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel met with veterans ' groups on Wednesday .

In an statement Wednesday night , the White House said that although the president believes the plan would raise more money for veterans ' care , the administration is dropping the idea after hearing the objections of veterans groups .

`` The President listened to concerns raised by the VSOs -LSB- veterans service organizations -RSB- that this might , under certain circumstances , affect veterans and their families ' ability to access health care , '' the White House said . `` Therefore , the president has instructed that its consideration be dropped . ''

News of the change of heart originally came from Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , who disclosed the decision to reporters while meeting with a group of veterans on Capitol Hill .

`` President Obama has listened to the concerns expressed by veterans ' leaders and veterans ' service organizations , '' Pelosi said . `` We will leave no veteran behind . ''

Veterans ' representatives and members of Congress have angrily opposed the proposal , which White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said was never finalized .

Leaders from 11 veterans groups discussed their position in a meeting Wednesday afternoon with White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel .

`` We stood firm on our stance that there is no way to support charging veterans ' insurance companies for service-connected treatment , '' said Jim King , executive director of AMVETS , a leading veterans ' advocacy organization .

Emanuel indicated that the proposal was `` a dead issue , '' King added . `` The administration was quick to say -LSB- that if veterans were -RSB- going to fight it , -LSB- the White House was n't -RSB- going to push it . ''

Another attendee , Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America Executive Director Paul Rieckhoff , said Emanuel was quick to come back after hearing the veterans ' groups stand firm and tell them , `` Let 's clarify , it is dead . ''

`` They made the right move -- they listened to us . Now we can move on to bigger more important issues , '' Rieckhoff said .

The meeting was very short , said King . Despite the difference in opinion , King said the atmosphere was cordial and `` everybody seemed comfortable . ''

On Monday , the groups met with President Obama , Emanuel , Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki and Steven Kosiak , director in charge of defense spending for the Office of Management and Budget .

The administration saw the plan as a way of raising more than $ 500 million in revenues for the Department of Veterans Affairs . However , veterans groups saw it is a violation of what they said is the government 's moral obligation to treat veterans injured during service to their country .

In addition , they believed it would lead to veterans and their families losing their private insurance or premiums rising because of the high costs of treating many service-related injuries .

The head of the Senate Veterans Affairs committee , Daniel Akaka , D-Hawaii , said Tuesday his committee would `` not advance any such legislation . ''

His counterpart in the House , Bob Filner , D-California , said his committee would n't take up the proposal either . In a statement released by his office , Filner said the idea is `` DOA '' and said the budget `` can not be balanced on the backs -LRB- or legs , or kidneys , or hearts -RRB- of our nation 's combat-wounded heroes . ''

The president pushed back during the meeting on Monday , telling the groups that private insurance companies were getting a free ride . He challenged the veterans to come up with an alternative way to raise revenues .

AMVETS planned to propose that billings be pursued more aggressively for injuries not related to service .

But AMVETS director King said Emanuel did n't ask for suggestions in Wednesday 's meeting .

A 2008 Government Accountability Office study found that about $ 1.7 billion in treatment that could have been charged to private insurance never was , nor was it collected by the VA. .
