-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Author John Updike , regarded as one of the greatest and most prolific writers in modern American letters , died Tuesday , his publicist said . He was 76 .

John Updike won many literary awards . His books , such as `` The Witches of Eastwick , '' were also best-sellers .

Updike passed away Tuesday morning after battling lung cancer . He lived in Beverly Farms , Massachusetts .

`` He was one of our greatest writers , and he will be sorely missed , '' said Nicholas Latimer , vice president of publicity at Updike 's publisher , Alfred A. Knopf .

Updike was a rarity among American writers : a much-esteemed , prize-winning author whose books -- including `` Rabbit , Run '' -LRB- 1960 -RRB- , `` Couples '' -LRB- 1968 -RRB- , `` The Witches of Eastwick '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- and `` Terrorist '' -LRB- 2006 -RRB- -- were also best-sellers . Updike won the Pulitzer Prize twice : for `` Rabbit Is Rich '' -LRB- 1981 -RRB- and its successor , `` Rabbit at Rest '' -LRB- 1991 -RRB- . iReport : Share your tributes to John Updike

The `` Rabbit '' series , about an angst-ridden car dealer in a town much like Updike 's hometown of Shillington , Pennsylvania , spanned four novels , a novella and four decades . In the books -- which also included 1971 's `` Rabbit Redux '' and a 2001 novella , `` Rabbit Remembered '' -- onetime basketball star Harry `` Rabbit '' Angstrom negotiates marriage , divorce , wealth and health problems , never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life .

`` Rabbit is not a character calculated to inspire affection , but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of American manhood , and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking , '' wrote Time 's Lev Grossman in naming `` Rabbit , Run '' to Time 's `` All-Time 100 Novels '' list .

Updike was incredibly prolific , penning essays , reviews , short stories , poetry and memoirs . His works frequently appeared in The New Yorker , including a famed 1960 essay about Ted Williams ' final game , `` Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu . ''

`` No writer was more important to the soul of The New Yorker than John , '' said David Remnick , the editor of the magazine , in a statement . `` Even though his literary career transcended any magazine -- he was obviously among the very best writers in the world -- he still loved writing for this weekly magazine , loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young .

`` We adored him , '' Remnick continued . `` He was , for so long , the spirit of The New Yorker and it is very hard to imagine things without him . ''

The magazine said that Updike had written 862 pieces for it over the years , including 327 book reviews , 170 short stories and 154 poems .

He was well-regarded in his adopted home state of Massachusetts .

`` John Updike 's place among America 's literary greats is forever secure , as is his special place in every Red Sox fan 's heart for his magnificent ` Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu , ' '' Sen. John Kerry -LRB- D-Massachusetts -RRB- said in a statement . `` We honor his memory and his contributions , and Massachusetts today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own . ''

Updike never won a Nobel Prize , but one of his characters , Henry Bech , received one in `` Bech at Bay '' -LRB- 1998 -RRB- .

His works , particularly given their sexual content , could be as divisive as they were poetic . Many critics accused him of misogyny , and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matter -- and Updike put out his prose by the ream .

`` It seems to be easier for John Updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book , '' the literary critic James Wood wrote in the London Review of Books in 2001 .

But his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers , the cover of Time magazine -LRB- for 1968 's `` Couples '' -RRB- and a lifetime achievement Bad Sex in Writing award from Great Britain 's Literary Review .

He was criticized by Norman Mailer , hailed by fellow author -LRB- and Updike obsessive -RRB- Nicholson Baker in `` U and I '' and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a `` Simpsons '' episode as the ghostwriter of a Krusty the Klown book .

'' -LSB- I -RSB- was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of Springfield , '' Updike said , noting that the hardest part of his performance was `` producing a chuckle . ''

John Hoyer Updike was born March 18 , 1932 , in Reading , Pennsylvania , and grew up in Shillington . From an early age he took to reading and writing , and earned a full scholarship to Harvard , where he headed the Harvard Lampoon . Upon graduation , he accepted a one-year fellowship to Oxford University in England . By the time he was 23 , he had been offered a position at The New Yorker , which was to become his literary home over the next 50-plus years .

Updike 's first novel , `` The Poorhouse Fair , '' came out in 1959 . The next year , in `` Rabbit , Run , '' he introduced Angstrom , who was to become one of the most famous characters in American fiction .

When introduced , Rabbit is a man fleeing his pregnant wife , the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life . Over the course of the `` Rabbit '' books , the character would routinely infuriate his spouse , mistresses and offspring , try to make things right , and never quite succeed .

His attitude did n't help . `` Men are all heart and women are all body . I do n't know who has the brains . God maybe , '' the character said in `` Rabbit , Run . ''

`` Rabbit , Run '' was successful , as were Updike 's other '60s books , including `` The Centaur '' -LRB- 1963 -RRB- , which featured a teacher much like Updike 's father , and the short story collection `` The Music School '' -LRB- 1966 -RRB- . But it was `` Couples '' that made Updike a household name . The book , about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban Massachusetts , became a No. 1 best-seller .

Updike 's interests ranged widely . He wrote about an African state in `` The Coup '' -LRB- 1978 -RRB- . He discussed the relationship between science and religion in `` Roger 's Version '' -LRB- 1986 -RRB- . He revisited `` Hamlet '' in `` Gertrude and Claudius '' -LRB- 2000 -RRB- . And he created a group of promiscuous witches in `` The Witches of Eastwick '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- , which became a hit movie in 1987 starring Jack Nicholson as the devil .

Though Updike 's work routinely sold well , he was painfully aware of the decline of what 's come to be called `` literary fiction . '' In a 2000 interview with Salon , he lamented its difficulties .

`` When I was a boy , the best-selling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher 's shelf . I mean , Steinbeck , Hemingway , some Faulkner . Faulkner actually had , considering how hard he is to read and how drastic the experiments are , quite a middle-class readership , '' he said . `` But certainly someone like Steinbeck was a best-seller as well as a Nobel Prize-winning author of high intent . You do n't feel that now . ''

And yet , Updike himself never lost his zest for the written word , and the pleasure brought by jotting , tuning , refining -- creating -- a new story , even as the years drifted by .

`` An aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that , as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them , will outlast him for a while , '' he wrote in AARP The Magazine late last year . `` The pleasures , for him , of book-making ... remain , and retain creation 's giddy bliss . Among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best . ''

Updike 's most recent novel , `` The Widows of Eastwick , '' came out in 2008 . A collection of stories , `` My Father 's Tears and Other Stories , '' is due out later this year .
