NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Yet another scale Il Divo has mastered : scaling the heights of success .

The quartet was formed in 2004 after a global search .

The operatic quartet 's new album , `` The Promise , '' debuted atop the UK charts , their third collection to hit the No. 1 spot .

The album -LRB- which was released in the U.S. last Tuesday -RRB- features Leonard Cohen 's `` Hallelujah , '' Frankie Goes to Hollywood 's `` The Power of Love , '' and the traditional `` Amazing Grace . '' Il Divo also takes a chance on the ABBA hit `` The Winner Takes it All . ''

The group is the brainchild of `` American Idol '' judge Simon Cowell , who saw a potential market for an international , `` popera '' - style act after the soaring success of the Andrea Bocelli-Sarah Brightman duet `` Time to Say Goodbye -LRB- Con te Partiro -RRB- . '' Watch Il Divo in action ''

Formed in 2004 after a global search , Il Divo -LRB- Italian for `` divine male performer '' -RRB- consists of Spanish baritone Carlos Marin , American tenor David Miller , French pop singer Sebastien Izambard , and Swiss tenor Urs Buhler .

According to Syco Music , Il Divo 's UK-based label , the quartet has sold more than 22 million albums worldwide . It seems Cowell knew what he was doing .

CNN caught up with Il Divo to find out how close they are to Cowell , and which American pop diva they dream of collaborating with .

CNN : Who do you most get compared to , the Three Tenors or the Backstreet Boys ?

Carlos Marin : -LRB- laughs -RRB- It 's a mix of everything . I mean at the end -LSB- of the day -RSB- we are just a pop act . We just sing pop songs , and we just converted mostly the big endings into operatic style . But we are just us , Il Divo .

CNN : Are you surprised by how much of a hit you 've become ?

Marin : In a way , yeah . I still remember the first time we went to number one -LRB- in the UK -RRB- . We knocked out Robbie Williams and it was just like `` Wow ! ''

CNN : What is the big appeal of Il Divo ?

Urs Buhler : I think it has a lot to do with the big variety we have inside the group , the fact that we are all from four different countries , from different cultural music backgrounds . And we bundle all those different energies ... and bring it together for that one cause -- to make the most beautiful music that we possibly can together . It 's not like we have a strategy or recipe for it , it 's just that we 're passionate about what we do . It works somehow . It 's magic .

CNN : How involved is -LSB- Simon Cowell -RSB- with the day-to-day Il Divo operation ?

Buhler : With the day-to-day operation , I would say his involvement is next to nothing . He 's only involved in the actual A&R - ing and the executive producing , which means we meet him about twice a year for an hour .

CNN : You took a lot of time off in 2007 . In fact you took nearly the whole year off . When you regrouped did you find anything was different ?

David Miller : Absolutely . The first three years were just a roller coaster of experiences : having the number one in the UK and then that turning into the number one in all the different countries , and going all around the world and being on tour , being on tour with Barbra Streisand and then more albums . Everything kind of bled into everything else and we did n't really have any time to appreciate all the things that we had done .

So after this break , -LSB- when -RSB- we came back together in the studio , it was really like a breath of fresh air . Like the magic of the first album was back . We could appreciate the music again . We could appreciate each other again . And it was a lot more relaxed and a lot more fun .

CNN : When you 're standing on stage and you look out at the audience what do you see ... is there a certain age range , a certain sex ?

Miller : It depends on the country we go to . For example , when we go to the UK , it 's a slightly more mature audience . When we go to Spain it 's a lot younger audience . When we go to South Africa , it 's a family affair . So it really just depends , but everywhere we go the universal thing that ties them all in is that they 're all music-lovers and they appreciate what we do .

CNN : How many languages do you sing in ?

Buhler : We -LSB- sing -RSB- in French , Latin , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese , English ... that would be six . And we speak about seven or eight .

CNN : Do you speak the language of love ?

Marin : Yes , we do !

Buhler : That would be the ninth language .

CNN : Who is the biggest diva in the group ?

Marin : We are really four divas . Four captains , one ship .

Sebastien Izambard : We have very strong personalities , and we 're the producers of our tour and we sit down -- the four of us -- and decide what we 're going to do , what set , what choice of the music or lighting . We 're four grown-up people and we make that very possible . -LSB- In the beginning -RSB- everyone had their own opinions . Now we just know what 's best for Il Divo . It 's easy . Everything 's easy .

CNN : How are you being received in America ?

Miller : I think in America it 's more of a slow burn . I think it 's more difficult to put us on the radio because we fall between the cracks in a way . We 're a little bit too pop for the classical stations , we 're a bit too classical for the pop stations . And right now hip-hop and rap sort of reign supreme on the airwaves . But there is a big following and it 's growing all the time .

CNN : If there was someone you could collaborate with who you have n't yet , who would it be ?

Izambard : Beyonce . Christina Aguilera .

Marin : Tina Turner .

CNN : These are all pop acts . So you really do want to stay within the pop realm ?

Buhler : Yeah , definitely . I mean that 's a very conscious choice . I do n't think we 're all opera purists , but for me personally , a `` Nessun Dorma '' -LSB- Puccini aria -RSB- is as good as it is and I do n't see the point of adding a breathy voice , or adding harmonies to it . While the pop repertoire ... it 's just more out there for everyone to take it and do with it whatever without offending people . All you want to do with a pop song is somehow transmit emotion .

So far there 's -LSB- been -RSB- much more freedom in pop music and that 's why we stay in there ... we pretty much can do whatever we want . And as Simon Cowell just said recently , `` Nobody owns music . ''
