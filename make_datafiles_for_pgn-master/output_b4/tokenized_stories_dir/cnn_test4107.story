LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Media maven Oprah Winfrey earned 10 times more than Angelina Jolie last year , but the actress bumped the talk show host from the top spot on Forbes ' 2009 Celebrity 100 list just released by the business magazine .

Angelina Jolie has ousted Oprah Winfrey from the No. 1 spot on Forbes ' 2009 Celebrity 100 list .

Jolie 's fame , evidenced by magazine covers and TV , radio , newspaper and Web stories , outweighed Winfrey 's , giving her the edge as `` the most powerful celebrity in the world '' based on Forbes ' formula , Forbes Senior Editor Matthew Miller said .

Winfrey , who was at the top for two years straight , grossed $ 275 million last year , compared with Jolie 's $ 27 million , Miller said .

`` We try and measure a celebrity 's power , and we look at two metrics to do that , '' Miller said . `` We look at money , and we look at fame . ''

A world tour , which helped Madonna pull in $ 110 million , and a bumper crop of tabloid gossip pushed the Material Girl into the third spot , up from her 21st ranking on last year 's list .

Beyonce Knowles held steady in fourth , same as last year , with $ 87 million in income from her multiplatform empire , Miller said . Forbes leveraged the singer-actresses fame by placing her on this week 's cover .

A bad knee kept Tiger Woods off the PGA tour over the past year and lowered him to the fifth spot on the Forbes list . The golfer , still the highest-paid athlete in the world , was second last year .

Bruce Springsteen 's tour landed the Boss in sixth , while director Steven Spielberg 's latest Indiana Jones movie helped him to seventh place .

Actress Jennifer Aniston and her ex-husband , Brad Pitt , were eighth and ninth , respectively , on the strength of successful movies and tabloid headlines .

Basketballer Kobe Bryant 's endorsements and popularity , boosted by his play on the U.S. Olympic team , jumped to the 10th spot .

Miller said Forbes ' has spent a great amount of time compiling the list for the past decade because `` celebrities play an ever increasing role in everyone 's lives , whether we like it or not . ''

`` Celebrities are brands , and they are marketing to us and there 's stuff we consume off of them , from movies to albums to concerts to books to speaking tours to everything in between , and we sort of all buy into it , '' he said .

The income figures used are gross numbers and do not take into account what goes to agents , managers , taxes and expenses , Miller said .

`` It can be very expensive to be a celebrity , '' he said . `` What they 're taking home to their personal checking accounts is far less than their gross earnings . ''

The list , which has been `` put through our special sauce of earnings and fame , '' is used as a barometer of who has the real power in Hollywood , Miller said .

`` When you look at the components of fame and earnings , you can get a good vibe as to who 's important this year and who 's not , '' he said .

`` Angelina Jolie is , by far , the most famous celebrity on the planet , '' he said . `` There 's not a day that goes by where she 's not on the cover of a tabloid magazine or a regular magazine . There 's not day that goes by when people are not talking about her philanthropy or her relationship with Brad Pitt or her movies or her children . All of that lends to a more popular , more robust and , frankly , more valuable brand . ''

Miller estimated that Jolie was on about 20 to 30 times more magazine covers last year than Winfrey .

It 's normal for celebs to fall down or off the list for a year if they are between projects , he said .

One newcomer to the list of top 100 celebrities is Barack Obama , debuting at 49 . Obama is the first sitting head of state to appear in Forbes ' Celebrity 100 rankings .
