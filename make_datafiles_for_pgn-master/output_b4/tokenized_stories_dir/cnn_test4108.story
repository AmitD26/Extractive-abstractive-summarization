-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As Hayden Henshaw was being rushed to the doctor 's office after becoming ill , his father heard that his son 's classmates had been struck with the deadly swine flu virus like the one sweeping through Mexico .

Swine flu commonly affects pigs and occasionally infects people in contact with pigs .

Patrick Henshaw called his wife immediately to have Hayden checked for it . Later , they received the bad news .

Hayden had become the third confirmed case of swine flu at his Texas high school . It is a virus that has killed 68 people in Mexico and infected at least eight people in the United States .

Health officials arrived at the Henshaws ' house Friday and drew blood from the whole family , then told them to stay inside and away from the public , Henshaw told CNN .

The whole family is quarantined indefinitely , according to CNN-affiliate KABB . Henshaw said his family was shocked when they got the news about their son .

`` Stunned . My wife was having a panic attack , '' Henshaw told the affiliate .

U.S. health officials have expressed concern about U.S. cases of a swine flu virus that has similar characteristics to the fatal virus in Mexico .

More than 1,000 people have fallen ill in Mexico City in a short period of time , U.S. health experts said .

`` This situation has been developing quickly , '' Richard Besser , acting director of the Atlanta , Georgia-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- , said Friday . `` This is something we are worried about . ''

Besser said all of the eight U.S. patients have recovered . Watch for more on the U.S. cases ''

New York health officials said Friday they were testing about 75 students at a school in New York City for swine flu after the students exhibited flu-like symptoms this week .

A team of state health department doctors and staff went to the St. Francis Preparatory School in the borough of Queens on Thursday after the students reported cough , fever , sore throat , aches and pains .

Test results are expected as early as Saturday .

The new virus has genes from North American swine influenza , avian influenza , human influenza and a form of swine influenza normally found in Asia and Europe , said Nancy Cox , chief of the CDC 's Influenza Division .

Swine flu is caused by a virus similar to a type of flu virus that infects people every year but is a strain typically found only in pigs -- or in people who have direct contact with pigs .

There have , however , been cases of person-to-person transmission of swine flu , the CDC said .
