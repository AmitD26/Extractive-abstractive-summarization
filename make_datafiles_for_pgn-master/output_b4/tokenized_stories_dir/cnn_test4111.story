WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Despite a bleak economic environment featuring wide-ranging layoffs and rising unemployment , the nation 's premier law enforcement agency is touting `` one of the largest hiring blitzes in our 100-year history . ''

The FBI is about to embark on its biggest hiring spree since immediately after the September 11 , 2001 .

The FBI posted openings for 850 special agents and more than 2,100 professional support personnel . Officials say it 's the largest FBI job posting since immediately after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .

The FBI 's unexpectedly large number of job openings results more from attrition and a wave of retirements than from growing government appropriations , Bureau officials told CNN .

The FBI routinely advertises openings for individuals with critical skills in computer science and language fluency . But John Raucci , assistant director of the FBI 's Human Resources Division , says current needs are much more wide-ranging .

`` We 're also looking for professionals in a wide variety of fields who have a deep desire to help protect our nation from terrorists , spies and others who wish us harm , '' Raucci said .

The lengthy list of openings includes positions in finance and accounting , security , intelligence analysis , training and education , nursing and counseling , physical surveillance , electrical engineering , physical and social sciences , and auto mechanics .

Procedures for applying and a full listing of available positions are posted on the Web site fbijobs.gov .

`` This is a great time to apply for a great job in the FBI , '' said the bureau 's chief spokesman , Richard Kolko .

Officials note at least a few jobs are currently available in every one of the FBI 's 56 field offices across the nation .

The FBI lists openings throughout the year , but seldom has anything close to the current number of available positions .

The present job postings expire on January 16 , but a new , possibly smaller set of openings will be posted shortly thereafter , the agency said .
