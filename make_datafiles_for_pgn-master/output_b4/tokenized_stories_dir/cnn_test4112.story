-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- English football star Steven Gerrard has admitted punching a man in a bar , but the Liverpool captain insisted in his court testimony that it was in self-defense .

England international Steven Gerrard is in court defending his actions after a bar brawl late last year .

The 29-year-old is facing a charge of affray after an incident in the early hours of December 29 , when he attacked businessman Marcus McGee following a dispute about the music that was being played .

If found guilty , Gerrard faces a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a fine of $ 7,200 .

Gerrard , who denies the charge , told a judge on Thursday that he was sorry about his actions in Southport 's Lounge Inn , but at the time he thought McGee was going to attack him .

They had been involved in an argument after Gerrard tried to change the music on the bar 's sound system , but McGee would not let him , the UK Press Association reported .

`` I thought he was going to hit me , '' Gerrard said . `` He was on his way forward to me and his behavior had changed from when I was having a discussion with him . I did n't know why . ''

Gerrard said he was unaware that his friend John Doran had already punched McGee when he himself started to hit the 34-year-old .

`` I am certainly mistaken in thinking he was coming towards me to throw punches at me , '' the midfielder said .

`` Now I know , obviously , he had been struck , reacted and thought the strike was by me and he came into me and that 's when I reacted . I am sorry about the whole incident .

`` I grabbed the back of his jumper as he moved forward to me . When I had hold of Marcus , I remember swinging my right hand two or three times .

`` I was trying to stop still and I felt I had arms all over me . I could see a melee around Marcus McGee . When I was getting pulled away I realized people were patting me , some of whom were my friends .

`` I wanted to help control the situation . I was worried the fight I had with Marcus was going to get worse because people were going past me in that direction . ''

Gerrard said that his friends had earlier told him to `` forget '' the argument , but he felt he needed to confront McGee .

`` I could n't understand why the guy had such a problem with me , why he was so aggressive , '' he said . `` I was also concerned that if I did leave it I would not have been able to enjoy my night , he may have come over to me .

`` I wanted to see why he had such a problem with it , why a total stranger had such a problem with me putting my favorite songs on . I asked why I could n't have an input in the music and tried to explain that I had permission from the manageress . ''

`` I asked Marcus what was the problem with the music machine and why he treated me like that . Very quickly he came off the bar stool and was in my face right by me . ''

Gerrard had been celebrating after scoring two goals as Liverpool thrashed Newcastle 5-1 to remain top of the Premier League , and admitted that he had been drinking alcohol .

`` I certainly knew I had had a drink . I was certainly in control of how I felt in my surroundings , '' he said .

The father of two said he had not been in trouble with the police since the age of 19 , when he was banned from driving for nine months for drink-driving .
