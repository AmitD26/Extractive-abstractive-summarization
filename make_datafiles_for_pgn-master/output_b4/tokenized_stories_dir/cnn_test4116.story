LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The British mother of a child who died after being brutally abused has been jailed indefinitely .

The child 's -- originally known as Baby P -- horrifying death caused a furor in Britain , with the media , public and politicians united in demanding to know how his terrible injuries were missed by social workers , police and medical staff .

Judge Stephen Kramer also Friday jailed the 27-year-old mum 's boyfriend for life with a minimum of 12 years and their lodger , Jason Owen , 37 , indefinitely but with a minimum of three years , the British Press Association reported . The boyfriend , 32 , was also convicted of raping a two-year-old girl .

Baby P 's mum has to serve a minimum of five years . She and her boyfriend can not be named .

Baby P -- he could not be known by his first name , Peter , until the recent lifting of a court order -- was only 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot in August 2007 .

He had more than 50 injuries , including a broken back and fractured ribs , despite being on London 's Haringey council 's at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers , doctors and police over eight months .

The resulting public outrage saw the government 's child secretary , Ed Balls , step in to demand the removal of the council 's head of children 's services , Sharon Shoesmith , with two other leading officials also stepping down .

Shoesmith had to be placed under police guard after death threats were made .

Judge Kramer told Peter 's mother that she was `` a manipulative and self-centered person , with a calculating side as well as a temper . '' Watch more on the case ''

`` Your conduct over the months prevented Peter from being seen by social services . You actively deceived the authorities ... you acted selfishly because your priority was your relationship , '' he told the court , PA reported .

Judge Kramer 's comments echoed the country 's response to the case .

`` Any decent person who heard the catalogue of medical conditions and non-accidental injuries suffered by Peter can not fail to have been appalled . ''

A second serious review of the case commissioned by Balls and released Friday , also reiterated that Peter 's death `` could and should have been prevented . ''

Graham Badman , the chairman of Haringey Local Safeguarding Children Board , which conducted the review said : `` I believe the most important lesson arising from this case is that professionals charged with ensuring child safety must be deeply skeptical of any explanations , justifications or excuses they may hear in connection with the apparent maltreatment of children .

`` If they have any doubt about the cause of physical injuries or what appears to be maltreatment , they should act swiftly and decisively .

Badman said the review found that if `` doctors , lawyers , police officers and social workers had adopted a more urgent , thorough and challenging approach , the case would have been stopped in its tracks at the first serious incident . ''

`` Baby Peter deserved better from the services that were supposed to protect him , '' Badman said .
