-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Manor GP are to be rebranded Virgin Racing ahead of their Formula One debut next season .

Manor team chief John Booth and Virgin supremo Richard Branson are due to announce the long-awaited sponsorship tie-up on Tuesday .

The news has effectively been confirmed by motor sport 's world governing body , the FIA , as they have announced the 2010 entry list for the F1 world championship .

Currently there are 12 teams , with the name Virgin Racing amongst the newcomers for 2010 , joining Lotus F1 Racing , Campos Meta 1 and US F1 Team .

The issue of the 13th entry remains unresolved , although Sauber are widely expected to be granted a place on next year 's grid following a meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in Monaco on December 11 .

Peter Sauber last week regained control of the team he sold to BMW four years ago after the German manufacturing giant 's withdrawal from the sport .

`` I am very relieved about that development , '' the 66-year-old Swiss , who is hopeful the FIA will now look favorably on the team 's entry , told reporters .

`` It would have been a crying shame had one of the best Formula One factories closed down . Regarding the slot on the grid , I am very confident we will be given a final confirmation very shortly . ''

The Formula One Commission are due to discuss Toyota 's fate next week , again in Monaco on Wednesday .

The Japanese manufacturer pulled out of F1 at the end of last season , despite during the summer signing the new Concorde Agreement that bound them to the sport for the next three years .

Speculation has surfaced of late regarding a potential takeover , yet it is unclear whether a buyer would automatically be granted an entry on the basis of Toyota 's signature on the Concorde .

In a statement , the FIA said : `` Toyota Motorsport GmbH remains formally bound by the Concorde Agreement to put forward a team for participation , though it has indicated that it will not be in a position to do so .

`` An announcement will be made regarding this entry in due course . ''
