KAMPALA , Uganda -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gunshots rang out in Uganda 's capital Saturday in a fresh burst of unrest after loyalists of a traditional kingdom battled with government forces for a third day .

Residents of the Kasubi suburb , west of Kampala , try to flee from violence as a soldier takes photos .

Local media reports put the death toll at 13 since the rioting started , but attempts by CNN to confirm with local authorities were unsuccessful .

An uneasy calm had swept over Kampala early in the day as police and the army patrolled the city in military convoys . By midafternoon , witnesses reported gunshots and isolated cases of riots .

The unrest Saturday started after rumors circulated by text messages that the king of the Buganda kingdom had been detained , said Judith Nabakooba , a police spokeswoman .

But a Buganda kingdom official refuted the rumor .

`` It is not true -- the king has not been arrested , '' David Mpanga said .

Tensions between the Buganda kingdom -- headed by King Ronald Mutebi II -- and President Yoweri Museveni have intensified in recent years .

The two sides spar over land , sovereignty and political power . Kings in the east African nation are limited to a ceremonial role overseeing traditional and cultural affairs .

Museveni has accused the Buganda kingdom , which is made of of Bagandans , of receiving foreign funding to carry out a hate campaign against the government . Bagandans are the dominant ethnicity and one of four ancient kingdoms in the nation .

Violence flared Thursday when the government said it would not allow the Buganda king to travel to an area inhabited by a renegade rival group .

The president said he tried to contact the king to discuss the issue as `` mature people , '' but he could not reach him by phone .

After the travel ban , young Bagandans took the streets , stealing ammunition from a police station and confronting officers , whom they accused of harassment .

Police and army officers were injured , and at least four people were killed , the nation 's police chief , Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura said Friday .

Rioters also burned tires and cars , set buildings on fire and looted stores , according to witnesses .

The streets in the capital were strewn with debris Saturday , including torched cars and burned tires . `` Soldiers are walking in a single file , waiting for rioters and ready to confront them , '' said Allan Mugabi , a resident of Kampala .
