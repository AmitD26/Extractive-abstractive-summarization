Santiago , Chile -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived Friday in earthquake-damaged Chile , which endured two more strong aftershocks while working to recover from last week 's devastating earthquake and tsunami .

`` I 'm here to express -LSB- the -RSB- solidarity of the United Nations , of the international community , to the people and government of Chile , '' Ban told reporters at the airport in the capital , Santiago .

`` I know that this is one of the worst natural disasters in recent history of Chile ; at the same time , I 'm very moved to see such strong courage and fortitude and resilience of Chilean people , '' Ban said .

Earlier , shortly before 9 a.m. Friday , an aftershock with a magnitude of 6.6 struck the area , the U.S. Geological Survey said . The aftershock followed another with a 6.0 magnitude , the survey said . The two are the latest in scores of aftershocks that have hit after the massive magnitude 8.8 earthquake and subsequent tsunami Saturday . Full coverage of Chile 's earthquake

Friday 's aftershocks did not cause any known injuries or damage , Chile 's National Emergency Office said , and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Tsunami Center did not issue any warnings .

The tsunami and 8.8 magnitude earthquake -- the fifth-strongest worldwide since 1900 -- killed hundreds of people and toppled buildings , particularly in the Maule region along the coast .

Shocking scenes hours after quake

Roads were torn up and power was cut off in many areas . Thousands have been left homeless .

Food , water and the restoration of basic services , such as electricity , are top priorities , said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs .

The Chilean government , which is leading the rescue and relief efforts , has asked the United Nations for items such as field hospitals with surgical facilities , dialysis centers , generators , satellite phones , structural damage evaluation systems , saltwater purifying systems , mobile bridges and field kitchens .

Ban said Friday that he will talk to Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and President-elect Sebastian Pinera about how the United Nations can best help . Pinera , a conservative billionaire businessman , takes office next week .

The secretary-general said he will visit hard-hit Concepcion to assess the damage and will bring the matter to the United Nations .

`` Now it is time for the United Nations and international community to stand with the Chilean people and government , '' he said , after noting the Chileans ' generosity in helping Haiti after its 7.0 earthquake on January 12 . That quake flattened much of the Haitian capital , Port-au-Prince , and killed hundreds of thousands of people .

A 24-hour telethon , `` Chile Helps Chile , '' which organizers hope will raise $ 27 million for earthquake victims , was scheduled for Friday .

Residents in devastated Constitucion expressed a determination to rebuild .

`` It very hard , but it 's not impossible . We have to be strong ; we have to reinvent ourselves , '' said resident Antonieta Biachi . `` You have to start from scratch ; there is no other option . ''

Though he is not yet in office , Pinera has named six officials to lead recovery efforts .

More than 13,000 soldiers and other military personnel have been dispatched to restore order in the earthquake-damaged area . Food and water began to arrive earlier this week in Concepcion , and officials said they distributed 3,500 aid packages Wednesday . But many residents have complained that federal aid has been slow to arrive .

A six-member U.S. Agency for International Development disaster response team has been sent to Chile to assist with relief effort , said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley .

The team should arrive Saturday , he said . A USAID contractor also is embedded with the Chilean National Emergency Response Office , the country 's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency .

The United States sent 71 satellite phones , plastic sheeting and two mobile water treatment units , the U.S. State Department said . Six more water treatment units are to arrive within a week . A field hospital and two C-130 aircraft to assist with moving supplies around the country have also been deployed .

The United States also sent $ 1 million to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to aid their efforts .

Bachelet toured parts of central and southern Chile on Thursday . She visited Talcahuano , where the tsunami roared through many parts of the seaport town . Bachelet also toured Talca , the capital of Maule .

`` This is the time for action , '' she said later Thursday on returning to Santiago , where she met leaders of the Catholic Church , a partner in providing help in the quake 's aftermath .

The top priority remained the needs of survivors , followed by reconstruction efforts , Bachelet said .

Chile has announced three days of national mourning beginning Sunday . Every house has been authorized to hang the national flag in memory of those who perished .

The death toll was revised downward Thursday as authorities reviewed discrepancies in the reported number of dead in the Maule region .

The casualty count there included more than 200 people who are missing but not confirmed dead , said Deputy Interior Minister Patricio Rosende . Therefore , the official nationwide death toll is lower than the 802 figure given by emergency authorities .

To limit confusion , Rosende read aloud the names of 279 Chileans who had been killed and identified by Thursday evening . He said would update that official number regularly . The new tally does not account for hundreds of unidentified victims .

With disasters of this magnitude , `` the number of dead change daily , '' Rosende said . `` It takes months sometimes to compile the information , because one of the biggest problems in the affected areas is the lack of precision and uncertainty at the scene . ''

Despite the disaster , the Chilean Davis Cup tennis team will open competition Saturday in Coquimbo , Chile , against Israel . Team officials and players said they would be playing in honor of quake victims .

`` It will be difficult , but we will do our best for our country , '' said player Fernando Gonzalez .
