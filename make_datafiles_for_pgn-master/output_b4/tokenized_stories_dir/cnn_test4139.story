Port-au-Prince , Haiti -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rescue workers pulled a woman out of rubble near Haiti 's national cathedral Tuesday , a week after a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck .

The rescue crews believe two other people may be alive under wreckage nearby , in part because of a text message the crews believe was sent from under the rubble , a CNN crew reported .

Men carried the woman , Ena Zizi , who is in her 70s , from the rubble on a wooden board as she grasped its edges .

They took her to a nearby clinic , although it does n't have the operating facilities needed to treat her , the CNN crew reported .
