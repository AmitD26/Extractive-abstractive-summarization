-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World No. 2 Novak Djokovic suffered a shock defeat by sixth seed Mikhail Youzhny in the semifinals of the World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam on Saturday .

The Serbian , who had not played since Thursday after being handed a walkover in his quarterfinal , lost 7-6 -LRB- 7-5 -RRB- 7-6 -LRB- 8-6 -RRB- to the Russian despite saving two match-points .

Youzhny , who won the Dutch indoor tournament in 2007 , will play second seed Robin Soderling in Sunday 's final after the world No. 8 edged out sixth-ranked Nikolay Davydenko 7-6 -LRB- 7-3 -RRB- 6-4 .

Youzhny will have the chance to avenge his compatriot 's defeat as he seeks to improve his 1-1 career record against Soderling .

The signs are good for the world No. 20 , who also defeated Djokovic in the semifinals three years ago .

The Muscovite will bid to win his sixth ATP Tour title , having won one in each of the past three seasons .

Soderling has bounced back from a poor start to the season that saw the Swede lose in the first round of his first two tournaments in 2010 , including the Australian Open .

`` This is a really tough tournament and it 's not easy to reach the final here , '' last year 's French Open finalist told the ATP Web site .

`` I 'm playing better with every match , so I 'm very happy . I 've had a lot of tough matches with Nikolay in the past few years . He 's one of the best players in the world , so it means I am playing great tennis to beat him . My confidence is up and I 'm looking forward to the final . ''

Meanwhile , second seed Fernando Verdasco reached the final of the SAP Open in San Jose in the United States after beating Uzbekistan 's Denis Istomin on Saturday .

The Spaniard won 6-3 2-6 6-4 to set up a clash with the top seed Andy Roddick who overcame a first set loss and two tiebreakers to defeat fellow American Sam Querrey 2-6 , 7-6 -LRB- 5 -RRB- , 7-6 -LRB- 4 -RRB- .

Top seed Elena Dementieva will play Lucie Safarova in Sunday 's Paris Indoor Open final on the women 's WTA Tour circuit .

Russian world No. 7 Dementieva came from behind to beat young American Melanie Oudin 4-6 6-3 6-3 in the semifinals of the French hardcourt event , where she lost in the final last year to Amelie Mauresmo .

Unseeded Czech Safarova upset Italy 's Flavia Pennetta , the second-ranked player in the field , as she also rallied from a set down to win 4-6 6-3 6-4 .

World No. 46 Safarova lost to Nadia Petrova in the 2007 final .

In Thailand , top seed Vera Zvonareva will seek home hope Tamarine Tanasugarn from winning her first Pattaya Open title on Sunday .

The Russian is on course to defend her title following a 6-2 4-6 6-3 victory against fourth seed Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan , reaching her 21st career title .

The 32-year-old Tanasugarn will have her 10th tilt at a WTA title after crushing Shvedova 's compatriot Sesil Karatantcheva , ranked 185th in the world , 6-2 6-0 in the other semifinal on Saturday .
