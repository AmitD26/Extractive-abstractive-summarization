-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kim Clijsters continued her successful return to tennis by demolishing American third seed Venus Williams in the final of the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami on Saturday .

The Belgian , a former world No. 1 but seeded 14th for this event following her two-year absence from the women 's circuit , will move up to 10th in the rankings next week following her one-sided 6-2 6-1 triumph at Key Biscayne .

Williams had been hoping for a fourth title at the event , having won her last two tournaments , but was well below par as Clijsters added to her 2005 victory in Miami in just 58 minutes .

The 26-year-old claimed her third title since making her comeback last year after giving birth to baby daughter Jada , who was watching her mum from the stands again on Saturday .

The 2009 U.S. Open champion notched up her 37th triumph in WTA Tour events , 28 of those now on hardcourt surfaces .

She passed $ 17 million in career earnings after taking home the $ 700,000 first prize -- which is almost $ 100,000 more than the winner of Sunday 's men 's final between Andy Roddick and Tomas Berdych will receive .

Clijsters , who defeated fellow comeback queen Justine Henin in an epic semifinal on Friday , broke Williams to love to seal the title .

`` It took a lot of hard work to get back into shape and I have a few people to thank , including my fitness coach and husband , '' Clijsters said on-court after the match .

`` It feels really good to be back here , having won the title in 2005 . It 's always nice to come back to a place you have done well before , and to such a beautiful stadium . ''

Williams , cheered on by injured younger sister and current No. 1 Serena , made 29 unforced errors to Clijsters ' 12 as she struggled to continue her recent good run of form .

`` Sometimes when you hit a few bad shots it 's not as easy to reel it in , and things start to go a little bit quicker , '' said Williams , who will rise to fourth in the rankings .

`` Obviously against a player like Kim , if you make too many errors , the match can go quickly . I mean , I think she hit eight winners , so it was n't that she played extremely solid -- it 's not like I was blown off the court . Unfortunately I was my own worst enemy today . ''
