-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Filipino hero Manny Pacquiao scored a comprehensive 12-round points victory over Timothy Bradley to regain the WBO welterweight title he controversially lost to the previously unbeaten American two years ago .

At 35 , many had believed that the Pacman 's best years were behind him , but he was an easy winner Saturday night in Las Vegas on all three of the judges ' scorecards after dominating the bout .

Pacquiao improved to 56-5 with two drawn and predicted he would continue to ply his trade in the ring for some time yet .

`` I think I can go another two years , '' said Pacquiao . `` I 'm so happy to be world champion again . Tim Bradley was not an easy fight . ''

Bradley had won their 2012 clash on a disputed points decision and Pacquiao also lost his next fight when knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez in the sixth round .

But he beat the promising young Brandon Rios last November to revive his fortunes and was back to his peerless best to take Bradley 's perfect record .

The WBO may mandate Pacquiao to face the winner of the Marquez-Mike Alvarado clash next month although the bigger prize may be a long-awaited clash with American superstar Floyd Mayweather .

Contractual and legal wrangles have to date prevented a money-spinning bout between the two boxing icons but Pacquiao 's performance in beating Bradley has certainly restored his reputation .

A star-studded crowd watched the fight in the MGM Grand Arena and aside from a spell in the fourth round , Pacquiao was in control .

Back home in the Philippines , thousands watched the fight on big screens , cheering wildly as their national hero took command .

`` The people of the nation are united in cheering on the victory of the nation 's fist , '' President Benigno Aquino 's spokesman told AFP after the victory .

Many Filipino 's are still recovering from the devastating impact of Super Typhoon Haiyan last year and Aquino said Pacquiao was a symbol of resistance in the face of adversity , having himself recovered from the defeats to Bradley and Marquez .
