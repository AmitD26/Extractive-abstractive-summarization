-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A prominent supporter of Sen. Barack Obama on Wednesday compared Bill Clinton 's appeals for his wife , Sen. Hillary Clinton , in South Carolina to the tactics used by a former Republican strategist that are infamous within Democratic circles .

Former President Bill Clinton responds to a reporter who asked him about criticism from the Obama campaign .

When asked about the comparison , the former president reacted with disapproval , saying it was a distraction from what voters really cared about .

In an interview with CNN , Dick Harpootlian , a former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party and an Obama backer , said some of Clinton 's recent remarks on the campaign trail were appeals based on race and gender , meant to `` suppress the vote , demoralize voters and distort the record . ''

Harpootlian said the remarks were `` reminiscent of Lee Atwater , '' a hard-hitting Republican strategist who worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and whose tactics were reviled by many Democrats .

Atwater died in 1991 .

When CNN 's Jessica Yellin asked Clinton about Harpootlian 's comments , Clinton disputed the charge and lashed out , saying : `` You live for this . This hurts the people of South Carolina . '' Watch Clinton rebuke the media ''

`` Because the people of South Carolina come to these meetings and ask questions about what they care about , '' he said . `` And what they care about is not what 's going to be in the news coverage tonight , because you do n't care about it . ''

`` What you care about is this . And the Obama people know that . So they just spin you up on this and you happily go along , '' Clinton told Yellin . `` And that 's not right . That is not right . This election ought to belong to those people who are out here asking questions about their lives . ''

The former president 's angry response comes just days before the South 's first Democratic contest on Saturday and is the latest in a series of heated exchanges between the Obama and Clinton camps .

Sen. Hillary Clinton is focusing her attention on states with contests next month on `` Super Tuesday , '' leaving the campaigning for this week 's South Carolina primary to her husband .

South Carolina 's primary is the Democrats ' last big contest before Super Tuesday on February 5 , when two dozen states hold primaries or caucuses .

The senator from New York is zigzagging across the country , while Bill Clinton makes the rounds in South Carolina and doubles up the attacks on Obama .

Obama sees his rival 's absence as a good thing , according to Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent David Brody , who interviewed the senator from Illinois on Tuesday .

`` He believes that it is a sign , in essence , the fact that she 's leaving the state -- that that bodes well for him , '' Brody said .

`` He was talking about the fact that she had said that ... he 's not running against Bill Clinton . But then , at the same time , Bill Clinton is here in South Carolina by proxy , running against Barack Obama down here in South Carolina . ''

The 42nd president has been immersed in the intense , back-and-forth exchanges between his wife and Obama , who said this week in a debate in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , that he sometimes ca n't tell which one he 's running against in the race .

The former president has attacked Obama in recent days , accusing him of overstating his opposition to the Iraq war , complaining about Obama 's union supporters in the Nevada caucuses last weekend and blasting his remarks on former President Reagan in a newspaper interview . Watch the battle brewing between the Clintons and Obama ''

Clinton on Wednesday tried to distance himself from the attacks , telling a CNN correspondent that the rhetoric was `` crazy '' and `` getting a little carried away . ''

But earlier in the day , the Clinton campaign launched a radio ad in South Carolina that takes another jab at Obama , highlighting some of his recent comments on the Republican Party .

The ad plays a portion of his interview with the Reno Journal-Gazette in which Obama said in part , `` The Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10 , 15 years . ''

The ad 's narrator asks , `` Really ? Are n't those the ideas that got us into the economic mess we 're in today ? Ideas like special tax breaks for Wall Street ? ''

The narrator goes on to say , `` Running up a $ 9 trillion debt . Refusing to raise the minimum wage or deal with the housing crisis . Are those the ideas Barack Obama 's talking about ? ''

Obama 's campaign has said the Clintons are mischaracterizing his comments , and Obama spokesman Bill Burton called it a `` negative , dishonest attack . '' Watch what the exchanges could mean for the election ''

`` The fact that Hillary Clinton has praised Ronald Reagan and supported some of the very worst Republican ideas just underscores that she will say or do anything to get elected , '' Burton said .

CNN political analyst Gloria Borger said the Clintons `` know exactly what they are doing . ''

`` This may be a very smart political strategy for them . They 've gotten Obama a little bit off his game right now because he 's busy responding to Bill Clinton , and that 's not what he wanted to be doing , '' Borger said . E-mail to a friend
