-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In focus -- 'Em iratization '

The UAE , like the rest of the Gulf , does n't have a large indigenous labour force .

Expats make up majority of the workforce . So , the government began a process called `` Emiratization . ''

In theory , its goal is to motivate locals to work , by creating jobs and training opportunities . But the UAE , like many of its neighbours , is a cash-rich nation . Citizens are entitled to a number of benefits , and few need to work .

So , how does the government create skilled local workforce ? And why are women stepping up to drive the change ?
