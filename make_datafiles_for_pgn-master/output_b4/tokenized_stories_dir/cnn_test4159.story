-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon will be sidelined for three months following successful back surgery in Milan .

The Juventus player underwent the operation on Sunday to repair a herniated disc in his back , and said afterwards he is in no hurry to return to action .

`` I feel relieved now , '' Buffon told Juventus ' official website . `` The intervention went well and this gives me faith and serenity . I must not hurry .

`` I need to take the due time to come back with no trouble and no risk of recurrence . ''

The 32-year-old suffered the injury in Italy 's opening World Cup match against Paraguay in Group F , which forced him to miss the rest of the tournament in South Africa .

The world champions suffered without Buffon , finishing bottom of the group as they failed to make it past the first round of the competition .

Buffon , who has won the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award a record nine times , is looking forward to working with new Italy manager Cesare Prandelli , who replaces the departed Marcello Lippi .

`` Considering my role , I think my career is still a long one and without the hernia I would have been able to lengthen it further , '' Buffon told Italian newspaper La Repubblica .

`` My future with the national team ? I believe I deserve my place .

`` I 've had Prandelli as a rival coach since my youth years and I knew back then that he has an exceptional rapport with his players . He is part of the group and I think that is very important . ''

Buffon , who has 102 caps , will replace Fabio Cannavaro as Italy 's captain once he is fit again following the defender 's retirement from international duty after the World Cup exit . He was previously national skipper at Euro 2008 when Cannavaro was ruled out by injury .

Meanwhile , Juventus announced the season-long loan signing of Udinese defender Marco Motta on Monday .

The 24-year-old , who spent last season at Roma as part of a co-ownership agreement , has been training with his new teammates in Pinzolo since Saturday ahead of the move .

The Turin club has the option to buy the right-back at the end of the loan deal .
