Istanbul , Turkey -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A remote-controlled roadside bomb ripped through a bus transporting Turkish military personnel and their families to a gendarmerie paramilitary base in Istanbul on Tuesday .

Turkish authorities say three gendarmerie sergeants and the 17-year-old daughter of a member of the security forces were killed in the attack .

A fourth wounded sergeant died in hospital hours after the bomb blast , an official at Istanbul 's TEM Hospital told CNN , raising the death toll to five .

`` It was a remote-controlled , fragmentation bomb that was left on the side of the road , '' said Huseyin Avni Mutlu , the governor of Istanbul , in a televised appearance broadcast live from the scene of the explosion . `` This is a terrorist act . ''

The bomb attack took place in the western , European side of the city . Mutlu said the device hit the third and last of a three-bus convoy that was traveling to the Istanbul Province Gendarmerie Command Center .

CNN Turk , CNN 's sister network , broadcast images of the white civilian passenger bus standing in the middle of the road , with purple curtains blowing through shattered windows .

The network also showed video of a man dressed in civilian clothes bleeding from the stomach , being loaded into an ambulance .

A splinter Kurdish nationalist group , the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons , claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement posted on the internet .

`` All military forces and groups , bureaucratic persons who have a role in this racist war against Kurdish people are our target , '' said the statement , which was released on the pro-Kurdish web-site , the Firat News Agency .

The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons are a splinter group from the Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK , a movement of Marxist Kurdish guerrillas who have been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s . Tuesday 's deadly explosion comes at a time when the 26-year conflict between Turkish security forces and Kurdish PKK militants is once again flaring .

Last week , a top Turkish army general announced the PKK was increasing the frequency of its attacks . General Fahri Kir said the militants are trying to expand operations beyond south-eastern , predominantly Kurdish-populated Turkey . PKK militants are making no secret of their threats to widen the battlefield in Turkey .

`` If the military operations and the political operations do not stop against the guerrillas and the Kurdish people , the actions of the PKK will spread to the cities as well , '' said PKK spokesman Roj Welat , in a telephone call to CNN from northern Iraq .

The PKK has been battling the Turkish government since the early 1980s . Initially , the movement fought to carve out a separate homeland for Turkey 's ethnic Kurdish minority , which makes up nearly 18 percent of the Turkish population , according to the CIA World Factbook .

More then 30,000 people , mostly ethnic Kurds , have been killed during the conflict . In recent years , the rebels say they have given up their demands for an independent Kurdish state , and are instead fighting for more linguistic and cultural freedoms .

Though the Kurds represent Turkey 's largest ethnic minority , their language has historically been suppressed by the Turkish state , which long referred to Kurds as `` mountain Turks . ''

Twelve Turkish troops were killed in eastern Turkey last weekend during clashes with rebels along the border with Iraq . According to the Turkish military , at least 55 Turkish security forces have been killed in fighting with the PKK since the beginning of March .

Turkish authorities said they were investigating links between Tuesday 's roadside bomb and a similar , less deadly bombing that targeted a police bus in the same Halkali district of Istanbul on June 8 . Fifteen police officers were injured in that attack .

When asked about the previous police bus blast , Istanbul Police Chief Huseyin Capkin said there may be a connection . He added that authorities were investigating the possible link .
