-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The mother of the man who gunned down eight of his colleagues at a beer distributor in Connecticut earlier this month says her son was `` no monster , '' but a `` gentle spirit '' who had reached his limit after being racially harassed at work .

Omar Thornton , 34 , called his mother , Lille Holliday , before fatally shooting himself , putting an end to the terrifying shooting spree that left eight people dead at Hartford Distributors in Manchester , Connecticut , on August 3 .

`` He said , ` I just killed the five most racist people , ' and I knew he was n't playing because he do n't talk like that , '' Holliday told CNN 's Soledad O'Brien in an interview that aired Tuesday .

Holliday said when she looked at her caller ID and saw that the phone call was coming from her son 's place of employment , `` I just kind of lost it . ''

Manchester police have said they have found no evidence of racial discrimination , and the president of Hartford Distributors said Thornton never filed a claim alleging racial discrimination . Instead , the company said it had asked him to resign after it found him stealing and selling alcoholic beverages .

Holliday disputed that statement in the interview , saying , `` I know he reported the -LSB- racial -RSB- problems because he brought home the papers that they signed . ''

Thornton 's girlfriend , Kristi Hannah , has said Thornton reported seeing drawings of a hangman with a noose around its neck as well as hearing the N-word directed toward him .

Holliday said she had few clues as to what Thornton was planning , but noted , `` I could just kind of see slowly he was just getting frustrated and aggravated . ''

`` He was getting more stressed out and he started to just kind of change , '' Holliday said . `` He started not being so relaxed but I never thought that it would be possible that something like this would happen . ''

Asked about the how calm Thornton sounded when he placed a 911 call to police after the killings , Holliday said , `` I think that he was at his limit and the calmness is something that he 's always been . I 've never really seen him enraged . ''

Instead , Holliday described her son as a `` gentle spirit '' who would buy his mother 's favorite ice cream and leave it in her freezer or leave a rose for her on her table .

`` I wish he was still here with me , '' she said . `` I miss him so much . ''
