THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Back from the weekend and ready to launch into 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines , including dueling protests , an Iranian announcement and one teen 's push for peace . I 'm Carl Azuz . This is CNN Student News .

First Up : Egg Safety

AZUZ : First up , a recall gets bigger as more than half a billion eggs are pulled off the shelves . Now last week , we told you about an egg producer that did a recall because of concerns about salmonella , a bacteria that can be found in eggs , and it can make you very sick . Well now , another producer is involved . Experts think that around 1,300 people have gotten sick from the tainted eggs . One doctor offered some safety tips .

DR. RANDY MARTIN , PIEDMONT HEART INSTITUTE : Eggs are actually a great source of protein and a lot of the good vitamins . But there are other sources . So , if you 're really concerned , have some tofu , other things like that . Refrigerate your eggs . They 've got to be less than 40 degrees . Store them individually , like you 've done , and then cook them . They 've got to be more than 160 degrees for 10 minutes . And eat them promptly .

Islamic Center Debate

AZUZ : In New York City , things are tense over plans to build an Islamic center with a mosque a few blocks away from Ground Zero . That 's one site of the 9/11 terror attacks . And Sunday , hundreds of people turned out in protest , both against the plan and for it . Most of the protesters are opposed to the plan ; they 're opposed to the Islamic center . They argue that it 's insensitive to build it so close to Ground Zero . According to a CNN poll that was taken earlier this month , nearly 70 percent of Americans agree with them ; they are against the plan . But on the other side of the debate , those folks who support building the Islamic center argue that the issue is freedom of religion . New York Governor David Patterson says there are no laws that prevent the construction of the Islamic center . But he says the controversy shows him that `` the wounds of 9/11 have n't healed . '' One of the leaders of the group that 's behind the development of the Islamic center says that there are no plans to move the construction site , at least not for now .

Shoutout

TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Time for the Shoutout ! What is the name of the Middle Eastern country that 's highlighted on this map ? If you think you know it , shout it out ! Is it : A -RRB- Saudi Arabia , B -RRB- Iran , C -RRB- Pakistan or D -RRB- Oman ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! The Islamic Republic of Iran is highlighted here . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout !

Drone Unveiled

AZUZ : And Iran is making a new type of military weapon . It 's a long-range drone , an unmanned arial vehicle . They 're pretty common in modern combat . The U.S. uses something called a Predator drone . And American officials say the unmanned vehicles help cut down risk for troops because no one actually has to be on board piloting it . Iran started producing its drones back in February . The first ones were unveiled yesterday . Iranian officials say the drones have a range of about 620 miles and can carry different types of bombs and missiles to hit ground targets . They claim that the goal of the new vehicles is to prevent aggression against their country . Meanwhile , Iran has started fueling a new nuclear energy plant . It says the plant will help make electricity . But other countries , including the United States , think Iran may try to make nuclear weapons .

Flood Economy

AZUZ : Moving east from Iran to Pakistan . We 've told you about the severe flooding there . We 're starting to see some of the aftermath of that flooding in terms of disease : skin diseases , respiratory infections , malaria . The World Health Organization says nearly a million Pakistanis are suffering some kind of illness . The floods are making a massive impact on the country 's economy as well , and Jonathan Mann has more on that .

JONATHAN MANN , CNN ANCHOR , ATLANTA : More than half of Pakistan 's people live off the land . Now , much of the land is covered by dirty water , and the people are reduced to misery .

WENDY CHAMBERLIN , PRESIDENT , MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE ; FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO PAKISTAN : It 's hard to imagine a country that is least prepared or had the thinnest of margins to be able to absorb a shock of this type .

MANN : Under all of that water , there are homes , farms and factories , bridges , roads and irrigation canals . Five hundred thousand tons of stored wheat is now reported ruined . Add potentially two million bales of cotton . Food prices have been rising in markets around the country . Pakistan 's long-standing electricity shortage is suddenly so much worse because power plants have been shut down or damaged as well . The county 's high commissioner to Britain told the Reuters news agency that it might cost $ 15 billion to rebuild from the devastation . And Pakistan -- already deeply in debt -- will have less money to spend , because its ability to earn with exports has been dramatically reduced .

CHAMBERLIN : What the floods have done is to virtually wipe out an infrastructure , agricultural infrastructure that it depended upon for its wheat exports . And because about 60 percent of the population worked in the agricultural sector , so the amount of investment that will need to go in just to bring Pakistan back up to a status quo , a status quo that was not sufficient , is going to cost billions and billions of dollars .

MANN : The world has responded with millions in aid . The World Bank alone has pledged $ 900 million more . But Pakistan will need so much more money than that , even long after the water is gone . Jonathan Mann , CNN .

Is this Legit ?

SHELBY ERDMAN , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Is this legit ? The demilitarized zone , or DMZ , divides North and South Korea . Legit ! It was established in 1953 as part of the agreement that ended the fighting in the Korean War .

Peace Mission

AZUZ : The fighting ended a while ago , but technically , North and South Korea are still at war . And the DMZ is patrolled at all times by troops from both countries . It does n't sound like the kind of place you might want to spend a vacation , but there 's a 13-year-old from Mississippi who thought so . And Emily Chang introduces him and his hope to us .

EMILY CHANG , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : He 's a 13-year-old boy turned international envoy .

JONATHAN LEE , PEACE ADVOCATE : Hello , my name is Jonathan , and I 'm the founder of a youth humanitarian environmental group called `` I See Hope . ''

CHANG : Just off a plane , Jonathan Lee greeted throngs of global media after a mission to one of the most isolated nations in the world .

LEE : Actually , I was really kind of scared at first . But once I got there , I was kind of relieved because I felt , in my experience , very safe .

CHANG : As a Korean-American from Mississippi , his idea was simple but ambitious : to convince Kim Jong-il to plant a children 's peace forest in the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea , two nations technically still at war .

LEE : I would really like , if possible , maybe of children from both countries to be able to meet and play with each other , like a big playground .

CHANG : How did you feel when he came up with this idea ?

MELISSA LEE , JONATHAN 'S MOTHER : I was like , really ? You want to go to North Korea , and when ? And then he was so adamant and so strong about how he felt , I was like , okay . I was cool with it . I was fine .

KYOUNG LEE , JONATHAN 'S FATHER : I said , no way .

CHANG : Completely opposite .

His father , originally from South Korea , was hesitant , but eventually agreed and the family embarked on their journey .

LEE : My idea for the mission statement of the children 's peace forest is `` Above politics , above borders , above ideology , above conflict . ''

CHANG : Jonathan 's humanitarian work started three years ago . He created Go Green Man , a superhero who teaches kids to protect the environment . He 's met with President Obama and other top leaders . He 's filed more than 30 iReports on CNN and waged a seven-day campaign to urge McDonald 's to recycle . But his trip to North Korea would be the most challenging and eye opening .

LEE : I went to a school children 's palace and I found out the children there are very talented . They learned piano and did it really impressively . The accordion , calligraphy , embroidery .

CHANG : He did n't meet with Kim Jong-il , but says he did meet with other government officials who told him a peace treaty would have to be signed before there could ever be a children 's peace forest .

LEE : Well , I was a little disappointed , but I 'm going to keep trying . Maybe if I keep trying , I do n't know , maybe eventually , hopefully .

CHANG : Emily Chang , CNN , Beijing .

Before We Go

AZUZ : All right , before we go today , we 've got a story that 's just too doggone cute -- or ugly -- to ignore . This is Izzy , a two-year old Chihuahua . But she 's only half the story . Look down by her leg . That 's a baby squirrel ! Two of those were abandoned under the tree . Izzy 's owner took in the squirrels , but Izzy decided to take over , adopting the little ones . We 've actually been holding on to this video for a few days , kinda waiting to show it off to you .
