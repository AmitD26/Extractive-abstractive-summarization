-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday denied a stay of execution appeal from Teresa Lewis , scheduled to be the first woman executed in the United States in five years .

Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell previously rejected a clemency request from the death row inmate , who is set to die by injection Thursday evening .

Lewis , a 41-year-old grandmother , pleaded guilty to her part in the 2002 slayings of her husband and stepson in their rural home near Danville , Virginia , about 145 miles from Richmond . Two male co-conspirators -- the triggermen -- were given life in prison without parole .

McDonnell last week refused to issue a stay for Lewis , who is the first woman scheduled to be executed in Virginia in nearly a century .

`` Having carefully reviewed the petition for clemency , the judicial opinions in this case , and other relevant materials , I find no compelling reason to set aside the sentence that was imposed by the Circuit Court and affirmed by all reviewing courts , '' the governor wrote . `` Accordingly , I decline to intervene and have notified the appropriate counsel and family of my decision . ''

Lewis and her lawyers had formally asked the governor to spare her life , arguing she has an IQ that is borderline mentally retarded and that she was manipulated to commit the crimes by a dominant male co-defendant . She pleaded guilty to her participation in the murders , but now regrets her actions .

`` I just want the governor to know that I am so sorry , deeply from my heart , '' she recently told CNN . `` And if I could take it back , I would , in a minute ... I just wish I could take it back . And I 'm sorry for all the people that I 've hurt in the process . ''

Lewis had admitted to police she concocted the plot to kill her husband , Julian Lewis , and his son , C.J. Lewis , an Army reservist set to be deployed to Iraq . At the time , she was having an affair with Matthew Shallenberger and paid him and then-19-year-old Rodney Fuller to commit murder for the victims ' insurance money . Court records show Lewis gave the two killers cash to buy weapons and left the door of the rural home open for easy entry .

Teresa was in bed with her husband when he was blasted with a shotgun by Shallenberger . Julian Lewis survived long enough to tell police : `` My wife knows who did this to me . '' C.J. Lewis was killed by Fuller in his bedroom down the hall .

Despite her guilty plea , a state judge later sentenced Lewis to death while sparing the lives of triggermen Shallenberger and Fuller . The judge at sentencing called her `` the head of this serpent . ''

The state argued Lewis was the mastermind of the murders-for-hire , and officials say she does not deserve mercy .

`` I can frankly say that Teresa Lewis is as evil a person as I 've ever met , '' said David Grimes , commonwealth 's attorney for Pittsylvania County , who was at the scene of the crimes shortly after they occurred . `` I would wager with some assurance that you would n't find anyone who knew her before this event occurred who thought she was mentally retarded , or had a limited mentality -- that it would ever cross their minds . ''

Her supporters say Lewis is deeply remorseful and has been a model prisoner , helping fellow female inmates cope with their circumstances .

`` I do feel I could be a lot of help to some of the women -- which I have already . From my understanding I 've already helped a lot , to change their lives , or made them look at their lives in a different way , '' she told CNN .

Amnesty International and best-selling author John Grisham are among those supporting leniency .

Grimes said Lewis has a `` fairly low '' IQ but noted courts have concluded she is not mentally retarded . The state also argued Lewis waited 45 minutes after the shootings before calling police and that she had involved her then-16-year-old daughter in the plot .

Defense lawyer Jim Rocap argued that such evidence suggested `` Teresa could not have been the mastermind . ''

`` Shallenberger has stated , and the experts that have examined her agree , that she was being used by Shallenberger , not the other way around , '' he said .

Lewis ' attorneys say that Shallenberger admitted he used Lewis to get at the $ 250,000 she would receive in the event her stepson died . A letter from Shallenberger to another woman , they say , said that the only reason he slept with Lewis was `` so she would give me the insurance money . ''

`` She was exactly what I was looking for , '' he wrote . `` Some ugly bitch who married her husband for the money and I knew I could get to fall head over heels for me . ''

Furthermore , they said , Shallenberger said he `` manipulated the whole thing '' and `` knew he was going ` take ' Lewis from the moment he met her , '' according to an affidavit from one of their investigators .

But Shallenberger , who committed suicide in 2006 , refused to sign the affidavit and actually tore up and ate part of it .

Still , Grimes said , his investigation showed that Lewis took an active role in the plot , that she connived and manipulated everyone from her late husband to her lover to her children . From early on , he said , Lewis schemed several different ways to get the inheritance money . She helped plan an earlier plot to kill her husband that failed .
