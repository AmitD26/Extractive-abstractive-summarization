-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The search for a freckle-faced 10-year-old North Carolina girl is over , with police announcing Friday that they had found her remains .

`` We have recovered enough physical evidence to believe we have found Zahra -LRB- Baker -RRB- , '' said Hickory , North Carolina , police Chief Tom Adkins . `` Today , our community mourns , our state mourns , our nation mourns , and the world mourns . ''

Adkins said that DNA from a bone dug up off Christie Road in Caldwell County -- the same place Zahra Baker 's prosthetic leg was recovered late last month -- was consistent with that taken from the girl 's personal items in her Hickory home , about 15 miles away .

Meanwhile , investigators are working to confirm that more human remains found earlier this week on Dudley Shoals Road in Caldwell County -- five miles from the Christie Road discovery -- also belonged to Zahra .

The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation will create a complete DNA profile of Zahra , using samples taken from her biological father and mother , to confirm they match the Caldwell County remains , according to Adkins . While there will be no confirmation until those tests are completed , Adkins said Friday that medical examiner 's staff at the Dudley Shoals Road site said the remains found there `` were consistent with a child . ''

`` Investigators , agents , officers and staff who have worked on this case are devastated that they were not able to find Zahra alive and bring her home safely , '' Adkins said .

The girl 's stepmother , Elisa Baker , reported Zahra missing on October 9 . Elisa Baker was arrested the next day , after police said that she admitted writing a fake ransom note found at the family 's home in Hickory . But no one other than a relative had seen Zahra since September 25 , according to authorities , when a woman said she saw the girl at a furniture store .

In mid-October , police announced they were treating Zahra 's disappearance as a homicide .

The disappearance of Zahra made international news . The girl , whose biological parents were both from Australia , lost part of her left leg at age 5 and lost hearing in both ears while being treated for cancer .

The girl 's father , Adam Troy Baker , was arrested late last month in nearby Catawba County on eight charges : five counts of writing bad checks and three counts of failing to appear in court . Authorities said that the charges were unrelated to Zahra 's disappearance , and he was later released on bail .

His wife , Elisa Baker , remains in jail . Besides an obstruction of justice charge for the ransom note , she was accused of writing worthless checks . Police said that she has been cooperating with investigators , including going with them to the Dudley Shoals search site .

Elisa Baker 's sister , Carrie Fairchild , spoke on HLN 's `` Nancy Grace '' soon after police reported they had found Zahra 's remains .

`` Most of the family 's reaction is we 're heartbroken and dealing with probably a lot of anger , too , '' said Fairchild . `` She 's made her way into everyone 's heart . She was a special girl and she will definitely be missed . ''

Friday 's announcement is the most significant , but not the first major development in the search for Zahra 's remains . On October 27 , investigators announced they had found the 10-year-old 's prosthetic leg in a brushy area off Christie Road . And earlier this month , authorities reported finding the bone that Adkins said Friday belonged to Zahra .

Zahra 's biological mother , Emily Dietrich , who has not seen her daughter since she was an infant , arrived in North Carolina on Thursday . Dietrich was emotional as she kneeled outside a makeshift memorial at the Baker home , CNN affiliate WCNC reported .

At Friday 's news conference , Adkins stressed that `` this is still a developing case '' and that investigators would continue to gather evidence . No one has been charged with a crime directly related to Zahra 's disappearance and death .
