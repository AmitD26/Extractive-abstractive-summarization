-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- 1 . `` Cracklin ' Rosie , '' by Neil Diamond

She 's not a girl -- she 's a bottle of wine . Neil Diamond told Rolling Stone that he got the idea from an Indian tribe in Canada with a much higher male than female population . When the guys with girlfriends all went out on dates , the bachelor guys got together and drank homemade hooch .

And actually , Cracklin ' Rosie is pretty decent wordplay when you realize the song 's boozy origins : `` Crackling '' is used in the wine world to describe a wine that 's lightly sparkling . You can actually buy a crackling rosé .

2 . `` Elenore , '' by The Turtles

If you 've ever listened to this song and thought the line `` you 're my pride and joy etcetera '' felt like a pretty poor attempt at lyrics , well , you 're right . `` Elenore '' was n't a girl , but an anti-love letter to the Turtles ' record label .

The label was demanding a hit just like `` Happy Together , '' which had come out the previous year , so the band slapped together a song they felt was insanely clichéd , happy-go-lucky and generally crappy . To everyone 's surprise , it was a big hit .

3 . `` Jane , '' by Barenaked Ladies

Jane St. Clair is n't a real girl , but an intersection in Toronto that piqued then-lead singer Steve Page 's imagination : Jane Street and St. Clair Avenue .

4 . `` Sexy Sadie , '' by The Beatles

Sexy Sadie was really Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . The song was about how they were disillusioned with him after he hit on Mia Farrow and some of the other girls studying with him . Mia Farrow and most of the group later felt bad for making these accusations , feeling they had probably misinterpreted his actions .

5 . `` Ana 's Song -LRB- Open Fire -RRB- , '' Silverchair

At first glance , the lyrics pleading with Ana to die might seem shocking , but in reality , lead singer Daniel Johns suffered from anorexia nervosa and was writing about his experience with it .

6 . `` Delilah , '' by Queen

Delilah was one of Freddie Mercury 's beloved cats .

7 . `` Martha My Dear , '' by The Beatles

The lyrics to this one may have been inspired by Paul McCartney 's girlfriend , Jane Asher -- he says they `` probably '' were -- but the name comes from his Old English Sheepdog .

8 . `` Shannon , '' by Henry Gross

Speaking of dogs , ex-Sha Na Na singer Henry Gross wrote this song about the tragic death of Beach Boy Brian Wilson 's Irish Setter , Shannon .

9 . `` Helen Wheels , '' by Paul McCartney and Wings

Helen Wheels was McCartney 's punny name for the Land Rover he and Linda McCartney owned .

10 . `` Mony , Mony , '' by Tommy James and the Shondells

The band had the song , but needed a two-syllable girl name to stick in the lyrics . That 's when Tommy James happened upon a Mutual of New York Insurance Company sign that had a dollar sign in the middle of the `` O '' and noticed that its acronym was MONY .

He and his songwriting partner had a laugh about what a great name MONY was for such a company , and ended up calling their fictional girl `` Mony . ''
