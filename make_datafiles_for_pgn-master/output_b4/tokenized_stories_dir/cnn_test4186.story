Rome -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Italy 's Constitutional Court Thursday struck down key parts of a law that would protect Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from prosecution .

The law was designed to halt criminal proceedings against top government officials for 18 months on the grounds that they are too busy to appear in court .

But Italy 's top court ruled that 18 months is too long , and that judges , not politicians , should be the ones to determine if a defendant is free to appear in court .

The law will automatically be modified to conform with the ruling when the Constitutional Court publishes its verdict .

The court heard arguments Tuesday about the legality of the `` legitimate impediment '' law , which would have granted top Italian government officials what amounted to immunity while they were in office .

The Berlusconi-backed law said top government officials could not be prosecuted because their official duties made it impossible for them to attend court hearings .

The law was approved in March 2010 , but prosecutors in Milan challenged the constitutionality of the measure , saying it should be judges , not politicians , who determined whether someone had time to attend court .

Two separate trials against Berlusconi are pending . He 's accused of bribing a witness to commit perjury in one case , and of tax fraud and other financial irregularities in another . Both trials began but were suspended when the immunity law was passed .

Berlusconi has called the charges politically motivated .

A third case against the prime minister , also related to tax fraud , is in preliminary stages .

Berlusconi has been tried on at least 17 charges since first taking office as prime minister in 1994 , but remains very popular with the Italian public .

The immunity law was due to expire 18 months after it was passed , which would have been in October .
