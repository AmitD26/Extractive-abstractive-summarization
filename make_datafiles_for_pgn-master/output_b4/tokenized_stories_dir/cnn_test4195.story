-LRB- OPRAH.com -RRB- -- People across the country are counting their pennies more closely than ever and asking themselves some tough questions about what they can really afford . Suze Orman is here to approve or deny what your finances can handle -- and this time around , she 's settling a few family feuds .

Money expert Suze Orman answers the question that keeps people up at night : Can I afford this ?

Many women have husbands with expensive hobbies , and Michaela is one of them . Michaela has her own Mary Kay business and just started her own cake decorating business .

Her husband Chris works in sales and is the ultimate Washington Redskins fan . `` When I met him , I knew he was a Redskins fan . I just really had no clue he was a Redskins fanatic , '' she says .

Michaela estimates her husband has spent about $ 25,000 on his `` man cave '' -- including a $ 2,200 television , a $ 900 surround-sound system , custom-framed photos worth about $ 300 and a poker table worth $ 500 to $ 1,000 .

Chris spares no expense to get Redskins gear for their three kids , Michaela says -- including jerseys and a Power Wheels Escalade in the Redskins ' burgundy color . `` I happen to know my husband 's e-mail password , and there are 320 e-mails of tracking purchases , '' she says . `` I would say that -LSB- delivery services are -RSB- at our house almost every day .

Michaela says Chris did n't grow up with much and now wants to enjoy some of his success . But Chris and Michaela are n't debt-free . Together , they owe $ 130,000 in student loans . `` It often makes me wonder if we will ever get them paid off . If we 'll ever get to the point where we can start thinking about our kids ' college and the future so they do n't have the loans that we have , '' she says . Watch saving money in tough times ''

So Michaela has a question for Orman : `` With all of our student loans and his fabulous hobby , can we afford his hobby or should we be putting the money somewhere else ? ''

Chris estimates that he spends about $ 7,000 a year on his hobby . Can he keep it up ? Orman runs the numbers .

Chris and Michaela 's monthly income is $ 9,000 , and their monthly expenses are $ 7,700 . Even with $ 1,300 leftover every month , they still face their large student debts and only have $ 5,000 in an emergency fund .

`` In this economy , what I 'd like to see is that people have at least an eight-month emergency fund , which would be $ 40,000 because we have three children here , '' Orman says .

Orman denies Chris -- but with love . `` We only have $ 5,000 of an emergency fund , '' she says .

Chris and Michaela have life insurance , but Orman says it 's simply not enough . Chris is insured for $ 350,000 , and Michaela is insured for $ 200,000 . The couple still owes $ 290,000 on their mortgage , which is $ 2,200 each month . If Chris dies , his life insurance policy will only cover the mortgage -- and still leaves the Michaela with $ 4,000 a month in expenses .

`` What is the rule of thumb ? You plan for the worst and you hope for the best , '' Orman says . `` But -LSB- Chris is -RSB- in sales . Anybody in sales , anything can happen at any time . So I love that you love football ... But you can not afford it , sir . ''

Chris takes everything in stride . He says he 's already started to look into better life insurance policies and wants to start college savings funds for his kids . `` My friend , he gets it ! '' Orman says . Oprah.com : How to save for college

Ken and Deb are a couple facing a heart-wrenching life decision in the middle of a poor economy -- divorce . Married for 12 years , the couple has a 9-year-old son and twin 7-year-old girls , one with Down 's Syndrome .

`` Having the three children , it 's been taxing on us . It just seems like we never get a chance to be alone and be together and just talk things out , '' Ken says . `` We 're just not on the same page . ''

Deb says she does n't put Ken -- or herself -- first . `` My children are first and foremost in our life , and I do n't think that 's a good way to build a marriage or a life either , '' she says . `` You kind of cast the other person aside . ''

Ken and Deb signed separation papers in April 2008 but still live together in the house they purchased 10 years ago .

`` Ken and I have been living in separate rooms since last November . He lives down the hall in what used to be our home office , and it 's very difficult living under the same roof , '' Deb says . `` Unfortunately , we can not afford to financially divorce and move on with our lives . ''

In April 2009 , Ken and Deb will be officially divorced . To complicate matters , Ken recently found out that he will be losing his job . `` I think if Ken and I separated , we 'd both be more relaxed and we 'd be happier people , '' Deb says . `` Obviously , we can not afford to maintain separate households . ''

Deb has come to Orman for help with her question -- can she afford to get divorced ?

Before Ken lost his job , the couple made a combined $ 4,500 a month . With only Deb 's income , the household total will decrease to $ 1,645 . Monthly expenses that will not decrease total about $ 4,300 each month . The couple also has $ 10,000 in credit card debt .

Despite their precarious financial situation , Orman approves Deb for a divorce .

`` In this particular situation , if they were to sell the house , there is enough equity in the house to pay off their mortgages for them to have $ 10,000 extra to pay off the credit card debt and for them each to have $ 5,000 to start over in renting an apartment , '' Orman says .

Orman says Deb could rent an apartment for about $ 800 a month . `` And on everything else that I figured for her , she could live in that apartment with her children and make it for $ 1,645 a month , also assuming that one day Ken will have to pay child support when he does get a job , '' Orman says .

Still , Orman says the real question here is n't about the money . `` Can she afford not to , emotionally speaking ? '' Orman says .

Because Deb says she never puts herself first , Orman wants to know how much longer Deb would stay in a marriage she says is already over .

`` How much longer are you going to stay in a situation that you know is absolutely over because you think you do n't have the money to leave ? '' Orman says . `` You lose your soul for money . You lose your children in terms of not understanding what 's happening for money . Is money worth that ? ''

But Deb 's not alone . Orman says the No. 1 deficit in this country is women not taking care of themselves . `` Women give of themselves . They never give to themselves . And that we have to change , '' Orman says .

Deb says she 's willing to try Orman 's recommendations . `` I think we need to be separate to find out what we both need , '' she says . Oprah.com : Can one woman afford her dream wedding ?
