CAIRO , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I 'm traveling with a chunk of gold -- the World Cup Trophy -- from Zurich , Switzerland to Cairo , Egypt .

CNN 's Ben Wedeman checks the World Cup is not getting a better seat than him .

When CNN Johannesburg Bureau Chief Kim Norgaard suggested I fly from Zurich to Cairo to cover the arrival of the World Cup trophy in Africa in the lead-up to the games in South Africa next summer , I thought he was joking .

Kim , an unabashed football -LRB- soccer -RRB- fanatic , knows I 'm , well , skeptical about a group of grown men paid hefty salaries to kick a little ball around a big field .

But variety is the spice of journalism , you might say , and Kim is a friend with whom I needed to settle an old debt from Turkey , so I agreed to give it a try .

Football is n't a subject I know much about , so I realized I would have to cram .

As it turned out I did n't have much time to prepare because someone broke into our house in Cairo the day before I was scheduled to depart . Rather than study World Cup football , I had to deal with the police , change locks , etc. .

Whoever it was did n't steal much , but here 's an odd aside : the thief left behind his -LRB- or hers ? -RRB- battered black running shoes , making off with my 15-year old son Christopher 's brand-new trainers . Preparing , perhaps , for a career in football ? Watch CNN 's journey with the World Cup . ''

Flying from Cairo to Zurich , where FIFA or the International Federation of Football Associations is headquartered , I finally found time to learn a few things about the object that would be my travel companion from Switzerland back to Egypt .

The trophy is made of more than five kilograms of 18 carat gold , with two bands of malachite running around the bottom .

Probably for good reason mere mortals such as myself and Beirut cameraman Christian Streib , who is with me on this trip , are n't allowed to touch the trophy .

According to FIFA regulations , only heads of state and members of teams that won the World Cup have that privilege . The trophy 's guard can handle it , but must wear special white gloves .

The trophy is worth a fortune -- for its symbolic value as well as its gold -- and is protected around the clock .

But the trophy on tour in Africa is not the first -- it 's a replacement created after Brazil were allowed to keep the original when they won the tournament for a third time .

And it 's that one currently in circulation , and presumably in the back of the plane we 're flying to Cairo in , packed away in a simple aluminum case .

While on tour the trophy is under constant guard , though as we passed through security at Zurich Airport to board the charter flight to Cairo I saw it go through the x-ray machine -- a big black mass of metal on the screen .

The airport security personnel asked the guard to open the box , and that was the closest Christian or I came to it .

We resisted the urge to get our grubby hands all over it , however .

The chances are slim that either of us will ever be on a winning World Cup team , and slimmer still that either of us will become head of state .

I 'd share more information about how the trophy is transported , but the tour organizers are worried that too much detail might endanger the cup and those guarding it , especially in some African countries where crime is rife .

According to the plan , after Cairo the trophy will be flown to almost every African capital before ending up in South Africa . The Coca Cola Company is covering the cost of the trip .

There is one African capital it probably wo n't be going to , however , and that 's Mogadishu , in Somalia . The city has been a battlefield on and off for the last 20 years , the airport often bombarded by mortars and artillery .

FIFA and Coca Cola have yet to officially turn down the request by the interim Somali government to bring the trophy to Mogadishu . If peace suddenly breaks out , they might actually do it .

Here is a personal World Cup footnote . Thanks to Italy 's defeat in the 1990 semifinals of the World Cup in Italy , the birth of my daughter Amira was uneventful . My wife Yasmine and I were in Rome that summer when Italy and Argentina had a semifinal match .

Yasmine , a native of Rome , was nine-months pregnant and then some , and went into labor shortly after the game ended , thankfully , with Italy 's defeat .

If Italy had won there would have been celebratory chaos in the streets until sunrise , and my wife would have ended up delivering in the back seat of the car .

As it was , the streets were empty . Italy was in mourning . And I was relieved .
