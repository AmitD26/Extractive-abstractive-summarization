-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lindsay Spencer was two years out of college and facing one of the biggest decisions of her young life : what to do with those Facebook friend requests from people she met through her job .

Blurring work and personal friendships is prompting Lindsay Spencer to maintain separate Facebook pages .

`` There 's nothing on my personal page that 's horrible , '' says the 24-year-old communications coordinator for the National Peanut Board in Atlanta , Georgia . `` It 's just that there are some things that are not work-appropriate . ''

Many of the job-related friend requests came after meeting people at conferences . Eventually they would find her by searching on Facebook and request to be `` friended . ''

Initially Spencer decided to ignore the requests . After all , does a virtual stranger really care what her favorite movies are ? Do they really benefit from learning details about her weekend leisure time ?

Spencer 's answer was to create a second Facebook page , which she devotes to work-related information .

This means she now has her `` friend friends , '' about 400 of them , and then she has her `` work friends , '' four , so far .

Spencer 's modern dilemma is becoming more common throughout the world , experts say , as friendships with co-workers extend to our lives spent online after work hours .

Simultaneously , our computer time at the office is becoming an extension of our personal life , they say .

` Work takes place in more places now '

This is n't necessarily a bad thing , says Paul Levinson , professor of communication and media studies at Fordham University in New York .

`` No one ever forces us to go online -- we can shut it off , '' he says . `` What this is really all about is an increase in information sharing . ''

And with the popularity of smartphones and other handheld devices , many people carry their work into their homes and are never separated from e-mail .

They also have the ability to stay in constant touch with their favorite social networking sites .

`` There is increasingly less difference in work life and personal time , '' Levinson says . `` We are coming from a time when there were very clear boundaries . That comes from an older expectation . Work takes place in more places now . ''

And again , Levinson does n't think it 's a bad thing to have access to all this information about work and co-workers .

Spencer , who has friended her manager but not her big boss , says she likes to think her co-workers are sensible enough not to put out too much information -- especially photographs -- on social networking sites .

And so far , so good . There have been no embarrassing images of drunken escapades , no status updates erupting with emotional outbursts .

Social networking sites have both good and bad uses in the business world , says Dr. Lynn Friedman , a clinical psychologist and adjunct faculty member at Johns Hopkins University .

Face time vs. Facebook time

People can use the sites to make new acquaintances outside their departments and groups , and users can extend their networks beyond the traditional workplace , she says in an interview by e-mail . `` It 's a way to enter new professional galaxies . ''

But people can use the sites too much and as a consequence give less time to meeting with co-workers in person .

`` In most businesses , it 's optimal to mix social networking with real-life face-to-face interaction , '' she writes . `` However , social networking can provide a springboard for identifying kindred spirits with whom one might want to do something old-fashioned like , say , having a cup of coffee . In an ideal world , it 's best to relate to others in both cyber and real space . ''

Paula Pile , a psychologist who practices in North Carolina , says you need to be careful to make sure that social networking sites are n't encroaching on your office time .

More than an hour a day is excessive , she warns . Worse , spending too much time on the sites can disrupt your balance between work and private time .

It can also take you out of your family time with your spouse or children .

`` If you are spending two hours at home on them each night , you are not available to your family , '' she says .

Set boundaries

Both psychologists advise setting boundaries between yourself and the people you work with , as well as your online `` friends . ''

Friedman also suggests setting goals for using social networking sites and telling others about your limits to avoid hurt feelings .

She uses an example of someone who lets people know , `` I do n't do those things at nights or on weekends so I can have my time with family . ''

And Pile says to consider who you 're corresponding with during your work time .

If they are n't people you would talk to in `` real life , '' she says , you probably are wasting time .
