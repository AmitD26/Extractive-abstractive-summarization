CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : I 'm Carl Azuz and this is CNN Student News ! We 're back from the weekend with 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines , including why you should n't believe everything you read .

First Up : Egypt in Crisis

AZUZ : We 're beginning in Egypt where there are some signs that things are slowly getting back to normal . In the capital city of Cairo , some shops and banks are re-opening , and traffic is starting to look like it did before the political protests of the past couple weeks . But there are some changes going on in the country . On Saturday , some key members of the ruling party resigned . And yesterday , Vice President Omar Suleiman met with representatives from groups that have protested against the Egyptian government . They talked about some ideas for how Egypt might move forward , although some of the protesters still out in the streets said the people meeting with Suleiman do n't necessarily represent them .

We 've been watching this political unrest in Egypt and other parts of the Middle East . Barbara Starr joins us now to talk about the potential impact that it could have on the American military .

BARBARA STARR , CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT : With unrest now sweeping across Egypt and neighboring countries , new questions about whether it 's a security crisis here at the Pentagon . A quick look at the map tells you how deeply tied the U.S. military is to regimes across the Middle East and Persian Gulf .

In Egypt , the U.S. provides around $ 1.3 billion a year in military aid . In return , the U.S. gets vital military air , land and sea access . U.S. warships transit the Suez Canal on their way to and from the Persian Gulf . Loss of the canal could lead to catastrophic delays and a crisis .

In Yemen , where President Saleh is facing demonstrations and has already said he wo n't run for re-election , the U.S. has been quietly training Yemeni forces to go after a rising threat from al Qaeda . The U.S. has conducted drone and missile strikes inside Yemen . The question : will a new government cooperate with U.S. counterterrorism efforts ?

In Jordan , King Abdullah is facing increasing discontent due to rising prices and unemployment . Jordan remains one of the U.S. 's closest allies in the War on Terror . Jordan 's intelligence services secretly operate against key al Qaeda targets . Jordan has also helped train Iraqi forces , and Jordanian troops serve in Afghanistan .

Three key Gulf allies provide other assistance . Qatar is home of the regional headquarters of the U.S. Central Command , which oversees the region and keeps a close eye on Iran . Kuwait is a staging area for U.S. troops moving in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq . And Bahrain is home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet , which patrols the Persian Gulf and pirate-infested waters off Somalia .

The U.S. spends billions of dollars in military aid and assistance across the region in return for all of this access . But the question may now be if the social unrest that is emerging leads to regime change , will the new regimes want to do the old business with the U.S. military ? Barbara Starr , CNN , the Pentagon .

Unemployment Report

AZUZ : The U.S. unemployment rate is down ! That should be good news , but it 's not that simple . During January , the rate dropped from 9.4 percent to 9 percent flat . But some economists ' descriptions of the unemployment report ranged from positive to mysterious to disappointing . One thing most everyone agreed on : the weather played a big role in all of this . All of those snow storms we 've talked about kept people from getting out to look for work and kept a lot of companies from hiring .

Shoutout

MATT CHERRY , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Armstrong 's gifted class at Zora Ellis Jr. . High School in Talladega , Alabama ! Who won the 1980 U.S. presidential election ? Was it : A -RRB- Ronald Reagan , B -RRB- Jimmy Carter , C -RRB- George H.W. Bush or D -RRB- Gerald Ford ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Ronald Reagan won that election to become the 40th president of the United States . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout !

Reagan Remembered

AZUZ : Ronald Reagan was 69 years old when he won that election . The oldest American elected president and during his his 8 years in office , President Reagan had several famous firsts . He appointed the first female justice to the U.S. Supreme Court . He submitted the first trillion dollar budget to Congress . And he was the first U.S. president to address both houses of the British Parliament . Yesterday would have been President Reagan 's 100th birthday . He died in 2004 . A ceremony for the late president yesterday included a wreath-laying at his memorial site and a 21-gun salute . As America remembers Ronald Reagan , Ted Rowlands takes us on a tour of his presidential library in Simi Valley , California .

FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN : Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall .

TED ROWLANDS , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Video and sound are a constant feature . Reagan 's movies and speeches are played throughout .

JOHN HEUBUSCH , EXECECUTIVE DIRECTOR , REAGAN PRESIDENTIAL FOUNDATION : We have right over here to my right , the very famous debate with President Carter , where he asked the question , `` Are you better off now than you were four years ago ? ''

ROWLANDS : There 's also a Berlin Wall , with tunnels , an interactive videogame table and an inauguration day exhibit complete with Reagan 's speech on the TelePrompTer . His diaries have been digitized for people to flip through . There 's also an exhibit dealing with the assassination attempt on President Reagan after 70 days in office . As in many presidential libraries , you can see an exact replica of the Oval Office . And Air Force One , the actual plane used by seven U.S. presidents and the one Reagan flew in during his eight years in office .

HEUBUSCH : They get to see right where the president sits in the aircraft . They get to see his working quarters . They get to see where the Secret Service would sit , where the traveling press corps sits . They get to touch and feel the airplane . It 's just a great experience .

ROWLANDS : An Iran-Contra affair exhibit deals with the low point of the Reagan presidency . Also on display , the letter Reagan wrote , with the audio of him reading it , announcing to the world he had Alzheimer 's .

REAGAN : My fellow Americans , I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer 's disease .

Is This Legit ?

TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Is this legit ? The first Super Bowl was played in 1967 . Yep , it 's true ! That game featured a face-off between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs .

Super Bowl Ads

AZUZ : In Super Bowl XLV yesterday , you saw it , the Packers and the Steelers . You know what happened in the game . We want to talk about the commercials ! Whether you thought these were good or bad , all of them had something in common . They were expensive . The average cost of a 30-second ad in this year 's Super Bowl was three million dollars .

One industry that was a big part of yesterday 's ads : car companies . Nine of them paid to run commercials . Some experts think that could be a good sign for the economy . Here 's why : If the companies are willing to spend millions for Super Bowl ads , it might mean they think viewers are willing to go out and buy the cars . And if people are willing to buy big items like that , that could mean people are feeling more confident about the economy .

Tree Octopus ?

AZUZ : Your teacher tells you about an endangered species : the tree octopus . Your assignment is to go learn more about the animal , and there 's a web site with all the information you need for your report . Only problem ? The entire thing is a hoax ! That really happened . The Department of Education sponsored a study run by researchers at the University of Connecticut . They set up this fake web site about the tree octopus filled with all kinds of facts . None of them true ; there is no such thing as tree octopus . The researchers wanted to see what kind of impact the internet can have on students ' ability to think critically . These were seventh graders . And not only did they accept all the facts on the web site as they were written , after the students were told it was all made up , some of them still refused to believe it was a hoax .

Blog Promo

AZUZ : I 've never spoken to a student who says he believes everything he 's read on the internet . But this study would suggest that many students actually do ! We want you to visit our blog today and tell us : What can be done to be sure that what you see online is the truth ? CNNStudentNews.com !

Before We Go

AZUZ : Two things I can do : I can run four miles , and I can eat a dozen doughnuts . But not at the same time ! That 's the challenge these folks took on over the weekend . It 's the annual Krispy Kreme Challenge . You run two miles , eat a dozen doughnuts , then run two miles back . And you have to do it all in under one hour . I do n't think you need an excuse to down a dozen doughnuts , but this race does raise money for charity .

Goodbye

AZUZ : And that kind of thing always makes you feel good , doughnut ? If you can stomach more puns like that one , we 'll hurl some more your way tomorrow . For CNN Student News , I 'm Carl Azuz .
