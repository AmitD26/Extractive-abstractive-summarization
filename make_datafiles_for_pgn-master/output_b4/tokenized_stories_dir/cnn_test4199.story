-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- AC Milan captain Gennaro Gattuso has apologised for head-butting Tottenham assistant manager Joe Jordan at the end of Tuesday 's stormy Champions League clash at the San Siro .

Gattuso had already had an altercation with 59-year-old Jordan , who ironically starred for Milan during his playing career , earlier in Tottenham 's 1-0 win , before the two went head-to-head again at the final whistle .

Speaking to the media following Milan 's defeat , Gattuso said : `` I lost my head and I 'm taking responsibility because I did something I should n't have done .

Why Gattuso has to lose his cool

`` I was annoyed about the words I 'd exchanged with Jordan earlier . We were both speaking Scottish given that I played in his country in Glasgow but I 'm not going to say what was said .

`` I made a mistake doing what I did to an older person , and that 's it . I will wait and see what UEFA decides now , '' he added .

And European football 's governing body UEFA have already issued a statement saying : `` UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Gennaro Gattuso after the incidents that took place after the match between AC Milan and Tottenham .

`` The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body will meet next Monday February 21 to discuss this case . ''

Gattuso 's behavior drew widespread condemnation , with his own coach Massimiliano Allegri expecting his player to be disciplined .

Allegri told a press conference : `` It was an unpleasant episode , I really do n't know why it happened . ''

`` I did n't like this episode , it 's not nice to see , of course it will be looked at by UEFA , there was certainly a reason that he behaved this way but you ca n't excuse it . ''

Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp added : `` Gattuso had a flair-up with Joe Jordan . I do n't know why . He obviously has n't done his homework . He really could have picked a fight with someone other than Joe .

`` He put his head into Joe 's face for some reason . It was crazy . He lost his head during the game . ''
