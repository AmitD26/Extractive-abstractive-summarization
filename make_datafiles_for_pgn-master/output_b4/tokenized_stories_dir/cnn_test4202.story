Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Kepler Meo is n't nervous . As befits a singer playing a principal role in a major opera production , he suffers the last-minute adjustments to makeup , hair and wardrobe .

Then finally he is left alone to prepare for this night 's performance of Benjamin Britten 's `` The Turn of the Screw . '' Alone except for his mother . Michael Kepler Meo is just 12 years old .

`` It 's really fun to sing , '' the ` tween confides , as he runs through a series of scales and brief snatches of the music that he will soon be performing on stage . His voice is high , crisp and crystal clear . A boy soprano . And behind the voice is a power and control that seem almost alien in one so young .

Los Angeles Opera Music Director James Conlon briefly peeks into the dressing room to wish young Meo good luck . `` Places please ... '' echoes through the dressing rooms and sends Meo scurrying through a maze of backstage cables to the massive turntable stage that will soon deliver him to the spotlight .

Michael 's professional singing career began just a couple of years ago . He had been singing in a boys ' choir in his native Portland , Oregon . It was one activity among many along with soccer and learning guitar . The Portland Opera company was holding auditions for `` The Turn of the Screw '' and Michael 's choirmaster suggested he give it a try .

`` I had a very vague idea even what opera was , '' Michael remembers , `` All I got was the version I got in school of the fat lady singing . ''

Michael won the role of Miles , a troubled boy threatened by menacing ghosts in a rambling English country home . It is a pivotal role in the production . He also starred in the premier performance of `` The Golden Ticket , '' an operatic version of `` Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . ''

Conlon says only a handful of boys are capable of taking on operatic roles . `` You have to find somebody whose voice is strong enough , and somebody who can sing at all levels with a very focused tone . And Michael fits all of those characteristics . ''

`` He was always making goofy noises all the time , from the time he was a toddler , '' says Michael 's mother , Trudy Meo . Meo says she is n't sure where Michael came by his musical talent . `` I 'm not musical at all , '' she says , `` When he sings I 'm almost useless in helping him . ''

An opera career has meant occasional separations from the rest of his family , as Michael and his mom travel the opera circuit . `` I do n't have too much contact with kids my age , '' Michael says . `` I 'm always working with adults ... I miss that a little . But I think it 's worth it . ''

Michael works hard in rehearsals , enjoys the performances and loves the applause .

`` He is lucky that he found something that he is so good at at so young an age , '' says his mom .

By almost any measure , Michael 's rise in the world of opera has been meteoric . As soon as his role in `` The Turn of the Screw '' ends in Los Angeles , he 's off to New York and a New York City Opera production of `` SÃ©ance on a Wet Afternoon . ''

But how long can it last ? It wo n't be long before the boy soprano 's voice changes . What then ?

It will be a challenge , but , `` It may be better , '' Michael says . `` In opera you can sing even if you are old . ''

And Michael is already thinking about a whole new world of roles he could sing as an adult .
