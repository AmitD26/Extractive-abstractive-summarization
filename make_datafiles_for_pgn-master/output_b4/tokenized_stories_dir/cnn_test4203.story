New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Broadway actor injured when he fell more than 20 feet while performing a stunt in the `` Spider-Man '' musical is set to be released from a rehabilitation center this week , his father told CNN Sunday .

Christopher Tierney , 31 , was moved into the center after being discharged from New York 's Bellevue Hospital on December 28 .

His father , Tim Tierney , said he is n't sure when his son will arrive at his Portsmouth , New Hampshire , home , but said he is scheduled to be released from the facility Wednesday .

Christopher Tierney suffered four broken ribs ; a hairline skull fracture ; a broken scapula , or shoulder blade ; a bruised lung ; three cracked vertebrae ; and broken bones below his elbow in the December 20 fall , the elder Tierney has said .

Tim Tierney said his son is improving .

`` He is up , '' he said . `` He is walking and just doing very well . '' He said Christopher Tierney can not wait to return to the show , `` Spider-Man : Turn Off The Dark . ''

Several of the shows were canceled following Tierney 's fall , and new safety precautions were put in place before they resumed following a meeting between the show 's company , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor .

The show , with music and lyrics by U2 's Bono and Howell -LRB- aka The Edge -RRB- , is the most expensive in Broadway history , but production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems .

Once Christopher Tierney is home , his family plans a belated Christmas celebration , Tim Tierney said .

Jonathan Dealwis , a tourist from New Zealand , said he saw Tierney fall .

`` Spider-Man was on a bridge , and Mary Jane was dangling from it , '' he said . `` I think he was meant to sort of swoop over there , but he just fell off ... the harness , you could see it just flick off his back and fly backward . ''
