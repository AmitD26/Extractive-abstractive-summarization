-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was just before Christmas when Michel Martelly mulled over events in his troubled land and concluded that everything had been done to ensure loss for him at the polls .

An election rife with fraud had ousted him from the race . Martelly 's dreams of leading Haiti were all but dead . But four months of recounts and reviews and then a runoff changed everything , and the unexpected candidate is poised now to move into the presidential office .

Unexpected because Martelly has never been a politician .

He 's better known as `` Sweet Mickey , '' a popular kompa singer who enthralled his fans with bad-boy antics on stage . He cursed and swayed with a bottle of Barbancourt rum in his hands and on occasion , mooned his audience .

It 's an image that Martelly said he cultivated solely for the stage . Still , it led many to question whether he was fit to run a nation , especially one as beleaguered as Haiti .

Already the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere , Haiti is reeling from devastation caused by last year 's massive earthquake followed by a cholera epidemic later in the year .

A perceived lack of progress prompted Haitians to vote against Jude Celestin , the government-backed candidate . Martelly , they said , was a fresh face in politics , untainted by the corruption that has marred many a presidency in Haiti .

`` To Haitians , particularly the legions of young and jobless , Martelly is an outsider who can bring change to Haiti , '' longtime Haiti observer Jocelyn McCalla said on Twitter .

Martelly 's victory falls in line with the signal the Haitian people have been sending for a while , said Garry Pierre-Pierre , editor and publisher of the New York-based newspaper The Haitian Times . `` They do n't want the establishment . They do n't want the status quo , '' he said .

On the streets of Port-au-Prince , thousands turned out to chant one of his most popular nicknames : `` Tet Kale , '' which means bald head in Creole . Haitians , especially the youth , were starving for a fresh face . And they got it Monday when the election council announced preliminary results .

Martelly won by a landslide with 67.6 % of the vote , soundly defeating his challenger , former first lady Mirlande Manigat , who received 31.5 % .

Pierre-Pierre called Martelly 's campaign impressive . He came out of nowhere and stunned established politicians with his strong showing in November .

`` This was a man who could move millions with a microphone , '' Pierre-Pierre said .

But at first , the election council said Martelly had placed third , behind Manigat and Celestin , meaning he was not eligible for a runoff .

His supporters took to the streets , angry at what they said was a rigged election .

Then came a review of the vote , monitored by the Organization of American States .

The review resulted in Celestin 's removal from the ballot and placed Martelly in the runoff . It was exactly what the candidate had hoped for back in December when he laid out for CNN his plan to lift Haiti out of its misery .

Martelly appeared in jeans and a button-down shirt at his plush home in Peguyville , a suburb of Port-au-Prince up in the hills . A silver arm cuff hugged his right wrist and he sipped hard on his favorite ice-cream soda . He sat at a table surrounded by a piano and eight wall-mounted speakers . It was not hard to tell this was a party house .

Haiti , he said then , was on the brink of revolution .

`` This is a very dangerous corner in Haiti 's history , '' he said . `` But it 's a revolution that can be done peacefully through the election . ''

Under the father-and-son Duvalier dictatorship , Haitians lacked freedom , but the people had clean roads , electricity , jobs , security , Martelly said . When democracy came overnight to this Caribbean nation , people did n't know how to handle it .

Martelly spoke of 24 years of troubled times , of a poor country that , he said , hurtled backward into even more poverty .

`` We are ruled by corruption , '' he said . `` The people have no confidence in their government . ''

The lack of confidence was further eroded by a presidential election in disarray .

`` You know how -LRB- U.S. President Barack -RRB- Obama said it 's not about the man , but it 's about the plan ? '' he said . `` Here it 's more about the man than about the plan . ''

Haiti will go nowhere , he said , unless the people have a president they can trust , a president who is honest . He was that man , he insisted .

He said his background in music as well as social work -- he founded an aid agency that helps the poor -- gave him 22 years on the ground . The people know him , he said . He was their light at the end of the tunnel .

But the man also had plans .

He said , for instance , that the $ 12 billion that was pledged by the international community for earthquake assistance should come in the form of infrastructure , not money , because Haitians do n't know how to manage money .

`` People are fed up here , '' he said . `` They have no food , no education , no health care . What kind of place is it when a young girl will sell her body to buy a phone card ? ''

Martelly exuded confidence that he could bring change to Haiti . But not everyone is so sure .

`` He 's stepping into not only a complicated moment in Haitian history but he is also stepping into the wasp 's nest of Haitian politics , '' said Amy Wilentz , author of `` The Rainy Season : Haiti Then and Now . ''

Wilentz said Martelly is a big unknown -- a pro for voters perhaps but a con for those trying to measure up the next few years of Haitian history .

`` I do n't see any reason to believe or not to believe he will be good at it , '' Wilentz said . `` I think Haiti needs a fresh start . It needs to step out of the muck . ''

Maybe , she said , Martelly is the man to do just that .

Pierre-Pierre compared Martelly 's win to another victory more than two decades ago that catapulted a Catholic priest into the presidency . Jean-Bertrand Aristide was popular in his own right as a man of the church but he also rose to power because he was not from the establishment .

`` Martelly spoke in a way Aristide spoke to the people , '' Pierre-Pierre said . `` He spoke to them , not at them . ''

But look what happened to Aristide , Pierre-Pierre said , referring to the fall of Haiti 's first democratically elected president , who coincidentally returned from exile just days before last month 's election .

Pierre-Pierre drew another comparison as well . Like Aristide , Martelly has no experience in politics .

`` He is a musician and a good one at that , '' he said .

That makes Pierre-Pierre a fan of Sweet Mickey but not necessarily a supporter of Martelly 's . Ultimately , Pierre-Pierre said , what does an entertainer know about Haiti 's role in the world .

Some Haiti observers went further than that .

Irwin Stotzky , a University of Miami lawyer who has studied human rights in Haiti , said Martelly hardly had the credentials to run the country and did not see much hope for the immediate future . He said his majority vote was skewed because Aristide 's party , Fanmi Lavalas , was barred from participation .

`` It 's sort of a bad joke , '' Stotzky said .

But criticism does n't deter Martelly . When asked in December whether a man who made a name dancing and singing had the mettle for his nation 's top job , he smiled .

`` Well , '' he said . `` Look at what the politicians have done . ''
