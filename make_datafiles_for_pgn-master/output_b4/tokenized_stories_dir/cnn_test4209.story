-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and three other former heads of state arrived in North Korea Tuesday , as part of the latest diplomatic effort to restart talks between the North and South , state media reported .

Carter is traveling with former presidents Martti Ahtisaari of Finland and Mary Robinson of Ireland , and former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Brundtland .

The group is collectively known as `` The Elders '' -- an independent group of global leaders founded by former South African President Nelson Mandela .

`` At a time when official dialogue with the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea appears to be at a standstill , we aim to see how we may be of assistance in reducing tensions and help the parties address key issues including denuclearization , '' Carter said Monday from Beijing , where he met with Chinese officials .

The Elders expect to meet with ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong Il , along with other senior officials and diplomats . They are going to Pyongyang at the invitation of the North Korean government , Carter said

`` Clearly there is a great level of mistrust and suspicion between North and South Korea , '' Ahtisaari said . `` But the stakes are too high to allow this stand-off to continue . ''

The Elders are scheduled to spend three days in Pyongyang , before flying to Seoul Thursday where they will meet with South Korean officials .

Tensions between North Korea and the West have spiked in recent years due in part to concerns over Pyongyang 's nuclear development program .

The United States and South Korea held joint military drills in February , despite North Korea 's warning to the South not to carry out the drills , calling them a provocation .

South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010 , killing 46 sailors . In November , North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island , killing two South Korean marines and two civilians .

Carter has a long history of dealing with North Korea . His 1994 talks with the late Kim Il Sung , Kim Jong Il 's father , paved the way for the `` Agreed Framework '' the same year -- an agreement designed to rein in Pyongyang 's nuclear ambitions .

North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years , increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington .

In August , Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes , a U.S. citizen who had been fined roughly $ 600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea .

Gomes , who attempted to commit suicide while in North Korean custody , was believed to be a Christian activist .

Earlier this month , North Korea reported through state-run news agency KCNA that it had arrested U.S. citizen Jun Young Su last year for `` committing a crime '' against the reclusive nation .

KCNA did not provide details on the nature of the alleged crime .

Two State Department officials , speaking on condition of not being identified , previously told CNN that the man is a Korean-American businessman . One of the sources said the businessman had a visa to enter North Korea .

It was not known how Carter 's visit might affect his detention .

Two American journalists -- Laura Ling and Euna Lee , who had entered North Korea in March 2009 and were arrested and sentenced to 12 years hard labor -- were released in August 2009 after an intervention by former U.S. President Bill Clinton .
