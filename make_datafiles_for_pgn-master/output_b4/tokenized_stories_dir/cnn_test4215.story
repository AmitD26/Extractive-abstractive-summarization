BEIRUT , Lebanon -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lebanon says it has approved the first ambassador to Beirut from Syria , the country which occupied Lebanon for decades .

The families of Lebanese prisoners held in Syria protest outside the United Nations offices in Beirut last year .

Lebanese President Michel Sleiman Tuesday formally accepted Ali Abed al-Karim Ali as the new Syrian ambassador to Lebanon , his office said . He did not present his credentials in person , and it is not clear when he will take office , Sleiman 's office said .

Syria and Lebanon established diplomatic ties in October 2008 .

Lebanon opened its first embassy in Damascus on March 16 , when Charge d'Affaires Rami Mortada raised the Lebanese flag over the building in the Damascus neighborhood of Abu Remmaneh , which is also home to the U.S. Embassy , Lebanon 's official news agency said .

Michel El Khoury was named as Lebanon 's ambassador to Syria earlier this year but has not filled his post yet , the president 's office said .

Syria maintained tens of thousands of troops in Lebanon from the 1970s until they were forced out by massive popular protests in 2005 . The protests were a response to the killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a huge car bombing in February of that year .

Many Lebanese , as well as the United States , accused Syria of orchestrating the assassination of Hariri , an outspoken opponent of Syria . Damascus denies responsibility . The United Nations opened a tribunal in December 2005 to look into the killing .

The United States is also exploring improved relations with Syria . Washington sent a high-level envoy to Damascus at the beginning of March , four years after it withdrew its ambassador over the killing of Hariri .

The envoy , Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman , said the United States and Syria found a lot of `` common ground '' on which to cooperate in the Middle East , but warned to `` keep expectations in check '' as Washington and Damascus re-engage after several years of strained relations .
