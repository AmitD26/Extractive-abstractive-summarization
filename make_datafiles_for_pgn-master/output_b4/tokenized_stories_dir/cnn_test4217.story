`` The vision was to have a variety of great airplanes , a variety of great pilots , '' Leeward said in a documentary about his ranch .

`` And a place where everybody could really have a lot of fun . I wanted that as part of my vision to be something that was just like my father had in the 1930s . ''

`` I think he was trying to do whatever he could right up to the end , '' said Fred Scholz , a witness . `` I could hear the engine ... I thought he was coming in on top of us . Instead , he missed us by about 100 feet and went out into the box area in front of us . ''
