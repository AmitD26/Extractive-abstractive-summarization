-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Magnificent snow-peaked summits and quaint thousand-year-old villages provide the backdrop for an unforgettable adventure in Nepal . Exploring the dramatic landscape on foot is nothing short of extraordinary , trekkers say .

'' -LSB- One night -RSB- the back doors were open towards the view of Mount Everest and the other peaks of the Himalayas . It was so beautiful with snow-capped mountains and the sky was full of stars . I think that was one of the most magical moments I 've ever had , '' says iReporter Kuna Rajandran , who trekked to Everest base camp in April .

Planning a Nepal expedition may seem daunting at first -- and you will be challenged -- but in the end , itÂ ¹ s worth it . You will come away with some of the greatest memories of your life , from savoring locally cooked meals at teahouses to soaking in breathtaking views of the high Himalayas , according to adventurers who 've made the trip .

There are endless options when it comes to planning a trek in Nepal . One of the most popular routes is the Annapurna Circuit , which loops around the base of the Annapurna range . And , of course , the more difficult Everest base camp trek is a magnet for many visitors .

Worlds away in Kathmandu

Experts urge travelers to be wary of individual porters and guides who approach you on the streets of Kathmandu . They are most likely uninsured , cautions Mohan Lamsal , general secretary of Trekking Agencies ' Association of Nepal -LRB- TAAN -RRB- . Have a detailed discussion with your chosen trekking company to assess their professionalism , Lamsal advises .

While booking in advance is a sure thing , some adventurous iReporters say making arrangements in Kathmandu is a convenient way to cut out the middleman .

Be careful not to overestimate your abilities . Even if you feel completely comfortable with the people and the landscape and think you can make the trek on your own -- do n't . Trekking with at least one companion is a must , especially if you 're a beginner , experienced trekkers say .

Since both the Annapurna base camp and Everest Base camp treks are located in conservation areas , you will need permits , said iReporter Barry Wenlock , a Kathmandu resident and an experienced Himalayan trekker who has been leading tours since 1995 . You can get permits before you begin or upon entry into the parks . Additionally , every trekker needs a Trekkers ' Information Management System -LRB- TIMS -RRB- pass . You or your trip organizer can get this card , which is part of a database that stores visitor information for safety reasons .

When deciding on when to make your trek , there is generally one rule of thumb : Avoid the monsoon season -LRB- June through August -RRB- . The most popular times to trek are late spring -LRB- March and April -RRB- and early to mid-fall -LRB- October and November -RRB- , but keep in mind that is also when the trekking routes are busiest . To beat the rush , try going a week or two earlier or later , suggests Wenlock .

`` There are such beautiful forests -LSB- at the foothills of the Annapurna -RSB- , and it 's Nepal 's primary rhododendron forest , so if you visit there in the last week of March , first week of April , the rhododendrons are full and it 's an absolutely staggeringly beautiful place . And the pink and red rhododendrons all up the hillside , a few magnolias mixed in , some jasmine , '' Wenlock says .

Before heading to Nepal , it 's important not only to prepare your itinerary , but also your body . Even the mild or `` Nepali Flat '' parts of the `` easier '' Annapurna trek have their fair share of steep inclines .

`` Walking around the golf course is n't enough -- you really need to do uphill walking . You can do that for a few weeks before you come , that will make it much easier , '' Wenlock says .

It 's cold in Nepal -- really cold . Weather-appropriate supplies are a must for any trekker , novice or expert . Remember to pack your warmest down jacket and broken-in hiking boots as well as sun and eye protection .

Based on his experience trekking the Annapurna Circuit in 2009 , iReporter Dean Gakos , an avid hiker , recommends watching out for knock-off gear , like fake North Face jackets , which he saw in Kathmandu . You do n't want to climb up into the mountains only to realize your jacket contains synthetic down .

If you 're planning on trekking up to higher altitudes , be cautious of altitude sickness . Warning signs include vomiting and weakness of the body , says Rajandran .

iReporter Udayan Mishra , a Kathmandu resident who has been on several expeditions in Nepal , suggests taking the trek gradually to acclimatize yourself -- overexertion in the beginning may lead to problems later on .

Make sure you have enough Nepalese currency before you get on the path . Gakos recalls that there was `` one ATM on the whole trek . '' And even if there is an ATM , there 's no guarantee that it has been recently stocked with money .

There are two typical types of treks : the more popular teahouse trekking and a fully organized camping trip . A teahouse trek gives you the comfort of knowing that lodging and food will be provided . You can carry additional supplies -- clothing , snacks , sleeping bag -- on your own or hire a porter to carry it for you .

Once you finish walking , five to six hours on average per day , you settle down in a village . If you do n't have a guide to recommend a teahouse , talk to other travelers and consult guidebooks for suggestions . In teahouses that provide lodging and food , guests are expected to eat at least two meals : dinner at night and breakfast the next morning , Gakos says .

Do n't expect a hotel experience -- expect better . Nepali locals are known for being extremely kind and hospitable . Wenlock says you 'll be treated like family during your stay . Gakos was looking for that kind of personal exchange .

' `` That 's why -RSB- we picked Annapurna , it was the perfect balance of wilderness and viewing the high Himalayas while also getting the Nepali culture , '' Gakos says .

Past visitors consistently praise trekking in Nepal as one of the best experiences of their lives . CNN iReporter Ruth Stewart , who trekked to the Everest Base Camp in winter 2010 , says Nepal was the most beautiful part of the world she 's ever been to .

Take advantage of the majestic mountains and the pristine landscape . Unlike many other mountain ranges , the Himalayan area in Nepal is practically untouched .

`` There 's no rubbish , there 's no gondolas going up to the highest view , there 's no cars , there 's no traffic -- it 's just complete serenity and it 's just the most incredible experience , '' Stewart said .
