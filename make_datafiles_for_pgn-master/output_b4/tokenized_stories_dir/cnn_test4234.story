-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- The box office had to contend with the World Series , a very early snowstorm in the Northeast , and Halloween festivities across the country this weekend , but audiences still managed to make it to the movies !

That being said , grosses for new releases `` Puss in Boots , '' `` In Time , '' and `` The Rum Diary , '' were n't all that strong . Check out how they performed below :

Dreamworks Animation 's `` Puss in Boots '' was the top cat this weekend , clawing its way to a $ 34 million debut , 51 percent of which came from 3-D screens , and 7 percent of which was from IMAX theaters . On paper , that number sounds good -- and , to be clear , it is by no means a disaster -- but the result comes with a `` Real Steel '' - ish caveat . `` Puss in Boots '' cost $ 130 million to produce , and it earned Dreamworks ' third-worst debut for a computer animated film , beating only `` Flushed Away '' and `` Antz , '' which started with $ 18.8 million and $ 17.2 million , respectively . The 3-D `` Shrek '' - spinoff , cost as much as Dreamworks ' `` Megamind , '' which opened in early November 2010 , but that film began with $ 46 million , and it played well through the Thanksgiving season on its way to a $ 148.4 million total .

`` Puss in Boots '' entered theaters a week earlier , but it will need to endure even better than `` Megamind '' to earn back its budget . The `` A - '' CinemaScore grade it earned from audiences should at least make that achievement possible , but considering people are already familiar with the `` Puss in Boots '' character , it 's doubtful that the film will attract many uninitiated viewers . We wo n't officially know where `` Puss in Boots '' is headed until next weekend , when we see how much the snowstorm , the World Series , and Halloween really affected the box office this frame . -LRB- My guess is not much -- and I 'm not just being catty . -RRB-

Second place belonged to `` Paranormal Activity 3 , '' which fell by 65 percent to $ 18.5 million in its second weekend . The found footage horror sequel has scared up $ 81.3 million after ten days in theaters , and considering the huge business the film will likely do on Halloween , `` PA3 '' is only a day away from passing Paranormal Activity 2 's $ 84.8 million cume . Not too shabby for a film that cost Paramount only $ 5 million to make !

Fox 's $ 40 million Justin Timberlake/Amanda Seyfried thriller `` In Time '' underwhelmed with just $ 12 million in its opening weekend . That debut is less than Timberlake 's last film , `` Friends with Benefits , '' which began with $ 18.6 million on its way to $ 55.8 million , as well as Seyfried 's recent `` Red Riding Hood , '' which debuted with $ 14 million on its way to $ 37.6 million .

Ads for `` In Time '' failed to effectively communicate the convoluted time-shifting story , and negative reviews likely kept older moviegoers away . Timberlake 's leading man status may not have helped matters too much , either -- audiences seem to find him more appealing as part of an ensemble , like in `` The Social Network '' and `` Bad Teacher . '' Moviegoers issued `` In Time '' an unenthusiastic `` B - '' CinemaScore grade , which may prevent the film from finding the same kind of legs that time-jumping thriller `` Source Code '' -LRB- $ 14.8 million opening , $ 54.7 million total -RRB- enjoyed earlier this year .

In its third weekend , dancing remake `` Footloose '' fell to fourth place , dropping 48 percent to $ 5.4 million . The $ 24 million production has now earned $ 38.5 million after 17 days in theaters , and it will pass the total of Julianne Hough 's first feature film , `` Burlesque '' -LRB- $ 39.4 million -RRB- , sometime this week .

Johnny Depp 's latest , `` The Rum Diary , '' stumbled out of the gate with just $ 5 million . `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' this was not . The disappointing opening fell in line with Depp 's other substance abuse picture , 1998â € ² s `` Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , '' which debuted to $ 3.3 million and earned $ 10.7 million total . `` The Rum Diary 's '' edgy story was always going to be a tough sell , and FilmDistrict 's President of Theatrical Distribution Bob Berney admits : `` While we all wish the numbers were better , we 're proud of the film and its loving tribute to Hunter S. Thompson . ''

The $ 50 million picture marks the third straight box office disappointment for FilmDistrict , the young distributor that found success with Insidious -LRB- $ 54 million -RRB- earlier this year . The studio has since struggled with both `` Do n't Be Afraid of the Dark '' -LRB- $ 23.9 million -RRB- and `` Drive '' -LRB- $ 33.7 million so far -RRB- recently . Unfortunately for FilmDistrict , audiences , which were 88 percent above the age of 25 , gave `` The Rum Diary '' a harsh `` C '' CinemaScore grade , so it 's not likely to hold well in future weeks . Talk about a bad hangover ...

In limited release , Sony 's Shakespeare tale `` Anonymous '' started with $ 1 million out of 256 theaters . That was good enough for a $ 3,774 per theater average , which does not merit huge expansions in the coming weeks . Young romance `` Like Crazy '' fared better , grossing $ 120,000 out of only 4 theaters , resulting in a $ 30,000 average . Richard Gere 's latest , `` The Double , '' was D.O.A. , pulling in only $ 27,545 out of 11 theaters . It 's not likely to platform much further . Zeitgeist-y Wall Street thriller `` Margin Call '' continued to play fairly well , grossing $ 713,000 out of 140 theaters . It has earned $ 1.5 million so far .

Internationally , `` The Adventures of Tintin '' got off to an excellent start . Sony 's motion capture animation grossed $ 55.8 million out of 19 territories , including $ 21.5 million in France and $ 10.7 million in the United Kingdom , where its being distributed by Paramount . Sony is bragging loudly about the film 's performance , perhaps in response to some prognosticators claiming that `` Tintin '' is likely to underperform domestically . -LRB- The picture is based on a series of comic books by HergÃ © which were very popular in Europe , but only cult hits in the U.S. -RRB- We 'll find out how excited audiences are about `` Tintin '' on December 21 .
