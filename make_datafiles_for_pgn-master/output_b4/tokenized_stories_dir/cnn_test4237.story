Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The federal government recovered almost $ 4.1 billion stolen in health care fraud schemes during fiscal year 2011 , Obama administration officials announced Tuesday . The figure is up 58 percent from 2009 .

`` This is an unprecedented achievement -- and it represents the highest amount ever recovered in a single year , '' said Attorney General Eric Holder . The Justice Department reported more than 1,400 people were charged with fraud in 500 cases . There have been more than 700 convictions .

`` We 're regaining the upper hand in our fight against health care fraud , '' said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius .

The numbers are contained in the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program Annual Report , which is sent to Congress .

Holder and Sebelius credited their Medicare Fraud Strike Force teams for tracking down crime in areas with `` hot spots '' of unexplained Medicare billing . The strike forces include prosecutors and investigators from the FBI , the Justice Department and the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General .

In fiscal year 2011 , new teams were created in Dallas and Chicago . They joined seven existing groups in Miami ; Los Angeles ; Detroit ; Houston ; Baton Rouge , Louisiana ; Tampa , Florida ; and the Brooklyn borough of New York .

Holder said recently strike forces have handled two large , multiple-city fraud takedowns . In one case , 115 people were arrested in nine cities for alleged false billing schemes amounting to more than $ 240 million . A second case involved $ 290 million in allegedly fraudulent bills in which 91 defendants were charged in eight cities .

Health care fraud has attracted both organized crime organizations and street gangs , according to Kevin Perkins , the FBI 's assistant director for the Criminal Investigative Division .

Perkins said that through computer analysis the FBI can look at many thousands of Explanation of Benefit forms and detect hot spots showing excessive Medicare billing , which law enforcement can then pursue .

`` We 're making an impact , '' Perkins said .

Officials say fraudulent schemes include illegal marketing of medical devices and pharmaceuticals for purposes not approved by the Food and Drug Administration , Medicare fraud by hospitals and other institutional providers , illegal pricing by makers of drugs , and violations of laws against self-referrals and kickbacks .

Sebelius said aggressively pursuing health care fraud is a great investment .

`` Over the last three years , for every dollar we 've spent , we 've put more than seven dollars back in the hands of American taxpayers , '' she said . The money goes into the Medicare Trust Fund , the U.S. Treasury and state treasuries .

Officials said the Affordable Care Act helps in the fight against fraud in various ways , including providing $ 350 million in resources , increasing data sharing , and expanding efforts to get money back after overpayments .
