Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Senate voted Thursday to kill a controversial proposal pushed by Republicans that would have allowed employers to opt out of providing health care coverage they disagree with on moral grounds .

By a 51-48 mostly party line vote , the motion by Democrats to table the amendment succeeded , effectively killing it . Three Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the tabling motion , while one Republican -- retiring moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine -- voted with Democrats in favor .

The so-called `` conscience '' amendment , sponsored by Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri , was the Senate Republicans ' response to the simmering controversy over a recent Obama administration decision to mandate the kind of health care coverage provided by religious employers .

`` This bill would just simply say that those health care providers do n't have to follow that mandate if it violates their faith principles , '' stated an early February press release from Blunt . `` This is about the First Amendment . It 's about religious beliefs . It 's not about any one issue . ''

The specific potential impact of the amendment was a matter of debate . On his website , Blunt rejected complaints that it would have allowed anyone to deny coverage of anything for any reason .

However , Senate Democrats insisted it would provide too much latitude for employers to impose their personal beliefs on the healthcare issues of their workers .

`` It would simply give every boss in America the right to make health care decisions for their workers and their families , '' argued Sen. Patty Murray , D-Washington .

She and other Democrats said that under the amendment , employers could have cited moral objections to cutting off coverage of immunizations , prenatal care for children of unmarried parents and other standard procedures .

The American Civil Liberties Union applauded the Senate vote .

`` The Blunt Amendment and its supporters are out of touch with reality , '' said Sarah Lipton-Lubet , the ACLU policy counsel . `` Overwhelmingly , women from every religious background use contraception to protect their health and plan their families and lives . The Senate did the right thing by American women today . ''

While Blunt 's amendment took a broad approach , the main issue involved whether religious employers should have to include coverage for contraception in health plans offered to employees at affiliated institutions , such as hospitals .

Earlier this month , Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius issued a directive that would have required all employers , including religious organizations , to include such coverage in health insurance offered to their employees . While churches were exempt , the mandate covered religious affiliated institutions .

Representatives from many faiths opposed the decision , calling it a violation of their religious conscience .

In response to the uproar , the White House backed off the directive and instead said that religious employers could opt out of offering coverage for birth control , but insurance companies would have to offer such coverage separately and at no charge .

Some critics say the White House 's changed position does not go far enough .

Blunt 's amendment stated the president 's health care law , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , imposes requirements that infringe on the rights and conscience of insurers and plan sponsors . While the law exempts some religious groups , it does not allow all those with religious or moral objections to decline providing coverage , the amendment says .

Part of the uproar surrounded universities and hospitals affiliated with religions , which were not given the same exemptions as churches and other religious institutions .

The Blunt amendment would have established that an entity refusing coverage on religious or moral grounds is not in violation of the law . It did not mention contraception specifically and included health insurance companies .

To get a vote on the Blunt amendment , it was tacked onto a $ 109 billion transportation bill , raising complaints from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , that the proposal was not germane to the legislation .

Because of the dispute , action stalled on the transportation bill , which is backed by both parties .

Reid said Tuesday that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , insisted on a floor vote on the Blunt amendment `` before we can move ahead with this jobs bill . ''

`` Once we have put this extreme and distracting proposal behind us , I hope my Republican colleagues will stop living in the past and join us this year , 2012 , and help us create jobs , '' Reid said .

Blunt welcomed the vote by tweeting , `` Glad Sen. Reid is going to allow a vote on my bipartisan admt to protect religious freedom this Thursday . #HHSMandate . ''

Voting on the amendment forced senators to take a stand on the controversial contraception decision . Though many Republicans have come out in support of the measure , Snowe told MSNBC the amendment is `` much broader than I could support . ''

Not all Democrats were united against the amendment , however . Sen. Joe Manchin , D-West Virginia , issued a statement Wednesday saying he would support it .

`` I am voting in favor of this measure to protect the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America , '' Manchin said in a statement .

A CNN/ORC International poll earlier this month showed a partisan divide on the issue , with 70 % of Democrats agreeing with the Obama administration policy while 85 % of Republicans opposed it . Independents were statistically split .
