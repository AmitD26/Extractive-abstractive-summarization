-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal officials say a plane crash that killed 265 people was caused in part by a rudder system design featured in various Airbus models .

American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in a residential area of Belle Harbor , New York , soon after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport on November 12 , 2001 .

All 260 people onboard died , along with five people on the ground .

According to a recommendation issued this week by the National Transportation Safety Board , the plane 's vertical stabilizer likely separated because of `` the first officer 's unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs . ''

But those inputs were likely caused in part by `` characteristics of the Airbus A300-600 rudder system design . ''

Two families of Airbus planes use a system design that limits available rudder pedal deflection as airspeed decreases , according to the safety board .

`` Consequently , at high airspeeds require lighter pedal forces ... to obtain maximum available rudder than at low speeds , '' the safety board wrote .

The safety board notes the circumstances of flight 587 are similar to a 2008 accident involving an Airbus Industrie A319 . Air Canada Flight 190 experienced `` in-flight upset '' and landed in Calgary . Three passengers suffered serious injuries .

The popular Airbus A320 family could also be affected . The European-based company 's website says it sold more than 3,200 A320 planes worldwide .

`` The Airbus 320 family is also susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeeds , '' the safety board wrote .

Safety board officials recommended the European Aviation Safety Agency review options for modifying some Airbus planes `` to provide increased protection from potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs . ''

No one from Airbus was immediately available for comment early Saturday .
