-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman who was convicted at a trial for wearing pants -- clothing deemed indecent by Sudanese authorities -- was released from jail Tuesday after being imprisoned for a day , a United Nations spokesman said .

Sudanese journalist Lubna Ahmed al-Hussein was facing 40 lashes for wearing trousers .

Lubna al-Hussein , a journalist who worked in the media department of the United Nations mission in Sudan , was jailed Monday for refusing to pay a court-ordered fine , her lawyer , Nabil Adib , said .

No further details of her release were immediately available .

Al-Hussein had faced 40 lashes for wearing pants deemed too tight and a blouse considered too sheer .

However , the court she appeared before on Monday spared her the lashes , and instead ordered her to pay a fine of 500 Sudanese pounds -LRB- $ 209 -RRB- or face a month in prison , her attorney said .

Adib told CNN after the trial that al-Hussein refused to pay the fine as a `` matter of principle . ''

She will appeal her verdict in an effort to have the conservative Muslim government 's decency law declared unconstitutional , her attorney said by phone Monday from Khartoum , Sudan .

Al-Hussein , who was arrested in July , pleaded not guilty during her one-day trial , Adib said . She was not allowed to call defense witnesses or present a defense case , he added .

`` She thinks that she did not have fair trial and a conviction was wrong so she did not want to pay the fine nor let anyone else pay on her behalf , '' Adib said .

Al-Hussein resigned from her U.N. position to waive her immunity as an international worker and face trial .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he is concerned about al-Hussein 's case .

`` The United Nations will make every effort to ensure that the rights of its staff members are protected , '' Ban said in July . `` The flogging is against the international human rights standards . ''

In August , scores of protesters supporting al-Hussein gathered outside the courtroom in Khartoum , waving banners and wearing headbands with the messages , `` No return to the dark ages '' and `` No to suppressing women . ''

On Monday , Sudanese security forces fought back scores of al-Hussein supporters , injuring some and detaining 47 women , according to an eyewitness who spoke to CNN by phone .

A Sudanese official accused `` the West '' of interfering in the case .

Al-Hussein was arrested along with 18 other women on July 3 at a Khartoum restaurant when police burst in and checked women for their clothing . At the time of her arrest she was wearing pants , a blouse and a hijab -- a headscarf worn by Muslim women , she said .
