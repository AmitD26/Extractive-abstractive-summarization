London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Alessio Rastani went on a UK news channel on Monday to discuss where stock markets were heading . By Tuesday he was an Internet sensation .

Was it that he said , as someone who bets against markets rising , that he `` goes to bed every night dreaming of a recession ? '' Was it that he said investment bank Goldman Sachs ruled the world and not governments ? Or was it that bloggers started to ask if he was just a `` fake trader '' who duped the media ?

Take your pick . But Rastani caused a stir by saying what many people think those in the markets think anyway -- it 's OK to make money out of falling markets and there is no reason not to prepare for that .

He certainly thinks the markets will crash again and people should be prepared for that , and that the average person should take steps now to protect their assets , or be prepared to lose their investments .

There is nothing wrong with giving that kind of advice , if that is what you think will happen . It 's just unlikely you would hear that from an established player from a bank that is looking for clients .

Still , it was worth hearing more from Rastani and to find out if he really believes what he said , if he understood the stir around him and whether he is in fact a trader .

CNN brought him in , and I asked him all that .

Firstly , Rastani is an amateur trader using his own money -LRB- as a `` hobby '' , he has told other media -RRB- and he 's not registered with the Financial Services Authority to trade other people 's money . He does n't claim otherwise , but there was a feeling after his first interview that he was some sort of suit from the City or Wall Street giving sage advice to his clients .

He does or can have other clients though . His website calls him a speaker and trainer of others who want to trade .

In my interview , Rastani said he does trade being prepared for a recession , but that as a `` human being you do n't want it . As a trader you think differently . You 're going to have volatile ... conditions to make money in that market . ''

He also said he was a religious man . He was also clearly nervous about the whole affair and was undecided for an hour to whether he should actually sit on our set for the interview . He said no a few times , before we sat down .

`` The question is , why are they paying attention to this ? '' he asked . `` In my opinion somebody out there does n't want my voice to be heard and they want to attack me and damage me . ''

He talked of the ` Big Boys ' being desperate to keep people like him from talking about the coming economic storm .

He admits there may be a book in the works , but one that focuses on traders whom he admires .

When I asked him if he was for real , he said he would not say things about the markets he did not truly believe . When I asked him if he is a member of the so-called `` Yes-Men '' who have faked TV interviews in the past , he would not say yes or no . `` Let people believe what they want to , '' he said .

To my mind , he should have been touted up front as a guy who has strong opinions on the markets , but certainly not as a ` trader ' or `` investment adviser '' in the classic sense . That does not make his view any more or less valid but , with that preamble , I do n't think it would have gone viral .
