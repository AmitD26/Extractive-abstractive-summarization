-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ethiopian forces attacked military posts in neighboring Eritrea to target `` subversive groups '' it said operate within the country , reigniting tensions between the two archrivals .

The ground assault Thursday struck bases used to launch attacks aimed at destabilizing Ethiopia , said Shimeles Kemal , an Ethiopian government spokesman .

Such attacks are `` organized , supported and financed by the Eritrean government , '' Kemal said at a news conference .

The Eritrean foreign ministry described the incident as a `` provocative attack '' and said it was intended to divert attention from Ethiopia 's continued `` illegal occupation '' of Eritrean territory .

The raid `` is part and parcel of the numerous unlawful and provocative attacks that have been going on intermittently in the past 10 years , '' the statement said .

The assault 16 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- into Eritrean territory reignites tensions between the two nations , which fought a two-year war from 1998 that left 80,000 dead .

They have all but severed diplomatic relations since then .

The military incursion was partly in retaliation to Eritrea backing groups responsible for atrocities in Ethiopia , the spokesman said , including a January attack that killed five Western tourists .

Two other Germans were kidnapped in the northern region attack blamed on the Ethiopian rebel group , the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unit Front or ARDUF , which the government accuses Eritrea of backing .

Kemal said Ethiopia prefers to settle disputes with its neighbor through peaceful dialogue but stressed the nation will not ` hesitate to take proportional retaliatory action '' if Eritrea launches more attacks .

Eritrea won its independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year war . Before the war , it was classified as a province .
