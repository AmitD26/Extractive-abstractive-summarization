Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistani lawmakers on Monday passed a resolution supporting the country 's democratic system , a vote that came after weeks of public speculation and political intrigue about the possibility of a coup in the volatile nation .

The vote came the same day Pakistan 's Supreme Court ordered Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to face a contempt of court hearing this week , a notice related to the government 's failure to reopen thousands of corruption cases against politicians and bureaucrats , including President Asif Ali Zardari .

The resolution that was voted on Monday by the National Assembly , the lower house of Parliament , was put forward Friday by the Awami National Party . That party is part of the governing coalition led by Gilani 's Pakistan Peoples Party -LRB- PPP -RRB- .

`` The army and the judiciary , they both have to protect democracy in Pakistan , '' Gilani said in a speech Monday night , after the vote . `` They ca n't remove democracy . They ca n't pack up the system . ''

The resolution calls for support for the democratic system in general -- something a majority of lawmakers are unlikely to vote against -- without naming any political parties or individuals , suggesting that it was designed to bolster the government while avoiding the risk of hurting the prime minister or the PPP .

`` This house endorses and supports the efforts made by the political leadership for strengthening democracy and reposes full confidence and trust in them , '' part of the resolution reads .

Two days earlier , the embattled Pakistani president , Zardari , met with Army Chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani -- a sign , some say , that shows tensions between Pakistan 's civilian and military leadership are cooling down .

Zardari and Kayani met to discuss the `` current security situation , '' presidential spokesman Farhatullah Babar said .

A second meeting between civilian and military leadership took place afterward , as Gilani convened the Cabinet 's defense committee .

The meetings came a day after Pakistani and British official denied a report that Gilani had contacted the British High Commission to express fears that a military coup was imminent in his country . Officials from both countries said such a call never took place .

Saturday 's meeting signaled an easing of tensions between the military and the president , said retired Brig. Mehmoud Shah .

`` It 's a good beginning to soothe the tension that 's gripping the country , '' said Shah , a military analyst . `` It shows the two sides are prepared to talk and want the democratic system to move forward . ''

During the prime minister 's meeting with leaders , he stressed that Pakistan 's sovereignty is non-negotiable , according to a news release .

`` We would reject any approach that would tend to compromise our sovereignty , honor and national dignity , '' Gilani said . `` Our contribution and steadfast commitment to stability and peace at home and in our region is unquestionable and second to none . ''

For Pakistan , there is a need for national unity , especially between the military and the civilian government , he said .

`` Together in complete harmony with each other and other vital institutions we can change the country 's destiny and accord , its rightful place in the comity of nations , '' he said .

Military officials did not immediately comment on the meetings and their outcomes .

The military and the government have been locked in an uneasy standoff after allegations of a secret effort by the government last year to ward off a possible military coup by curbing the army 's power with Washington 's help .

That compounded tensions created by the U.S. killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on Pakistani soil in May , which deeply embarrassed the military , and NATO airstrikes in November that killed two dozen Pakistani soldier near the Afghan border , putting further pressure on relations with Washington .

A Supreme Court panel also held a hearing Monday to investigate an unsigned memo sent to the Pentagon that allegedly called for Washington to help avert a military coup and curb the military 's powers .

The memo enraged military leaders who are cooperating with the Supreme Court . The court is investigating to determine whether Zardari was aware of the memo .

The government has denied involvement , but the Supreme Court 's eventual findings could threaten Zardari and his government .

The president also faces pressure from the Supreme Court on another front .

The court is pushing the government to pursue old corruption charges against thousands of politicians and bureaucrats , including Zardari . The politicians were granted amnesty by a decree issued by then President Pervez Musharraf in 2007 .

In 2009 , the Supreme Court ruled the decree was unconstitutional , but the government has yet to pursue and reopen the cases .

The Supreme Court is running out patience and last week threatened to censure the government if it did not taking action -- including the possibility of disqualifying Gilani .
