-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tuesday 's deadly suicide attack targeting Afghan Shia just did n't fit the pattern of what had come before in this troubled country .

The police formed the usual cordon at the attack site -- this time a shrine in Kabul . Sirens pierced the odd moment of eerie silence , but the police chief 's face was contorted with fury and confusion , like he 'd seen something new and troubling -- even after decades of conflict here .

Yes , the insurgency has specialized in hitting targets right in the city center , often meters away from key institutions . Yes , they are aimed for effect .

But mass casualty attacks like we used to see in 2009 are rare these days . The insurgents prefer to hit strategic targets -- unless their roadside bombs are maiming civilians elsewhere .

And no , the Shia simply were n't targets before . Sectarianism was seldom an issue here : Afghanistan has lacked the Sunni-Shia divide in Iraq that helped to keep Saddam in power but made his fall so bloody .

It has been spared the brand of Sunni extremism in Pakistan , where ruthless attacks on Shia are a shocking part of the fabric .

The question of who did it was quickly answered but unsatisfactorily .

The interior ministry here points its finger at the Taliban , despite an effusive denial from spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid .

It 's arguable that an offshoot of the Lashkar-e-Janghvi movement , which reportedly rang in a claim from Pakistan , is capable of mounting a sophisticated , targeted and vicious attack in the very heart of Kabul without some assistance .

If they are responsible , it does require some explanation as to how a small , rogue group of extremists -- which has links to al Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban -- could suddenly develop the capacity to penetrate the capital of a neighboring state . And are Pakistani extremists really operating freely inside Afghanistan now ?

Whether the culprits turn out to be the Pakistan-based Haqqani network -- the group blamed for recent high-profile and sophisticated attacks in the capital -- the Lashkar-e-Janghvi al Almi , or another complex part of Afghanistan 's insurgency , fractured and complicated after 10 years , many Afghans place the blame at one source : Pakistan .

That 's the `` address '' that Kabul thinks the Taliban now resides under . That 's who they blame for most of the ills here , despite simultaneously hoping they will come to the negotiating table and help .

But we should not rush to attribute blame for one reason : The advent of Pakistani extremists trying to foment sectarian violence in Afghanistan at this late stage in the war is a prospect too terrifying to behold .
