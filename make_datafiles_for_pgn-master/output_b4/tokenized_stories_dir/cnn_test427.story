-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Veteran character actor Ralph Waite -- who many knew best from his time on `` The Waltons , '' though he also had regular roles in more recent series like `` Bones '' and `` NCIS '' -- has died .

He was 85 .

Waite died on Thursday afternoon at his Palm Desert , California , home , according to Steve Gordon , his family accountant . Jane Mead , a representative of the Spirit of the Desert Presbyterian Fellowship that Waite attended regularly , confirmed his death .

According to IMDB.com , Waite was already a Hollywood veteran with parts in movies like `` Cool Hand Luke '' and `` Five Easy Pieces , '' plus TV series such as `` Bonanza '' when he landed the role of John Walton Sr. .

`` The Waltons '' struck a chord with many viewers during its run from 1972 to 1981 , with Waite being a constant on that show as well as in several TV movies to follow .

Waite was twice nominated for an Emmy , first in 1977 for supporting actor in a comedy or drama series for `` Roots '' and the next year as lead actor in a drama for his Waltons ' role .

Waite also tried his hand at politics , running unsuccessfully as a Democrat for a U.S. representative seat that includes Palm Springs -- narrowly losing in 1990 and again in 1998 to Mary Bono , the widow of former congressman and `` Sonny and Cher '' star Sonny Bono .

These forays did n't stop Waite from continuing his day job , however .

He continued to score regular roles , for instance , on TV shows like `` The Mississippi , '' `` Murder One , '' `` Carnivale , '' `` The Practice '' and `` Grey 's Anatomy . ''

In fact , Waite was busy working right through last year playing recurring characters on not only `` Bones '' and `` NCIS '' but also `` Days of Our Lives . ''

Stephan Nathan , `` Bones '' executive producer , remembered Waites as `` a wonderful man . ''

`` A big loss , '' Nathan tweeted . `` RIP . ''

Pauley Perrette , part of the `` NCIS '' cast , also tweeted condolences for the man she referred to as Papa Gibbs .

`` We love him at NCIS SO much , '' Perrette said . `` So so sad . ''
