-LRB- Wired -RRB- -- After releasing two generations of iPhones with exactly the same form factor , Apple is expected to show off a new chassis design -- and possibly new materials -- in its sixth-generation smartphone .

And a little-known alloy that Apple has quietly been using for the past two years could be just the ticket to make consumers swoon .

Korea IT News reported Wednesday that the iPhone 5 is likely to be housed in Liquidmetal , the commercial name for an alloy of titanium , zirconium , nickel , copper and other metals . It would make the outer surface of the phone `` smooth like liquid , '' according to the report .

`` The next iPhone needs to truly stand out from the crowd , '' Canalys analyst Chris Jones told Wired via email . `` A change in materials is a likely way to differentiate its form factor . ''

Liquidmetal was discovered at the California Institute of Technology in 1992 . It 's a class of patented amorphous metal alloys -LRB- basically metallic glass -RRB- with unique properties including high strength , high wear resistance against scratching and denting , and a good strength-to-weight ratio . Apple was granted rights to use it in August of 2010 .

`` Liquidmetal allows precision parts to be fabricated similar to plastic injection molding , but with similar properties to metal , '' IHS senior principal analyst Kevin Keller said .

In today 's metal-based gadgets , you either need to bend a piece of sheet metal , or die-cast with an inferior alloy like aluminum or magnesium . In die-casting , the alloys tend to be brittle and have poor wear resistance .

Liquidmetal 's injection molding process is still a relatively new technology , and it 's fairly expensive -- but that 's not necessarily anything that Apple would shy away from .

Liquidmetal has been used in Apple products -LRB- as well as those of other manufacturers -RRB- for several years . The SIM card ejector tool in some North American first-generation iPads was made of Liquidmetal , and since then , Keller said , it 's been used in a number of other internal parts and small mechanical components .

`` We expect Apple and other manufacturers to start using this not only for larger and more visible portions of devices , but also entire enclosures , '' Keller said . Thus , a Liquidmetal iPhone chassis seems entirely reasonable to expect in the not-too-distant future .

Jones also noted that the discovery and use of new materials was one of Steve Jobs ' obsessions . `` But Apple will need to ensure a change in material does not compromise the performance of the device , '' he added , noting the infamous `` antenna-gate '' issue with the iPhone 4 .

Reports that an upcoming iPhone could have a metal back and a unibody case have been circling since well before the iPhone 4S was announced .
