-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Timothy Bradley shook the boxing world after a stunning split decision against Manny Pacquiao to win the WBO welterweight title .

Pacquiao appeared to dominate Bradley during the fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Saturday night , but the judges felt otherwise .

Two of the ringside judges had the fight 115-113 for Bradley while the other judge scored it 115-113 for Pacquiao .

After the judges ' scores were announced , most of the sold-out crowd at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas voiced its displeasure .

Defeat leaves ` Pacman ' fans stunned

Bradley , a native of Cathedral City , California , remains unbeaten with 29 wins , along with one no-contest . Pacquiao suffered his first loss since 2005 .

Some analysts believed Pacquiao would win the bout , given he was arguably the world 's best pound-for-pound fighter . He was the first fighter to win world titles in eight weight classes , but none of that mattered Saturday .

` Shocked ' by ` local hero ' Bradley win

The fight did not start until late Saturday because promoter Bob Arum did not want it to compete with Game 7 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat . The Heat won 101-88 to advance to the NBA finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder .

Now , the question is what Bradley 's win or Pacquiao 's loss will mean for boxing . After the bout , both announced they were interested in a rematch . Many fans have called for a potential showdown between Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr. .

Mayweather is in a Nevada jail serving a three-month sentence for a domestic violence conviction .
