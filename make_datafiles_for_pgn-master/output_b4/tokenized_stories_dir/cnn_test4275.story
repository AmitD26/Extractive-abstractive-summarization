-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chelsea booked a semifinal date with Champions League holders Barcelona with a 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge over 10-man Benfica Wednesday .

But their passage was not assured until substitute Raul Meireles scored the clinching goal in injury time .

A first half penalty from Frank Lampard was canceled out by a late Javi Garcia header for the battling visitors , who had Maxi Pereira sent off just before halftime .

Chelsea , who won 1-0 win in Lisbon last week , went through 3-1 on aggregate .

Real Madrid thrashed spirited Cypriot minnows Apoel Nicosia 5-2 in their quarterfinal second leg in the Santiago Bernebeu stadium to win 8-2 on aggregate .

Bayern Munich await Jose Mourinho 's men in the last four .

Cristiano Ronaldo put Real ahead midway through the first half as he connected with Marcelo 's cross .

Former World Player of the Year Kaka capped an electrifying first half performance with the second on 36 minutes with a curling shot .

The visitors , the first Cypriot team to reach the last eight of the Champions League , had brief cause for celebration through a Gustavo Manduca goal just after the hour mark , but Ronaldo grabbed his second with a stunning free kick to re-open a two-goal advantage on the night .

It was his eighth in the Champions League this season and leaves him one short of 50 in all competitions .

Jose Callejon made it four for Real , but the visitors were not finished yet .

Hamit Altintop brought down Adorno for a penalty and Estbeban Solari sent Iker Casillas the wrong way .

An impudent chip from Angel di Maria rounded off the Real scoring on an eventful night .

Chelsea 's continued their passage under interim manager Roberto Di Matteo , but their fans were kept on the edge of their seats until the very end of their second leg tie .

Benfica made a bright start but when Garcia brought down Ashley Cole to concede a penalty , well-taken by Lampard , Chelsea could breath easier .

Pereira , who had been needlessly booked for dissent , was shown his second yellow for a studs up challenge on Jon Obi Mikel to leave his side with an uphill task .

But Chelsea wasted chances to wrap up the match , Ramires missing from close range and Fernando Torres firing agonizingly wide to leave Benfica with late hope .

That was intensified as Garcia rose unmarked to head past Petr Cech only for Mereiles to burst clear and score with a thumping shot .

A relieved Di Matteo said that he had always expected a tough passage to the semifinals .

`` We knew before the game we were going to face a difficult game tonight and it proved that .

`` Benfica are a good side , but we are pleased we are in the semifinal now . The second goal was missing to kill the game . With a 1-0 lead they still had a chance and they knew that . We missed a lot of chances to kill the game , '' he told ITV Sport .
