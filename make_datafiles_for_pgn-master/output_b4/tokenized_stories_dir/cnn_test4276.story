New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Canadian beauty pageant contestant who was disqualified when the Miss Universe Canada organizers discovered she was transgender said Tuesday she had been devastated by the decision and wanted a clear change in the rules .

After initially disqualifying Talackova , organizers of the Miss Universe beauty pageant reversed course late Monday , saying she can participate .

In a statement , the Miss Universe Organization said Jenna Talackova can compete provided `` she meets the legal gender recognition requirements of Canada , and the standards established by other international competitions . ''

The statement , however , did not elaborate on what the requirements were .

The 6-foot-1-inch blond model told a news conference Tuesday of the pain the row had caused her .

`` I am a woman . I was devastated and I felt that excluding me for the reason that they gave was unjust , '' she said .

Talackova , a 23-year-old Vancouver resident , also called on Donald Trump , who owns the Miss Universe competition , to state `` in plain words '' whether she will be able to compete and go forward to the Miss Universe final if she wins her country 's contest .

`` I have never asked for any special consideration . I only wanted to compete , '' she said .

`` I also want Mr. Trump to clearly state that this rule will be eliminated because I do not want any other woman to suffer the discrimination that I have to endure . ''

Speaking to CNN Tuesday , Trump said that according to the laws of Canada and the United States , Talackova should be allowed to enter the pageant .

`` So she will be entering the Miss Canada pageant , but we went strictly by the laws , '' he said .

`` As with any competition , the Miss Universe pageant has rules that apply to all of its franchises around the world . Such rules include , but are not limited to , citizenship , age , and marital status requirements . Additionally , the rules currently state that all contestants must be naturally born females , '' the Miss Universe organization said .

Those rules are not posted on the Miss Universe website .

High profile feminist lawyer Gloria Allred , speaking alongside Talackova , also said Trump needed to clear up the confusion over Talackova 's participation .

`` We need a clear answer -- not a wimpy , wishy-washy type of answer -- but something that we can take to the bank . Will Jenna be allowed to compete or not ? Will he eliminate this abhorrent rule or not ? ''

Allred said Talackova , who until Tuesday had not spoken to reporters , was considering all legal options .

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , or GLAAD , commended the pageant organizer 's decision Monday night .

`` The Miss Universe Organization made the right decision and has taken an important first step , '' the group said .

Talackova was one of the 65 finalists selected to contend for the title of Miss Universe Canada and the honor of representing her country in the Miss Universe competition .

But organizers told her last month she could not compete because she lied about having undergone sexual reassignment surgery and did not meet requirements for the pageant .

At the time , the Miss Universe Organization said current rules state that all contestants must be a `` naturally born female . ''

In a 2010 interview in Thailand , where she was competing for Miss International Queen , a competition for transgender women , Talackova said she knew she was a girl at age 4 . She said she started hormone therapy at age 14 and underwent sexual reassignment surgery at 19 .

After Talackova 's disqualification , social media users flooded the Facebook page of Miss Universe Canada with comments criticizing the decision .

A petition started on the social change website Change.org garnered more than 41,000 signatures calling for organizers to reverse their ruling .

The 61st annual Miss Universe Canada Pageant will be held in Toronto on May 19 .
