Istanbul , Turkey -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The downing of a Turkish jet over the Mediterranean last Friday by a Syrian missile took Turkish-Syrian tensions to a new level . Though the Turkish government did not declare war as some expected , and others feared , it did declare Syria a `` clear and present danger '' and raised its rules of engagement to an alert level .

How we came to this point is an interesting story . The 550-mile long border with Syria , Turkey 's longest , has often been tense . During the Cold War , Syria was a Soviet ally , Turkey was a NATO member -LRB- as it still is -RRB- and the border was heavily mined . Moreover , Hafez Assad , the father and predecessor of Syria 's current dictator , Bashar al-Assad , supported and hosted the PKK , the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party , which has led a guerrilla war against Turkey since the early '80s . -LRB- PKK is defined by Turkey and the United States as a terrorist group . -RRB- Turkey had come close to waging a war against Syria in 1999 because of this PKK connection .

Turkey moves forces to Syrian border amid tensions , official says

However , the relations surprisingly changed for the better in the first decade of the new century . Bashar al-Assad , who replaced his father in 2000 , seemed to promise a more open and friendly Syria . In Turkey , the Justice and Development Party of Recep Tayyip Erdogan , which came to power in 2002 , initiated a foreign policy of `` zero problems with neighbors . '' This led to a fruitful Turkish-Syrian rapprochment : Erdogan and Assad became friends , trade between the two countries was boosted , and borders were opened for visa-free travel . Just two years ago , the two countries looked like the core states of a would-be Middle Eastern Union modeled after the EU .

But this honeymoon came to an abrupt end with the Arab Spring . The Erdogan government , whose claims include democratizing Turkey by saving it from the tutelage of the country 's overbearing military , intuitively sympathized with and announced support for this democratic wave in the region . Yet while this proved to be a winning game in Tunisia , Egypt and Libya , Syria turned out to be a tougher case .

Throughout the initial months of the demonstrations in Syria , which began in March 2011 , the Turkish government hoped and tried to persuade al-Assad 's regime to allow a peaceful transition to democracy . This hope was gradually replaced by frustration , however , and Erdogan soon began to condemn the `` barbarism '' and `` savagery '' of the Syrian regime . The trouble for him , as it usually is , was also personal : As he said in the Turkish Parliament on June 21 , Assad had promised him change and reform but proved to be a liar instead .

Consequently , Turkey rapidly emerged as one of the boldest supporters of the Syrian opposition , and the Syrian National Council , formed as the dissidents ' umbrella group , found a base in Turkey . Meanwhile , at least 15,000 refugees from Syria , both dissidents and their families , were given shelter on the Turkish side of the Syrian border .

Moreover , the Free Syrian Army , a rebel group formed by the Syrian soldiers who deserted to the opposition 's side , not only operated from Turkey but , according to some reports , were helped with arms and other supplies as well . The Syrian response was to add Turkey to its own version of the axis of evil -- the United States , NATO , Saudi Arabia and in fact much of the rest of the world -- in its official propaganda .

Inside Turkey , this engagement in the Syrian crisis has supporters and critics . The supporters are mostly Sunni conservatives who strongly identify with the Syrian opposition , which include the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood . -LRB- The massacre of thousands of Sunnis in Hama in 1982 by Hafez Assad had been a tragic memory in the minds of these conservative Turks , who now believe that the Syrian leopard has simply not changed its spots . -RRB-

Other voices in Turkey , ranging from hardcore secularists to pro-Iranian marginal Islamists , accuse the government for being naively involved in a conflict cooked up by `` Western imperialists . ''

The plane incident came on top of all this . The downed jet was apparently an unarmed but military aircraft which , according to the Turkish government , was on a peaceful mission to test the NATO radar system based in eastern Turkey . Syrians said the plane violated Syrian airspace and was shot within it .

The Turkish government said the plane violated the Syrian airspace `` mistakenly and very briefly '' but was hit by a Syrian missile despite immediately having reverted to international airspace . The plane 's two pilots , who apparently fell to the sea , are missing .

The Turkish reaction to the incident was outlined by Erdogan in an address in the parliament that came four days after the incident . In a very strident tone against the `` bloody dictator of Syria , '' Erdogan announced that Turkey now sees its southern neighbor as a `` clear and present danger '' and will change its rules of engagement : `` Any military element that approaches the Turkish border from Syria by posing a security risk will be regarded as a threat , and will be treated as a military target . '' The very same day , some Turkish tanks on the Syrian border were repositioned , implying that Ankara meant business .

Yet almost no one in Turkey seems enthusiastic for war . Many here point out that Turkey 's ascendance in the past decade has been thanks to its `` soft power . '' That mainly rested on the country 's economic boom and democratic reforms , which seemed to present a synthesis of Islam , free-market capitalism and political liberalism .

But should Turkey now consider putting some `` hard power '' on the table , without which it might become ineffective in its region ? This is a question that Turks are passionately discussing these days , and the answer seems to matter a lot for the Syrians as well .
