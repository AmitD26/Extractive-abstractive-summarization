-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A new study on healthy women with genetic mutations that sharply increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer supports the old adage : An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure .

The report , published online Monday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , studied nearly 5,800 women with specific genetic mutations called BRCA1 and BRCA2 .

Researchers found that women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations who protectively had their ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian , fallopian tube , or peritoneal cancer by 80 % , and their overall risk of death by 77 % .

BRCA stands for breast cancer susceptibility genes , a class of genes known as tumor suppressors . Mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer .

According to Monday 's study , women with BRCA1 mutations should have preventive ovarian surgery -- known as prophylactic oophorectomy -- by age 35 , as waiting appears to increase the risk of ovarian cancer . In contrast , women with BRCA2 mutations can safely delay surgery until their 40s , the study suggests , as their risk of ovarian cancer is not as strong .

The new research provides doctors with additional information to support the risk-reducing surgery , said ovarian cancer expert Dr. Shannon Westin .

Removing the ovaries in these patients `` provides more benefits than just the reduction in ovarian cancer because this study shows there 's a survival benefit that has not been shown this clearly before , '' she said .

7 questions on cancer gene testing

Westin is an assistant professor in the Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston . She was not involved in the study .

According to the American Cancer Society , previous studies have shown that removing the ovaries of a premenopausal woman with BRCA mutations can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by 85 % to 95 % , and the risk of breast cancer is cut by 50 % to 60 % .

But Monday 's study is the first study to show an overall mortality reduction benefit .

`` To me , waiting to have oophorectomy until after 35 is too much of a chance to take , '' said Steven Narod , professor of medicine at the University of Toronto in Canada , and the study 's lead author . `` These data are so striking that we believe prophylactic oophorectomy by age 35 should become a universal standard for women with BRCA1 mutations . ''

BRCA mutations grabbed national headlines last year when actress Angelina Jolie announced she carries a mutation of the BRCA1 gene and had underwent a preventive double mastectomy at age 37 to reduce her risk of breast caner .

Jolie 's mother , actress and producer Marcheline Bertrand , died of ovarian cancer in 2007 at the age of 56 .

`` My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer , although the risk is different in the case of each woman , '' Jolie wrote in a New York Times op-ed article in May .

`` Once I knew that this was my reality , I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much I could , '' she said . `` I started with the breasts , as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer , and the surgery is more complex . ''

Dr. Agustin Garcia , an associate professor of Clinical Medicine at Keck Medicine of University of Southern California , said another important aspect of the study is how it breaks down the differences researchers saw between BRCA1 and BRCA 2 carriers .

`` In most of the guidelines , we do n't distinguish between the two , but this study separated the two groups for potential age for prophylactic oophorectomy , '' said Garcia , who was not involved in the research .

He said the study tells women with the BRCA2 mutation they can probably wait until they are 50 to have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed .

`` These results could make a real difference for women with BRCA mutations , who face tough decisions about whether and when to undergo a prophylactic oophorectomy , '' Don Dizon , a member of the cancer communications committee at the American Society of Clinical Oncology , said in a statement .

`` Importantly , for women who will be undergoing this surgery early in life , it 's reassuring to see that it carries long-lasting benefits , substantially reducing ovarian cancer risk as well as total mortality risk , '' he added .
