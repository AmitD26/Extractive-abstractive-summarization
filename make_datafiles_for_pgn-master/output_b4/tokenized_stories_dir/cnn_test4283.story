-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Oprah Winfrey took to Twitter last night to ask Nielsen viewers to watch her cable network OWN , drawing criticism from some followers and investigative scrutiny from the ratings measurement company .

`` Every 1 who can please turn to OWN especially if u have a Nielsen box , '' she tweeted Sunday evening at the start `` Oprah 's Next Chapter '' and the mega-rated Grammy telecast . She later added , `` Commercial Grammy people . . u can turn to OWN . ''

That tweets caused a backlash on the social networking site , with readers accusing her of `` begging for viewers '' and being `` desperate . ''

Oprah followed up with a flurry of defensive replies that were apparently in response to reader criticism : `` The word ` please ' is used as courtesy not a beg ... ` desperate ' not ever a part of my vocab ... ` unethical ' a little harsh do n't u think ? Seemed like it made sense to me . Sorry if u 're offended . ''

The original tweet has since been deleted .

As Deadline noted , networks are not allowed to specifically target Nielsen subscribers . It 's policy prohibits `` attempts to single out panel members ... to change their viewing habits . ''

`` In accordance with our policies and procedures , Nielsen is reviewing this incident with our clients and we may withhold , breakout and/or make a note in the ratings , '' a Nielsen rep told EW.com . `` We take any violation of our policy seriously and will work with clients to resolve the situation . ''

Of course , given that 39.9 million people watched the Grammys last night , with CBS crushing rivals , a more effective punishment might be releasing OWN 's ratings instead of holding them back .

UPDATE : Oprah Winfrey released this statement : `` I removed the tweet at the request of Nielsen . I intended no harm and apologize for the reference . ''
