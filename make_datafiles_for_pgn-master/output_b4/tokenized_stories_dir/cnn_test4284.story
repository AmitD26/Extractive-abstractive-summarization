-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fans from across Europe will soon be traveling to Poland to support their teams during Euro 2012 , but so too will police officers from each nation to keep an eye on them .

When their national teams are playing , visiting police officers will be at Poland 's police headquarters in Warsaw , the nerve-center for security operations during the event .

Poland has a lot riding on the tournament it is co-hosting with Ukraine , and is no stranger to football violence .

Last year 's Polish Cup Final between Legia Warsaw and Lech Poznan was a high-profile example of how domestic football in Poland is still blighted by hooliganism , as violent fans clashed with police and water cannons had to be used to control the crowd .

Even before that incident , UEFA , European football 's governing body , had criticized Poland for football violence which it said was ruining the country 's reputation .

However police in the capital have spent years preparing for Euro 2012 and reducing the potential of trouble from homegrown and international football hooligans . Like all major international events terrorism is the main security concern .

`` The whole security plan is ready ; the right equipment has been bought , '' says Mariusz Sokolowski , press officer for the Polish police force .

`` The sites that needed to be renovated for the tournament have also been completed . And now it 's a time to put all that we have done into practice . ''

The new National Stadium in Warsaw hosted a friendly match between Poland and Portugal in February this year , when the local police force was able to test their readiness . It was called a success by UEFA .

`` We know what we deliver has to be the best , at the top level , '' says Beata Stelmach , Poland 's Deputy Foreign Minister .

`` We are absolutely the best prepared for Euro 2012 and welcome everybody who wants not only to see football games , but also to see how hospitable we are and how beautiful the country is . ''

Poland is following on from lessons learned at recent big European tournaments , like Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland , and Germany 's staging of the World Cup in 2006 . There will be `` fan zones '' with big screens and entertainment dotted around the major cities , where traveling fans without tickets can watch the matches .

`` The less we are visible and less we need to act the better the event will be as it will show that Euro 2012 will be a very safe event , '' says Sokolowski .
