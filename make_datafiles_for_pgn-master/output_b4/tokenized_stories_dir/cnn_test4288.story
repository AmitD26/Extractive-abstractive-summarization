-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Italy and Spain have become the second and third nations to secure qualification for the Euro 2012 finals after wins over Slovenia and Liechtenstein respectively on Tuesday evening .

Germany were the first country to book their tickets for the finals in Poland and Ukraine on Friday .

And they have now been joined by Italy , after a goal five minutes from time from Inter Milan striker Giampaolo Pazzini gave them a 1-0 Group C success over Slovenia in Florence .

Should UEFA put weaker nations out of their misery ?

A defensive mix-up between Marko Suler and Bostjan Cesar left Pazzini to smash the ball home from five yards out to secure victory for Cesare Prandelli 's side .

The result means the Italians now have an eight-point lead over Serbia with just two matches remaining .

Serbia beat Faroe Islands 3-1 and Estonia thumped Northern Ireland 4-1 in the other two group matches played on Wednesday .

That leaves second on 14 points and one win from their final two matches will see them reach the play-offs .

And , later in the evening , world champions Spain made it three teams to seal qualification after a 6-0 hammering of minnows Liechtenstein in Group I.

David Villa and Alvaro Negredo both scored twice with Xavi and Sergio Ramos also on target for Vicente Del Bosque 's side .

Spain have a maximum 18 points from their six matches , eight points ahead of the Czech Republic , who are battling Scotland for second place in the group .

Scotland kept their hopes of reaching the play-offs alive with a narrow 1-0 win over Lithuania in Glasgow .

Meanwhile , Netherlands need just a point from their last two matches to secure qualification from Group E after a 2-0 victory over Finland in torrential rain in Helsinki .

The World Cup finalists went ahead in the 29th minute when Wesley Sneijder set up Kevin Strootman to score .

And the Dutch added a second goal in injury time through striker Luuk de Jong to secure their eighth win from eight matches .

Netherlands require a draw against either Moldova or Sweden to secure their place in Poland and Ukraine .

Sweden kept their faint hopes of pipping Netherlands alive with a 5-0 thumping of San Marino , while Hungary won 2-0 at Moldova .

England have also edged closer to qualification after a narrow 1-0 Group G win over neighbors Wales at Wembley .

Manchester United winger Ashley Young scored the only goal , but Wales can consider themselves unlucky not to get something from the match after dominating the second half .

England need a point from their final two matches to reach the final . Montenegro lie second on 11 points and they still have to play Fabio Capello 's side at home .

Switzerland beat Bulgaria 3-1 in the other group match to keep alive their hopes of finishing second .

Group H is the closest of the nine groups , with three teams locked together on 13 points after Denmark beat Norway 2-0 thanks to a double strike from Sunderland forward Nicklas Bendtner .

Portugal are level with those two nations , although Norway only have one match remaining while the other two have two each .

It is also close in Group B with the top four teams separated by just three points . Russia and Republic of Ireland drew 0-0 in Moscow and remain first and second on 17 and 15 points respectively .

But Armenia put themselves into contention with a stunning 4-0 success in Slovakia , leaving both teams a point behind on 14 points .

France remain top of Group D despite a disappointing 0-0 draw in Romania . Laurent Blanc 's side are a point clear of Bosnia , who beat Belarus 1-0 , while Romania still retain faint hopes of qualifying .

It is now down to a two-horse race in Group F between Croatia and Greece , with Croatia leading by a point with two matches left .

A double from Eduardo da Silva helped Croatia defeat Israel , while Greece were held to a costly 1-1 draw in Latvia .

In Wednesday 's friendly matches , Poland and Germany drew 2-2 apiece with both sides scoring in injury time , while Argentina beat Nigeria 3-1 and Belgium had a 1-0 success over the United States .
