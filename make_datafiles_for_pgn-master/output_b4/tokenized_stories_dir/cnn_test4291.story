-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has issued a decree authorising a multi-party political system , state media reported Thursday , a day after the U.N. Security Council condemned the Syrian government 's crackdown on protesters .

The decree issued by Assad may have the power to bring to an end decades of single-party rule by the Baath Party in Syria , although it remains unclear how the new law will be implemented .

The draft law was earlier passed by Syrian lawmakers , the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency -LRB- SANA -RRB- reported , and grants citizens the right to establish political parties with the aim of contributing to political life `` through peaceful and democratic means . ''

However , the Syrian opposition has argued the decrees are simply for show and will not bring about real change .

Assad 's move comes as reports of violence continue to prompt international outrage . Security forces killed four people after evening prayers on Wednesday , the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said , one in the southwestern town of Nawa , in Daraa province , one in the central city of Palmyra , and two in Damascus .

The observatory said communications remained cut off Thursday in the western city of Hama , a center of discontent and bastion of anti-government protest . The group is concerned that many civilians may have died , as the military remains in the city .

The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday issued a presidential statement condemning the Syrian government 's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties .

`` The Security Council condemns the widespread violations of human rights and the use of force against civilians by the Syrian authorities , '' the eight-paragraph statement says .

It calls for `` all sides to act with utmost restraint , and to refrain from reprisals , including attacks against state institutions . ''

The statement says those responsible for the violence should be held accountable but offers no suggestion that foreign intervention is being considered .

`` The Security Council reaffirms its strong commitment to the sovereignty , independence , and territorial integrity of Syria , '' it says .

`` It stresses that the only solution to the current crisis in Syria is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process , with the aim of effectively addressing the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the population which will allow the full exercise of fundamental freedoms for its entire population , including that of expression and peaceful assembly . ''

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who is to update the council on the situation in Syria within a week , welcomed the statement .

`` The world has watched the deteriorating situation in Syria with the most profound concern , but the events of the past few days have been brutally shocking , '' he told reporters .

`` Once again , I call on President -LRB- Bashar al - -RRB- Assad and the Syrian authorities to immediately cease all violence against their people , to fully respect human rights and implement reforms that they have already announced . ''

He urged Damascus to comply with the Security Council 's demand that international humanitarian organizations be granted unimpeded access to affected areas . `` Those responsible should be held to account , '' he said .

He praised the 15-nation Security Council for speaking out `` with one voice and condemning all this violence and asking them to take necessary measures '' after long discussions on the matter .

But Lebanon 's ambassador , Caroline Ziade , said her country , which is Syria 's neighbor , dissociated itself from the statement . However , Lebanon chose not to block the measure , as it could have done .

Resolutions usually carry with them some sort of action . Presidential statements are simply unanimous on-the-record positions .

Though a resolution would have been more significant than the presidential statement , U.S. diplomats said they were glad the United Nations had taken a stance .

U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice called the statement `` long overdue . '' She added that she hoped Damascus will `` be chastened by the strength and the unity of the condemnation . ''

The statement came on the third consecutive day of talks in New York to address the crisis , which a White House spokesman called `` grotesque and appalling . ''

Witnesses said Wednesday that security forces were brazenly advancing into the heart of Hama .

Hama , which has seen massive demonstrations by anti-government protesters in Friday demonstrations , was the site of the 1982 bloody crackdown by the Alawite-dominated government against a Muslim Brotherhood uprising .

The city is under siege by security forces amid a military offensive , according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , and witnesses say communications have been closed down amid the military push .

Rami Abdul-Rahman of the observatory told CNN Thursday that 1,000 families had fled west to surrounding villages and 500 families eastwards , leaving a city where violence has persisted for days .

His group monitors the unrest in Syria through many contacts on the ground , and his sources have reported hearing explosions and seeing plumes of smoke . `` There are great concerns of a massacre in the city , '' he said Wednesday .

`` The human situation is very bad , '' said a witness from an opposition movement who said he was in the center of Hama and asked not to be named for security reasons .

Corpses were seen on the ground after tanks occupied parts of central Hama amid heavy shelling , said a resident who fled the city .

Dozens more people have been killed in Hama and other Syrian cities in recent days , rights groups have said .

Residents said the city is running short on food . Power and water are scarce and residents said they fear a humanitarian crisis . Across Hama , intermittent gunfire and shelling rang out , helicopters whirled overhead and government snipers took positions , making it difficult for people to venture out , residents said .

Security forces also launched a series of raids and detentions in the Khaldiyeh neighborhood of Homs , another western city , and dozens of people have been detained in the area , the scene of marches by anti-government protesters .

Syria 's parliament plans to meet Sunday to discuss `` issues related to the homeland and citizens ' interests , '' SANA reported Wednesday .

CNN is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in Syria , which has restricted access to the country by international journalists , including CNN 's .

Since mid-March , anti-government protesters have taken to the streets across the whole country to demand reforms from or an end to the al-Assad 's regime .

The death toll in Syria since its uprising began in mid-March has reached 2,003 , the observatory 's Abdul-Rahman said . The dead include 1,629 civilians and 374 Syrian security forces .

The figure does n't include tolls from the Wednesday unrest in the city of Hama , where it is difficult confirming information because of the ongoing military offensive there .

Activists blame the deaths of demonstrators on security forces , but the government has consistently attributed the violence to `` armed groups . ''
