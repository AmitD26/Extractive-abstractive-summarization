-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rescue workers rushed Tuesday to get aid into flooded communities in New Jersey and Vermont , where many residents remain stranded in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene .

Marc Leibowitz , a New Yorker , went to Vermont over the weekend to get married . The wedding went off without a hitch , he said , but now he is stranded in the town of Pittsfield , with no roads to get him and his guests out .

Residents have food and drinkable water , but resources are limited and wo n't last forever , Leibowitz told CNN 's `` AC 360 . ''

`` There 's several bridges down on Route 100 . There 's a road that just caved in . There 's several houses in town that we watched floating . It 's been scary , '' he said .

Thirteen Vermont towns were inaccessible by roads early Tuesday . By late afternoon , Route 100 into Stratton and Rochester had opened and officials said they hoped to have the remainder of those towns accessible soon .

In Grafton , Vermont , 800 residents were stranded . `` It 's one massive mess , '' said Tara Taylor , who came out of Grafton to nearby Rockingham , along with her family . `` There 's no words to describe this . ''

While part of Grafton has maintained electricity , much of the town is running on generators , she said . But as far as she knew , people were well , and no one had been hurt , Taylor said . `` We 've been very lucky with this . ''

Taylor 's young daughter told CNN she had seen pictures of some devastated areas . `` It just tore me apart on how it was like all just gone , '' she said .

Mark Bosma of the Vermont Office of Emergency Management said officials were working to bring supplies to cut-off communities , turned temporarily into islands .

The National Guard operated two helicopters , doing drop-offs where needed , delivering such necessities as food , water , medicine , diapers and formula .

Meanwhile , in New Jersey , search-and-rescue teams went door-to-door by boat in flooded communities , transporting families from their homes to higher ground .

`` The water 's moving so fast , '' said Scott Evans of the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management . `` It 's not even safe to go close to the river at this point . ''

Evans spoke with CNN in Paterson , New Jersey , just three blocks from the swollen Passaic River .

Water in the street was as high as 15 to 18 feet , he said . Some one-story buildings were fully submerged .

Tuesday morning alone , 34 people , including 14 children , were rescued in Paterson along with three dogs , Evans said .

While people had been warned that river levels were rising and flooding was likely , some stayed in their homes overnight because they did n't realize the water would come gushing so quickly , Evans said .

`` Unfortunately , they are used to flooding , but not of this magnitude , '' he said of local residents . `` And a lot of areas are getting flooded this time that have not been flooded before . ''

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie surveyed some of the damage and told reporters on Tuesday that he had seen `` extraordinary despair . '' More than 1,300 people throughout the state are in shelters , he said , though that number is likely to rise as additional areas are evacuated .

Also Tuesday , the death toll stemming from Irene continued to rise . At least 43 deaths were linked to the storm , from Florida to North Carolina to New England .

An estimated 2.85 million customers remained without power Tuesday afternoon , the U.S. Department of Energy said . That included more than half a million each in Connecticut and New York , more than 400,000 in Virginia , more than 300,000 in New Jersey and more than 250,000 in Maryland .

Nearly 6.7 million customers initially were left without power by the storm , the department said .

`` This storm covered a tremendous amount of territory , '' Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters in Virginia . She said most states are now in recovery , though a few states -- like Vermont and New Jersey -- are still in response mode .

Napolitano traveled to North Carolina and Virginia on Tuesday with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to meet with state and local officials and to survey storm efforts .

Vilsack spoke to reporters in North Carolina after touring some of the hardest-hit areas . He said tobacco , cotton and corn producers had suffered extensive damage .

The full extent of Irene 's destruction wo n't be known for some time . The federal government estimates that the cost from wind damage alone will exceed $ 1 billion . Analysts have put the total expected cost of Irene much higher .
