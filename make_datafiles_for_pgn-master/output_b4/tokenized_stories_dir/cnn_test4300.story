-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The best/worst -LRB- take your pick -RRB- part of any Olympic Games is the way millions of us end up watching a sport that millions of us would n't be caught dead watching under any normal circumstances . I love this stuff . Why , just a little while ago , I found myself reading a story that began : `` Slovenia judoka Urska Zolnir won gold in women 's 63 kilogram over China 's Xu Lili . ''

I thought to myself , `` hmmm ... . I do n't know what a judoka is , I do n't know what a kilogram is , and , come to think of it , I ca n't even tell you where Slovenia is . ''

And then I think : `` Wait a minute . Did n't you GO to Olympic women 's judo once ? '' Yes , indeed I did . Barcelona , 1992 .

I was there when Yael Arad , 25 , a 136-pound -LRB- not sure how many kilograms that is -RRB- aspiring dietitian from Tel Aviv took second place to become the first Israeli athlete -LRB- man or woman -RRB- to win a medal -LRB- gold , silver or bronze -RRB- in an Olympic competition -LRB- summer or winter -RRB- . Israel and judo , who knew ? They go together like the United States and rugby , like Iraq and ice hockey .

I wrote about judo that day , even though I do n't know judo from jiu-jitsu from karate from taekwondo . I only know that you sign up your grandson for lessons , and he goes to a class at a mall .

The women in Barcelona came out in what looked like white bathrobes . I saw one 's belt come loose . Was that a point for her opponent ? I saw one go down . `` That 's an ippon , '' I was told by the guy next to me .

I saw a point go on the scoreboard under the word `` koka . '' It was my first time seeing an ippon go up on a koka . I was enjoying my first judo . I was n't yet ready for the National Judo League to put Monday Night Judo on TV , but I was having a good time .

The women grunted and groaned on the mat and appeared to be having a really bad-ass game of Twister . It got pretty physical out there . Not quite Batman vs. Bane , but definitely tough stuff .

I got a kick out of watching them fight . I looked up that day 's judo results later on a computer and found the following : 19 ippons , 13 waza-aris , 22 yukos , 35 kokas , 13 shidos , three chuis , two keikokus and no hansoku-makes .

Do n't you hate it when you watch judo all day without seeing a single hansoku-make ?

Sports of all sorts , that 's the Olympics in a nutshell . I think they 've had every kind of sport so far -- SO FAR -- except bungee jumping , elephant hunting and `` Celebrity Apprentice . ''

The 1896 Athens Games began with King George I of Greece declaring them open . He did not jump out of a helicopter first with James Bond . He did not need to listen to the `` Chariots of Fire '' theme . He did not sit at home watching Bob Costas on TV , although Zeus knows that he probably did know a whole lot of guys named Costas .

Swimming was part of those 1896 Games . I doubt if any Speedo suits were involved . Do you know where the 1896 swim events were held ? In the bay . I ai n't kidding . They swam in the Bay of Zea , not in some cool pool . I bet the bronze medalist would be really angry if he lost a few seconds on the clock while attempting to swim for his life from a shark .

The 1900 Paris Games included cricket and croquet . It also had golf , which is being brought back for 2016 . I am extremely excited about this , because whenever I think of an Olympic athlete , I think of a lean , hard , buff , rock-abbed , Adonis-like individual like Phil Mickelson .

Paris also had a sport called Basque Pelota . I personally love pelota , but not that Basque kind . In the first place , I believe it uses a designated hitter . In the second place , Basque Pelota is notorious for its MVPs being on steroids . I am glad Basque Pelota is gone now . Otherwise , NBC would probably ask Savannah Guthrie to get out there and try to play it .

The 1904 St. Louis Games had sports I could comprehend . Like tug of war , for one . Nobody needs to explain tug of war to me . One team tugs . The other team tugs . Whichever team tugs harder wins . I do not know if the losing team fell face first into Missouri mud , but I 'd like to think so . -LRB- By the way , although Boston and New York usually get most of the publicity , St. Louis fans are considered by many to be the greatest tug-of-war fans in the world . -RRB-

Those 1904 Olympics also had a sport called roque , which is a form of croquet . It has n't returned since , so maybe there was a scandal . Maybe the winner got caught corking his mallet . I wish croquet would make a comeback in the Olympics , particularly so the top croquet stars could end up with at least 500,000 followers on Twitter . I can see Canada becoming very good at this . The croquet fights alone would go over big in Toronto .

Nowadays , we have things such as archery , badminton , beach volleyball , canoe slalom , equestrian , handball , modern pentathlon and water polo that you do n't usually see on TV . I mean , let 's face it , there are n't a lot of archery highlights shown at 11 o'clock . Not a lot of `` Top 10 Shuttlecock Shots of the Day . '' Not much canoe coverage for all you whitewater fantasy-league geeks .

I have been to 11 Olympics in person , yet I still have no clue what modern pentathlon is , or if there was ever old-fashioned pentathlon . The only archery I have witnessed between 2008 and 2012 was in `` The Hunger Games . '' I am one of those old dudes who ca n't take synchronized swimming -LRB- or diving -RRB- seriously because all I can see is Harry Shearer doing it with Martin Short .

I just watched equestrian events on TV . I pull for the horses . I want a horse to get up on a pedestal and get a gold medal . I think the horse does the hard part and deserves the perks . I see some poor gelding about to leap over an obstacle , and I bet he 's thinking to himself : `` I could jump even higher if I could get this fool off my back . ''

Greco-Roman wrestling is another sport you can go four years without watching once on TV . I know there are networks that could use a hit , so they really should consider Greco-Roman wrestling with masks and costumes and 250-pound men jumping off the top rope .

It is so cool seeing some of these obscure Olympic sports come back to life .

I believe the popularity of some of these sports could rise dramatically if shown more frequently on TV . Bikini beach volleyball should be shown 23 hours a day . If I worked for NBC , for example , I would be absolutely begging the International Olympic Committee to give serious consideration to bikini judo .

Mike Downey : Olympics compel us to watch sports we 'd never follow

@highlight

He says the rules and even language of sports such as judo are n't familiar to many in U.S.

At St. Louis games in 1904 , tug of war was an entry -- at least the rules were plain , he says

Downey : I 've attended 11 Olympics and still do n't know what modern pentathlon is
