HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai was in stable condition and recovering from head injuries Friday night after a car wreck that killed his wife , Susan , medical sources told CNN .

Tsvangirai and his wife , Susan , were en route to the prime minister 's hometown of Buhera .

The crash , on a busy two-lane highway between Tsvangirai 's hometown of Buhera and the capital city of Harare , comes just weeks after the start of a power-sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival , President Robert Mugabe .

Analysts say the crash is bound to raise suspicion of foul play , with one former U.S. diplomat calling for an outside investigation , saying it is not the first time that a political foe of Mugabe has been killed or injured in a car crash .

Members of Tsvangirai 's political party , the Movement for Democratic Change , said Friday that it was too early to tell whether the crash is anything other than an accident .

Tsvangirai 's aide and driver also were injured in the head-on collision with a large truck , according to his spokesman , James Maridadi .

Movement for Democratic Change spokesman Nelson Chamisa said he spoke to Tsvangirai at the hospital , and the party leader was in `` relatively stable '' condition . An MDC spokesman describes ` critical ' accident ''

Sources at The Avenues Clinic in Harare said that Tsvangirai was in stable condition with minor head injuries and that the prime minister was alert and talking . One source said the attending doctor had told him of his wife 's death .

Another said that doctors were planning to keep Tsvangirai overnight for observation and that specialists were checking his condition .

Tsvangirai , Zimbabwe 's main opposition leader , took office last month under a power-sharing deal with Mugabe after a contentious election .

Tsvangirai 's MDC reached the power-sharing agreement with Mugabe in September after months of angry dispute that included violence . More than 200 deaths , mainly those of opposition supporters , were reported leading up to and in the aftermath of the election .

`` I 'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure , '' said Tom McDonald , the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001 . `` President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it 's sort of his M.O. of how they get rid of people they do n't like . '' Watch more on the fatal crash ''

McDonald cited the 2001 death of Defense Minister Moven Mahachi , Employment Minister Border Gezi 's death in 1999 and the death last year of Elliot Manyika , a government minister and former regional governor .

All three died in car crashes .

`` This is several , '' McDonald said . `` So , when I hear that Tsvangirai was in an accident , it gives me pause . ''

McDonald , now an attorney with the Washington law firm Baker Hostetler , urged a full investigation by outside authorities .

One analyst who studies the region said the collision could `` exacerbate '' the fragile unity government .

`` There will undoubtedly be suspicions about the cause of the crash and whether there was foul play involved , '' said Jennifer Cooke , director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .

`` At a time when there needs to be confidence-building measures , this incident potentially raises suspicions and undermines the potential for greater cohesion of the government . -LSB- There is -RSB- huge potential for the agreement to be manipulated by Mugabe . ''

McDonald , however , was quick to say that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe . The highway on which Tsvangirai was traveling is a two-lane road where tractor-trailers are common , vehicles in the country are often in bad shape and drivers often are inexperienced , he said .

`` It 's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things , '' he said .

The collision occurred on the Harare-Masvingo Road as Tsvangirai and his wife headed to his hometown of Buhera , south of the capital , Harare , his spokesman said .

The couple , who were married in 1978 , have six children , according to the British Broadcasting Corporation .

Last month , Susan Tsvangirai told a BBC affiliate that the past decade had been an `` endurance test '' for her husband and his MDC colleagues .

`` People went through hell , but they stuck to their ideals to seek change through democratic means , '' she said . `` This was a struggle that we endured with MDC cadres , activists , supporters and peace-loving Zimbabweans .

`` To them I say thank you so much for the support they gave the MDC to reach this momentous period . ''

A former miner and union organizer , Morgan Tsvangirai first ran for president in 2002 against Mugabe , who has been the country 's leader since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1980 .

Since then , Tsvangirai has been charged with treason twice and accused of plotting to assassinate Mugabe . Tsvangirai was arrested and allegedly beaten in 2007 . The criminal charges against him were dropped .
