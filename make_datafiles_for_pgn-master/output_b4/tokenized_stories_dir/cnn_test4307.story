-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An elderly grandfather was greeted with hugs and kisses from his family in Washington state after returning home from months of what he called false imprisonment in a Mexican prison .

Ed Chrisman 's wheelchair was pushed toward his cheering family members Monday at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for the highly anticipated reunion , CNN television affiliate KOMO reported .

The 88-year-old 's ordeal began in January , when he went to Mexico with grandson Gary Chrisman Jr. for inexpensive dental work , family members said .

The pair ran into trouble in Algodones , Mexico . At a convenience store , the younger Chrisman went inside to buy soft drinks while his grandfather waited in the car .

The younger Chrisman had been photographing the area and approached a woman in the store about snapping shots of her daughters . He offered them $ 25 ; they agreed , and he took a few pictures of the teenagers ' faces .

At that point , the Chrisman family says , the mother demanded more money from Gary Chrisman , he refused , and she called authorities , alleging that he had tried taking pornographic pictures of her daughters .

Both men were arrested , but the police report does not say why the elder Chrisman was arrested .

A Mexican judge ruled that Ed Chrisman could be released based on his age and health , KOMO reported .

The grandson remains in a Mexican jail , awaiting trial .

Ed Chrisman , of Arlington , Washington , was released in early March . But he caught the flu in jail and was recovering in Arizona .

He described wretched conditions in jail , family members said , including rats that were large enough to drag away a guard dog 's puppies .

`` It was really rough going to prison when you had never been there before , '' Chrisman told KOMO . `` Without any facilities . Without any food for three days . Or water . Or anything . ''
