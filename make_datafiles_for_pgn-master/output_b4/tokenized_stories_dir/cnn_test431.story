Concord , New Hampshire -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Republican Scott Brown used the latest potential Ebola case -- this time , a doctor in New York -- to blast President Barack Obama 's handling of the virus outbreak in a debate against New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen Thursday night .

It was a local debate that turned on national issues as Brown called for a ban on travel from the West African epicenter of the outbreak and defended his suggestion that Ebola could come across the border with Mexico .

He blasted Obama 's appointment of Ron Klain as the nation 's Ebola response coordinator as someone `` with no experience in his field . '' He criticized Shaheen for not voting to close the U.S. border with Mexico . And he complained that the New York doctor should have been quarantined when he returned to the United States .

Brown even said the Ebola threat would be minimized if Republican Mitt Romney had been elected president .

`` Had he been president , I feel he would have had a clear and concise plan . He would have reassured the American people , '' Brown said .

Shaheen , meanwhile , criticized Brown for `` fear-mongering about this issue , '' and said neither she nor Brown have medical expertise on the issue .

But Brown shot back that `` she calls it fear-mongering ; I call it rational fear . ''

The exchange -- in a debate being moderated by CNN 's Wolf Blitzer and held at the NH1 studios in New Hampshire 's capital city of Concord -- was the latest demonstration of Brown 's effort to nationalize the race -- connecting Shaheen to Obama and national Democrats and accusing them of wobbly responses to threats that have emerged this summer and fall .

Brown has focused his campaign on national issues , also blasting President Barack Obama for his handling of ISIS , illegal immigration and a host of other issues -- then latching Shaheen to Obama by pointing to her votes for his initiatives .

Shaheen , meanwhile , has questioned the former Massachusetts senator 's move into New Hampshire , casting him as a political opportunist and accusing him of being vague on his support for abortion rights , equal pay for women and more .

The two have both dodged answers about whether they would support their parties ' leaders -- Democrat Harry Reid and Republican Mitch McConnell -- for majority leader .

Entering Thursday night 's debate , the race was a dead heat . A new CNN/ORC International poll found Shaheen with 49 percent support to Brown 's 47 percent -- well inside its margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points .

Brown 's favorability rating was underwater , with 50 percent of the likely voters surveyed

saying they have unfavorable views of him versus 48 percent saying their views are favorable . Shaheen , meanwhile , scored a 52 percent favorability rating .

However , the race could turn on whether Shaheen is able to keep on her side voters who

have turned on Obama . His approval rating dropped to 39 percent in New Hampshire -- which has driven Brown 's efforts to connect Shaheen with the president .

It was what dozens of supporters of both candidates were talking about while cheering and chanting for their favored candidates outside the NH1 studio before the debate started .

Alice Chamberlin , a 64-year-old environmental lawyer from Warner who stopped by to pick up a pro-Shaheen sign before the debate , said some voters are turned off by Brown 's approach .

`` I think you can talk about the national issues all you want . People get that Scott Brown is just using us for a national stage , '' she said .

She pointed to Shaheen 's support for equal pay and access to health care as issues that will help drive Democratic-leaning voters to the polls , and praised Shaheen 's deep political ties to New Hampshire , including her three two-year terms as governor .

`` We who have lived here for a long time -- and I 've lived here since 1976 -- know what she 's done , '' she said in a veiled shot at Brown , the former Massachusetts senator .

Brown supporters said he has more than enough connections to the state .

`` I think anybody that was born in this state has every state to run for Senate in the state that they were born in , '' said Paul Schibbelhute , a 59-year-old mechanical engineer from Nashua who said he had crossed into Massachusetts in 2010 to volunteer for Brown 's campaign there .

He said the `` biggest issue '' in the race is that Shaheen has backed Obama 's policies in the vast majority of her Senate votes , calling her `` carte blanche for the president . ''
