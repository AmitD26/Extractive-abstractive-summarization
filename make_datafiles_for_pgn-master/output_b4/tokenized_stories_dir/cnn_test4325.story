Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Anti-Gadhafi forces Saturday claimed a new military advance into the deposed Libyan dictator 's hometown Sirte , while a fuel storage warehouse fire at the port of the country 's capital city Tripoli in the west sent plumes of smoke into the air .

National Transitional Council forces took a neighborhood previously held by remnants still loyal to Moammar Gadhafi , according to a spokesman . Twenty-four hours of NATO aerial bombardments preceded the advance .

The western military alliance `` struck a series of targets -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- forces used in order to threaten the civilian population of Sirte , '' NATO said in a statement .

`` Among the reports emerging from Sirte are executions , hostage-taking , and the calculated targeting of individuals , families , and communities within the city , '' according to NATO , which also pointed to the involvement of mercenaries on the pro-Gadhafi side and denial of civilian access to food , water and medical care .

Targets included a munitions stash , a command post and three large guns .

During the advance , NTC fighters `` removed all the Gadhafi loyalists ' checkpoints in that area , allowing for more revolutionaries to enter the town for the first time , '' said spokesman Adel Ghuleak with the NTC in Misrata . He said senior Gadhafi military members were in the neighborhood , a claim CNN is not able to confirm .

Thirty NTC fighters sustained injuries in the push , Ghuleak said .

One person died after a navy fuel warehouse at caught fire Saturday afternoon in Tripoli 's port , according to a local physician . Twelve more suffered smoke inhalation , said Dr. Tarek Abu Selim , from Tripoli Central Hospital , who was at the scene during the fire .

NTC security arrived at the scene and secured the surrounding area , blocking roads leading to the burning site and firing into the air to drive back dozens of onlookers . Journalists ' access was limited .

Sporadic explosions could be heard in the Libyan capital for an hour as the fire spread . The blaze has since been extinguished and the explosions ceased .

A fire crew sprayed water on a ship docked near the warehouse , but it was not clear if the ship was burning .

Libya 's NTC is to hold an urgent meeting Sunday to discuss the formation of an interim government , a senior council member told CNN Friday .

Mohammed Naser , the council member , said the formation of a government could take up to one week , but NTC members agreed that the interim government would include a premier , a vice premier , and 22 ministers .

Earlier in the week , Elamin Belhaj , a senior member of the NTC , told CNN the formation of a Libyan government would not be announced until anti-Gadhafi forces controlled the borders of the country and liberated three cities that still remained under loyalist control -- Bani Walid , Sirte and Sabha -- a task that could take up to one month , he said .

The NTC , he said , will expand as cities are liberated in order to give representation to all regions of the country . Ultimately , the council could have approximately 80 members ; it currently has 43 .

Elections for a National Congress is slated to take place in eight months . At the creation of the congress , the interim government will cease to exist .
