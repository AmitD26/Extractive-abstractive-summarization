-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man is nothing if not mercurial .

John McAfee , the American tech mogul fighting deportation to Belize , where authorities want to question him about the killing of a neighbor , said late Sunday that he wants to return to the United States .

He spoke to reporters via a Ustream video from an immigration detention center in Guatemala City . McAfee emerged in that capital to ask for asylum last week , after weeks of living in hiding . His bid was rejected , but a Guatemalan judge granted a stay of deportation .

`` Our intent is to return to America , if at all possible , and settle down to whatever normal life we can settle down to under the circumstances , '' said McAfee . `` There is no hope for my life if I am ever returned to Belize . ''

Authorities in Belize want to talk to the 67-year-old Internet security founder about the November 11 killing of his neighbor , American businessman Gregory Faull .

McAfee said he had nothing to do with the death and insists he left Belize to escape police persecution . He was taken into custody in Guatemala on accusations of entering the country illegally .

`` Let me be clear : I had absolutely nothing to do with the murder , '' McAfee said . He told reporters he `` barely knew the man , '' and that they had exchanged maybe 50 words over five years .

`` I believed then , and I believe even stronger now that the intent to question me has nothing to do with Mr. Faull 's murder , '' said McAfee .

He also explained why he was taken to a police hospital last week , the same day his asylum bid was rejected .

`` At 67 years old , well , your health is not the best no matter what . However , it is improving . The problem I had the other day is I did not eat for two days , I drank very little liquids and for the first time in many years , I 've been smoking almost nonstop . I stood up , passed out , hit my head on the wall , came to in total confusion , '' he said . `` I am fine now . ''

His legal team initially said he was treated for cardiovascular problems , though his attorney later said McAfee suffered a nervous breakdown and that tests had shown he did not have heart issues .

Sunday 's developments are just the latest in a story that reads like a bestselling mystery , complete with murder , poisoned dogs and international intrigue .

McAfee founded his computer security software company , McAfee Associates , in 1987 , initially running it from his home in California . Seven years later , he sold his stake in the company . He moved to Belize in 2008 .

On November 9 , he told police someone poisoned four of his dogs . To put them out of their misery , he shot each in the head and buried them on his property , a former girlfriend said .

The dogs ' barking and aggressive behavior had been a source of friction between the neighbors .

Two days after the dogs were poisoned , Faull 's body was found , fatally shot in the head .

`` He 's really gone out of his way to make the country look bad , '' Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez has said about McAfee . `` We just believe he should , if he 's innocent as he 's saying he is , he should bring in his lawyer , and let 's get to the bottom of this and say what he needs to say and let 's move on . ''
