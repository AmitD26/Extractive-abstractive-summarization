London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The deaths of two Western journalists Wednesday in Syria -- where at least three other journalists have been killed in covering the uprising -- highlight the danger reporters face in covering conflict zones .

Marie Colvin , a longtime American foreign correspondent for London 's The Sunday Times , and prize-winning war photographer Remi Ochlik , 28 , were killed in shelling in the city of Homs , the besieged center of resistance to President Bashar al-Assad 's regime .

Colleagues remembered Colvin , 56 , who lost her left eye to shrapnel while covering a conflict in Sri Lanka , as `` a legend '' and `` a class act . ''

Ochlik had covered conflicts from Haiti to Libya , and he won first prize in the 2011 World Press Photo general news category for a photograph of a rebel fighter resting in front of a rebel flag in the war-torn landscape of Libya 's Ras Lanuf .

The French Foreign Ministry demanded that Syria give the International Committee of the Red Cross access to Homs to remove the journalists ' bodies .

`` This shows how much the freedom to inform is important , how the work of a journalist can be so difficult , '' French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Wednesday . `` I want to pay tribute to them because if reporters were not over there , we would not know what is going on . ''

At least one other journalist , photographer Paul Conroy , was wounded in the attack , The Sunday Times said , adding that initial reports suggest his wounds are not serious .

The two journalists ' deaths come less than a week after New York Times reporter Anthony Shadid , a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner , died in Syria apparently of an asthma attack .

Colvin 's legacy is to `` live a passionate and important life as you see it , '' her mother , Rosemarie , told CNN . `` Do what you 're committed to , to the highest level you can do it -- because that 's what she always did . Overcome the obstacles that you meet as best you can . ''

Rosemarie Colvin said she never told her daughter to stop doing her work because `` it was the most useless conversation you could have had . ... From the time she was a little child , she was committed to doing things that were important . ''

`` She was a ferocious correspondent , and ferociously funny , '' said CNN 's Jim Clancy . `` I just loved spending hours with her talking about the people , the places and the stories . ''

The emergencies director for Human Rights Watch , Peter Bouckaert , called Colvin `` a legend among her fellows . She was always the first one to show up -- long before anybody else would arrive , and she really had a passion to report from these difficult places . ''

Bouckaert said Colvin had contacted him Tuesday about a story she had written for The Sunday Times , which requires readers to pay before gaining access to the website . `` She said , ` Please , put my story ... over the pay wall , and I will face the firing squad tomorrow at the paper . I do n't often do this , but it is sickening what is happening here . '

`` So , we posted the story on a private Facebook page for journalists , and another journalist commented that he was relieved that she had already left Homs . So her response , her last message to us , said , ` I think the reports of my survival may be exaggerated . I 'm in Baba Amr . It 's sickening trying to understand how the world can stand by and I should be hardened by now . I watched a baby die today . Shrapnel . The doctors could do nothing . His little tummy just heaved and heaved until it stopped . I 'm feeling helpless as well as cold . I will try to keep getting out the information . ''

Rupert Murdoch , the media magnate who owns The Sunday Times , said Marie Colvin `` put her life in danger on many occasions because she was driven by a determination that the misdeeds of tyrants and the suffering of the victims did not go unreported . ''

And John Witherow , the editor of the paper where she worked for more than 25 years , said Colvin `` was much more than a war reporter . She was a woman with a tremendous joie de vivre , full of humor and mischief and surrounded by a large circle of friends . ''

Colvin spoke to CNN about the suffering in Homs the day before she died .

She told Anderson Cooper that Syria was the worst conflict she had covered , partly because of the sheer amount of ordnance falling on Homs .

`` There 's a lot of snipers on the high buildings surrounding the neighborhood . I can sort of figure out where a sniper is , but you ca n't figure out where a shell is going to land , '' she said .

Colvin had reported from many conflicts , including last year 's Libyan civil war , where she saw the shelling of the rebel port city of Misrata .

She stayed in the city after many of her colleagues had left , she told the Public Radio International program `` The World '' in May .

`` It is very dangerous , I mean , it has to be said , and I think part of that danger is also the expectation of shelling . I mean , it 's very random , '' she said .

At 20 , Ochlik started photographing conflicts , first in Haiti , and then he went on to cover the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the presidential elections in Haiti in 2010 , and the Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt , Tunisia and Libya , his website says .

His work was published by Le Monde Magazine , VSD , Paris Match , Time magazine and The Wall Street Journal .

At least three other journalists have been killed in Syria 's nearly year-old conflict . France 2 TV journalist Gilles Jacquier was killed on January 11 when a mortar shell struck a pro-government rally he was attending as part of a government-authorized tour of Homs , his network said .

Syrian journalists Shukri Abu al-Burghul and Mazhar Tayyara were also killed .

Before the deaths of Colvin and Ochlik , the Committee to Protect Journalists said that at least 11 journalists have already been killed around the world this year .

CNN 's Hala Gorani , who reported from Syria last summer on a government-sanctioned trip , later wrote about the dangers journalists faced .

`` Away from the prying eyes of government minders , they risk imprisonment , torture , even death to cover the rebels , '' she said .

Why do some journalists decide to risk so much by reporting from dangerous locations such as Syria ?

These journalists are `` out there doing their job not for the glory , not for the recognition , but because they genuinely believe that truth is valuable and will ultimately end suffering that otherwise would happen in the darkness , '' said Al Tompkins , a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute , a leading journalism school .

`` These are places where we need journalists to be , '' Tompkins told CNN . `` They are there as our surrogates , because without their firsthand information we have only the partisan government reports to rely on . We know the cost of unreliable government information . ''

Currently , CNN and other media outlets often can not independently verify opposition or government reports because the Syrian regime has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists .

`` We know that the cost of sending journalists into harm 's way can be high , '' Tompkins said . But `` the cost of not going there is even higher . ''

With daily reports of civilian fatalities in Syria , some critics may question the amount of attention focused on the deaths of a couple of Western journalists . But these deaths may resonate more with readers in places such as the United States , said Kelly McBride , another senior faculty member at Poynter .

`` In these distant , remote conflicts , it 's so hard to know what 's really going on , '' McBride said . `` People actually appreciate the valor of independent journalists who do this work . ... That 's why people are so upset . ''

Tompkins noted that `` in any story when you can attach a recognizable name and face to a story , the story becomes more relatable . ''

`` This would be a day where it would be right for readers , viewers , and listeners to just to take a moment and thank the brave men and women who go to the world 's hellholes on their behalf , to find out what 's going and bravely report it , '' Tompkins said .
