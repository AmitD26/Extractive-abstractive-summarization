Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Texas GOP upstart Ted Cruz claimed victory Tuesday with a familiar tea party rallying cry .

`` Millions of Texans and Americans are rising up to reclaim our country , to defend liberty and to restore the Constitution , '' he told supporters .

Cruz claims victory in Texas runoff

A 41-year-old , first-time candidate , Cruz walloped the well-funded Republican establishment candidate , Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst , in Tuesday 's GOP Senate primary runoff . He did so by vowing to stand by his tea party principles .

`` Politicians cut deals ; principled conservatives deliver , '' is the way a Cruz television ad summed up his message .

Democratic Senate leaders reacted to Cruz 's primary win with a warning : If he wins the general election in November , gridlock in the Senate will be even worse than it is now .

`` Anyone elected to the Senate who starts off by saying ` I wo n't compromise ' is n't going to help us , '' Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin told CNN .

The tea party movement is a good foil for Democrats , but the reality is Cruz 's vote probably would n't make that much difference , because he 's replacing Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison , and she votes with the GOP 90 percent of the time .

Still , Democrats do have a point that Cruz , like any senator , would have a lot of power to grind business to a halt .

`` You know what the Senate is like , '' said Durbin . `` One senator stands up and says no , we stop the train , until we figure out how to bring that senator around . ''

And Cruz would n't be the only possible new senator willing to do that . In Indiana , Richard Mourdock beat veteran Republican incumbent Sen. Richard Lugar , vowing confrontation over compromise .

Lugar 's loss further polarizes Senate

`` What I 've said is , and what I continue to believe , certainly , is one side or the other must prevail . And I 'm hoping this candidacy will help move the Republican Party forward to become a permanent majority , '' Mourdock said the day before his GOP primary win in May .

The Senate was already bound to be a more polarized place next year because so many moderates chose to leave . Nearly half a dozen from both parties are retiring this year , including Sen. Olympia Snowe , R-Maine ; Sen. Joe Lieberman , I-Connecticut ; Sen. Ben Nelson , D-Nebraska ; Sen. Kent Conrad , D-North Dakota and Sen. Jim Webb , D-Virginia .

Snowe retirement a blow to Senate 's ` sensible center '

Still , it 's an open question whether tea party rhetoric on the campaign trail translates into action in office .

Ron Bonjean was a Senate Republican leadership aide for years , and he said history shows leaders can never be sure what rank and file firebrands like Cruz will do .

`` Ted Cruz is going to be a new voice , and he 's going to be a variable that we do n't know what to expect -LRB- from -RRB- yet , '' said Bonjean . `` He can hold everything up if he wants to or he can go against the Senate Republican leadership . ''

Two years ago , a handful of successful tea party-backed Senate candidates promised to hold their own leadership 's feet to the fire to slash spending , shrink the government and protect civil liberties . Sen. Mike Lee , R-Utah ; Sen. Ron Johnson , R-Wisconsin ; Sen. Rand Paul , R-Kentucky ; and others beat party favorites by vowing to shake up the Republican establishment once in Washington .

But once they became senators , uncompromising demands were rare .

Last year , Paul sounded off against his GOP leadership and held up Senate passage of a bill extending parts of the Patriot Act .

But , by and large , the so-called tea party threat of halting business to make a point did n't often bear itself out .

`` If you look at conservatives across the board , in the past year or so , there has n't been a whole sea change that we thought would happen , '' said Bonjean .

Sen. Jim DeMint , R-South Carolina , is a sort of tea party kingmaker . Much to the chagrin of his party leadership , in 2010 he helped defeat GOP candidates across the country that Republican leaders supported .

That streak continues this year with Cruz . DeMint told CNN the political action committee he started and still advises gave Cruz $ 2 million in addition to critical help with the conservative grassroots .

DeMint argues the more tea party movement-backed senators , the less gridlock .

'' -LRB- When -RRB- Ted Cruz comes in ... I think he can help empower some of the Democrats to make those hard decisions , '' DeMint told CNN .

The South Carolina lawmaker believes the more staunch conservatives in the Senate , the more Democrats will be forced to compromise and come the GOP 's way .

`` I think there are enough Democrats , if we have a strong mandate election , who will work with people like Ted Cruz and -LRB- Sen. -RRB- Marco Rubio and -LRB- Sen. -RRB- Pat Toomey and these senators here , in a sensible way to change the course of our country , '' said DeMint . `` The good news is this : because the rest of the world is in such bad shape , if we make a few hard decisions about fixing our tax code , fixing our entitlements so that we 're on a sustainable course , America could be the best place to do business overnight . ''

One thing is clear : if the GOP succeeds in winning back control of the Senate , expectations will be a lot higher and pressure on the Republican leadership will be a lot more intense not to give in on the `` stick-to-our principles '' sensibilities driving voters towards tea party-backed candidates like Cruz .

Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , is the man in charge of electing enough Republicans to the Senate to take the majority . In a Capitol hallway conversation , even he nodded and smiled in agreement with the notion that it 's a lot easier to coordinate and control the caucus when you 're in the majority .

It 's a problem he and Sen. Mitch McConnell , the current Senate minority leader , relish having .
