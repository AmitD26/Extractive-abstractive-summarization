-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 2-year-old who went missing from his home in Dewey , Arizona , on Monday night was found dead Wednesday , according to the Yavapai County Sheriff 's Office .

The body of Emmett Trapp was found by search and rescue personnel at 11:30 a.m. about one mile from his home , lying in a muddy pit once used to collect waste products from a former mining site .

`` We are just devastated by the loss of this little boy , '' sheriff 's spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn said .

The area where his body was found on the former Iron King Mine site is being treated as a crime scene , which the sheriff 's office described as `` common protocol . ''

The cause of death appears to be a result of spending more than 24 hours exposed to Arizona 's elements , Sgt. Jeff Newnum said . An autopsy was scheduled to be performed later Wednesday , he said .

He added that there was `` no foul play at Emmett 's body that would suggest something was awry . ''

Emmett was the second 2-year-old boy to go missing from Yavapai County in 10 days .

His case is believed to be unrelated to the disappearance of Sylar Newton -- another 2-year-old who went missing July 25 from a camping site in Rimrock and is presumed dead , D'Evelyn said Tuesday .

Emmett was reported missing by his mother at 8 p.m. Monday , the sheriff 's office said in a news release .

The mother told authorities that she and her four children were at their home in the Dewey-Humboldt area , about 80 miles north of Phoenix . When the mother awoke from a nap Monday evening , Emmett -- last seen wearing a pajama top , diaper and no shoes -- was missing .

The family dog had also apparently wandered off with Emmett , but returned when called . The mother told police she searched around the home and immediate area without success .

Newnum said the door to the house was unlocked at the time of Emmett 's disappearance , and it appears the boy walked as many four miles , crossing hilly , rough terrain , before he was found .

Newnum credited the muddy terrain in the area with helping find Emmett . He said the small footprints around the site indicate the boy `` was by himself . ''
