United Nations -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Last year , the U.N. Security Council authorized `` all necessary measures '' to stop the violence when the nation in question was Libya . It has come nowhere close to that on Syria , where the United Nations estimates more than 5,000 people have been killed since March . Why ?

Diplomats say the answer is simple : Russia . Tensions between Russia and the other permanent members of the Security Council have always been a factor . But diplomats say that Russia 's conduct in its refusal to condemn Syria , or even negotiate on resolutions in good faith , have reached new lows .

At this point , the only way Western diplomats believe the Security Council will be able to pass a resolution on Syria is with a request for intervention from the Arab League . Russia and China abstained from the vote on Libya after the Arab League and the African Union requested UN involvement in that country .

In October , Russia and China issued a rare double veto of a sanction-less resolution that would have condemned the violence in Syria .

Though China joined Russia in its veto on Syria , and India , Brazil and South Africa abstained , diplomats say that it is Russia that has been taking the lead in opposition to action .

In Russia 's view , NATO overstepped the Security Council 's mandate in Libya , and they fear a similar mistake being made in Syria . Though Western diplomats insist they have not proposed anything approaching military intervention , Russia insists that the Syria crisis should be solved internally .

`` I think Libya has been beat to death , overused and misused as an excuse for countries not to take up their responsibilities with respect to Syria , '' Susan Rice , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said .

Last month , Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin pushed the Security Council to open an investigation into civilian deaths in Libya . European and American diplomats immediately called foul .

`` Is everybody sufficiently distracted from Syria now ? '' Rice asked the media after a meeting called by Russia . `` Let us see this for what it is . That this is duplicative , it 's redundant , it 's superfluous , and it 's a stunt . ''

`` This is not the kind of issue which can be drowned in expletives , '' Churkin countered the next day . `` You can not beat a Stanford education , can you ? '' referring to Rice 's alma mater , saying she should be `` more Victorian . ''

Shortly thereafter , Rice 's communications director tweeted a picture of Churkin 's face superimposed on the Grinch , with the text `` rough day at the Security Council . '' -LRB- Churkin later said that he `` thought it was a nice joke . '' -RRB-

Despite Rice 's high-profile tit-for-tat with Churkin , it is the four European countries on the Security Council , not the United States , that have taken the lead on issues Libya and Syria .

Those countries -- France , Germany , Portugal and the United Kingdom -- have expressed deep frustration at Russia 's scuttling of attempts at a resolution .

In December , Russia held the rotating presidency of the council , which gave it significant power to determine the agenda . Diplomats complained of having to fight tooth and nail for even routine briefings .

A senior Western diplomat said that Churkin routinely interrupted other diplomats and cut off debate . Churkin 's conduct was `` outrageous '' and `` disrespectful , '' the diplomat said , who had `` never seen anything like the atmosphere in the Security Council now . ''

Western Diplomats admit that Russia has been using its close relationship with Syria to apply pressure on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . But their criticism of Churkin 's conduct at the Security Council is unequivocal .

`` Churkin is practicing shoe diplomacy , '' another senior Western diplomat said , referring to Soviet Premier Nikita Krushchev 's famous shoe-banging speech in the General Assembly .

`` Russia and Syria are the last two members of the Warsaw Pact , and Russia is behaving in an imperialistic manner , '' another Western diplomat said .

Churkin does not disagree that the mood is contentious . But he says that the root cause is a `` my way or the highway '' attitude . He called December the toughest of his five separate month-long terms at the helm of the Security Council .

`` There is a lot of nervousness , a lot of expectations that things are going to be done my way or no other way , '' Churkin said . `` That what I need to have , I must have now . ... I think that if this trend were to continue it might seriously hurt the ability of the Security Council to work . ''

Russia surprised even its allies last month when it introduced its own draft resolution condemning the violence in Syria . Publicly , Western diplomats seemed encouraged by the move but privately were deep cynical .

Western Diplomats said Russia had expected the Europeans and Americans to reject the draft out of hand , because it did not include some of the provisions they consider non-negotiable . -LRB- And , for example , they say it drew an unacceptable equivalence between violence perpetrated by the government and violence perpetrated by protesters . -RRB-

Since then , Western diplomats say that Russia has not engaged in negotiation on their proposed additions .

They also complain that Churkin has misrepresented to the media the content of closed Security Council meetings . He claims productive work on the draft Syria resolution , they say , when in fact he has been stonewalling .

`` We are working all the time , '' Churkin said Tuesday of Russia 's draft resolution .

They have not held a single negotiation on the text since Christmas , Western diplomats say .

Western diplomats admit that when it comes to Syria , they are at a `` dead end . '' The only way around it -- the `` only game in town , '' as French U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud says -- is the Arab League .

The Arab League has a group of observers in Syria , who were sent there to gauge the situation on the ground . Their report is expected on January 19 .

If that report is unequivocal about the Syrian government 's culpability -- an outcome Western diplomats admit is a long shot -- then they may have enough political capital to push forward . And in-person briefing from the Qatari prime minister , who has been very outspoken on Syria , or the secretary general of the Arab League , may help to push Russia , they say .

The Arab League report , a Western diplomat said , is a necessary condition for action . But it may not be sufficient .
