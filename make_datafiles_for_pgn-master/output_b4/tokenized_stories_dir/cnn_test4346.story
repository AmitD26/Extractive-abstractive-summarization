-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Amateur Athletic Union kick-started a child sex abuse criminal probe against its former president when it gave Memphis , Tennessee , police the identities of three of his accusers , a spokesman for the group said Sunday .

Ron Sachs spoke with CNN hours after ESPN aired , on its show `` Outside the Lines , '' interviews with two men who accused Robert `` Bobby '' Dodd of abusing them in the 1980s , when he was their coach at a YMCA program in the southwest Tennessee city .

According to Sachs , the Memphis police had `` no reports from anybody '' about Dodd until the Amateur Athletic Union -- also known as the AAU -- gave them the results of their own , nearly month-long investigation last Thursday . The group previously claimed that it alerted authorities last Friday .

This included revealing the identity of a `` potential third complaining victim '' who was not brought up in the ESPN report , the spokesman said .

`` Only the AAU 's contact with the Memphis police triggered what we believe is now a legitimate law enforcement investigation , '' said Sachs .

In the ESPN report , Dodd 's accusers claim he sexually abused them in hotel rooms during tournaments when they were 12 to 16 years old .

CNN could not reach Dodd , 63 , who was dismissed from the AAU on November 14 , for comment . ESPN said it also had been unable to reach him .

Dodd is distinct from the legendary , late former Georgia Tech football coach who had the same name .

Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong has said that his department is probing the claims .

`` Although this case has its challenges due to the amount of time that has passed , it will be thoroughly examined , '' Armstrong said . `` And if the investigation reveals the law was violated , the person responsible will be held accountable . ''

The allegations were made amid child sex scandals at Penn State and Syracuse universities and The Citadel ; both men accusing Dodd told ESPN that the publicity from the scandals prompted them to act .

Detailing its involvement , Sachs said the AAU stands by its response -- including its decision to oust Dodd , hire an investigator and then contact authorities .

`` These -LRB- AAU -RRB- folks dealt with these allegations -- as brief as they were , as anonymous as they were , as salacious as they were , but lacking any specificity , '' Sachs said .

The AAU got `` cryptic , brief '' e-mails -- signed only as `` shrimp breath '' -- on November 7 , 8 and 9 -- that `` alleged , in a very general way , that Bobby Dodd engaged in child sexual abuse , '' said the spokesman . And on November 9 , the organization got two brief voice-mails along the same lines . There was no name or contact information left in either case .

Those messages were sent to the AAU 's compliance and general counsel office , and AAU `` officers '' were notified on November 11 . The board members , several of whom flew into Orlando , convened on the following Monday , November 14 , `` to confront then-President Bobby Dodd , '' said Sachs .

In that meeting , Dodd claimed he 'd gotten similar phone messages and insisted he was innocent , according to the spokesman , who said he 'd spoken with several AAU officers at that meeting .

`` Despite those denials , the AAU officers directed that Bobby Dodd leave the premises and leave his position -LRB- as president and CEO -RRB- for an indefinite period , '' said Sachs .

Under its acting president , Louis Stout , the AAU hired a private investigator to look into the allegations . Those findings were turned over to police earlier this month .

One of Dodd 's accusers , identified by ESPN as Ralph West of Miami , said he was 14 at the time of the alleged abuse . West said he was on a basketball team run by Dodd , who he said would sometimes slip into West 's hotel room .

West said he was talking publicly , despite the potential embarrassment to him and his family , not to `` gain anything '' but because he felt `` the guy should n't be around kids anymore . ''

West said Dodd abused him or tried to abuse him six times , including at least once in which he tried `` to put his hand in my boxer shorts '' while West was sleeping .

Asked how Dodd could have entered the hotel room on that and other occasions , West said , `` He had a key . He always somehow had a key to whatever room I was in . ''

West said he tried to find ways to keep Dodd out of his hotel room when they were at out-of-town basketball tournaments , saying he was `` afraid to even fall asleep . ''

`` He would push his way in the room and then end up , I 'd see , I would n't see him , I would hear him , he 'd lay at the floor of the bed masturbating , '' the man said . `` And you just lay there horrified . But you do n't know what to do . What , are you going to blow the lid off of this at 14 years ? All you want to do is pretend it did n't happen and not address it at all . You want to hide and bury it . ''

Another accuser , whom ESPN did not identify , said Dodd gave him alcohol before taking him to a bedroom and touching him inappropriately .

`` The last thing that I can really remember was him carrying me into his bedroom and I can remember him , you know , touching me in ways that I , I did n't uh , I did n't want another man touching me , '' the man said .

That accuser said he called Dodd on November 11 and confronted him . Dodd , he said , then apologized for the alleged abuse . The network said it examined the man 's phone records and verified an eight-minute phone call to Dodd 's number .

Both men said they had never reported the alleged incidents to police and had only recently told their families , ESPN said .

Sachs criticized the half-hour ESPN report for not quoting Stout 's video statement on the matter or others from the AAU . The organization , which has 80,000 adult volunteers involved in coaching and works with hundreds of thousands of young people , is asking outside experts to review its policies for protecting children , which Sachs called the AAU 's `` No. 1 priority . ''

The spokesman also clarified that Dodd told his successor , Stout , that he had colon cancer and needed surgery after his November 14 dismissal . Dodd allegedly asked that he be able to retire for medical purposes -- a request that Stout denied , according to Sachs .

'' -LRB- Stout -RRB- told Mr. Dodd to go focus on your health , go through this surgery and we 'll deal with this issue later , '' said Sachs .

Dodd has been back at the AAU 's offices one time since his ouster , contrary to the organization 's earlier reports that he 'd never returned . The occasion was a `` forensic audit '' that the spokesman called `` standard '' for outgoing leaders of organizations .

`` Bobby Dodd is no longer part of the AAU , '' said Sachs . `` He has no continuing role -LRB- or -RRB- involvement in their programs . There 's no contact with him . Whatever compensation he would have been entitled to -- accrued vacation time -- will be paid , and that 's it . ''
