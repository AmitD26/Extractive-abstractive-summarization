Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lindsay Lohan 's new lawyer has a white rabbit 's foot hanging from the handle of his Louis Vuitton briefcase .

`` That 's for good luck , '' Mark Heller said . `` Lindsay Lohan is a great beauty with tremendous talent and I believe that all she really needs in life is a little bit of luck . ''

A receptive judge , cooperative prosecutors and a good lawyer might help .

But after six drama-filled years through the Los Angeles criminal court system , starting with two drunken driving convictions in 2007 , Lohan may have exhausted her supply of those .

She has appeared in court at least 20 times before four Los Angeles judges who found her in violation of probation five times and sentenced her to a total of six months in jail .

The actress faces a March 18 trial that includes charges of lying to a police officer about a car crash , reckless driving and violating her probation for a shoplifting conviction .

Lohan did face a receptive judge at a pretrial hearing Wednesday .

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner is the same one who found her guilty of stealing a necklace from a jewelry store and violating probation two years ago . She praised Lohan for completing the terms of her sentence a year ago when she lifted her supervised probation .

Sautner retires next month , so another judge -- yet to be determined -- will preside over her trial .

There are two prosecutors , including one from Santa Monica , where the car crash happened last June , and another from the Los Angeles city attorney 's office , which is overseeing the shoplifting probation . While they 've not taken a public position , several media reports -- not confirmed by CNN -- have said they want Lohan to spend at least six months in confinement .

Heller , who met with the prosecutors for the first time Wednesday , said they seemed to be `` very much interested in serving justice . ''

What would justice be in this case ?

Past justice for Lohan has included less than two weeks behind bars in her six trips to the Los Angeles County jail . Measures to relieve jail overcrowding led to her release after just hours in all but one of those visits . Lohan did spend 35 days confined to her Venice , California , home . She also served about 67 days of community service , mostly working at the L.A. County morgue .

`` Justice always has to be tempered with mercy and jail is not always the answer , '' Heller said . `` When people find themselves coming before the court , there 's usually a very serious underlying reason and cause . ''

In fact , Lohan acknowledged her drug and alcohol addiction in past court appearances . She 's spent 250 days in five rehab facilities since January 2007 , including one long court-ordered rehab stint after a failed drug test .

Her father has been urging Lohan to enter rehab voluntarily ahead of her trial , hoping that would satisfy the judge and prosecutors .

Heller said it was premature for him to talk about a plea deal with the prosecutors since he just got the case file Wednesday .

While her previous lawyer , Shawn Holley , entered a not guilty plea on Lohan 's behalf two weeks ago , Heller did not go as far as to suggest to reporters that she did not lie to police or violate her probation .

Lohan took the bold move of firing Holley , who steered her through her many legal troubles over the past few years .

She appeared reluctant , however , in court Wednesday when Judge Sautner asked her if she wanted to replace Holley .

`` Today , yes , '' Lohan answered .

Sautner approved the switch to Heller , a New York lawyer for 44 years , with the exception of a five-year suspension from practicing law for bar rules violations .

`` This is not the most complex case we 've ever seen , '' Sautner said .

But it could send Lohan to jail again . Sautner warned her a year ago that any violation of the law could mean she would have to serve 245 days in jail -- the remainder of her suspended sentence from a shoplifting conviction .

While critics have panned Lohan 's recent dramatic appearances as an actress -- her recent portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor is exhibit A -- defendant Lohan has consistently delivered drama .

She caught a late flight from New York Tuesday night to be in Los Angeles for court Wednesday morning despite sending a doctor 's note that said she was too sick to travel .

`` Glad to see you 're feeling better , '' Sautner told Lohan .

`` Thank you , '' Lohan replied .

Heller told the judge that her doctor diagnosed an upper respiratory condition . `` In New York , it 's the flu , '' he said .

`` No , it is n't , '' said Sautner , who was an NYPD detective in a previous career . `` The flu is the flu . ''

Still , the judge overlooked the issue , even saying that Lohan does not have to attend future hearings or even the trial , since it is misdemeanor case .

Lohan proved she can still draw a crowd of paparazzi to court . Dozens of photographers captured her walk from the limo into the courthouse . And she was dressed appropriately for a media event , wearing a Chanel dress and her traditional red-soled Louboutin stilettos .

`` She will rise to the occasion and I think she 'll be fine , '' Heller told reporters .
