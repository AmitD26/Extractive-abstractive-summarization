-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Muddin '' in the neighborhood `` holler , '' bringing raw deer meat to a party and brawling with a neighbor after noise complaints -- `` Jersey Shore '' is so over . Welcome `` Buckwild , '' an MTV reality show that debuted Thursday featuring nine young adults from West Virginia .

Often stereotyped and sometimes forgotten as its own state , West Virginia is now at the center of MTV 's latest drunken portrayal of young people goofing off -LRB- and occasionally working -RRB- . The show uses subtitles in case viewers do n't understand some of the accents .

#Buckwild : 10 crazy tweets about the new show

`` You preyed on young people , coaxed them into displaying shameful behavior -- and now you are profiting from it , '' charged U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin , D-West Virgina , in a December letter to MTV asking the cable network to cancel the show .

That 's not likely to happen , though several reviews have panned the show . `` Not only is it another tired portrayal of Southern stereotypes , but it 's also inexcusably poorly executed , '' claims the Hollywood Reporter .

The state 's tourism officials seem to have shrugged off the stereotypes .

`` While some reality television programming is designed to excite , entice and generally entertain viewers , these types of programs tend to represent an extremely small segment of a population . This program does not represent our state or our citizens , '' the West Virginia Division of Tourism said in a statement .

The spotlight may help promote the state , as the `` Jersey Shore '' did for that state , despite the antics of Nicole `` Snooki '' Polizzi and Mike `` The Situation '' Sorrentino .

Much ado about `` Buckwild ''

There 's more to West Virginia than `` Buckwild '' suggests . Born of a group of anti-slavery citizens in western Virginia who would not secede with Virginia , West Virginia became its own state on June 20 , 1863 . The state celebrates 150 years of statehood this June .

`` West Virginia is looking forward to celebrating its 150th anniversary , '' said Jacqueline Proctor , deputy commissioner at the West Virginia Division of Tourism . `` Our state is steeped in the history of the nation and born of the Civil War . '' The state 's tourism website highlights the events that formed West Virginia .

`` These locations and other events off the battlefield not only influenced the war itself but the very shape of our state . Communities across the state are developing commemorations , reenactments and celebrations . The entire state will recognize the formation of West Virginia on June 20th . ''

An abolitionist state

The state has a long an illustrious history of anti-slavery activity . And nowhere is that more pronounced than Harpers Ferry National Historic Park . In 1859 , John Brown and his supporters attacked the U.S. Armory and Arsenal at Harpers Ferry , attempting to capture the arms there for a slave uprising . After being captured , charged with `` conspiring with slaves to commit treason and murder , '' Brown was convicted and hanged for his crimes . Harpers Ferry was also the site of the arrival of the first working railroad and one of the earliest integrated schools in this country , where former slaves were educated .

Where the Hatfields and McCoys duked it out

The Hatfield-McCoy Mountains of southern West Virginia take their name from the bitter feud fought between those two infamous families in West Virginia and Kentucky . The West Virginia town of Historic Matewan is located between the homes of Devil Anse Hatfield and Randle McCoy . It 's also where Sid Hatfield was buried . But the activities in those mountains do n't just appeal to history buffs . Dirt bike and ATV riders can find plenty to do on over 500 miles of trails included in the Hatfield-McCoy Trail System .

`` Buckwild '' producer : Show is n't like a train wreck

What 's old is new again

A National Historic landmark , the Greenbrier has been hosting visitors since 1778 . Located in White Sulphur Springs and surrounded by the Allegheny Mountains , the resort was renovated a few years ago and offers fine dining , a spa and championship golf course . Golf Magazine even gave the golf course a shout out in 2010 .

If you live in West Virginia or have visited the state , where would you recommend visitors go ?
