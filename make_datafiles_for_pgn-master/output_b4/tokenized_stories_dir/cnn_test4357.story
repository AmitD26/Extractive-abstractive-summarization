-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the winter of 2011 , Chris , a 23-year old professional poker player , was confident that his candidate , President Barack Obama , would keep control of the White House in November of 2012 .

But instead of ordering a few lawn signs or volunteering to go door-to-door for the campaign , he put his money where his mouth was .

Chris , who asked that his last name not be used out of legal concerns , bet a Maryland bookie $ 50,000 that Obama would beat the field , at that time the entire cohort of Republicans slugging it out in the primary .

`` I was very confident , '' said Chris , a recent graduate of George Washington University . `` No outcome is certain , but this guy was offering me 50-50 and I did n't understand how I can turn this down . The president , at the very least , was a favorite . ''

It is illegal to vote on the election in the United States -- the Maryland Attorney General 's office told CNN that instances of betting on an election are rare -- but that does n't mean betting on an election elsewhere is rare .

Just look across the Atlantic , where most betting institutions in the United Kingdom and Ireland have odds on all things presidential .

By the numbers : Presidential predictions

International odds makers are giving the upper hand to Obama . Most UK bookmakers this week , aside from a few outliers , give Obama 1 to 4 odds -LRB- if you bet $ 1 and win , you get $ 1.25 back -RRB- , while Romney is getting 11 to 4 odds -LRB- for every $ 4 you bet , you get $ 11 back -RRB- .

Paddy Power , a popular Irish bookmaker , is one such company . They not only offer head-to-head betting opportunities , but they also allow bettors to wager on state-by-state winners , Electoral College numbers and even the odds that Romney and Obama will tie in the Electoral College -LRB- only 25/1 at time of publishing -RRB- .

By the way , there are also odds on who would win the 2016 presidential election . Mitt Romney is the favorite , Paul Ryan , Romney 's running mate , is a close second and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is just behind Ryan . Donald Trump , the Republican business magnate , is getting 100 to 1 odds .

Obama getting better odds
Paddy Power , like most international bookmakers , has Obama as the favorite and Romney as the underdog in Tuesday 's election .

In the last few days , possibly looking to take advantage of the odds , a sizable amount of money has been coming in for Romney , according to FÃ © ilim Mac An Iomaire , a spokesperson for Paddy Power .

`` It is over a million pounds sterling -LRB- about $ 1.6 million -RRB- at this stage , '' Iomaire says of the amount of money that has been bet so far . Everyday , he says , bets of over 10,000 pounds -- or about $ 16,000 -- have become normal .

In order to set the odds , Iomarie says a group of bookies in Ireland comb through much of the same data that American political watchers read .

`` All the latest polls will be looked at . We also do a line in all the states -- so we watch the regional polls very closely , '' Iomarie said . `` Ninety percent of it going in is what the polls are saying . ''

Intrade is another popular Irish site that allows members to bet on the outcomes of non-sports-related events . Members buy `` contracts '' that stipulate what they are worth if whatever outcomes happens . For example , at time of publishing , buying one share of `` Barack Obama to be re-elected President in 2012 '' would cost $ 6.65 . By contrast , the same bets for Romney cost $ 3.38 .

According to Intrade , Obama has a 66.3 % chance of winning the election . Romney has a 33.9 % chance .

Intrade has become a website the political reporters and pundits follow regularly . When Obama 's chance of winning on Intrade began to slip , many Republicans took to Twitter to tout the downslide .

Like most betting sites , Intrade does not allow U.S. credit or debit cards to be used on the site -- a way to basically prohibit Americans from betting on the election .

Brit : Americans are too 'em otional '
Back at Paddy Power , Iomaire jokes that Americans may not be the best people to bet on their own election .

`` I know from speaking to American friends , they tend to have a bit more of an emotional opinion about it , '' Iomaire said with a laugh . `` When we are looking at it on our end , we are setting it very much based on polls and the money that is coming in . ''

The people betting , like Chris , see it differently , though .

`` Given how little is known by non-political scientists about how elections are determined , almost no one has a good idea about the likelihood about one person winning or not , '' Chris said . When you look at election forecasting models that `` rely on more economic data and less on polls , the percentage likelihood exceeds the odds that any sports book is giving . ''

One blog the avid bettor reads , he says , is The Monkey Cage , a blog about political science and politics . John Sides , a contributor to the blog and a professor at George Washington University , says he never saw himself as a prognosticator . `` I never thought of myself as giving a lot of sage advice that then you could make wagers on , '' Sides says .

But in saying that , he acknowledges that understanding the data and the historical trend of economic data can lead to `` educated guessing . ''

`` To the large extent , the inclination of academics is to look at systematic patterns in the past and derive what is going to happen in the future , '' Sides said . `` Maybe the information is useful , but then again , that perspective opens up the risk that this time is different .

`` It would be easy money if the election were n't close . But it is a very close election , '' he said .

Bettors like Chris remain strident , though .

`` It is a market that is malformed , '' Chris said . `` Whenever there is a malformed market and you know what you are doing , it is a reasonably good place to put your money .
