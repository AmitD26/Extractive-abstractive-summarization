-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A very nice married couple from Canada struck up a conversation in a restaurant where we were having dinner . At one point the husband said that , earlier in his life , he had played with some buddies in a rock band .

The name of the band , he said , was the Rock-Olas .

`` Like the jukebox , '' I said .

`` Of course , '' he said .

Rock-Ola jukeboxes were gorgeous ; they were icons of the early days of rock and roll .

`` Where do you think those jukeboxes got their name ? '' I asked him .

He assumed the same thing most people always assumed : `` Rock-Ola '' was a combination of `` rock and roll '' and `` Victrola , '' the storied brand of early phonograph-record players .

`` Nope , '' I said .

I had always thought the same thing . But then , years ago , I spoke with the founder of Rock-Ola .

His name was David C. Rockola . The whole thing was a total coincidence . Even before he started manufacturing jukeboxes , he had put the hyphen between the two parts of his name when he was selling coin-operated machines . He just wanted customers to be able to pronounce his name -- and the company 's -- correctly .

The couple to whom I told the story laughed , and later it occurred to me that many products we take for granted -- products so famous that they and their names are synonymous -- once started out nameless . There was the thing -- the product -- and then there was a need to call it something .

Take Snickers , the candy bar . When you hear `` Snickers , '' you immediately see the candy , almost taste it .

But how did it become Snickers ?

Well , the Mars family , who introduced the candy bar , had a favorite horse they owned . Snickers . So when they needed to call the candy bar something ...

Cheerios -- the cereal ? It was originally named Cheerioats , because of its main ingredient . But there was a problem -- a competitor was producing an oat cereal with a similar name . Thus : Cheerios . It has n't done badly .

How about Q-tips ? Everyone knows what they are , but what does the name mean ?

A man named Leo Gerstenzang , in the 1920s , saw his wife applying cotton swabs to toothpicks . This gave him the idea to come up with a pre-made cotton swab for use with infants .

The product 's original name -- intended to connote gentle care of happy newborns -LRB- this was in a different American era , with a different lexicon -RRB- -- was Baby Gays . But that did n't adequately describe the product , so it was changed to Q-tips . Q for quality ; tips for the cotton swab at either end .

What about Conway Twitty , the late singer ? -LRB- I know we 're getting a little far afield here -- Twitty was a person , not a product -- but he was terrific , and his name begs the question . -RRB-

He was Harold Jenkins in the 1950s , trying to make it big in the recording industry , and finding that `` Harold Jenkins '' did n't exactly translate to thrills and excitement .

So the story went , he and his manager took a map of the United States and put their fingers on it . On Arkansas and Texas , to be precise . Conway , Arkansas . Twitty , Texas .

Soon his records were enormous hits in Rock-Ola jukeboxes from coast to coast .

Next up : Weejuns , the classic penny loafers made by the G. H. Bass shoe company .

You know those shoes on sight . But the name ?

It refers to a similar kind of shoe that was worn by Norwegian farmers . Norwegians : Weejuns , for short .

You still along for the ride ? Let 's pull over to the Holiday Inn . One of the most recognizable brands on the planet .

When Kemmons Wilson first came up with the idea for standardized , affordable highway motels , he did n't have a name for it . His architect , Eddie Bluestein , as an in-joke , wrote , across the bottom of his diagrams , `` Holiday Inn , '' after the Bing Crosby movie about a country lodge . Some joke . Wilson liked the sound , which turned out to be a spectacular business decision .

Haagen-Dazs ? A made-up combination of make-believe words to make a brand of ice cream sound Scandinavian and inviting . The words mean nothing at all . Except huge profits .

Popsicles , on the other hand , started out as Epsicles , named for their inventor , Frank Epperson . When he applied for a patent , the product was officially titled the Epsicle ice pop . His children , though , called this confection dreamed up by their dad -- their pop -- a Popsicle . Pop 's sicle .

Taco Bell ? In California after World War II , a fellow named Glen Bell decided to sell hamburgers from a stand . He called his store Bell 's Burgers .

He had some competitors nearby : a couple of brothers with their own stand . Last name McDonald . The brothers had a splendid hamburger product .

Bell arrived at the conclusion that , when it came to burgers , he probably could not outcook and outsell McDonald 's . So he chose another food specialty : tacos . He tried a few names before settling on a variation of Bell 's Burgers , altered to connote Mexican cuisine : Taco Bell .

Space is growing short here , and there 's probably an outside chance that somewhere in the world today there is more important news than this . Quickly :

Nehi soda pop .

The founder wanted customers to understand that his soda pop came in tall bottles , offering good value for the money . Knee-high bottles , to be hyperbolic . In marketing , hyperbolic is good . Thus : Nehi .

May we slip just one more in ?

Dairy Queen .

Its founder , John F. McCullough , liked to proudly proclaim to all who would listen that the cow was `` the queen of the dairy business . ''

As a parting note , let 's give the last word to David Rockola himself .

He died in 1993 ; when I spoke with him , six years earlier , he was 90 . I told him that it must be really cool to be able to have a jukebox in his home -- especially one with his name on it .

No , he said . No jukebox in the Rockola home :

`` I had speakers installed in the ceilings of every room , and I had the wiring put in . But at the last minute , Mrs. Rockola said no . She said , ` You get enough of jukeboxes at the factory . We do n't need one here . ' ''

@highlight

He found Snickers candy was named after a favorite horse of the Mars family
