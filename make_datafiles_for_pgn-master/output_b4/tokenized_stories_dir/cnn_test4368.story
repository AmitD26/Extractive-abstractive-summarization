-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Politics can be a blood-soaked affair in Pakistan , and this leadership struggle is no exception . Dozens have been killed in attacks in the weeks leading up to this Saturday 's election .

And yet , this poll is expected to mark a milestone in Pakistan 's 66-year history : The first democratic transition of power . The nation has experienced three military coups , been ruled by generals for half its life , and it remains mired in near-constant political turmoil .

But the former government defied expectations by becoming the first elected to serve a full five-year term .

`` Despite all the odds , completion of the term is an extraordinary and historic achievement , '' Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf said in an address to the nation on March 16 , marking the end of the term and the start of the election season now coming to an end .

The government may have survived , but the country has lurched from crisis to crisis .

Here are some of the main developments from the last five years of political turmoil .

2008

The nation collectively mourns the death of PPP leader Benazir Bhutto , who is assassinated just months before the elections in February 2008 . The Pakistan Peoples Party -- led by Bhutto 's widower , Asif Ali Zardari -- comes to power on the back of a populace disillusioned with then-President Perez Musharraf . He leads a coalition with Nawaz Sharif 's Muslim League party , however the alliance collapses when Sharif pulls out after failed efforts to secure the release of dozens of judges put under house arrest by President Musharraf during a state of emergency in 2007 .

In August of the same year , Musharraf resigns as president , clearing the way for Zardari to take over the post .

2011

On May 2 , U.S. President Barack Obama announces the killing of Osama Bin Laden , who was living in hiding at a compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan . The incident underlines the often fractious relationship Washington has with Islamabad , whose leaders had long said Bin Laden was not hiding in Pakistan . Pakistan 's parliament adopts a resolution condemning the U.S. raid and Musharraf brands it a `` act of war . ''

In October , Pakistani businessman Mansoor Ijaz claims in an op-ed piece for the UK-based Financial Times that a Pakistani diplomat had him deliver a secret memo to U.S. Admiral Mike Mullen , who was then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . The memo , allegedly from Zardari , reportedly asked the U.S. to back him in the event of a military coup related to the U.S. killing of Osama bin Laden . The government said it had nothing to do with the memo .

In December , Pakistan 's Supreme Court appoints a panel to investigate the memo .

2012

In February , Yousuf Raza Gilani becomes the first Pakistani prime minister to be charged while in office . He 's accused of contempt for refusing to re-open old corruption cases against Zardari .

Two months later , Gilani is convicted and receives a symbolic sentence of custody for the duration of the hearing . He refuses to resign and vows to appeal .

In June , Pakistan 's Supreme Court rules that Gilani is ineligible to hold office . The court declares the prime minister disqualified retroactive to April 26 . Raja Pervez Ashraf is appointed prime minister after majority vote in parliament .

Later in the year , the Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for a series of attacks on Shiite Muslims . In the months ahead , militants stage further attacks against Shiites in an attempt to disrupt the election .

2013

In January , the Supreme Court orders the arrest of Ashraf over corruption allegations which one of his advisers calls a `` soft coup '' against democracy . Ashraf denies the claims .

In March , a caretaker government is appointed to oversee parliamentary elections .

March 24 -- Musharraf lands in Karachi after more than four years in exile . He faces criminal charges , and the Taliban vow to unleash a `` death squad '' to assassinate him .

He returns to face a lengthy list of charges , including accusations he illegally deposed and detained 62 senior judges during a period of emergency rule in 2007 , and not doing enough to protect the life of Bhutto , the country 's first woman to be elected prime minister of Pakistan . He denies any wrongdoing .

April 11 -- A candidate in May 's 2013 national elections in Pakistan is shot and killed by two gunmen on a motorbike . Candidate Fakhar Ul Islam was targeted on his way home from his office , police said . Islam was a member of Muttahida Quami Movement or MQM , Pakistan 's most liberal and secular political party .

April 12 -- Musharraf acknowledges his government secretly signed off on U.S. drone strikes , the first time a top past or present Pakistani official has admitted publicly to such a deal . His admission to CNN runs counter to their repeated denunciations of a program they long claimed the United States was operating without their approval .

April 16 -- At least 15 people in Peshawar are killed and 35 people injured in a suicide bombing targeting an anti-Taliban political party , hospital and police officials said . A bomber blows himself up when Ghulam Ahmed Bilour , senior vice president of the Awami National Party , gets out of a car . Bilour 's driver and two police officials were killed .

Meanwhile , Musharraf 's comeback hits the skids when election officials bar him from running for a parliamentary seat . He had been disqualified because he declared a state of emergency in 2007 . Even though he has n't been tried for that action , the move has been ruled an act of treason , making him ineligible to run for office .

April 26 -- An explosion in Karachi , Pakistan , kills at least eight people and injured more than 20 , Karachi authorities said . The target of the blast was a meeting the Awami National Party , an anti-Taliban liberal political party .

April 28 -- Five people die and 22 are wounded by an explosion in Orakzai , police said . In Peshawar , three people are killed and eight wounded , police said . Both attacks target independent candidates .

April 29 -- A man on a motorcycle detonates explosives near a police van in northwest Pakistan , killing at least six people and wounding more than 30 , police said . The explosion took place on a busy road in the city of Peshawar .

April 30 -- Gunmen kill a political candidate and three other people . During the attack in Balochistan province , men fire on a vehicle carrying Fateh Muhammad Magsi , an independent candidate , police said .

A court in Pakistan bans Musharraf from politics for life . The move -- which can be appealed -- is another barrier in the road Musharraf faces as he tries to get back into his country 's political mix .

May 3 -- Gunmen in Pakistan kill a leading prosecutor working on high-profile terrorism cases and an anti-Taliban politician and his son . Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali was heading to a court in Rawalpindi , where he was trying a case stemming from the death of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , who was assassinated while she was campaigning for her party in 2007 .

In Karachi , gunmen on a motorbike shoot and kill Sadiq Zaman Khattak and his 4-year-old son as they leave a mosque , said Zahid Khan of Awami National Party , an anti-Taliban liberal party .

May 5 -- Three people are killed and more than 30 injured in back-to-back explosions near the headquarters of an anti-Taliban political party in Karachi . The explosions , about 30 minutes apart , take place near the headquarters of Muttahida Quami Movement . One device is placed in a rickshaw , police said . The second is buried in the ground .

May 7 -- A blast near a political rally leaves 18 people dead in a Pakistan tribal region , a local government official said . The explosion occurs during a rally staged by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman group , a right-wing religious party with sympathies for the militant Taliban movement .

In Lahore , former cricket star Imran Khan , running for prime minister , was injured when he fell off a stage during a political rally for Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party - throwing even more uncertainty into Saturday 's race . He continues to campaign from his hospital bed as doctors say he 's expected to make a full recovery .

At least 16 people are killed in two attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province ; one attack targeted a Pakistan People 's Party rally , and the other targeted a candidate for the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman group , police said .

May 9 -- Ali Haider Gilani -- son of former Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani -- is kidnapped on his way to address a public meeting in the city of Multan . His younger brother is running for a seat in the Punjab provincial assembly .
