Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday that Israel 's announcement of new settlement construction in disputed territory in East Jerusalem was `` insulting '' to the United States .

The Israeli announcement came during Vice President Joe Biden 's visit this week to Israel . It complicated U.S. efforts to set up so-called proximity talks between the Israelis and Palestinians , the latest attempt to nudge the two sides back toward talking directly .

Clinton said the United States ' relationship with Israel is not at risk : `` Our relationship is durable . It 's strong . It 's rooted in common values . ''

`` But we have to make clear to our Israeli friends and partners that the two-state solution -- which we support , which the prime minister himself says he supports -- requires confidence-building measures on both sides , '' Clinton told CNN 's Jill Dougherty . `` And the announcement of the settlements the very day that the vice president was there was insulting . ''

The construction , announced Tuesday , will be in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood , in disputed territory in East Jerusalem . The Israeli Interior Ministry denies that the territory is in East Jerusalem .

Biden arrived in Israel on Monday , meeting first with Israeli President Shimon Peres at his official residence in Jerusalem and then with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . Biden emphasized the close relationship between the United States and Israel as he met with Israeli leaders Tuesday , a visit that also touched on relations with the Palestinians and Iran .

However , later Tuesday , after getting word of the settlement announcement , Biden said the United States condemned Israel 's decision to build 1,600 housing units in the Jerusalem neighborhood , calling it `` a step that undermines the trust we need right now . ''

The Israeli Interior Ministry said the construction plan was approved by a district committee , and the public can express objections to it over the next 60 days .

`` I mean , it was just really a very unfortunate and difficult moment for everyone -- the United States , our vice president who had gone to reassert our strong support for Israeli security -- and I regret deeply that that occurred and made that known , '' Clinton said Friday .

She added that she has no reason to believe that Netanyahu knew about the announcement during Biden 's visit but added , `` He is the prime minister . Like the president or secretary of state ... ultimately , you are responsible . ''

The controversy over Israel 's announcement came just a day after the Obama administration 's special envoy for Middle East peace announced that Israeli and Palestinian leaders had accepted indirect talks .

George Mitchell said Monday that the two sides , with him acting as intermediary , had begun to discuss the `` structure and scope '' of the talks .

`` I will return to the region next week to continue our discussions , '' Mitchell said . `` As we 've said many times , we hope that these will lead to direct negotiations as soon as possible . ''

Negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis have been stalled for more than a year , despite the Obama administration 's attempt to move toward a resolution of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict .

Under current agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority , Israel maintains full control over the West Bank and its borders while the Palestinian government oversees administration of major population centers .

Speaking at a Christians United for Israel convention in Jerusalem on Monday , Netanyahu said he welcomes `` the initiation of the peace process between us and the Palestinians . ''

`` We have been calling to resume the talks without prior conditions for almost a year now , '' he said . `` I hope that the proximity talks will soon lead to direct talks . ''
