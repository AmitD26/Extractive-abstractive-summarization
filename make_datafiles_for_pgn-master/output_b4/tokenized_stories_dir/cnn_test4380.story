-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a beautiful spring morning in Florida . I 'm standing next to my shiny new road bike on the side of a road , weeping .

Passers-by probably assume that I 've taken a tumble from said bicycle . They 're wrong . So why the tears ? It 's simple : I feel completely out of control .

When I was chosen as a member of the CNN Fit Nation Six-Pack I was thrilled . But almost immediately the fear , doubt and worry set in . In fact , my exact words to Dr. Sanjay Gupta were , `` I 'm so excited and a little bit terrified . ''

I soon settled into my new fitness routine . Each workout was challenging and , for the most part , served to build my confidence . I was running longer without breaks , I was swimming faster and I stopped falling over on the bike .

Three months later I boarded a plane to Clermont , Florida , to meet up with my teammates and coaches for a week of intense triathlon training . The schedule was ambitious , leaving me physically exhausted at the end of each day . But Coach April knew we could rise to the occasion , and we did so repeatedly during the week .

A few days into training , we tackled our first group bike ride . For me , this was the first time riding in traffic , and I was anxious . I was paired with Denise Castelli , a Fit Nation alumnus , and we fell into place at the back of the pack . When we took a right and headed onto the main road , I freaked . There was no paved shoulder . We were riding on the white line , and I had to trust that drivers would n't plow into me .

I was focusing on cycling , clipping in and out of my pedals and following Castelli as close to that white line as possible . Then she asked me to pass her so that she would bring up the rear .

My brain just shut down . For the first time in my training , the voice telling me , `` You ca n't do this '' was simply too loud to ignore . I pulled over and wept .

Instead of my usual optimism and tenacity , I was consumed by fear and the foregone conclusion of failure . I was terrified of how close the passing cars felt and how fast they seemed to be zipping by me . I did n't trust the drivers to see me , and I did n't trust in my cycling ability to be able to stay out of harm 's way . I had pushed past the boundaries of my comfort zone , into a place where I lacked control . That is not a place I 'm used to visiting , let alone taking off my coat and staying awhile .

There were other challenges for me during the week of training . Do n't get me wrong ; I had some amazing successes and workouts that just clicked . But there were times that the sentiment , `` What did I get myself into ? '' reverberated in my mind .

I quickly realized that my fear of losing control was jeopardizing my triathlon goal . Worse , it was robbing me of the joy of my journey . Nope , not going to happen on my watch .

So here 's what I 've learned :

1 . I 'm not alone . There is a ton of literature indicating that the fear of losing control is a prevalent issue . The toll that living in such a heightened state of fear , anxiety and stress can have on a person is also well-documented . A quick glance at a list of common phobias , such as fear of flying and enclosed spaces , reveals that a perceived loss of control is the root of most fear . Knowing I 'm not alone prevents wasting energy wondering , `` What is wrong with me ? '' and instead focuses me on changing my perspective .

2 . Desiring control is wanting certainty in an uncertain world . Folks with this fear are usually perfectionists . I need to accept that no one is capable of controlling the future . To break out of the anxiety-filled cycle I have to give up the notion that I have some superhuman level of control .

3 . Accepting that I ca n't completely control the future does not mean that I stop taking responsibility for my actions , decisions or thoughts . I can control my attitude . I can choose to rise to the challenge and genuinely try my best and be proud of that regardless of the outcome . I can make the best choices given the information I have at the time , understanding that nothing is certain .

So how do I quit the control cycle ? I have to be brave . I have to have courage that I am doing my best with the tools I currently possess and that will be enough . At the beginning of this journey , my friend advised me to `` lean into the fear '' of triathlon training . That sentiment rang true during my time in Florida .

I 'm proud to say that these hard-won lessons have served to galvanize my resolve . I returned from Florida more determined , more committed , more courageous . My first week back , I squeezed in two extra swim workouts and a yoga class in addition to my regular training load . And I have enjoyed every minute of it !

The joy has returned to my journey , and I do n't plan to let it get away from me again .

I know that when I cross that finish line in Malibu , it wo n't be the capstone to a perfect race because there is no such thing . But it will be my race . And that will be more than enough .
