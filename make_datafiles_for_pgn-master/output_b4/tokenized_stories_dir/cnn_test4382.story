-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of the busiest travel weeks of the year is upon us .

With the uproar over the Transportation Security Administration 's new airport security measures reaching a fever pitch , CNN has put together a short Q&A to separate fact from myth and answer basic questions about what to expect if you 're flying this holiday season .

Q -RRB- What exactly are the new TSA rules ?

A -RRB- When you arrive in the airport security checkpoint , you will be directed to either a traditional metal detector or one of the new advanced imaging technology -LRB- AIT -RRB- machines . Passengers directed to the AIT machines can instead opt for an `` enhanced '' pat-down .

Q -RRB- Will the checkpoint look very different when I arrive ?

A -RRB- No . The only noticeable difference may be the presence of the AIT machines , which are larger than metal detectors .

Q -RRB- Does every airport have the AIT machines ?

A -RRB- No . There are approximately 400 AIT machines installed in 69 airports nationwide . The rest of the country 's roughly 450 commercial airports still only use metal detectors .

Q -RRB- Does everyone go through the AIT machines ?

A -RRB- No . As noted above , most airports in the United States do n't have the AIT machines yet . And even if your airport has them , you may still be asked to go through a metal detector instead .

Q -RRB- What sorts of images do the AIT machines show ?

A -RRB- They show a somewhat blurred outline of the passenger 's body . Clear facial features are not shown .

Q -RRB- Is anyone exempt from the AIT machines ?

A -RRB- Yes -- working pilots .

Q -RRB- Is advanced imaging technology dangerous ?

A -RRB- There are actually two types of advanced imaging technology -- backscatter X-ray technology and millimeter-wave technology .

Backscatter technology has raised concerns among some experts because it uses small doses of ionizing radiation . Radiation experts say millimeter-wave technology poses no known health risks .

The TSA says travelers are exposed to less radiation during an AIT scan than they would from two minutes of an airline flight . In other words , according to the TSA , it 's safe .

Q -RRB- Is the use of advanced imaging technology a violation of my rights ?

A -RRB- It depends who you ask . Several lawsuits have been filed . One public interest research group is seeking a suspension of the body scanning program , arguing that the measures violate the Fourth Amendment and the Privacy Act , among other laws .

Courts , however , have traditionally given wide leeway for airport screening under the Fourth Amendment , according to Adam Winkler , a UCLA law professor who specializes in American constitutional law .

Q -RRB- Does everyone get the new enhanced pat-down ?

A -RRB- No . Fewer than 3 percent of the flying public are subjected to the enhanced pat-down , according to the TSA . Pat-downs are used primarily on passengers who set off either the AIT machine or the metal detectors , and those who opt out of the AIT machine . A few randomly selected passengers will be subjected to a pat down even if they clear the metal detector or AIT machine .

Q -RRB- What 's included in the enhanced pat-down ?

A -RRB- The TSA does n't provide an exact description of the new pat-down procedure . Passengers subjected to the screening , however , have indicated that TSA representatives have probed their entire body , including the posterior , crotch , and chest .

Q -RRB- Why is the enhanced pat-down necessary ?

A -RRB- `` It just makes good security sense , '' the TSA says on its website . `` The weapons and other dangerous and prohibited items we 've found during pat-downs speak to this . ''

Q -RRB- Am I going to be subjected to a pat-down in front of fellow passengers ?

A -RRB- You can request to have the pat-down conducted in a private room with a passenger witness of your choosing .

Q -RRB- I have a metal implant in my body . Am I more likely to require a pat-down ?

A -RRB- No . In fact , if you go through an AIT machine , you may be less likely to require a pat-down . A metal detector will be set off by the presence of metal inside the body -- potentially leading to a pat-down . The AIT scans the exterior of the body , and should therefore not detect the presence of metal inside the body .

Q -RRB- Are kids exempt from enhanced pat-downs ?

A -RRB- Children under the age of 12 requiring additional screening will receive `` a modified pat down , '' according to the TSA .

Q -RRB- What happens if I refuse to go through a complete screening ?

A -RRB- Passengers who refuse complete screening wo n't be allowed past security and could face civil penalties , according to a TSA statement .

Q -RRB- Will all airports have the new AIT scanning machines in the future ?

A -RRB- That 's the goal .

The new rules require passengers to go through a regular metal detector or a new AIT machine

If you set off the detector or machine -- or refuse to go through them -- you will get an `` enhanced '' pat-down

The new advanced imaging technology machine is generally considered safe

Only 3 percent of the flying public will likely need an enhanced pat-down
