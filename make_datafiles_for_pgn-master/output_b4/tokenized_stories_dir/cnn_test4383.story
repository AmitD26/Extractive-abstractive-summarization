-LRB- Parenting -RRB- -- Dear Mr. Principal ,

My son , Aden , started seventh grade today . He 's the one who often sits in his guidance counselor 's office because he 's too nervous to go to class .

Remember , the kid who got two days of suspension because he broke your `` personal space '' rule by touching another boy 's necklace he thought was cool ? I want a fresh start this year , so it 's time you heard who Aden is .

His trouble with school started early . He cried every day in kindergarten until nearly Thanksgiving . His teacher , on her last year after 36 with the district , put him at a desk alone , facing the corner . To keep us from figuring this out , she moved his desk back on open school night and parent-teacher conferences -LRB- during which she lamented his high-energy and `` incorrigible '' attitude -RRB- . We found out in May , when my husband walked into the room unexpectedly with a forgotten snack .

The diagnosis of ADHD came as third grade started . We gave him the meds , which his teacher appreciated . Still , homework was a battle . The teacher sent us notes , full of obvious tips she must have thought we were too incompetent to have considered , like setting up a homework spot and providing a snack . These rubber-stamp homework success tips did nothing to address the elephant in the room : the fact that a kid who reads at a level several grades below the one he 's in is not going to be able to do , say , the social studies homework which involves reading a textbook .

Soon the medication 's effects wore off . And the thing was , it was too late for any pill to make him love to learn anyway .

The next three years proceeded in the same way : We spent the first half of the year being scared by threats of his being left back , predictions of his never graduating high school if he did n't read more , even becoming a `` troubled teen . '' Then with spring came the state tests , which he passed , literally , by a point or two . I was mystified , considering that he flunked nearly every in-class test . I asked how this was possible , and never got a straight answer . We pleaded for him to go to summer school , and the answer was always `` He 's fine ! Summer school is only for the kids who do n't pass the tests . See you next year . ''

So we paid a tutor each summer . We knew she could n't work a miracle , but her unspoken role was to praise his efforts , something few adults did . We gladly paid her for that .

As his academic abilities floundered , though , his athletic abilities grew ; he was an all-star basketball player every year , MVP twice . At practices , the other moms would drop their sons off . I stayed for the hour and a half , all alone , watching . Do you have kids , Mr. Principal ? For a couple of hours a week , he was n't a problem . He was a star . Basketball saved him ... and me .

On July 4 , 2010 , we were watching fireworks when his head started twitching . Then his arm started jerking . The tics got worse and as the first day of fifth grade approached , he started grunting , chirping , and meowing . Tourette syndrome was diagnosed . The kids that year , having known him all through elementary school , were pretty tolerant .

At the end of fifth grade , I was finally able to convince the special education committee that a child who has never been able to read a single grade-level summer reading book is not `` fine . '' He was put into an inclusion class as he moved into your school .

The kids in junior high , though , were n't as kind as the ones in elementary school . He was bullied on the bus , called a freak . With all due respect , your `` zero tolerance anti-bullying policy '' is crap . A kid got off the bus at Aden 's stop , and then attempted to strangle him . He got two days suspension , after which he commenced taunting my son as if nothing had happened . Ironically , that was the same punishment Aden got earlier in the year for admiring that shark tooth necklace a little too closely .

And then , with your `` classes come first '' policy , Aden could n't play basketball anymore . As you know , no extracurricular activities if a kid is in danger of failing any subject . No exceptions , even for special-ed students . I lost my all-star point guard , and Aden lost the one thing that made him feel good about himself .

Maybe if he had been allowed some extracurriculars , he might have perceived school to be more fun , and tried a little harder . Just a thought .

Now you know the story of Number 49 on your special education roster : He looks like any other 12-year old boy : gawky , a little bedraggled , yet usually smiling , with braces . But he had a rough start and never fully recovered . He often says `` I 'm stupid , '' or `` Everyone hates me , '' and sometimes , `` I do n't care anymore . ''

Parenting : Could you be pregnant ?

In summer school last month , he got a 70 . A pleasure to have in class , they said . So there is hope . He 's not the norm in your school , but he 's one of yours , still . Please make room for him , and kids like him , in your policies and your attitude .

And if he 's still in danger of failing something come October ... can you bend your rule for basketball ? If we work together , we can prove that elementary-school teacher who saw him as a future troubled teen wrong .

But time grows short .
