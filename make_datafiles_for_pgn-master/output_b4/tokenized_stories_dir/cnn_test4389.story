-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A family facing foreclosure is anything but a unique story in these troubled economic times .

Daniel and Ebony Sampson with their children . `` It 's a personal miracle , '' she says of how their home was saved .

But this is a happier story of one family whose financial ruin was averted by the actions of a friend , the compassion of strangers , the networking power of the Internet and the holiday spirit of giving .

`` This is our Christmas story , '' said Ebony Sampson . `` It 's going to be told for generations and generations to come . ''

Sampson , who lives in Aberdeen , Maryland , with her husband , Daniel , and their two young children , has overcome more hardship than one person should ever have to face . When she was in the 10th grade , she lost her entire family in a horrific car accident . Raised by a grandmother in New York , Ebony eventually used some life-insurance money from her parents ' death to buy the home in Aberdeen , near where she grew up .

But in June , Daniel got sick . After several tests , his doctors concluded that he was suffering from salmonella after eating a tainted tomato . As a new employee of Bank of America , he had not accrued enough paid time off to keep his job as a credit-card account manager . Watch how the Sampsons ' home was saved ''

Suddenly , the sole breadwinner in the Sampson household was out of work . Though the Sampsons received unemployment checks from the government , the money was n't enough to make ends meet .

First came the shut-off notices from the electric company . Then one of their cars broke down . One morning , Daniel woke up and looked out his bedroom window and saw his truck was missing . It had been repossessed .

With no job , no car and no income , the Sampsons got another surprise : Ebony Sampson learned she was eight weeks pregnant .

The Sampsons returned home from church , where they are practicing ministers , on a Sunday in November to find a stranger knocking on their front door . He wanted to put a bid in on their house . Ebony told him their home was not for sale . The next day , the Sampsons were notified that they were facing foreclosure unless they could come up with $ 10,000 in the next two weeks to bring their mortgage up to date .

`` Once we received that letter , it was like , ` Oh my God , what are we going to do ? ' '' Daniel Sampson said . `` I do n't think anyone in their right mind would receive a foreclosure notice and not be rattled by it . ''

Somehow , the couple maintained their sense of humor . Ebony Sampson called one of her oldest friends , Jaki Grier , and jokingly asked her if she had $ 10,000 . Jaki told her , `` Sure , just let me open up my invisible purse ! ''

But then Grier got an idea .

A self-described geek , Grier started blogging years ago . Since then , she 's contributed to a magazine 's Web site and regularly posts thoughts and life happenings on her LiveJournal page . So , she published Ebony and Daniel 's story , along with a link where people could make a donation .

At the most , Jaki thought she could raise enough money to help the Sampsons pay a security deposit on an apartment after their home was auctioned .

But donations started pouring in . Within 24 hours , Grier 's blog had raised $ 1,000 , far exceeding her expectations . People started linking to Grier 's blog from sites across the Internet and around the country .

Attorneys posted legal advice . Others in similar situations offered sympathy . One woman sent a donation with a note that said she had just lost her own home but wanted to help anyway . Another woman wrote that she did n't have a car but would walk to her grocery store with a jar of change and donate it to the cause .

Yet another e-mail came from a woman who was unemployed , with no job prospects . She donated a dollar .

With every donation , the total raised ticked higher and higher on Grier 's blog .

`` Everybody wants to give to a charity , but so many times when you give to a charity you do n't really see where your money goes , '' Grier said . `` At least with this , you saw the little -LSB- donations -RSB- ticker go . I think that made people excited . ''

Four days after Grier 's blog post , she had raised $ 3,400 -- enough to repair the Sampsons ' car . That night , Grier went to bed ecstatic . The next morning she checked her PayPal account and was stunned to find the balance had ballooned to $ 10,900 .

In the time it took Grier to take the donation link down from her blog , the balance had reached $ 11,032 . In just five days , she had raised enough money to save her friend 's home . A Baltimore TV station , WBAL , caught wind of the story and put it on the air . Someone contacted Daniel Sampson and offered him a job interview .

`` It 's been overwhelming , '' Daniel Sampson said . `` For me , out of all the donations -LSB- we -RSB- received , it was a little kid -LSB- who -RSB- came knocking on the door early Saturday morning ... with a five-dollar bill in his hand . He just came up to the door and said , ` Here you go , mister . ' Then he just walked away . I was , like , speechless . He could n't have been more than 8 years old . ''

Now Daniel and Ebony Sampson will be able to enjoy Christmas much more than they thought they would just a few weeks ago . They say that once their children are grown , they 'll tell them the story of how one holiday season they came within days of losing their house . They 'll spend this Christmas full of thanks .

`` It does n't seem real to me , and so I just thank everyone out there that cares , '' Ebony Sampson said . `` There really was no hope for us . Then , out of nowhere , just the kindness of strangers , just people that came and , you know , provided for us . Jaki was our beacon of light that led them to us .

`` It 's a personal blessing . It 's a personal miracle . It makes you understand what the season is all about . ''
