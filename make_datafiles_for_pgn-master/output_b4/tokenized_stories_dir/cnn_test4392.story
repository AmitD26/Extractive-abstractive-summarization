-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A movement away from using chimpanzees for research is gaining speed . This month , a working group organized by the National Institutes of Health issued a report recommending that most federally supported chimpanzees be retired and taken to sanctuaries .

`` It 's not that the chimpanzee is not itself a valuable animal , '' said K.C. Kent Lloyd of the University of California , Davis , who co-chaired the working group .

But newer technologies , other animals and non-animal systems have been `` shown to address questions that we before may have only been able to address for chimpanzees , '' he said .

A 60-day comment period has begun on this report , and the public is invited to weigh in . After that , NIH Director Francis Collins will determine whether he will accept the report in its current form or make changes , Lloyd said .

The recommendations pertain to the 360 chimpanzees that the NIH owns that are currently either `` research active '' or `` research inactive . '' An additional 91 chimps eligible for research live at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio ; although the NIH financially supports their maintenance , the agency can not itself retire these animals , Lloyd said .

A separate group of 219 NIH-supported chimpanzees has been retired and is living at Chimp Haven Inc. in Keithville , Louisiana , or the New Iberia Research Center at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette .

Laboratory chimps get a new lease on life

Plans to accommodate additional retiring chimpanzees should begin `` immediately , '' the report said .

But the report does not call for the elimination of all research on chimpanzees , who share about 99 % of their DNA with humans . About 50 chimpanzees should be kept for potential research needs , the report said . They could all live in the same colony to minimize costs .

In December 2011 , the Institute of Medicine proposed guidelines -LRB- PDF -RRB- for chimpanzee research , stating that there is little anticipated need for these animals in research and that they should live in appropriate environments and social settings .

At that time , the Institute of Medicine committee highlighted two areas where chimpanzees could still be useful in biomedicine : creating a hepatitis C vaccine and developing therapies for cancerous tumors . Studies of chimpanzees ' cognition and brain activity may also fit the group 's standards .

The NIH accepted the institute 's report and established a working group to give further advice on how to implement those recommendations .

To gather information for the new report , Lloyd and colleagues went on field trips to various facilities to discuss with their experts what works and what challenges they encounter .

`` We were not there to inspect facilities ; we were there to learn and to be exposed to how chimpanzees are maintained in a variety of environments , '' Lloyd said .

The report recommends that chimpanzees live in social groupings of at least seven and that no chimpanzee should live alone for extended periods of time without a documented medical reason or social circumstances .

`` Pairs , trios , and even small groups of 4 to 6 individuals do not provide the social complexity required to meet the social needs of this cognitively advanced species , '' the report said .

Chimpanzees should have a living space of at least 1,000 square feet per animal and should be able to climb at least 20 feet vertically , the report said .

The Humane Society of the United States is happy about the report 's recommendations for chimpanzee retirement and for the standards of living conditions for the animals , although its ultimate goal is to end all animal use in research , said Kathleen Conlee , vice president for animal research issues .

`` It finally confirmed that there should be no chimpanzee breeding , which we were also very pleased with , '' she said .

Conlee said no U.S. laboratory meets the guidelines for chimpanzee living conditions described in this report . But Lloyd could not confirm this , as the working group did not evaluate individual sites based on those standards and did n't visit every single U.S. laboratory .

The report included the observation that smaller animal models have helped scientists make strides in highly virulent viruses . Mice , rats , hamsters and guinea pigs are among the animals that are increasingly used for the research of emerging infectious diseases . `` The availability of these models will continually raise the scientific bar for justifying the use of chimpanzees , '' the report said .

If the recommendations go into effect , they will have jurisdiction only over NIH-supported or owned chimpanzees . But there are other chimpanzees that are part of research in the United States that do not fall into these categories . The Institute of Medicine report counted more than 930 chimpanzees at U.S. medical research facilities as of May 2011 . Many are used for hepatitis testing .
