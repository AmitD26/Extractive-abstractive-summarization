-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the day Alisher Usmanov was named as Britain 's wealthiest man , his soccer club Arsenal overtook that of one of his `` rich list '' rivals in the race for a European Champions League place next season .

Usmanov , the English team 's joint-biggest shareholder along with American Stan Kroenke , is worth £ 13.3 billion -LRB- $ 20.2 billion -RRB- according to the annual Sunday Times table -- a rise of almost £ 1 billion -LRB- $ 1.5 billion -RRB- since last year .

Arsenal moved up into third place in the Premier League with Saturday 's 1-0 win at Fulham , putting Arsene Wenger 's side two points above Chelsea -- owned by Usmanov 's fellow Russian Roman Abramovich .

Abramovich is fifth on the Sunday Times list with an estimated wealth of £ 9.3 billion -LRB- £ 14.16 billion -RRB- -- a drop of two places . His team 's fortunes have also been sliding since last year 's Champions League success , but the Blues can regain third with victory in Sunday 's trip to Liverpool .

Defeat , however , could allow fifth-placed Tottenham to join Chelsea on 61 points if the London side beat second-placed Manchester City earlier in the day .

Despite moving five points clear of Spurs , Arsenal 's top-four hopes remain in the balance , having played two more matches than both London rivals .

The Gunners next face runaway leaders Manchester United , but the final three games are against teams near the bottom of the table .

`` We are on a strong run and we just go into the next game and focus on winning that , '' Wenger told Arsenal 's website . `` The next game will be Man United so it 's a good challenge for us . ''

Defender Per Mertesacker scored the only goal against Fulham just before halftime , as the home team had former Arsenal midfielder Steven Sidwell sent off for a rash lunge on Mikel Arteta early on -- his second red card in as many matches .

Arsenal also ended the game with 10 men after France striker Olivier Giroud was sent off .

`` He said to me that he slipped at the moment he went for the ball , and it 's confirmed by the television , '' Wenger said . `` I have n't seen it but he 's not a tackler .

`` He went over the ball and , knowing that Sidwell had been sent off before , I had no illusion of the color of the card . ''

Another club with connections to a man on the rich list took another step towards relegation on Saturday as Queens Park Rangers lost 2-0 at home to Stoke .

Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal retained a one-third stake in QPR after Malaysian businessman Tony Fernandes became principal shareholder in 2011 , but the club 's fortunes have mirrored his own .

Mittal had been Britain 's wealthiest man eight years in a row , but has dropped to fourth on £ 10 billion -LRB- $ 15 billion -RRB- -- with £ 2.7 billion -LRB- $ 4.1 billion -RRB- wiped off his value .

His shares in QPR may also be worth considerably less if the club returns to the second division after just two seasons in the EPL , despite having spent large sums on players under Fernandes -- that will happen on Monday if Aston Villa manage an unlikely victory against Manchester United .

Saturday 's defeat left the London club level on points with bottom side Reading , who lost 2-1 at Norwich , while Stoke climbed six points clear of the relegation zone after ending a run of six defeats and a draw .

It put Stoke on 37 points along with Newcastle -- who held eighth-placed West Brom 1-1 -- and Sunderland , whose 1-0 win over Everton was the second successive victory for new manager Paolo Di Canio .

Sunderland 's victory -- the club 's second since January 23 -- dented sixth-placed Everton 's hopes of European qualification , leaving David Moyes ' team two points behind Tottenham having played two more matches .

Wigan stayed in the third and final relegation place after a 2-0 defeat at Wigan , while ninth-placed Swansea drew 0-0 with Southampton , who stayed 12th .
