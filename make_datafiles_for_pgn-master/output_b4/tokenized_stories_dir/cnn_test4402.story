LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The decision of English Premier League giants Manchester United to ban their players from signing autographs at the team 's training ground wo n't affect the sports memorabilia market significantly , an industry expert says .

Sorry kids : Manchester United will no longer be giving autographs at their Carrington training ground .

The move to ban autographs was announced by Sir Alex Ferguson in the team 's match day program for Saturday 's 2-1 win over Blackburn Rovers at Old Trafford .

Ferguson said in the program he wanted to put a stop to memorabilia dealers using the autographs for financial gain .

`` I offer apologies to fans who come to the Carrington training ground looking for autographs , he wrote .

`` The problem is that we have had too many opportunists selling on signed merchandise . They are not fans at all , '' Ferguson said .

While the Independent Manchester United Supporters ' Association declined to comment on the issue , a spokesman from a Kent-based supporters ' club `` Invicta Reds '' said he was happy to agree with the manager 's decision .

`` If Fergie -LRB- Sir Alex Ferguson -RRB- likes it then it 's good for us all , '' the spokesman told CNN .

The decision comes at a time when the market for replica jerseys and other autographed football memorabilia continues to grow significantly .

A quick trawl of the UK 's version of auction site eBay shows almost 16,000 autographed football items for sale . These items include signed jerseys , cards , photos , books and prints . Prices vary greatly , however , a David Beckham Manchester United shirt was selling for Â£ 300 -LRB- $ 436 -RRB- on Monday .

Vice-president of operations at sportsmemorabilia.com , Mike Gallucci , speaking to CNN , estimated the autographed memorabilia industry was worth about $ 4 billion a year .

`` It has definitely been growing , it 's big business . In the past , people had n't realized the price they could get for some of these items .

`` The power of the Internet has changed this . However , with more players signing more autographs , the market is a little flooded with the items , '' he said .

Gallucci said less accessibility to players for some fans should n't alter the market too much as the items sourced from official routes were usually the most popular .

`` People who want a 100 percent genuine item will buy through a company where they can verify the authenticity , '' he said .

A spokeswoman for eBay said the trading of football memorabilia was very popular on the site and had grown in recent years .

More than 90,000 items had been listed in the last three months , and eBay had noticed `` a shift in people starting to sell their memorabilia on the site to make money , '' the spokeswoman told CNN .

In the U.S. market , players in sports such as baseball sometimes only signed autographed items on pre-arranged and contracted deals with memorabilia companies , Galluci said .

A 2007 Forbes magazine list rating the top ten sports collectibles ranked baseball star Mark McGwire 's record 70th home-run ball as the most expensive -- with an estimated value of $ 3,005,000 .

All of the top ten items on the list are baseball memorabilia . See the list here .
