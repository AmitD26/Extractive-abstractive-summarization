Lac-Megantic , Quebec -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Edward Burkhardt said he tried to get the people of Lac-Megantic , Quebec , to hear him , to try to understand that he had traveled to their town because he genuinely cared , he told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday .

The 74-year-old chairman of Montreal , Maine & Atlantic Railway wanted to answer any questions from officials and hear people out about the anguish they feel after a driverless train carrying tank cars oil rolled out of control , exploding in an inferno that killed at least 20 people .

At least 30 more are still missing , most them probably dead , Quebec Provincial Police Capt. Michel Forget has said . The blaze may have vaporized victims , authorities said .

Burkhardt expected that he 'd face raw emotions , but was surprised that so much anger was directed at him .

`` I 'd been told about it . I 'd been warned about it , '' he said . `` But it was worse than I thought . I thought people would respond to my willingness to come there . I mean , they were screaming about how I took three days to get there . ''

The tragedy occurred Saturday . Burkhardt arrived in Lac-Megantic Wednesday .

`` Well , the three days we had a dozen people on the scene and I was organizing all kinds of things that were necessary , '' he said . `` And I figured I did n't really need to be in the way of people there when they were trying to put the fire out and that sort of stuff .

`` I would wait till the dust settled to a certain degree and then I would come . That 's what I did , but this was not well-received at all . ''

On Wednesday , two middle-aged men shouted at Burkhardt as he spoke with reporters , calling him an obscene name and challenging him to walk into the heart of the tragedy .

One of the men , Pierre L'Heureux , told CNN he knew at least half the people who were dead or missing .

`` They should put that guy in prison , '' L'Heureux said . `` He 's a murderer ... he should be in prison . ''

`` People wanted to throw stones at me . I showed up and they threw stones . But that does n't accomplish anything , '' Burkhardt told CNN said .

Attempts to set up meetings with city officials and rescue workers were unsuccessful , he said .

`` I failed with all that , '' he told CNN . `` They were too busy . They did n't want to meet . ''

His visit to the town was `` designed to get a healing process under way , '' he said , but he was misunderstood .

`` Maybe I did n't present my case very well . But I 'm not a communications professional . I 'm a manager . ''

The executive with more than 50 years in the railway business told CNN that he could get `` quite emotional '' talking about the train disaster .

`` They talked about that I had no empathy , or no sympathy , and in fact I have plenty , '' he said . `` I can imagine myself being in that kind of situation and I also would be grieving and I 'd be very unhappy . I 'd be very mad about the whole thing so I certainly understand the need to vent . But it comes a point where it 's totally unproductive . ''

Burkhardt told CNN that that is why he has decided not to return to Lac-Megantic Thursday . CNN spoke to him in Sherbrooke , an hour and a half outside Lac-Megantic , the closest area with an available hotel room .

`` I 'm willing to come back -LRB- to Lac-Megantic -RRB- at a later date when maybe things are a little calmer , a little more settled down , '' he said .

CNN asked the railway executive what he believed was the cause of the disaster .

`` Well , there 's no question that it 's a brake failure on the train . The train rolled away . That speaks for itself , does n't it ? '' he answered . `` There 's no sugarcoating that . ''

`` What caused the brake failure is a bit complex it 's more than one factor , '' he continued , saying that the company is still `` trying to pull all the pieces together on that . ''

Burkhardt has said that the train engineer reported to railroad managers that he set 11 hand brakes on the train cars before they broke away from their engines . On Wednesday , the executive said he felt `` it 's questionable '' whether the engineer indeed did that .

`` Our general feeling is now that is not true , '' Burkhardt said Wednesday , adding that the engineer had worked for the MM&A for `` many years '' and `` had a completely clear safety record up until Saturday . ''

On Thursday the railway executive told CNN that the engineer is suspended , and Burkhardt has not spoken to him .

`` The investigation is continuing , but if we decide to bring internal charges against the engineer he 's entitled to a full and impartial investigation with his union at his side , '' Burkhardt said . `` We 're -- he 's got a big problem on his hands and we 're not trying to make that worse for him personally .
