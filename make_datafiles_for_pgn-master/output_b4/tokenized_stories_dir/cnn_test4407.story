-LRB- CNET -RRB- -- Coming from a company known more for its plasma HDTVs , the Panasonic TC-32LX85 is a pleasant surprise in the 32-inch LCD category .

Attractively designed and well appointed with generous connectivity , it is also a good performer overall , although by no means perfect . I was particularly impressed with the set 's color accuracy , which is something I really do n't expect from entry-level displays .

Compared with the competition , the LC-32LX85 represents a compelling value in small LCD screens when you consider its performance characteristics .

Design

Basic in its design , but simultaneously elegant-looking , the TC-35LX85 has a glossy black finish , with a 3-inch-wide bezel surrounding the screen on all sides . It is a small and unobtrusive television that will fit into just about any decor nicely . Side panel AV inputs are neatly tucked away behind the right side of the screen .

The remote control is identical to Panasonic 's current plasma line of HDTVs , with an excellent ergonomic design . It is on the large side , but slender enough to fit in the hand comfortably . Unfortunately , the remote is not backlit . The internal menu graphical user interface is also quite simple and intuitive to use and navigate .

Features

The Panasonic TC-32LCX85 's offers a fairly comprehensive feature package for an entry-level 32-inch LCD TV . Its native resolution is 1366x768 , or around 720p , whereas many higher-end models have a 1080p native resolution .

At this screen size , however , the benefits of 1080p resolution are nearly impossible to discern with moving video , whether standard - or high-definition . If you plan on regularly using your 32-inch LCD TV as a computer monitor , however , you might want to consider a 1080p model .

Picture adjustment options are OK , but not as extensive as found on the Samsung LN32A450 or LG32LG30 for example . Preset picture modes include Cinema , Game , Custom , Vivid , and Standard . Custom can be adjusted independently per input while the others can be tweaked as well and apply to every input .

Selectable color temperatures include Warm , Normal , and Cool . The Backlight feature may be the most important in terms of optimizing the panel 's picture , as it helps it achieve reasonably deep black levels when lowered from its factory setting .

Some dubious picture-adjusting features include Color Management and AI Picture , both of which should be shut off for optimum performance . AI is an auto-contrast feature that raises and lowers the light output of the panel depending on ambient room lighting . This ultimately makes black and white level a moving target , and both of these parameters really should remain constant .

In the Advanced menu there are two varieties of noise reduction , called Video NR and MPEG NR , and for high-quality sources both should be turned-off . Black Level should be set to Light for full shadow detail , although intuitively I would think Dark would be correct . -LRB- Panasonic always had Lighter and Darker settings that were intuitively correct at 7.5 and 0 IRE respectively in their DVD players . Strangely , for their TVs , it is backward . -RRB-

Connection options are generous enough on the Panasonic , although unlike most other small-screen flat-panel sets it lacks a VGA-style PC input . The rear panel does have two HDMI inputs , one component video input , one AV input with a choice of either composite or S-Video , and one RF input .

One set of analog audio outputs , and one digital optical audio output for routing sound to an external AV receiver are also on tap . Side panel inputs include one HDMI , and one set of AV inputs with composite video only , and an SD Card slot on the right side of the panel for viewing your digital photos . We 'd like to see a headphone jack on the side as well , but no dice .

Performance

The Panasonic LC-32LX85 is one of the better performers at its size in the entry-level , 720p-resolution LCD category . Color accuracy and black level performance are its main strengths , while color decoding and standard-definition processing are not .

I did n't have to make too many adjustments during the user menu calibration to get the little TV looking its best . Since there are no custom color temperature controls in the user menu , I simply chose the best picture mode -LRB- Custom -RRB- and color temperature preset -LRB- Warm -RRB- and then tweaked the remainder of the basic picture controls .

Afterward I was pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of the grayscale ; you can click here to access my full picture settings . For my comparison I looked at the Panasonic alongside the Sony KDL-32M4000 , the Westinghouse VK-40F580D and the Vizio VP322 , two LCDs and a 32-inch plasma respectively .

Black level : Blacks are reasonably good for an inexpensive LCD flat-panel TV , and deeper than either the Sony or the Vizio , although not quite as deep as the Westinghouse . The Panasonic also delivers the blacker-than-black video signals that many more expensive displays can not , which helps lead to improved shadow detail .

Chapter two of `` X-Men : The Last Stand '' showed off the LC-32LX85 's compelling blacks very nicely . This high-contrast scene takes place at night , with bright explosions going off to provide a good look at an HDTV 's shadow detail capability . There was plenty of fine detail in the background dark areas of the picture . The black areas of the picture were deep , rich , and inky , and the scene was relatively free of low-level noise .

Color accuracy : As you can see from the Geek Box , grayscale tracking in the Warm color temperature preset was impressive , and the primary colors of red , green , and blue also measured reasonably close to the HDTV standard , which is unusual even in some expensive flat-panel displays .

Color decoding does push red a bit though , so we had to desaturate the color somewhat and remove some of the picture 's punch . Colors still appeared vibrant , however , and skin tones looked quite natural . Chapter four of the awesome transfer of `` I , Robot '' proved an excellent scene to show off the Panasonic 's contrast ratio -- good blacks and whites creating a snappy picture -- as well as its accurate color reproduction .

Video processing : Unlike most modern HDTVs the LC-32LX85 does n't accept 1080p sources , so my evaluation had to be with all HD sources set to 1080i . The set lacks an aspect ratio that provides for zero overscan , which would be a bigger issue if it were a 1080p resolution panel , but really is n't a big deal the panel has only a 720p resolution . The video processing does roll off the high-frequency video somewhat , a common flaw with many flat-panel sets on the market today .

Uniformity : White-field uniformity was reasonably good on this panel , and that is saying something for an LCD . As you may know LCD display technologies , whether flat panel or projection , suffer from poor white-field uniformity . As a result you may see red and blue splotches in scenes that are primarily white like the ice in a hockey game or a movie like `` Ice Age . '' This Panasonic , while not perfect , was better than most in this performance test .

Standard-definition : The Panasonic is a mediocre performer with standard-def material . It did n't resolve every line of horizontal resolution according to the charts on the HQV disc , and as a result some images appeared a bit softer than normal .

It did a below-average job of smoothing out jaggies on rotating diagonal lines , and there were a good number of such artifacts in a waving American flag . The set 's noise reduction , on the other hand , was very good at cleaning up moving motes in low-quality images of skies and sunsets , and the set engaged 2:3 pull-down detection quickly and effectively .

PC : Absent a VGA-style PC input I attempted to test the Panasonic 's capability to handle digital signals from a PC via its HDMI jack . The best resolution the video card allowed was 1,280 x768 , which is short of the set 's native resolution , and there was enough overscan that important areas of the screen , including the Windows taskbar , were obscured . People who want a PC display should probably choose another set .
