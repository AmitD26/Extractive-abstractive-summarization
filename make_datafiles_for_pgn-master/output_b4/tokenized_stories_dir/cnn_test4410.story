Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When you consider the array of public men who have been forced , in one way or another , to come clean on their bad behavior , the list is not insubstantial : a president -LRB- Bill Clinton -RRB- , presidential candidates -LRB- John Edwards , Gary Hart -RRB- , governors -LRB- Mark Sanford , Eliot Spitzer -RRB- , senators -LRB- John Ensign , David Vitter -RRB- . And that 's just the top tier .

The bar has been set -- and it 's awfully low .

And by the way , many of these men managed to crawl right under that bar and survive , even thrive .

Eventually , they found there was just one way out -- owning up to their own shortcomings . Sure , it may have been due to legal pressure . Or political reality . Or both . But some discovered the public can be forgiving , especially if it believes you have something important to offer to the nation . Just ask Bill Clinton , now serving as philanthropist to the world .

So now comes Herman Cain , accused of sexual harassment by four women . He calls the charges baseless and defends his integrity . His political campaign and supporters have gone into full damage-control mode , scrutinizing the women . All predictable -- and reflexive -- enough .

But here 's the rub : Cain also tells us that the National Restaurant Association investigated the charges against him and found them to be `` baseless . '' If he wants to get this behind him , how about getting the facts out ? Give the association 's board permission to release the results of their internal investigation , if there was a formal inquiry .

Then , as they say , the truth will out .

And there 's another plus : The partisans and the interest groups will have to start dealing with the facts . And the public can decide for itself .

It 's not as if this predicament is new to us . Recall back in the day when Clinton was in the middle of the Lewinsky mess . Republicans were -LRB- rightly -RRB- outraged , demanding his resignation or impeachment . Feminist groups , by and large , remained largely on the sidelines or supportive of Clinton -- because he was , um , not a sexual harasser . Oh , and yes , he was good on their issues .

Now the tables have turned . Feminist groups are outraged by the charges against Cain and lots of Republican partisans are defending him , choosing to level their scrutiny on the women instead . -LRB- We 've come a long way , baby , in that some conservative women 's groups are criticizing Cain 's I-don ` t-recall defense . -RRB-

Conservative CNN contributor Bill Bennett sees the hypocrisy of those who raised the red flag about Clinton , but not Cain . `` For we who led the charge against Bill Clinton on a number of related issues to continue to blame the media or other campaigns or say it simply does n't matter makes us the hypocrites as well , '' he wrote on CNN.com . He is , of course , right .

And it is exactly what we are seeing , much of it from the Cain campaign itself .

When declarations of innocence do not seem to be enough , there 's the change-the-subject tack : How about fingering a leaker , say from Rick Perry 's staff ? When that 's denied , back off . Then take a turn , and start decrying `` anonymous '' charges . When the charges are on the record , take on the accuser . And when all else fails , blame the media . And the liberal `` Democrat machine . ''

Ah , it takes me back to the days when Monica Lewinsky was whispered to be a `` stalker '' and Hillary Clinton was taking on the `` right wing conspiracy . ''

But here 's what we learned in that case : The fact that Monica inappropriately bared her underwear to the president did not excuse his behavior . And the fact that Hillary was right about those who were `` out to get '' Clinton does not mean he was in the clear . It 's just not that simple .

The voters will figure it all out , as always . The bar may be set low for the politicians , but the public somehow manages to rise above it .
