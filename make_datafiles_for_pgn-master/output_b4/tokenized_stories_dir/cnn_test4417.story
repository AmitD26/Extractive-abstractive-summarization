-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The world of professional cycling suffered another blow Friday , as Dutch bank Rabobank announced it is to end its sponsorship of pro cycling teams in the wake of the Lance Armstrong doping scandal .

Rabobank will pull its backing for both men 's and women 's professional cycling teams on December 31 , it said in a statement .

The company will continue to sponsor amateur cycling , including the youth training and the cyclocross team , it said . The activity is hugely popular in the Netherlands , where millions of people cycle routinely .

The bank made clear its decision was a direct response to the controversy that has engulfed Armstrong since the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency last week detailed what it called `` overwhelming '' evidence of his involvement as a professional cyclist in `` the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program . ''

`` Rabobank has come to this decision following publication of the report from the American doping authority USADA last week , '' its statement said . `` This report speaks volumes . ''

Rabobank -- a century-old business which began its involvement in professional cycling 17 years ago `` full of conviction and with a clear mission '' -- had previously seen cycling as a good fit with the company , its clients and its employees , it said .

But all that has changed since the USADA report alleging doping by Armstrong and the U.S. Postal Service team .

`` It is with pain in our heart , but for the bank this is an inevitable decision , '' Bert Bruggink , of Rabobank 's managing board , is quoted as saying .

Opinion : With Armstrong 's disgrace , will anything change ?

`` We are no longer convinced that the international professional world of cycling can make this a clean and fair sport . We are not confident that this will change for the better in the foreseeable future . ''

In its report , the anti-doping agency made public testimony from Armstrong 's teammates and others who said Armstrong was among team members who used banned performance-enhancing substances and tried to hide it from testing officials .

The seven-time Tour de France winner has consistently denied the allegations against him .

But a long chain of accusations trailing Armstrong has begun to erode support even among those who have steadfastly backed him in the past .

On Wednesday , Armstrong walked away from the chairmanship of the cancer charity he founded 15 years ago , Livestrong , saying he wanted to spare it any negative effects from the controversy surrounding him . He will remain on the charity 's board of directors .

On the same day Nike , which initially stood by Armstrong , dropped him with a terse statement citing what it called `` seemingly insurmountable evidence '' that he participated in doping .

Hours later , brewery giant Anheuser-Busch followed suit , saying it would let Armstrong 's contract expire at the end of the year . Nike and Anheuser-Busch said they still planned to support Livestrong and its initiatives .

The USADA report is part of its request to international cycling officials to strip Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles . The International Olympic Committee is also reviewing the evidence and could consider revoking Armstrong 's bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney games . Armstrong is already banned from competing in events sanctioned by U.S. Olympic governing bodies .

Armstrong has said he never has failed a drug test and has consistently denied participating in any banned practices .
