-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Cairo court Saturday adjourned the retrial of former President Hosni Mubarak over charges of involvement in the killing of protesters during the country 's 2011 revolution .

A judge postponed the retrial to August 25th .

Mubarak faces charges connected to the killing of protesters during the revolution . He was forced from office in February 2011 following two weeks of mass street protests .

His trial , which was adjourned last month , continued despite the latest upheaval in the country he ruled for 30 years . Protesters calling for a reinstatement of his successor as president , Mohamed Morsy , have battled with security forces for days , leaving hundreds dead .

Following a lengthy trial , Mubarak and his former interior minister , Habib al-Adly , were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were complicit in the protesters ' killings .

After appealing their convictions , they were granted a new trial early this year .

Six of Mubarak 's former security aides last year were acquitted of charges related to the killings , and Mubarak 's two sons -- Gamal and Alaa -- were acquitted of corruption charges .

But they , too , were ordered to be retried after Morsy , himself ousted last month , ordered a new investigation last year .

Mubarak and the other defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges . The former president made his first court appearance in May .

Mubarak has been held since his guilty verdict last year . After months spent in a military hospital , a public prosecutor sent him back to prison in April .

Mubarak 's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration . He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had maintained that he was physically unfit to stand trial .

He is also charged with seizing public funds and misusing political influence . In addition , he faces a corruption charge that was not part of the original trial . Mubarak is accused of selling natural gas to neighboring Israel for prices below fair market value .

The ousted autocratic leader spent three decades in charge of Egypt , the most populous Arab country .
