-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman who allegedly scammed nearly half a million dollars from a nonprofit fund benefiting the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings was arrested Friday , according to Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley .

Audrea Gause , 26 , was arrested in Troy , N.Y. , where she lives , on a Massachusetts fugitive warrant , a statement from Coakley 's office said . She is charged with larceny in Massachusetts

The nonprofit -- The One Fund Boston -- began distributing nearly $ 61 million to 232 eligible claimants starting June 30 , according to a release from the organization .

Gause was awarded $ 480,000 from the fund after claiming she suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of the Boston Marathon bombing .

Following a tip received by both the office of the state attorney general and The One Fund Boston that Gause was not in Boston at the time of the bombing , an official investigation began on Gause 's claims , Coakley said at a news conference Friday afternoon .

That investigation determined that Gause was not a patient at Boston Medical Center or Albany Medical Center at the times allegedly entered on her notarized claim form , the statement says .

`` She was stealing money from the real victims of the Marathon bombing , and from the people who gave so generously to help them , '' Coakley said on Friday .

The One Fund Boston divided payments up between four classifications that were based on the severity of injuries or loss of life , according to the fund 's statement .

More than 260 people were wounded and 3 were killed in the double bombings , which took place near the Boston marathon finish line on April 15 .

There has been some indication that there may be others involved with Gause 's fraudulent claims and the investigation is still ongoing , Coakley said .

Gause appeared in Rensselaer County , New York , Court for a fugitive warrant hearing on Friday afternoon , Capt. John Cooney of the Troy Police Department told CNN .

Gause was being held without bail in the Rensselaer County Jail . Her next hearing is scheduled for Tuesday , Cooney said .

It could not immediately be determined whether Gause had retained an attorney .

Coakley 's statement said her office , in conjunction with The One Fund , is reviewing all claims submitted to and paid by the fund .
