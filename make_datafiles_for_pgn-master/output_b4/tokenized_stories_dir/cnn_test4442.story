-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- The upcoming fourth season of `` Community '' may have a short order -LRB- 13 episodes -RRB- , may be on Fridays -LRB- with a `` Whitney '' lead in -RRB- and may have seen the exit of creator Dan Harmon . But that does n't mean it 's the final season , NBC brass says .

`` We 're in a transition with our comedy programming and trying to broaden the audience and broaden what network does , '' NBC entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt told critics at the Television Critics Association 's press tour in Beverly Hills on Tuesday . `` Those Thursday comedies , which the critics love and we love , tend to be a bit more narrow than we 'd ultimately like as we go forward . ''

'' ` Community ' has been a show that 's always on the bubble -LSB- to return -RSB- and we decided to bring it back again and see what a fourth season would do for us , '' Greenblatt continued . `` The reason we did 13 episodes -LSB- of Community and other shows -RSB- is we wanted to get more comedies on the schedule ... which is n't to say we could n't decide at some point to extend those seasons longer .

As for Harmon 's exit , Greenblatt said :

`` I think fans of ` Community ' are going to get the same show they have loved from the beginning , '' he said . `` Every so often it 's time to make a change with a showrunner ... you evaluate the creative ... sometimes you want to freshen a show and we decided to do that with ` Community ' -- no disrespect to anyone . ''

Asked if he would categorically rule out a fifth season , Greenblatt said : `` I would love nothing more than ` Community ' to have a following on Friday and be able to continue -LSB- beyond season 4 -RSB- . ''

NBC is premiering several new comedies this fall , including broad and wacky titles like `` Animal Practice '' and `` Guys With Kids , '' as well as potentially more risky shows like the Matthew Perry therapy sitcom `` Go On `` and Ryan Murphy 's unconventional family comedy `` The New Normal . ''

`` We 're in this awkward stage , '' said NBC 's entertainment president Jennifer Salke . `` Some of our new comedies might seem more commercial to you ... it 's kind of an evolving comedy brand . ''

`` Shows like ` Whitney ' and ` Up All Night ' were steps in the right direction and that 's why they 're back , '' Greenblatt said . `` It -LSB- can -RSB- take more than a couple seasons for a show to creatively find itself . ''
