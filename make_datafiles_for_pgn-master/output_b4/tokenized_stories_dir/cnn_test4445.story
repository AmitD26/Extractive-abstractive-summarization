-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dreaming of Africa is one way that Prince William escapes from the stresses he faces as the future king of Britain .

`` I regularly daydream , '' The Duke of Cambridge reveals in the documentary `` Prince William 's Passion : New Hope , New Father . ''

`` Africa is definitely one of the places I go to ... I have hundreds of animals on my iPhone . So if I am ever having quite a stressful day ... you can put a buffalo on in the background or a cricket , '' he says .

This may sound like a small , even trivial , detail but it 's a thought that may one day help define the British monarchy . `` It takes you back instantly to the -LRB- African -RRB- bush . And it does completely settle me down . ''

Prince William will one day be king , and he 's acutely aware of the responsibility that comes with that ; it weighs heavily on his thoughts . And even before he takes on that mantle , he 's grappling with the often unwelcome attentions of the world media .

Everything he does , or is rumored to do , makes a headline , somewhere . His fame has only been compounded by his choice of wife and the birth of his heir , Prince George .

There 's no suggestion that Prince William would ever drop out of public life , but he does crave normality . He needs a dose of it every now and then to cope with the maelstrom that surrounds him . The prince gets some of that normality from his role in the military where he 's treated as `` one of the guys , '' but he also gets it from Africa .

For William , Africa provides an escape that helps with his royal work back home : `` Its escaping to a kind of different world where I am just who I normally am anyway , and I can let that side , that sort of slightly immature , silly person come out a bit more than I normally do . ''

He enjoys the lack of airs and graces : `` There 's not sycophants or anything like that . You 're very much treated as one of the team , and if you 're not pulling your weight , you 're told to man-up and get on with it . ''

Prince William told me Africa first got under his skin during a trip to Kenya when he was 17 . He saw an elephant that had been darted : `` It just blew my mind really . It was being that close to something so huge , something so majestic and part of nature 's great wonders , and again its vulnerability , it was lying in the middle of the road just breathing away with its ears flapped over its eyes to shut it from the sun . ''

That experience , he says , made him realize how powerful we are as humans , and ever since he 's wanted to do what he can to protect Africa and its wildlife . This drive has culminated in his support for the Tusk Conservation Awards which were set up to recognize outstanding achievement in conservation on the continent .

Soon after his first visit to Africa , William heard about Tusk and became its patron in 2005 . He supports the charity by visiting its conservation projects in Africa and by attending fundraising events on their behalf . The charity was one of the first patronages he took on .

If you 're in any doubt about his connection to the cause , watch as he comes close to tears talking about Edwin Kinyanjui , who risks his life every day in the fight against elephant poachers .

Fatherhood has strengthened William 's resolve : `` Suddenly you start thinking of like , wow , there is stuff you want to safeguard for the future . I 've always believed it , but to actually really feel it as well , it 's coming through powerfully now as well . ''

For William , Africa is a very emotional place . He told me he likes to watch the sun set with a rum , reminiscing . His mother , Diana , Princess of Wales , is never far from his thoughts .

`` What I am doing in Africa is probably not as obviously , visually if you like , related to what she did . But helping communities , and helping Africans , as she has done , and did with communities over in the UK , and around the world ... it 's about helping the needy and the vulnerable . ''

His personal connection with Africa was sealed when he got engaged to Kate Middleton in Kenya in 2010 . He told me it felt appropriate : `` I did n't really plan it that far in advance , like I just knew I wanted it to feel comfortable where I did it and I wanted it to mean something , other than just the act of getting engaged . ''

William says it just happened on that particular holiday : `` She understands what it means to me being in Africa , and my love of conservation . ''

The prince is already planning his next trip , once things settle down at home : `` I think as soon as George grows up a little bit more . I will be hung if I go now ... It 's definitely a plan of mine to go back to Africa . I will always have Africa as a special place that I love to go back to . ''
