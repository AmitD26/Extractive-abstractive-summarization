-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The psychiatrist treating the accused Colorado movie theater gunman was so concerned about his behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues , saying he could potentially be a danger to others , CNN affiliate KMGH reported Wednesday , citing sources with knowledge of the investigation .

The psychiatrist 's concerns surfaced in early June , nearly six weeks before the July 20 killings inside a movie theater in Aurora , sources told the Denver station .

Twelve people were killed and 58 wounded when the gunman opened fire during a screening of the new Batman film . James Holmes , 24 , was charged Monday with murder and attempted murder in the case ; he also faces two weapons charges .

Why Holmes was charged in ` unusual ' way

A court document filed Friday revealed Holmes was a patient of University of Colorado psychiatrist Lynne Fenton before the attack .

Sources told KMGH that Fenton contacted several members of a `` behavioral evaluation and threat assessment '' team to say Holmes could potentially be a danger to others , the station reported .

The `` BETA '' team consists of `` key '' staff members from various university departments who have specific expertise in dealing with assessing potential threats on campus , the school says on its website .

Holmes was a doctoral student at the university 's Anschutz Medical Campus until June , when he withdrew from the program .

Sources told KMGH that university officials never contacted Aurora police with Fenton 's concerns before the July 20 killings .

`` Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team '' in `` the first 10 days '' of June but it `` never came together '' because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members , Holmes began the process of dropping out of school , a source told KMGH .

Sources told the station that when Holmes withdrew , the BETA team `` had no control over him . ''

KMGH said sources did not know what Holmes told Fenton that sparked her concern .

`` It takes more than just statements , '' one source told the station , explaining that Holmes would have had to tell Fenton `` something specific '' before she would have to report it to law enforcement .

`` He would have to tell her he had taken steps to make it happen , '' another source told the station .

One source also told the station that the team may not have been convened because while Fenton had `` serious concerns , there may not have been an immediate threat . ''

It 's not clear if Fenton continued treating Homes after he dropped out of school , whether she referred him to another medical professional or had any further contact with him , KMGH reported , citing sources familiar with the investigation .

Michael Carrigan , chairman of the CU board of regents , told KMGH he did not know if Holmes had ever been discussed by the BETA team , KMGH reported .

`` It 's the first I 'm hearing about this , '' he reportedly told the station .

Authorities have remained silent about a possible motive in the case .

Prosecutors say they will begin turning over thousands of pages of discovery in the next couple of days . The defense said it needs this information to prepare for the hearing .

During the week of November 12 , attorneys expect a preliminary hearing and an evidence hearing that will include several days of testimony .
