Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- AEG Live lawyers rested their defense case in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial , setting the scene for closing arguments to be delivered in a Los Angeles courtroom starting Monday .

`` We 're in the 9th inning , '' Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos told jurors Wednesday afternoon , the 81st day of testimony in the trial to decide if Jackson 's last concert promoter is liable in the singer 's death .

Katherine Jackson and grandchildren Prince , Paris and Blanket contend AEG Live executives negligently hired , retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray , the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter .

Murray , who is set to be freed from jail next month , did not testify in the five-month-long trial because he indicated he would invoke his constitutional right to refuse to answer questions while his appeal is pending for his criminal conviction .

While the trial has been held in a small courtroom with seating limited to just 60 by the fire marshal , the judge decided Wednesday that the three days of closing arguments will be delivered in a larger courtroom that can seat hundreds .

Lawyers for Jackson 's mother and three children will call two more witnesses before resting their rebuttal case Thursday . Dr. Allan Metzger , who treated Jackson for nearly three decades , is set to take the stand Thursday morning .

Jackson 's pain was real , doctor testifies

AEG Live lawyers played video of Metzger 's deposition testimony as their last witness Wednesday , but Jackson lawyers say they want to ask him questions not covered when the deposition was recorded last year .

Metzger said in his deposition that Jackson would `` doctor shop '' and that he kept details of treatments by other physicians a secret . `` Michael would never tell me what he was doing , '' he said .

AEG Live lawyers contend Jackson 's secrecy about his drug use made it impossible for its executives to know that Dr. Murray posed a danger to the singer as he prepared for his comeback concerts .

Murray told investigators that he gave Jackson infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol almost every night for the last two months of his life to treat his insomnia . The coroner ruled Jackson 's June 25 , 2009 , death was caused by a propofol overdose .

`` Michael would seek out avenues of sleep helpers and that 's another aspect of his secrecy , '' Metzger testified . `` I never did know what he did when he was n't in L.A. ''

Jackson was `` secretive about medicine , secretive about procedures , secretive about all kinds of stuff , which was part of his mystique , '' he said .

Metzger described a phone call from Jackson on February 26 , 2009 , four months before his death . It was a month after he signed a contract with AEG Live to do his `` This Is It '' comeback tour that would debut in London in July .

`` It was more of an anxiety call , about his health and how he was going to deal with all the 30 or 50 shows , '' Metzger said . `` I do n't think at that time he knew how many shows it would be . ''

Jackson was `` fearful because this is it and he needed to do a lot of perfectionizing , '' Metzger said . `` He wanted it to be something that had never been done before and it had to be great , so he had a lot of pressure from himself . ''

Jackson `` wanted to redeem Michael Jackson '' and `` go out with a flash , '' he said . The pop icon was `` still terribly hurt '' about the child molestation trial that ended in his acquittal four years earlier , he said .

Odd twist in trial

`` He was one of the most recognized names in the world and he wanted it to stay that way , '' Metzger testified .

Jackson 's biggest worry was `` that he was going to have a hell of a time sleeping and what are we going to do . '' He had a long history of not being able to sleep between shows on a tour , he said .

Metzger visited Jackson at his Los Angeles home on April 18 , 2009 -- two months before his death -- to discuss `` his profound sleep disorder , '' the doctor said .

The doctor said he suggested they find a sleep expert in London , where his first 50 shows were scheduled , who would use `` safe modalities for sleep . '' Metzger conferred with other doctors in Los Angeles , hoping for recommendations to help Jackson .

`` I batted zero , '' he testified . `` Nobody had any specific people for me to call . ''

Jackson told Metzger he wanted someone to give him intravenous medicine that would put him to sleep . `` I ca n't sleep without something special , '' he told him . Propofol is infused intravenously .

`` I told him it was dangerous and potentially life threatening , '' Metzger said . He warned Jackson that it should only be used in a hospital because he could overdose , have an allergic reaction in a hotel , be given a wrong medication or develop an infection .

`` It just is n't the right thing to do , '' he said he told Jackson .

A nurse who tried to help Jackson find sleep with vitamin infusions testified last month that Jackson became convinced that propofol was the only cure for his insomnia . Cherilyn Lee said Jackson asked her on April 19 , 2009 -- a day after his meeting with Metzger -- to find an anesthesiologist who could put him to sleep him with propofol .

Lee , like Metzger , refused the request , warning him it was unsafe . She testified that she told Jackson that any doctor who would give him propofol at home did n't care about him and was just doing it for the money .

Jackson lawyers contend it was around the same time that Dr. Murray agreed to take to job . Just over two weeks later -- on May 6 -- an AEG Live executive wrote in an e-mail saying that it was a `` done deal '' that Murray was being hired for $ 150,000 a month to serve as Jackson 's full-time physician .

Jackson lawyers began their rebuttal case Wednesday afternoon by calling Los Angeles Police Detective Scott Smith , who testified that he concluded Murray 's motive in Jackson 's homicide was the $ 150,000 monthly salary he was to get from AEG Live .

Jackson 's fatal search for sleep

`` Information was obtained that revealed that Dr. Murray financially was in ruins , was losing his house in Las Vegas , had a lien against his pool , was arrears in child support for multiple children to multiple women , '' Smith said . `` Financially , he was just a mess . ''

Jackson lawyers argue that AEG Live executives created a conflict of interest with the structure of their agreement with Murray , which provided that he could be fired if the concerts were delayed or canceled . He was too dependent upon the pay to refuse to administer the risky propofol infusions which Jackson was convinced he needed to prepare for the tour , they argue .

The key reason Jackson lawyers called Smith was to refute a statement made by Kathy Jorrie , the lawyer who helped negotiate and write the contract between AEG Live and Murray .

Smith , who interviewed Jorrie during his investigation of Murray , wrote in his report that she told him that the London concerts were `` only the beginning , that Michael Jackson was going to do a world tour that was to last two to three years . ''

Jorrie testified last month that she never told police there was a planned world tour .

`` If Detective Smith were to come in here and say you made that statement he would be lying ? '' Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked Jorrie .

`` He would be mistaken , '' Jorrie replied .

In court Wednesday , Smith testified that `` she did state that there was going to be a world tour that would last two to three years . '' He said it was reflected in his handwritten notes , as well as the typewritten summary of his interview with the lawyer for AEG Live .

Evidence that AEG Live and Jackson intended to take his tour around the world is important if the jury decides the company should pay damages in the singer 's death . An entertainment expert hired by the Jacksons estimated he would have earned $ 1.6 billion if he had not died -- mostly from that world tour . It represents lost income that jurors could order AEG Live to pay the family in damages .

Jackson lawyers said they may show jurors previously unseen raw video of Jackson 's last rehearsals after they call Dr. Metzger to the witness stand Thursday . They said they expect to rest their case at the end of the day .

Judge Palazuelos will read several hours of jury instructions on Friday , guidance intended to help jurors find their way through a complicated case that could take weeks to deliberate .
