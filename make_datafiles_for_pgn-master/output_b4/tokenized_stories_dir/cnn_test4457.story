London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange urged the world Saturday to `` stand with '' Edward Snowden , the man who admitted leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs , according to the text of a speech posted on Twitter .

As he appealed for a `` brave country '' to step forward and offer Snowden asylum , Assange also accused U.S. President Barack Obama of betraying a generation of `` young , technically minded people . ''

Assange was scheduled to speak from the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on Saturday , but the appearance was postponed at short notice `` due to a security situation , '' WikiLeaks said on Twitter .

Wednesday marked a year since Assange sought refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden , where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another .

Assange has repeatedly said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website . Ecuador 's government granted him asylum in August , but British authorities have said they will arrest him if he leaves the premises .

As a result of his decision to seek refuge in the embassy , `` I have been able to work in relative safety from a U.S. espionage investigation , '' said Assange , according to the text of the speech .

`` But today , Edward Snowden 's ordeal is just beginning . ''

Assange to Snowden : ` Go to Latin America '

Assange 's words came hours after Snowden was charged by U.S. federal prosecutors with espionage and theft of government property , according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in Virginia on Friday .

Snowden , 30 , has admitted in interviews that he was the source behind the leak of classified documents about the NSA 's surveillance programs . Those leaks were the basis of reports this month in Britain 's Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post .

He is believed to be in hiding in Hong Kong . The United States has asked authorities there to detain the former National Security Agency contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant , The Washington Post reported , citing unnamed U.S. officials .

Assange , in his published speech , said the espionage charge had come `` like clockwork , '' making Snowden the eighth `` leaker '' to be charged with that count by the Obama administration .

`` Two dangerous runaway processes have taken root in the last decade , with fatal consequences for democracy , '' he said .

`` Government secrecy has been expanding on a terrific scale . Simultaneously , human privacy has been secretly eradicated ... The U.S. government is spying on each and every one of us , but it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off . ''

Also among the eight `` leakers '' is WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning , Assange said . Manning is being court-martialed on charges he aided U.S. enemies by leaking documents he obtained as an Army intelligence analyst .

He named the others as Barrett Brown , Jeremy Hammond , Aaron Swartz , Gottfrid Svartholm and Jacob Appelbaum .

Assange suggested Obama was the real `` traitor '' for his failure to live up to his promises of hope , change and transparency in government . And he warned that the U.S. government will lose the battle if it tries to take on the tech-savvy people now calling its actions into question .

`` Edward Snowden is one of us . Bradley Manning is one of us . They are young , technically minded people from the generation that Barack Obama betrayed . They are the generation that grew up on the Internet , and were shaped by it , '' he said .

`` The U.S. government is always going to need intelligence analysts and systems administrators , and they are going to have to hire them from this generation and the ones that follow it .

`` One day , they will run the CIA and the FBI . This is n't a phenomenon that is going away . ''

Assange added that charging Snowden `` is intended to intimidate any country that might be considering standing up for his rights '' and appealed for efforts to find asylum for him to be intensified .
