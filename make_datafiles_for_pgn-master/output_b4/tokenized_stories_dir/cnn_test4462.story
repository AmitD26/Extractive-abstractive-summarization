Princeton , New Jersey -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Late last week , the campaigns of President Obama and Mitt Romney released Web videos highlighting the mistakes their rivals have made on the campaign trail .

Obama 's statement that `` the private sector is doing fine '' was the highlight for a Romney video , while one of the president 's videos featured a remark by the former Massachusetts governor that the nation does not need more firefighters , teachers or police officers . We can expect the gaffe wars to continue , since they are a staple of presidential campaigns .

Even though such statements are far from a fair indication of a candidate 's record or stance on the issues , and often they are accurate statements taken out of context , they can be devastating to a campaign .

Some off-kilter comments are too slight to sink a candidacy , but when they play into preconceptions of a candidate , the remarks -- and even sometimes a gesture or sound -- can be potent .

Obama 's recent statement about the private sector plays perfectly into Republican arguments on multiple levels . Although Obama was referring to data showing that if not for cutbacks in government jobs , the recovery would be far more robust , the statement has been used to argue that the White House is out of touch with average Americans .

It also tends to confirm the notion that Obama does n't really know much about the private sector , Republicans say , in contrast to Romney . Finally , the statement can be used to support the criticism that Obama inhabits a world of celebrity , living in a bubble and unaware of the negative sentiment about his policies .

Of course , Obama 's opponent , though a disciplined campaigner , has used a number of poorly chosen words that have contributed to his image as a tone-deaf beneficiary of privilege , such as making a $ 10,000 wager during a debate or saying at the Daytona 500 that he has `` some great friends who are NASCAR owners . '' His statement about public workers suggests that he does n't care about the kinds of basic services many Americans depend on , Democrats contend .

Both men join a long history of politicians who have been criticized for a wrongly chosen phrase or gesture . A quick look at history shows what can happen :

1 . Barry Goldwater , `` Merely another weapon '' -LRB- 1964 -RRB- : President Lyndon B. Johnson used these words , one in a series of controversial statements that the senator made about how tactical nuclear weapons could be used in certain situations , to buttress the Democratic argument that Sen. Goldwater was hell-bent on nuclear war . This was the basis for the famous commercial where viewers saw a little girl picking the petals of a flower , with a mushroom cloud appearing in her eye .

2 . George Romney , `` Just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get when you go over to Vietnam '' -LRB- 1967 -RRB- : Michigan Gov. Romney , Mitt 's father , then seen as one the most promising Republicans in the party because of his ability to compete for moderate voters , said this upon returning from the war 's front lines . He was becoming more critical of the war and the lack of accurate information about it from the Johnson administration . But Romney 's comment was used by critics to question his mental stability .

3 . Hubert Humphrey , `` Happy Days Are Here Again '' -LRB- 1968 -RRB- : A song played throughout Vice President Humphrey 's campaign . The juxtaposition of the song and the scenes of anti-war protests and social turmoil , including at the Democratic Convention in Chicago while the police clashed with protesters outside as the candidate spoke , served as evidence that he was out of touch with how volatile the country had become in the tumult of the 1960s .

4 . Gerald Ford , `` There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe '' -LRB- 1976 -RRB- : When President Ford said these words during a televised debate with Democrat Jimmy Carter , in an effort to counteract right-wing criticism about his policy of dÃ © tente with the Soviet Union , Democrats pounced on the statement to claim that the president was not competent on foreign policy .

5 . John Kerry , `` I actually did vote for the $ 87 billion before I voted against it '' -LRB- 2004 -RRB- : The statement was prime fodder for GOP commercials to demonstrate Sen. Kerry 's flip-flopping and the inability of the Democratic Party to take a tough stand on foreign policy .

6 . John McCain , `` The fundamentals of our economy are strong '' -LRB- 2008 -RRB- : The statement was used by Democrats to attack Republican economic policies , connecting McCain to the unpopular President George W. Bush .

7 . Michael Dukakis , `` No , I do n't , Bernard , and I think you know that I 've opposed the death penalty during all of my life '' -LRB- 1988 -RRB- : When Democrat Michael Dukakis said this in response to CNN anchor Bernard Shaw 's question about whether the Massachusetts governor would support the death penalty if his wife were killed , Dukakis ' cold response suggested that he was detached and Democrats were unwilling to take a tough stand on crime .

8 . Howard Dean screams -LRB- 2004 -RRB- : After coming in third in Iowa , Dean 's exuberant scream in front of reporters was used by his opponents to argue that the Vermont governor was less stable than he appeared to be .

9 . George H.W. Bush checks his watch -LRB- 1992 -RRB- : When asked by a citizen about how the recession had affected him , the president appeared to be distracted , even checking his watch , which played directly into Democratic criticism that he did not take domestic policy seriously .

10 . Al Gore sighs -LRB- 2000 -RRB- : Vice President Gore 's multiple sighs during a debate with George W. Bush played into impressions that Gore was arrogant and aloof .

Though this list is far from exhaustive , the history should provide a powerful reminder to Obama and Romney that a few words can come back to haunt a campaign .

It is virtually impossible for candidates to explain away these kinds of mistakes . The more they discuss them , the longer the story plays out . The most successful response has been by candidates who aggressively shift attention to new issues and help redirect the news cycle .

Obama has made several moves that could change the conversation , including his announcement Friday of a policy against deportation of many young illegal immigrants . In coming months , we 'll find out whether those moves are working .
