-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy is slated to stand trial starting on November 4 on charges of committing and inciting violence , state media said Wednesday .

Facing trial alongside him are 14 other members of the Muslim Brotherhood movement , state news agency MENA said .

Morsy , who is backed by the Brotherhood , will be tried at Egypt 's Criminal Court on charges relating to his alleged involvement in violence that took place around the Ittihadiya Presidential Palace , the news agency said .

U.S. to cut some military aid to Egypt after coup , turmoil

Egypt 's military forcibly removed Morsy from office in early July . He has been in detention since then , and a military-backed interim government has been in power .

In September , an Egyptian court banned all activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and froze its finances , drawing complaints from the international community .

The Brotherhood , an Islamist group that rose to power after the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 , has called for the reinstatement of Morsy 's government .

Egypt has been in turmoil since Morsy 's ouster , with the military and Morsy opponents battling Muslim Brotherhood members and others .

In August , hundreds of people -- citizens as well as members of security forces -- were killed . Many of the deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo . Violence raged after Morsy supporters staged demonstrations a few days later .

Each side blames the other for stoking the violence .

The rise and rapid fall of Egypt 's Mohamed Morsy

Morsy , who was backed by the Muslim Brotherhood 's political arm , was the country 's first democratically elected president .

But critics say he became increasingly authoritarian and forced through a conservative Islamist agenda during his year in power that alienated moderates . His ouster came after huge street protests calling for his removal .

Western nations , including the United States and Britain , have urged Egypt 's temporary government to have an inclusive political process .

Egypt 's interim foreign minister , Nabil Fahmy , told the U.N. General Assembly last month that the government is following a road map that will see nationwide elections by spring .

U.S. military aid to be reduced

The Obama administration announced Wednesday a suspension of significant military aid to Egypt .

The move , involving hundreds of millions in U.S. assistance to the Egyptian military , is the culmination of months of debate within the administration about how to respond to Morsy 's ouster .

`` As a result of the review directed by President Obama , we have decided to maintain our relationship with the Egyptian government , while recalibrating our assistance to Egypt to best advance our interests , '' U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement .

The reduction involves a significant amount of military aid , including large-scale military hardware and cash assistance .

Aid that will continue includes funds to uphold Egypt 's obligations under its peace treaty with Israel , and money for counterterrorism and security in Sinai , where extremists have been able to set up base , Psaki said . The United States will also maintain nonmilitary funding that helps promote democracy as well as health and education programs .

CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman said that in the short term , the U.S. decision could have a positive impact for the interim Egyptian government .

`` Immediately , probably , the Egyptian government is going to find it 's going to gain somewhat in terms of local public opinion , '' he said . `` There seems to be a lot of frustration with the United States , given its role in Egypt over the last 2Ã‚ 1/2 years since the revolution . ''
