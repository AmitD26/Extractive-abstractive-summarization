-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Some of the president 's men are still working . In golf 's Presidents Cup , that is .

And while U.S. President Barack Obama was n't in attendance in Ohio -- he has more important things to worry about -- a former president , George W. Bush , greeted both teams Thursday at the Muirfield Village Golf Club .

The biennial competition , which pits the U.S. against the rest of the world minus Europe , has been kinder to the Americans than the more prestigious Ryder Cup .

Indeed since the tournament started in 1994 , only once has the International Team prevailed , and the U.S. has won four in a row .

The U.S. featured six players in the top 10 in the rankings , including world No. 1 and PGA Player of the Year Tiger Woods . The International Team , by contrast , had one -- Masters champion Adam Scott .

Early indications suggested the U.S. 's superiority in the rankings would translate to an easy victory -- they led all six fourballs in the early stages .

But after about a 90-minute delay because of thunderstorms , the International Team fought back .

By day 's end , it was 3.5 to 2.5 for the U.S. , a slender advantage .

Jason Day 's dramatic putt at the 18th gave the Australian and Graham DeLaet a win over Hunter Mahan and Brandt Snedeker after Woods and Matt Kuchar routed Angel Cabrera and Marc Leishman 5 and 4 .

`` It 's awfully fun partnering the No. 1 player in the world , '' Kuchar said in a televised interview .

The U.S. fell behind as Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley lost to Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel 2 and 1 before Scott and Hideki Matsuyama halved with Bill Haas and Webb Simpson .

Jason Dufner and Zach Johnson eased past Branden Grace and Richard Sterne 5 and 3 to level the match .

In the decider , Steve Stricker and Jordan Spieth edged Ernie Els and Brendon de Jonge .

Stricker 's short putt at the 18th gave the U.S. the lead heading into Friday 's foursomes .
