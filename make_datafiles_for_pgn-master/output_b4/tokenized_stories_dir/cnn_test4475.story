-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 16-year-old boy was charged late Sunday in connection with a shooting at the Bryant Park skating rink that wounded two people , New York City police said .

Corey Dunton was arrested and charged with attempted murder , assault , reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon , and will be charged as an adult , according to New York Police Detective Kelly Ort .

Police believe Saturday 's shooting began over an argument about a coat , Ort said .

One victim was shot in the back and the second one in the leg , police said . The victims ' injuries are not life-threatening . The victims were 14 and 20 years of age . Police are withholding the victims ' names at this time .

Megan Cutcher , a San Francisco resident visiting New York City , was having a drink with relatives at a nearby restaurant when the gunfire started .

`` We sat down at one of the outdoor couches with a heater and ordered a drink , '' Cutcher said . `` Right after we ordered , we heard three shots . Initially , it just sounded like a pop gun , but then people started screaming , and we realized it was more serious . ''

She grabbed her mother and pushed her under the table .

`` We were at most 10-15 feet from the ice , '' she said . `` Luckily , the couches we 'd been sitting on blocked us from the view of the shooter . ''

A few minutes later , the gunfire stopped and the restaurant staff ushered them into the kitchen for safety .

`` I was able to calm down a bit , though my heart was racing , '' she said .

Police ordered them to stay put while they searched the area . About an hour later , they got an all-clear to use a particular exit .
