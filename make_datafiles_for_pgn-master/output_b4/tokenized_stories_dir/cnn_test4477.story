Manila , Philippines -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With memories of last year 's killer typhoons still fresh , Typhoon Megi roared across the Philippines on Monday , ripping through roofs and cutting off electricity .

The cyclone 's peak wind speeds decreased as the system moved over the Sierra Madre mountains , but it still packed sustained winds of around 167 kph -LRB- 103 mph -RRB- with gusts up to 204 kph -LRB- 126 mph -RRB- , according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center . This is down from peak sustained winds of 212 kph , with gusts up to 259 kph -LRB- 161 mph -RRB- , over the weekend .

Megi , also known as Typhoon Juan , was expected to pick up steam again as it heads over the South China Sea . Current forecasts from the Joint Typhoon Center show the storm heading toward the southeastern China coast , just west of Hong Kong .

In the Philippines , five people have died in what the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council is billing as the strongest storm of the year , according to Catherine Martin , manager of disaster management services at the Philippine National Red Cross .

Emergency workers pulled the body of Vicente Decena , 53 , from a bloated river ; a tree fell on the house of Aileen Respicio , 20 , killing her and injuring her child . Five others were injured elsewhere , the disaster council reported .

Even as it weakened , Megi continued to pose a serious threat .

Trees swayed and relentless rains inundated roads . Storm chaser James Cabrera , who was in Luzon , said parts of the Philippines could see 300 to 500 millimeters -LRB- 12 to 20 inches -RRB- of rain .

`` Unfortunately , this is a part of the world where the infrastructure is quite fragile , the power grid is quite fragile and a lot of people live in quite basic houses , '' James Reynolds , a storm chaser who is on Luzon , told CNN on Monday .

`` We have learned our lessons from the grim experiences we had during typhoons Ondoy -LSB- known internationally as Ketsana -RSB- and Pepeng -LSB- Parma -RSB- , '' House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. said , according to the Philippine News Agency . `` We must all cooperate because nature 's wrath exempts no one . ''

A year ago , tens of thousands of people were in evacuation centers as four consecutive typhoons drenched the Philippines . About 500 people were reported dead .

Journalist Eduardo Lingao in Manila contributed to this report for CNN .
