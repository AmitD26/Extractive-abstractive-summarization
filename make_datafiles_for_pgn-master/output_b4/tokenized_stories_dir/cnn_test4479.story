-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This week we mark Constitution Day , commemorating the electrifying moment on September 17 , 1787 when the Philadelphia framers went public with their proposed Constitution .

Over the ensuing year , Americans debated and ratified this audacious plan , and thereby gave birth to a far better world . Let 's recall the central features of that year that changed everything so that we can measure how far we have come , and how far we still need to go , to redeem the Constitution 's promise .

After its public unveiling in mid-September , the Philadelphia plan was put to a vote across the continent , in a process that let vastly more ordinary folk than ever before in human history decide how they would be governed .

In most states , standard property qualifications were lowered or eliminated for this special ratification election . New York , for the first time in its history , let all adult free male citizens vote -- no property qualifications , no race tests , no religious qualifications , no literacy tests -- for ratifying-convention delegates who in turn voted yes on the Constitution several months later .

Later generations have nobly built upon this foundation , repeatedly adding the words `` the right to vote '' in a grand colonnade of amendments promising a permanent end to all sorts of electoral discrimination and exclusions . That 's undeniable progress .

But America no longer leads the world in the integrity and inclusiveness of our elections ; several states are now shamelessly trying to roll back voting rights ; the Supreme Court has renounced a key piece of the landmark Voting Rights Act ; and Congress has yet to mend the tattered statute .

Modern American free speech is a happier story , with robust free expression in almost every corner of the land . Here , too , we have 1787-88 to thank , a year when Americans dramatically embodied free speech in the very process of establishing the Constitution . No one was censored that year , and the document 's opponents were not forever demonized or voted off the island .

In fact , several of the Constitution 's early critics came to rank among the new nation 's highest leaders -- for example , President James Monroe , Vice Presidents George Clinton and Elbridge Gerry , and Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase .

The two camps that had sharply divided over the Constitution 's ratification -- the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists -- soon thereafter found common ground in supporting a Bill of Rights . Is it too much to hope that today 's polarized parties might learn something from this inspiring example , and try to find something -- anything ! -- that they can agree upon ?

Perhaps because the Constitution 's supporters did not try to muzzle skeptics , these skeptics , when outvoted , acquiesced . In several states , the document squeaked through only by the narrowest of margins -- for example , 30 to 27 in New York .

Yet everyone accepted the basic principle of majority rule , even though the document itself did not explicitly specify this voting rule . Here , too , there are lessons for today .

The entrenched filibuster has made the current Senate a deeply dysfunctional body , yet some senators seem to think that a supermajority-rule system has deep roots in founding principles and practices . These senators are mistaken .

The early Senate followed the principles of 1787-88 , and the key principle that year in every single state ratifying convention was simple majority rule . Everyone got to speak ; and then votes ensued , and simple majorities prevailed . Period .

Finally , let 's note the extraordinary religious inclusion championed by the document first unveiled in mid-September 1787 . Unlike most revolutionary state constitutions and the contemporaneous rules generally in place elsewhere on the planet , the Constitution opened its doors to office seekers of all faiths and philosophies .

Last year , three of the four men atop the major party tickets -- Mitt Romney , Paul Ryan , and Joe Biden -- were not members of the mainstream Protestant churches that dominated society at the founding . Today 's speaker of the House is a Catholic , the Senate majority leader is a Mormon , and no Protestant sits on the current U.S. Supreme Court .

One is tempted to say , `` only in America ! '' but in fact there are other modern countries that are democratic and religiously pluralist . However , many of these democracies have been powerfully influenced by the American constitutional experience .

Before the Constitution went public in 1787 , pluralistic democracy existed almost nowhere on the planet , outside America . Thus it had always been throughout recorded history . Today , constitutional self-government reigns across half the globe , and it does so thanks largely to the legal , political , cultural , moral and military success of the American constitutional project .

In short , the world is becoming more American -LRB- and America itself , thanks to trade and immigration , is becoming more global -RRB- . So we should not say `` only in America , '' but rather `` only because of America '' -- and in particular , because of America 's Constitution and because of the year that changed everything .
