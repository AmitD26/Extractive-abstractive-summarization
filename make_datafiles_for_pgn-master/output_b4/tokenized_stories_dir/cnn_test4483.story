-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Zhang Xin is an example of true grit success . She rose from the faceless assembly line of a Beijing factory to a property magnate richer than Donald Trump and Oprah .

Her company , SOHO China , literally changed the landscape of Beijing and Shanghai over the past two decades . Forbes magazine has listed her family 's net worth at $ 3.6 billion .

And she 's not stopping there . In a private transaction -LRB- not related to her company business -RRB- , her family and the Safra banking family of Brazil just bought a 40 % stake in the iconic GM building in New York City -- the building that houses the flagship Apple store on Fifth Avenue .

Zhang recently sat down with CNN 's Pauline Chiou to talk about everything from her Beijing childhood to the volatile property market and how her 14-year old son tried to get a job at McDonald 's .

Failure is part of the puzzle

CNN : Did you come across a lot of bumps in the road and a lot of failures ?

Zhang Xin : Every day . I mean , I think that 's just life . You will always bump into difficulties , challenges and problems . It appears to be that we seem to be doing quite well , but as it is now , we 're still having challenges every day . So I think that 's just nothing unique . That 's just life .

Pivot and dribble around politics

CNN : You moved from residential real estate to commercial and now you 're focusing on commercial . Why did you do that , especially when we see new home prices still rising ?

ZX : Residential development has become very political . Government policies ... are against any prices going up because this is a very social issue .

The government comes out with policies that deal one day with this side -LSB- of the issue -RSB- another day with this side -LSB- of the issue -RSB- . We said , `` Let 's get out of this area . Yeah , let 's move on to somewhere we can really exercise our skills as a developer . ''

I think the policies are so distorted . Like someone who 's sick , you 've taken so much medicine that you 've lost the sense of which one works and which one does n't . That 's a little bit like the real estate market in China .

Grab the opportunities

CNN : On the Forbes ' recent list of 24 self-made female billionaires , there are five women from China , one from Hong Kong . What is it about China and the women of your generation that allows them to achieve that highest level ?

ZX : Women of our generation went through the Cultural Revolution , went through hardship , went through coming from nowhere . Suddenly , we see China 's been given so many amazing opportunities . So women just seized the opportunity . I think in terms of coming from a low base , coming from nowhere , we 're all equal .

In China , there are a lot of problems but also there are a lot of opportunities . Precisely because there are so many problems , things are not established ; therefore , there are opportunities .

Have a life outside of work

CNN : You 're a mother of two boys . You 're a wife . How do you do the work-life balance ?

ZX : I 'm very , very focused on my children . In fact , I 'm very religious about having breakfast with them every morning , having dinner with them every evening , and spend all the weekends with them that I do n't work . So as long as I 'm not traveling , I 'm always with them and I go to their soccer and tennis matches . After dinner we 'd just sit together and do homework with my children because they need help . I love doing that . It also makes me realize the world is so much wider than just your business world .
