-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man extradited to Florida for writing , publishing and selling a controversial book considered a `` how-to '' for pedophiles pleaded no contest to criminal charges in exchange for two years ' probation , authorities said Thursday .

Phillip Greaves was arrested in his home state of Colorado in December and extradited to Polk County , Florida . Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at the time his detectives were able to establish jurisdiction in the case by conducting an undercover operation , buying a copy of the book `` The Pedophile 's Guide to Love and Pleasure : A Child-Lover 's Code of Conduct , '' through the mail .

Greaves even autographed it . Police paid $ 50 for the book , which they received on December 8 .

Greaves and his book gained national attention last year after Amazon.com defended selling the book on its website despite angry comments and threats of boycotts from thousands of people . The book was removed from the website in early November .

Officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children , grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents . Judd said last year Greaves ' book outlines a `` code of ethics '' that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children .

Greaves told reporters after his arrest the book could be used as a guide to rehabilitating pedophiles and instead of teaching them how to avoid arrest , teaches them to avoid illegal actions .

Asked if he is a pedophile , Greaves said , `` I only have sex with grown-ups . '' He said he has no children and `` I do n't keep children around my house . ''

On Thursday , as he was leaving jail , Greaves told CNN affiliate WESH he still supports the sale of the book .

`` I do n't think I did anything wrong , '' he said . `` It backfired on me . ''

According to the pre-arranged plea deal announced in court Wednesday , Greaves agreed to plead no contest as charged and will serve two years ' probation . While the plea does not require Greaves to register as a sex offender , he is required to continue mental health counseling , said Chip Thullbery , spokesman for the prosecutor 's office .

`` We believe this agreement accomplishes our objectives : to see he does not do it again and give a warning to others who may want to create such materials , '' Thullbery said . `` If he publishes this book again or sells it further , he would be subject to re-arrest . '' If that occurs , Greaves could be sentenced to the maximum for the charge : five years in prison .

However , while the probationary terms apply to Florida , Thullbery did not know what action , if any , Florida prosecutors could take if Greaves sells the controversial book in another state where it could be considered legal .

`` We 'll have to address that issue at that time , '' Thullbery said .

Greaves will be allowed to serve the probationary term in Colorado .

Judd has previously publicly said his office 's investigation into Greaves and his subsequent arrest was prompted by media reports on the book , including one by CNN 's `` AC360 , '' and the public outcry .
