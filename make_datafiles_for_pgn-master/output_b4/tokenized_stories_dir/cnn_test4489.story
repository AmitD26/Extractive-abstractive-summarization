-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The other day , the industry group representing small brewers issued its latest definition of what qualifies as a `` craft '' beer . Based on our size , that definition excluded us , even though we brew some of the most popular craft beers in the marketplace .

We respect the fact that some of our fellow brewers would want to differentiate themselves , but we 're convinced that the ultimate assessment of our beers will not come from an industry organization , but instead from America 's beer drinkers .

We know that no matter what style of beer it is , we will ultimately be judged by the quality of our beers . We like that , because we are confident that the quality of our beers stacks up well versus that of any brewer of any size , anywhere .

Now , because we are best known for brewing some of America 's biggest light beers , some people may be skeptical about that claim . We urge those people not to confuse the style of a beer with the quality of the beer . Whether it 's a light lager designed to provide the refreshment many American beer drinkers seek , or a vigorously hopped IPA designed to provide the nice bite many other beer drinkers desire , our brewmasters are obsessed with crafting superior-quality beers within each style .

While we may be big , we are still a company of beer people who take great pride in our beer culture and heritage , tracing our roots to two visionary immigrant entrepreneurs who opened breweries in the mid-19th century , Frederick Miller and Adolph Coors .

We 're also proud of our craft heritage . Nearly a quarter century ago , we acquired the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co. , which was making great beers , but struggling financially like many smaller brewers of that era . Leinie 's , as it 's affectionately known , was founded in 1867 , and we promised we were n't presumptuous enough to tell it how to brew its beers .

We 've kept that promise , and the Leinenkugel family -- now on its sixth generation in the business -- is experimenting more than ever with new styles and flavors , including the popular lemonade-flavored Summer Shandy .

Then there 's Blue Moon Belgian White . Launched in 1995 by brewmaster Keith Villa , Blue Moon exposed U.S. beer drinkers to Belgian-style ales at a time when they were not widely known . After a quiet start , Blue Moon has gone on to become the best-selling craft beer in the country . In fact , Blue Moon introduces many consumers to craft , opening their eyes to the diversity of beer .

The brewers of Leinie 's , Blue Moon and other smaller craft and import beers operate autonomously so they can maintain their own unique personalities and keep experimenting and pushing limits .

As a large brewer , we do not view the emergence of craft beer as a threat , because we know that innovation is essential to the American beer industry . In fact , we appreciate the vital role craft beers play within our industry . And we believe it 's good for beer that there are more breweries and more brands available to American beer drinkers than at any other time in U.S. history .

We 're determined to continue to play a leading role in that innovation . And whatever style beer you might prefer , all we ask is that you judge us by the quality of the beer in the glass .
