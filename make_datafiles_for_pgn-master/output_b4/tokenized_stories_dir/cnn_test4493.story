-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The deal struck at the weekend between Iran and world powers over its nuclear program is not just a triumph of Western diplomacy , but a step forward in the budding rapprochement between Iran and the U.S. that had been long in the making .

Every U.S. administration from Reagan to Obama has tried to reach out to Iran . Unfortunately , these efforts all failed because the circumstances for rapprochement were not quite right -- unlike today , where Iran 's new president , Hassan Rouhani , has been determined to outflank his ideological opponents in Tehran and reach a deal with the West .

The Obama administration seems equally determined -- despite opposition from Saudi Arabia and Israel , as well as an obstructive Congress -- to welcome the Iranians back into the international community , so long as they agree to play by the rules .

This is Obama 's `` opening to China '' moment and he must seize it .

Ever since Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on November 4 , 1979 and initiated the 444-day Iran-hostage crisis , the United States and Iran have been regional arch-nemeses . Even so , in the thirty years since this traumatic event , there have been periodic efforts to improve relations .

The first episode occurred in 1985 when Israeli officials helped facilitate a back-channel approach to so-called Iranian `` moderates '' , represented by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani . This led to the infamous `` Mission to Tehran '' , where senior U.S. officials traveled to Tehran to trade weapons and spare parts in exchange for the release of American hostages held in Lebanon . This mission failed spectacularly . Details were leaked to the press , leading to the Iran-Contra scandal , which nearly brought the Reagan administration down .

After George H.W. Bush 's election in 1988 , the U.S. reached out to Iran once again , saying in his inaugural address , `` Goodwill begets goodwill '' . Bush implied that if the Iranian regime helped the U.S. obtain the release of the hostages , he would respond with gestures of goodwill .

Upon Rafsanjani 's election as president in June 1989 , he announced that he would help the U.S. obtain the release of the hostages , which was done in late 1991 . But goodwill did not beget goodwill . When the hostages were released , the U.S. did not do anything .

During Clinton 's first term , U.S.-Iranian relations first underwent a deep chill . Following the Gulf War , the U.S. sought to `` contain '' Iran and Iraq , even though Iran had disarmed itself following the Iran-Iraq War . The policy , known as `` Dual Containment '' , was confusing . It advocated America playing a costly balancing role , when in fact the U.S. needed Iran to balance Iraq and vice versa . But the landslide election of Mohammad Khatami in 1997 led to a major thaw in U.S.-Iranian relations .

Like Rouhani today , Khatami sought to open up to the U.S. , telling CNN that `` all doors should now be open for such dialogue and understanding and the possibility for contact between Iranian and American citizens . '' Clinton seized this opportunity and exchanged letters with the Iranians in 1999 , but regime hardliners undercut Khatami and rejected the American overture .

After the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 , the Iranian people -- much to the surprise of U.S. officials -- poured into the streets in solidarity with the American people . As U.S. officials prepared for war they were shocked to find Iran ready to help . According to Bruce Reidel , a former U.S. official , the U.S. and Iran worked closely together after the toppling of the Taliban to establish the post-war Afghan government . Unfortunately , George W. Bush squandered whatever goodwill had been achieved by including Iran as part of the so-called `` Axis of Evil . Ã‚ ''

Even so , the U.S. still made progress on the nuclear issue . In May 2003 , Iran sought to trade Western acceptance of its right to a peaceful nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief , assistance in stabilizing Iraq , and cooperation against al-Qaeda . But the U.S. rejected Iran 's proposal , undermined the Khatami government , and ruined any chance of achieving a lasting deal .

When Barack Obama came to office in 2009 there was great optimism that he could achieve a major breakthrough . This was because Obama had indicated during his election campaign that he was willing to talk directly with Iran . In March 2009 , Obama sought to bolster moderates inside Iran in the lead up to the June 2009 election by speaking directly to the Iranian people .

Unfortunately , the regime 's hardliners had no interest in seeing another reformist return to power and rigged the election , crushed the civic-minded protests against the regime , and ushered in another four year term for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .

The election of Rouhani in June 2013 has turned U.S.-Iranian relations on its head . Like Khatami in 1997 , Rouhani stunned the West with a charm offensive , condemning Syria 's use of chemical weapons , wishing Jews a happy Rosh Hashana , and releasing political prisoners . Rouhani 's objective was clear : he wanted sanctions relief in exchange for a compromise over his country 's nuclear program .

To this end , he found a willing partner in Obama . This remarkable opening culminated in Obama 's famous telephone call to Rouhani at the end of the UN General Assembly in late-September , the first direct communication between American and Iranian leaders since 1979 .

These exchanges set the stage for the nuclear deal reached over the weekend . After decades of intense hostility between the U.S. and Iran , calmer heads have finally prevailed .

Only time will tell if the U.S. and Iran can build upon this interim agreement and establish a working relationship , which is in the best interests of the region . More importantly , this deal stands as a lesson to the war hawks that diplomacy actually works .
