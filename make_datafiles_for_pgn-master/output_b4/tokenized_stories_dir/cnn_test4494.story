-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Every spring , a yellow blanket of pollen descends upon America , eliciting complaints from allergy sufferers already fed up with watery eyes , stuffed-up sinuses and excessive sneezing .

If you 're wondering exactly what that is covering your car , it 's pine pollen , which usually comes out in mid - to late-April . But believe it or not , it 's probably not what 's causing your symptoms .

`` Amazingly enough , most people are not allergic to the stuff you can see , '' CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said .

Instead , it 's microscopic particles in the spring air that are hell-bent on causing misery . Most seasonal allergies are caused by smaller tree pollen and mold spores , according to the American Academy of Allergy , Asthma & Immunology .

More than 60 million Americans suffer from allergic rhinitis , according to the academy . That means when they inhale something they are allergic to , they suffer symptoms in the nose and eyes . When the trigger of the reaction is pollen , the person is said to have `` hay fever . ''

Warm , dry climates have the highest pollen levels , according to Pollen.com , while rainy or cool weather significantly reduces allergens in the air .

Do n't let allergies stop you from traveling

Fortunately for allergy sufferers , 2013 has so far been relatively mild compared to last year , when an unusually warm winter caused the season to start earlier and last longer .

Pollen.com breaks the United States down into seven allergy regions . Except for the South Central area , all the regions are recording lower pollen levels than last year at this time , according to IMS Health , the company behind the website .

Pollen counts

There are no government pollen trackers , but private companies have stepped in to provide data on pollen levels nationwide .

Worst U.S. cities for allergy sufferers

A pollen count signifies how much pollen is in the air . A higher count means people who are allergic are more likely to exhibit symptoms . Pollen counts are calculated using the concentration of pollen in a certain area during a specific period -LRB- usually 24 hours -RRB- , according to Pollen.com .

'' -LRB- Air-sampling devices -RRB- collect particles from the air onto a transparent , sticky surface , '' the website 's FAQ page says . `` The sample is then examined under a microscope , where the pollen grains are counted and identified . ''

The device must be placed on a rooftop at least one story high , away from any significant pollen or mold sources , AAAI.org states , to get an accurate reading .

The numbers used to quantify pollen levels vary between collecting stations , and do n't mean much to the average consumer , so levels are usually described simply as low , moderate or high . What constitutes a high pollen count also depends on what type of allergen is being tracked , according to AAAI.org .

Where do allergies come from ?

Treating the symptoms

You 've got three options for over-the-counter oral antihistamines : Allegra -LRB- fexofenadine -RRB- , Claritin -LRB- loratadine -RRB- and Zyrtec -LRB- cetirizine -RRB- , but many patients need a prescription nasal spray in addition to one of those in order to find relief .

Allergists can prescribe topical nasal antihistamines and steroidal sprays . Antihistamine eye drops are also available over-the-counter and by prescription .

The only long-term option for allergy sufferers is to undergo immune therapy , in the form of shots , over three to five years . An allergy test determines what you are allergic to , and then you get tiny doses of that allergen injected until you become desensitized . A method of accomplishing this using droplets under the tongue has shown promise in studies , but is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration .

Bottom line : If you 're suffering this spring , allergists can help .
