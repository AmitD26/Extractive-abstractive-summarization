-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the 4x100 sprint relay , it is the handoffs that decide the winner . Speed is important , but without a top-notch changeover , you 're out . The maneuver is a perfectly orchestrated move performed in a split second without looking .

It 's all about teamwork , something Tianna Madison knows a thing or two about . She was part of the U.S. team that won gold in the relay at the London Olympics , shattering the world record in the process .

Madison is now back in the U.S. , using the lessons she learned on the track to help young girls learn their worth and make positive choices for the future .

As a role model , she is not shy to share her experiences -- including the downs in her life : `` I went from being World Champion long jumper in 2005 , to nothing in the last seven years , to now being an Olympian .

`` I dealt with a bankruptcy ; I had my home foreclosed , and these were things that happened and I was not honest with myself about why I was in that situation , '' she said .

Crucially for her career , she realized that she could n't deal with everything on her own . She was lucky enough to get help and support from her husband .

Building on this experience , she started Club 360 , to give young women love and support , which they might not find elsewhere .

Madison sat down with CNN to talk about the ups and downs of her career and how they motivated her to start the program .

CNN : What is Club 360 and why did you decide to start it ?

Tianna Madison : Club 360 is a personal development program for girls aged nine and up . We teach girls and young women the importance of living with integrity , honor , and self-respect and we do that through both online and offline activities . They can learn good habits , take their weaknesses and make them into strengths .

CNN : Why did you decide to incorporate your ideals of `` honor , integrity and self-respect '' into Club 360 's platform ?

TM : Integrity means I will not waver from where I want to be , cut corners or cheat myself . When I met my husband , he had a hard conversation with me : I had a weakness where I would say one thing but my action would indicate something else . I would say I wanted to be a great athlete , but I would only give 50 % at practice .

I learned to be very honest with myself so I know exactly where I am . I can take those weaknesses and turn them into my strengths .

Honor means that if I say I am going to do ten reps , I will do ten reps. Sometimes 12 . It is important to me to bring honor to my sport , to the people I work with , and to my husband . I can only do that by setting the course .

Self-respect : Do n't do anything that would derail you or damage you . When you know for a fact who you are and what you want , peer pressure really does n't exist .

CNN : How does teamwork play into it ?

TM : In a relay , you have to be trusted and you have to trust the next runner . That is what made our team successful . Allyson Felix trusted me to hand her the baton and I trusted her to give me a good target to give her the baton . In school when you have group projects or at work when you have to come together as a team , you have to trust that each person is going to deliver and you have to be trustworthy

CNN : Part of your group 's platform is combating stereotypes and avoiding the over-sexualization of young women . What stereotypes do you feel compelled to combat as a female athlete ?

TM : People think that athletes do not put a lot of emphasis on education . That is really not true ; education is very important .

We want our members to experience a range of new things . We teach girls not to not keep themselves in a box where they think they are supposed to be or where they fit in .

CNN : What challenges have you faced in your life and career , and what lessons have you learned that you feel you can pass along to these young women ?

TM : I had to deal with being molested in high school and what that did to my self-esteem and my ability to trust . I overcame this with the love and support of my husband .

But this is definitely not a sob story ! I also went from being World Champion long jumper in 2005 , to nothing in the last seven years , to now being an Olympian . I dealt with a bankruptcy ; I had my home foreclosed , and these were things that happened and I was not honest with myself about why I was in that situation . It was n't until -LRB- last -RRB- September that I was able to do that .

It took someone like my husband to give me the love and tools to help me change it . It was not something I could do on my own . That is why I wanted to start Club 360 -- so we could give these young women love and support as well .

CNN : What 's the biggest lesson you 'll take away from your experience in London ?

TM : No matter what stage you 're on , no matter where you are , it always comes down to your ability to execute . On the other side , the Olympic Games showed me that I was a part of a larger movement . While my role in that movement was in sports , the whole world was involved in a unity that was amazing to see .
