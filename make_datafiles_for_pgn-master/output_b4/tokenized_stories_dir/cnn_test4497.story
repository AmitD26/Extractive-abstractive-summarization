-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The jubilation over the freeing of three women and a girl from their alleged captivity in Cleveland is quickly giving way to a serious question : Did Cleveland police miss clues ?

How could Amanda Berry , Georgina DeJesus and Michelle Knight remain captive for about decade in a densely populated area within a few miles of where each of them disappeared ?

The women were freed this week with the help of neighbors . The man who lived in the home where the alleged captives were found , Ariel Castro , was charged Wednesday with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape , Cleveland chief assistant prosecutor Victor Perez said .

Prosecutors are not pressing charges against Pedro and Onil Castro , who were also arrested along with their brother Ariel , with Perez saying there 's `` no evidence '' that they were complicit in the case .

Neighbors say they had called police about suspicious activity at the home in the past .

Cleveland police deny that , issuing a statement Wednesday saying that a `` thorough review of police communications records '' show no such calls ever took place .

Police say they went to the address once in 2000 , before the alleged kidnappings , when Castro reported a fight outside his home , and in 2004 , after two of the three women had disappeared . The latter visit was unrelated to the kidnappings , police said . Child services requested that visit to investigate a complaint that Castro had left a child alone on a bus during the time he worked as a bus driver .

No one answered the door at the home , and investigators later interviewed him elsewhere , police say .

Martin Flask , director of public safety for the city , later told reporters that `` there is no evidence to indicate that any of them -LRB- the women -RRB- were ever outside in the yard in chains , without clothing or any other manner . ''

Timeline : From missing to liberated

Neighbors say they reported suspicious activity

Neighbor Nina Samoylicz says that in July 2010 , she and her friends saw a naked woman in the backyard of Castro 's home . They said something to her , and Castro `` told her to get down . So we said something to him . He told her to get in the house , '' and then he went inside as well , Samoylicz said .

`` We called the cops , '' she says . `` They thought we were playing and joking ; they did n't believe us . ''

But Faliceonna Lopez , Samoylicz 's sister , told CNN 's `` Piers Morgan Live '' Tuesday night that they called their mother , not the police . Their mother , Annita Lugo , did not contact authorities because , she said , she did n't know what to do .

Within a week or two after they saw the naked woman , tarps went up , shielding the backyard from onlookers , Nina Samoylicz said .

Samoylicz also said she saw a girl who would sit looking out an open window until Castro would come along and board it back up . Sometimes the girl played at a nearby park by herself . `` My cousin one day said something to her . She said she 's waiting for her dad and then she pointed to -LRB- Castro -RRB- . And she ran up to him , and gave him a hug , and they left . ''

Neighbor feels ` fooled ' by abduction suspect

Police say the girl is Berry 's daughter .

News reports say another neighbor called police after seeing a woman through an attic window of the home , which Castro never allowed neighbors to enter .

And another neighbor , Israel Lugo -- Annita Lugo 's brother -- says he called police in 2011 when he heard yelling in the Castro home . Officers came a half-hour later , knocked on the door about 20 times over a 10-minute span , then left after no one answered the door , Lugo says .

Yet Cleveland police took to Twitter on Wednesday afternoon to dispute such claims . After an `` extensive '' look at its records , Cleveland police said there were no calls to the Castro house `` for women held or women banging on windows . ''

While denying any tips in the past , authorities are reaching out now to try to get more information about Ariel Castro and his home , in the hopes it can help their investigation .

`` We continue to ask the community to send tips and information -- to say something if you see something . We can not do this alone , '' police said in a statement after the women were freed .

Some people in the neighborhood , including Charles Ramsey , the man who helped free the alleged captives , say they do n't recall seeing anything suspicious at Castro 's home .

But legal analysts are taking the police to task .

If someone really heard screaming and police simply knocked on the door and left without further investigation , then `` law enforcement clearly dropped the ball , '' attorney Lisa Bloom said on CNN 's `` Piers Morgan Live . ''

`` It was almost like a Keystone Cops situation , '' prominent attorney Mark Geragos added .

`` There 's got to be much more to this story . Given my experience in handling criminal cases , I ca n't believe that we 're not going to find in the days ahead or the weeks ahead much more that unravels about this that blows your mind . ''

Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba , at a press conference Wednesday , said investigators over the past 10 years have often asked themselves whether they missed a significant angle . The answer , he said , is no .

`` I 'm just very confident in the ability of those investigators and those law enforcement officers that they checked every single lead and if there was one bit of evidence , one shred of a tip , no matter how minute it was , they followed it up very , very aggressively . ''
