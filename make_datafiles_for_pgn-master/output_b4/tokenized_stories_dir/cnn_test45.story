-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Team Sky 's Bradley Wiggins moved closer to Britain 's first overall victory at the Tour de France , maintaining his two minute five second lead over his rivals .

Wiggins , who was wearing the leader 's yellow jersey for an eleventh straight day , never looked troubled on the 222.5 km route from Blagnac to Brive-la-Gaillarde .

His teammate Mark Cavendish reinforced the British team 's dominance with a spectacular sprint over the final few hundred meters to claim his second victory of this year 's race .

The day 's stage had earlier been interrupted by a dog breaking onto the course , resulting in a four bike crash .

Cavendish , a sprint specialist who will represent Britain at the forthcoming Olympic Games , has spent a lot of the Tour supporting Wiggins ' attempt to claim the overall title .

`` Cav has waited a while for that and he 's been patient . It 's been difficult the last couple of weeks , we 've had to put his goals and aspirations aside really , '' Wiggins told the Tour website .

Wiggins admitted his team mate had sacrificed himself for the yellow jersey chase , but claimed Cavendish had `` been the first to say , ` look guys , I think the general classification is more important . ''

Cavendish 's victory in the 222.5 km stage between Blagnac and Brive-la-Gaillarde was his 22nd stage win at the Tour , moving him up to fourth in the all time records . He is now level with American Lance Armstrong and legendary French sprinter Andre Darrigade .

`` Twenty two stage wins ... has it sunk in ? Yeah ! Because I 've been waiting to do it for nearly three weeks now , '' Cavendish told the Tour website .

`` I 'm now equal with Andre Darrigade : he won 15 sprints but 22 stages of the Tour de France . So to match him is something , it makes me happy ''

The first incident of the day occurred 120 km into the stage when a large dog ran onto the course , causing a crash .

Four riders were unseated in the collision , notably Philippe Gilbert of the BMC team .

The former Belgian national champion took a moment to remonstrate with the dog 's owner before climbing back onto his bike . Gilbert later received treatment during the race from Tour medical staff .

Team RadioShack-Nissan rider Franck Schleck , who withdrew from this year 's Tour after a failing a doping test , has protested his innocence after announcing that his ` B ' sample also tested positive .

`` The result of the counter test was positive , but for me nothing changes , '' he said in a statement .

`` I just know that I did nothing wrong . I will therefore continue my search to find out ho the substance could have entered my body . ''

Luxembourger Schleck , whose brother Andy won the 2010 tour when Alberto Contador failed a doping test , was 12th when he withdrew from the race .
