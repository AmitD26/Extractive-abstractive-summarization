-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Can we predict the future of medicine ? Although designer babies and a disease-free world may or may not come to pass , you can get a glimpse of the most promising and upcoming medical innovations each year , via the Cleveland Clinic .

The clinic 's Top 10 Medical Innovations list , which has been an annual undertaking since 2007 , contains treatments and technologies that are expected to significantly change patient care and save lives .

To be considered , each innovation must have a good chance of being available to the public in the upcoming year , says Dr. Michael Roizen , chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic and chairman of the committee that decides the list . The committee must also expect it to have a significant impact on a large part of the population .

The process starts with a panel of Cleveland Clinic physicians and scientists who submit their ideas . These suggestions , which Roizen said totaled about 700 for the 2015 list , are then narrowed down and voted on by 40 physicians in a variety of health fields .

Here 's what they selected for 2015 :

1 . Mobile stroke unit

Videoconferencing has made its way into ambulances , specifically for treating stroke victims on the go . Hospital stroke neurologists can interpret symptoms via a broadband video link and instruct an onboard paramedic , critical care nurse and CT technologist on treatment . This new technology should improve the speed of medical care , which is important as strokes quickly damage and kill brain cells .

2 . Dengue fever vaccine

The World Health Organization reports that about half of the world 's population is now at risk for dengue fever , which up until now was preventable only by avoiding mosquito bites . The disease is a leading cause of death and illness in children in some countries . A new vaccine has been developed and tested , and is expected to be available in 2015 .

3 . Painless blood testing

For those who hate large needles , a nearly painless way to sample blood will be a welcome relief . Plus , it will be cheaper and provide faster results than today 's blood test . The new technology takes blood from your fingertip , and the Cleveland Clinic reports that over 100 tests can be performed on just one drop of blood .

4 . New way to lower cholesterol

New self-injectable drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors have shown to be very effective in lowering cholesterol . These drugs may prove to be helpful for people with high LDL cholesterol who do n't have good results with statins . The FDA is expected to approve the first PCSK9 in 2015 .

5 . Cancer drug that does n't harm healthy tissue

Although chemotherapy can save lives , it can be hard on the body and attack healthy cells as well as cancerous ones . A welcome breakthrough in the world of cancer treatment , antibody-drug conjugates can deliver targeted treatment without damaging healthy tissue .

6 . Immune booster for cancer patients

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to prevent cancer cells from `` hiding '' from the immune system , allowing the body to more effectively fight these abnormal cells . Combined with chemotherapy and radiation treatment , the drugs have shown significant , long-term cancer remissions for patients with metastatic melanoma , one of the most deadly forms of cancer .

7 . Wireless cardiac pacemaker

Until this point , wires have been a necessary component in pacemakers . A new wireless pacemaker about the size of a vitamin can now be implanted in the heart without surgery . Its lithium-ion battery is estimated to last about seven years .

8 . New medications for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that causes scarring in the lungs , leading to breathing difficulties and a shortage of oxygen in the brain and other organs . Life expectancy is only three to five years after diagnosis , but those numbers may change now that the FDA has approved two experimental drugs that slow the disease : pirfenidone and nintedanib .

9 . Single-dose radiation therapy for breast cancer

The National Cancer Institute estimates that 40,000 women in the United States will die from breast cancer in 2014 . The Cleveland Clinic cites multiple chemotherapy appointments , sometimes requiring the patient to travel long distances , as a hindrance to successful treatment . Intraoperative radiation therapy is a new solution . It treats a breast cancer tumor during surgery in a single dose , reducing time and cost spent on treatment .

10 . New drug for heart failure

About 5.1 million people in the United States suffer from heart failure , according to the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute . It is managed with a combination of drugs , but a new drug , angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitor , has been granted fast-track status by the FDA because of its ability to cut the risk of dying from heart failure more effectively than current treatments .

`` We look in past to see what we voted on to improve the process , '' Roizen said . `` With one exception , we 've been pretty good . ''
