-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- New photographs released by NASA have captured images of a vast stellar formation resembling a human hand reaching across space .

NASA 's Chandra Observatory captured this hand-shaped image of an X-ray nebula .

The image , taken by NASA 's space-based Chandra Observatory telescope , shows an X-ray nebula 150 light years across .

It shows what appear to be ghostly blue fingers -- thumb and pinky clearly discernible from index , ring and middle digits -- reaching into a sparkling cloud of fiery red .

NASA says the display is caused by a young and powerful pulsar , known by the rather prosaic name of PSR B1509-58 .

`` The pulsar is a rapidly spinning neutron star which is spewing energy out into the space around it to create complex and intriguing structures , including one that resembles a large cosmic hand , '' NASA says .

The space agency says B1509 -- created by a collapsed star -- is one of the most powerful electromagnetic generators in the Galaxy . The nebula is formed by a torrent of electrons and ions emitted by the 1,700-year-old phenomenon .

The finger-like structures are apparently caused by `` energizing knots of material in a neighboring gas cloud , '' NASA says .

NASA scientist Patrick Slane told CNN that he and his fellow astronomers were more interested in the make up of nebula rather than its hand-like appearance . Watch Slane explain the discovery ''

`` To tell you the truth , when I first saw the image , it was n't a hand structure that jumped out at me at all , it was other more complex structures , '' he told CNN .

`` We really concentrated on how this thing could be made rather than what it might be . ''
