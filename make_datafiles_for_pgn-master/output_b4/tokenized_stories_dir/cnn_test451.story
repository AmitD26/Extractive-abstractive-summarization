Pahoa , Hawaii -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The lava flow has slowed , if not stalled altogether .

Still , authorities warned Thursday that the threat to eastern Hawaii residents -- much like the oozing , simmering , destructive lava itself -- has n't gone away .

Darryl Oliveira , the director of the Hawaii County Civil Defense , told reporters that `` there 's been no movement forward '' at the front of the destructive lava stream between Wednesday and Thursday .

`` But there 's lots of activity behind it , '' Oliveira said . '' ... There are breakouts along the margins that we 'll have to watch and be wary of . ''

The lava began moving toward the area of Pahoa , on Hawaii 's Big Island , in June , when a volcanic crater vented and released the river of liquid rock .

It 's been creeping along ever since , with authorities warning at one point the main road in Pahoa could be overcome by Friday morning .

The lack of recent movement changes that equation , though the main flow -- which is about 20 yards wide at its tip , expanding to 100 yards farther back -- is still within about 480 feet of that street .

There 's no guarantee of what happens next , including whether the stream resumes its forward movement or whether any of its offshoots encroach on people or properties . A USGS geologist has said the lava flow could continue for 30 years .

As Matthew Patrick , a geologist with the Hawaii Volcano Observatory , explained Thursday : `` The flow is still active , and there is still scattered activity in the flow .

`` So it 's just a matter of where that activity is at any given moment . ''

On Wednesday , Oliveria said about 20 families in the path of the lava have been told to evacuate . Many others have packed up , `` prepared to move at a moment 's notice '' should they , too , get the order .

`` You can see some of them walking around ; they are still very upset , distraught , frustrated -- the full range of emotions as they 're dealing with this crisis , '' the civil defense director said Thursday .

So far , thankfully , no homes have been buried . Nor have any vehicles . Instead , it 's mostly grass and vegetation that have been immersed and scorched .

This is n't a lazy river , after all . It 's a 2,000-degree river of molten rock , the kind that a firefighter ca n't use a hose to stop .

`` As it moves across soil , you can hear and smell the fire , '' said Troy Scott of the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency . `` It is incredibly hot ... the heat is very strong . ''

That 's why there are ongoing efforts to make sure people and property are protected , as well as to clear out any hazardous materials , such as those at a one-time gas station , in the lava 's potential path .

Local civil defense officials got some help Thursday , in the form of 80 Hawaii National Guard members . Oliveria explained that these guardsmen will drive around on patrols as an extra set of eyes .

He said , `` As long as we need them , they 'll be here . ''
