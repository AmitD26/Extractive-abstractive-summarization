Las Vegas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The humble thermostat is getting a 21st-century makeover . And so is the boombox , thanks to a son of the late reggae legend Bob Marley .

The 2012 International Consumer Electronics Show does n't start in earnest until Monday , but at a gadget preview event Sunday , some electronics startups seemed determined to give redemption to ordinary appliances , and not just those from children of the Rastafarian movement .

In a packed hotel ballroom , companies demonstrated portable televisions , plastic guitars , stoves and solar-powered e-reader cases .

Here are five of the more intriguing gadgets we found :

Nest thermostat

For most of their existence , home thermostats have been mere functional accessories . White or beige , they blend into the wall and only get noticed when someone needs to change the temperature .

With an elegantly simple dial that turns blue when cooling and orange when heating , the new Nest digital thermostat seeks to change that . If it looks like something made by Apple , that 's because it 's designed by former Apple exec Tony Fadell , the man behind the look of the iPod .

`` We 're the iPhone of thermostats , '' said Nest Labs marketing spokeswoman Kristin Bickett , continuing the Apple theme . `` It 's the simplicity of the design . ''

The Nest saves energy with motion-tracking sensors that detect when people enter or leave a room and adjust temperatures accordingly . It also tracks your energy-use history and energy savings .

When it 's connected to Wi-Fi , it downloads software updates automatically . And if you 're lazy , you can control it wirelessly from your couch with your phone or tablet .

It sells for $ 249 and is available from heating - and cooling-system installers or at Nest.com , although the website is currently sold out .

Marley Bag of Rhythm

`` We 're bringing back the boombox from the '80s ! '' said House of Marley spokeswoman Karen Korponai cheerfully in what must surely be one of the stranger marketing pitches at a cutting-edge gadget show .

Indeed they are . The Bag of Rhythm is pretty much that -- a portable stereo with high-end components , a handsome birch wood face and an iPhone/iPod dock , nestled inside a canvas shoulder bag .

Take it to the beach , to the college quad or to your next Hacky Sack game . The rechargeable battery promises five to six hours of music for your dancing , air-guitaring or spacing-out pleasure .

The Bag of Rhythm will sell for $ 300 when it hits the market in February , Korponai said .

The House of Marley company , which also makes earbuds and headphones , operated under a partnership with the late Bob Marley 's family . One of his sons , Rohan Marley , was at CES to help promote the product .

Dyle TV tuner

Why is it that your uncle 's clunky old hand-held TV can pick up live channels , but our cutting-edge smartphones are left with 20-second cat videos ?

A new device called Dyle can put live TV on an Android phone , iPhone or iPad . The cork-size plastic gizmo has a headphone jack at the end of a short wire , which houses an antenna that can pick up digital TV signals .

The wireless TV transmission is the same one that pipes into many homes that do n't subscribe to cable . That means no monthly fee , and watching hours of video does n't add up in costly cellular data bandwidth .

Mobile Content Venture , the year-old company formed by such media giants as Fox Broadcasting and NBC Universal , makes the mobile TV service . The company expects people will access live TV from their phones in addition to all on-demand content found online . The over-the-air broadcasts Dyle pulls in are limited to a dozen or so channels .

`` We do n't think it 's one or the other , '' Erik Moreno , an MCV general manager and also a Fox executive , said in an interview . `` We think consumers want to do both . ''

MCV and Belkin International , which makes the accessory , declined to announce a price or release date . Those details should come in the next few months , Moreno said .

Dyle will also be included in an upcoming Samsung Android phone for MetroPCS , a prototype that MCV demonstrated at the event Sunday . A metal antenna can be extended from the top of the phone to improve reception -- and to make users look like they stepped out of a time machine from 1992 .

Guitar Apprentice

`` Guitar Hero '' publisher Activision Blizzard hung up its ax a year ago , but music equipment maker Ion Audio is breathing new life into the plastic guitar with a new gizmo called the Guitar Apprentice .

The Gibson-style guitar body has a slot in the soundboard for an iPad to be inserted . Using a companion application , Guitar Apprentice players can run their fingers across virtual guitar strings while holding buttons on each fret along the neck to play musical notes . The buttons light up to teach newbies proper finger placement for playing each chord .

Virtual shredding will commence when the $ 99 Guitar Apprentice hits the market in June or July , an Ion spokesman said . Prospective Doors cover bands can already practice with Piano Apprentice , a $ 100 , 25-note keyboard with a place for hooking up an iPad .

Strange days , indeed .

Tinke vital-signs monitor

Like some similar health-care gadgets , the Tinke is a little gizmo with a sensor that plugs into the bottom of your iPhone .

Unlike those devices , however , you do n't have to put a clamp on your finger to read your vital signs . If you simply place your thumb on Tinke 's sensor for 60 seconds , it will tell you your heart rate , breathing cycle and blood-oxygen level .

The Tinke also will store your data on your phone so you can chart your heart or breathing rates over hours or days . Manufacturer Zensorium , a Singapore-based company , expects to debut the gadget in mid-2012 and sell it for about $ 100 .
