-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's the biggest stage in the world of college football .

The talented students from Florida State and Auburn who charge onto the field Monday night in Pasadena , California , will know that nothing in their lives may ever top this feeling . For the great majority of the seniors who wo n't go on to play professionally , this will be the last time in uniform .

I 'm not referring to the football players . The Florida State Seminoles and the Auburn Tigers will be competing for the national championship , and their head coaches , Jimbo Fisher and Gus Malzahn , have been getting them ready for the game .

But there are two other groups of students from those schools who also will step onto the bright green floor of the Rose Bowl on Monday night . Those squads are even larger in number than the football teams , and , although they draw considerably less national attention , they have been preparing just as diligently .

`` It starts with practices in the heat of the Alabama summer , '' said Corey Spurlin , associate professor of music at Auburn and director of the 380-member Auburn University Marching Band .

`` Just like the football players , our musicians are at the very peak of their abilities , '' said Patrick Dunnigan , professor of music at Florida State University and director of bands , including the 400-member Marching Chiefs .

With kickoff approaching , I got in touch with Spurlin and Dunnigan because the months of work put in by marching band members at schools across the country often gets overlooked . They are a major part of the pageantry of college football , but in recent decades the television networks have all but ignored them most of the time . If the performance of the marching bands at college games each Saturday gets a few seconds on the TV broadcasts , they count themselves lucky .

`` Generally , if we do get airtime , it 's very brief , minimal , '' said Auburn 's Spurlin . `` We 'd love to be able to share what we do with more people . ''

Florida State 's Dunnigan said : `` The kids in the band do n't know any different . I grew up in a world where the halftime shows were seen on TV , but that 's over . ''

The replacements on television have been studio shows with analysis , replays and highlights of other games ; the studio shows are lucrative revenue generators , attractive for commercial sponsors , and the switch away from the field at halftime is almost instant on most telecasts .

Still , the audiences inside the stadiums are massive . Florida State 's home stadium seats more than 82,000 ; Auburn 's seats more than 87,000 . The Rose Bowl , where Monday 's national championship game will be played , seats more than 90,000 . Few bands of any kind ever get to play in front of that many people . Bruce Springsteen and the Rolling Stones might even be a bit envious .

The musicians , although they do their work on the same gridirons as the football players , are not recognized around campus the way the star quarterbacks or linebackers are . `` With 380 musicians in the band , not many people can pick out their faces , '' Spurlin said .

And as far as the scholarships and perks that go with big-time college football programs : Forget it . At Florida State , Dunnigan said , not only are there no marching band scholarships , but `` the student musicians pay for the work they do -- the band is a one-credit class , so they 're paying tuition to be in it . We 're kind of proud that the members of the band are there by choice . ''

At Auburn , Spurlin said , the budget that is available for the marching band 's expenses goes only so far ; the university provides the band 's uniforms , `` but the members of the band have to pay for the cleaning , '' and they have to get their uniforms to the laundry after the games .

The intangible rewards , however , are ample . `` The individual challenge is to play the instruments as well as they can , to lock into the formations as well as they can , '' Dunnigan said . `` The big picture is when they look at the crowd , see the fans clapping , watch the football team waving at them . The feeling is being a part of something huge . '' Spurlin said the friendship and the time together is something irreplaceable , something the band members will take with them for the rest of their lives .

Very few members of the marching bands go on to careers as professional musicians . `` Some will go on to teach music , '' Spurlin said , `` but for most , they bless us with their talent while they 're here , and then they graduate and do something else for a living . ''

Dunnigan said : `` I hope that , in 10 years , some who are in the band now will still play their instruments in church , or in a community musical group . ''

The physical challenges can be daunting : `` We come onto the field in a high-step jog , with legs all the way up , '' Spurlin said . `` They 're wearing long-sleeved cadet-style uniforms , heavy hats , and carrying their instruments , and for a 1 o'clock game in Alabama , it can be 98 degrees down on the field . ''

Dunnigan and Spurlin both said that , each year , there are some musicians who are supremely talented , but who just ca n't play their instruments well while marching quickly in formation . There also are some who are brilliant at close-order drills , but whose musicianship does not match their strutting skills . The directors have to tell them that they have n't made it onto the bands .

With hundreds of band members on the field , if one musician hits a clunky note or takes a false step , the football fans up in the seats may not notice . But the other band members do , as do the band directors .

`` We 're all attuned to it , and we know , '' Dunnigan said . `` The accuracy of the notes , the formations to lock into , the crescendos -- we know right away when something 's off . ''

Spurlin said : `` Our standards for ourselves are high . We teach a precise work ethic , a pride , that we hope will carry over to whatever the musicians do after they leave here . ''

As the seniors in both schools ' bands , like the seniors on both schools ' football teams , soon will do . But first there is Monday night 's game . Each band has been allocated six minutes to perform before kickoff , when , as they march , they will play their schools ' traditional fight songs . At halftime , each band gets eight minutes ; among Auburn 's selections , Spurlin said , will be music from stage shows that became popular movies . Dunnigan said that the Florida State band will also include movie music : the James Bond theme , among other songs .

And then , for the musicians whose final season this is , it will be over . `` The value of all this will become more apparent to them as the years go on , '' Dunnigan said .

Spurlin said that when graduating band members tell him that being on the squad has been the time of their lives , he tells them he hopes that turns out not to be true .

`` I thank them , but I tell them that I do n't really want that for them . I tell them that I hope they will have many , many special moments after they leave college . I tell them that I hope the times of their lives -- the spine-chilling , best moments -- are still ahead of them . ''
