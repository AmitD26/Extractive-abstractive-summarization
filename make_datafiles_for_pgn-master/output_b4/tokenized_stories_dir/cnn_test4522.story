New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two New York state men have been charged in a bizarre plan to develop a mobile X-ray system that would be used from afar to silently kill people that they deemed `` undesirable , '' federal officials said .

Glendon Scott Crawford , 49 , and Eric J. Feight , 54 , were arrested Tuesday after an undercover operation by the Albany FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force . They were charged with conspiracy to provide material support for use of a weapon of mass destruction , according to the criminal complaint .

Crawford and Feight were developing a device `` intended to be mobile ... designed to turn on remotely from some distance away '' that would emit `` some dangerous levels of X-ray radiation , '' according to John Duncan , executive assistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York .

Individuals who might have been `` subject to this X-ray radiation , would not immediately know that they had been harmed until some days later when they would either be injured , or it could result in their death , '' he said .

The suspects intended to use the device to harm and kill `` enemies of Israel , '' a Department of Justice news release said .

Undercover agents allegedly heard Crawford , a self-described member of the Ku Klux Klan , state that he `` harbors animosity towards individuals and groups that he perceives as hostile to the interests of the United States '' and refers to them as `` medical waste . '' He specifically identified Muslims as belonging to this group , according to the criminal complaint .

Crawford and Feight appeared in court Wednesday . If convicted , each faces up to 15 years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and five years of supervised release .

Feight appeared with a lawyer , while the judge appointed one for Crawford . CNN attempted to contact the attorneys late Wednesday but was unsuccessful .

Though the device had extraordinary potential for harm , the public was not in danger because of the early involvement of authorities , Duncan said .

Andrew St. John , a friend of Feight 's for 30 years , called Feight a `` pacifist '' and a `` smart guy . ''

Crawford , a manufacturing employee at a GE plant in Schenectady , New York , worked with Feight , an employee at a nearby automotive company often contracted by GE , according to the investigation report . The automotive company did not comment .

Since the arrest , Crawford has been suspended from the company , which is fully cooperating with authorities , according to GE spokesman Shaun Wiggins .

`` We have no reason to believe the act took place on GE property , nor is there any information indicating that our employees ' safety was ever compromised , '' Wiggins said .

According to the criminal complaint , Crawford repeatedly used another GE employee as a proxy `` to covertly obtain the parts list for the remote initiation system '' among other things , at times meeting in GE 's parking lot .

Wiggins told CNN on Wednesday that he could not speak to those allegations .

Crawford contacted two Jewish organizations in April 2012 for funding assistance of an `` off the shelf '' technology that could be used by Israel to defeat its enemies by killing them while the slept , according to the criminal complaint .

A lengthy federal investigation then began . Agents met with Crawford and Feight , posing as both potential middle men and customers for this `` radiation emitting device , '' according to the criminal complaint .

Crawford said the lethal machine would be capable of emitting 8 to 10 grays -- a unit of radiation dose -- toward the target Muslim community , according to the criminal complaint . The radiation-emitting device would be `` Hiroshima on a light switch , '' Crawford said , and that `` everything with respiration would be dead by the morning . ''

Feight was recruited by Crawford to develop a `` remote initiation device '' powered `` by a plug-in cigarette lighter electrical source , '' according to an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Geoffrey Kent . The system would have three parts -- the X-ray , a power source and a remote initiation device -- and it would fit into a truck , the complaint said .

In October , Crawford traveled to North Carolina to meet with a high-ranking KKK official and two businessmen affiliates , all working with the FBI , to discuss his scheme and raise money , according to the complaint .

Feight was introduced to undercover FBI agents in November and called the design of the lethal machine `` incredibly smart '' because it gives `` a lot more isolation from the ... issue , '' according to a recorded dialogue in the criminal complaint .

Feight seemingly explains his rationale for involvement in the same meeting . `` When I started seeing how things , the direction things were going ... after the elections , '' Feight said , `` You know , the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing . ''

Crawford was apparently concerned about not surviving a surgical procedure he underwent during the development of the machine .

According to the criminal complaint , Crawford made arrangements with colleagues to contact his wife to retrieve his computer and phone , containing important data , so they could move on with the operation . In an e-mail to an unidentified person , Crawford said : `` if something happens I do n't want this to go away , it can serve our people well . ''
