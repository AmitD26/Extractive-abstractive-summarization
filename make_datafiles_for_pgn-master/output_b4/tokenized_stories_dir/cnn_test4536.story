-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two stories of America -- one about its sometimes perverse capacity for reinvention , the other about the most tragic period in the country 's history -- were among the leaders Thursday for the nominations for the 86th Academy Awards .

`` American Hustle , '' a story about con artists based loosely on the late 1970s Abscam scandal , tied for the lead with 10 nominations . The movie was nominated in several major categories , including picture , director -LRB- David O. Russell -RRB- , actor -LRB- Christian Bale -RRB- , actress -LRB- Amy Adams -RRB- , supporting actor -LRB- Bradley Cooper -RRB- , supporting actress -LRB- Jennifer Lawrence -RRB- and adapted screenplay .

And `` 12 Years a Slave , '' based on Solomon Northup 's 19th-century narrative about being taken from freedom into slavery , earned nine nods , including picks for best picture , best director -LRB- Steve McQueen -RRB- , best actor -LRB- Chiwetel Ejiofor -RRB- , best supporting actor -LRB- Michael Fassbender -RRB- and best supporting actress -LRB- Lupita Nyong ` o -RRB- .

`` This has been an amazing ride , and to receive nine nominations from the academy is testament to all of the hard work . And for that I am truly grateful , '' McQueen said .

The complete list of nominees

`` Gravity , '' about a space mission gone wrong , also received 10 nominations , including picks for best picture , best director -LRB- Alfonso Cuaron -RRB- and best actress -LRB- Sandra Bullock -RRB- .

`` I am particularly moved by Sandy 's nomination , '' said Cuaron in a statement . `` She is the heartbeat of our film . I thank her for her grace , her trust and her dedication to finding the truth of this character . ''

The academy nominated nine films for best picture overall . They are `` American Hustle , '' `` Captain Phillips , '' `` Dallas Buyers Club , '' `` Gravity , '' `` Her , '' `` Nebraska , '' `` Philomena , '' `` 12 Years a Slave '' and `` The Wolf of Wall Street . ''

CNN Oscar ballot : Make your choices , share your picks

`` The Wolf of Wall Street '' had divided critics -- and , more to the point , industry audiences -- with its relentless depiction of hedonism among financial traders in 1990s New York . In one instance , according to a story that quickly gained currency in Hollywood , an academy member heckled director Martin Scorsese after a screening .

But Oscar sided with the film , giving it five nominations , all in big categories : best picture , best director , best actor -LRB- Leonardo DiCaprio -RRB- , best supporting actor -LRB- Jonah Hill -RRB- and best adapted screenplay -LRB- Terence Winter -RRB- .

5 things we learned from Oscar nominations

Love for ` Dallas Buyers Club '

There was also good news for `` Dallas Buyers Club , '' the story of an HIV-positive man in the 1980s who rallies others to battle the AIDS crisis . The low-budget film , which cost $ 5 million , received six nominations , tying it with `` Nebraska '' and `` Captain Phillips . ''

Matthew McConaughey , who won a Golden Globe for a performance that required him to lose 45 pounds , was among the best actor nominees . The film was also nominated for best supporting actor -LRB- Jared Leto , another Globe winner -RRB- and best original screenplay , along with best picture .

The academy also smiled on director Alexander Payne , a two-time Oscar winner whose films include `` Sideways , '' `` The Descendants '' and `` About Schmidt . '' His `` Nebraska , '' the story of a curmudgeon and his son who make a trip to the Cornhusker State in the possible vain pursuit of a sweepstakes prize , included nominations for picture , director , original screenplay , supporting actress -LRB- June Squibb -RRB- and best actor . The last went to 77-year-old film veteran Bruce Dern , whose only other nomination was for 1978 's `` Coming Home . ''

Another sleeper , `` Philomena , '' received nominations for picture , adapted screenplay and star Judi Dench as well as music -LRB- original score -RRB- .

As expected , Cate Blanchett also was nominated for best actress as a modern-day Blanche DuBois in `` Blue Jasmine . '' She already has won the Golden Globe -LRB- drama -RRB- , National Society of Film Critics Award and New York Film Critics Circle Award for her role in the Woody Allen film .

The tireless Meryl Streep was recognized yet again by the academy , receiving a best actress nomination for `` August : Osage County . '' It 's Streep 's 18th nomination . She has three wins , for `` Kramer vs. Kramer , '' `` Sophie 's Choice '' and `` The Iron Lady . ''

Hanks , Oprah missing

But not everyone ended up touched by Oscar 's golden glow .

Perhaps the biggest shocker was the lack of a nomination for Tom Hanks , who pretty much carries `` Captain Phillips '' as the titular seaman . The film did receive nominations for best picture , best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor -LRB- for former limo driver and Somalia native Barkhad Abdi -RRB- , but neither Hanks nor director Paul Greengrass ended up with nods . -LRB- It also was nominated for film editing , sound editing and sound mixing . -RRB-

Hanks ' other major film , `` Saving Mr. Banks , '' was almost entirely snubbed . Though Emma Thompson was nominated for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of `` Mary Poppins '' author P.L. Travers , the academy overlooked her in the best actress race , and the film failed to earn a best picture nomination .

Oprah Winfrey and the film she starred in , `` Lee Daniels ' The Butler , '' also came up empty .

And Robert Redford was expected to make a run at best actor for his almost wordless performance in `` All Is Lost , '' about a lone sailor lost at sea when his boat is damaged . But the 77-year-old actor did n't get a nomination .

Pixar , which once a sure thing in the animated feature category , was left off the nominations list again . The nominees for best animated feature are `` The Croods , '' `` Despicable Me 2 , '' `` Frozen , '' `` The Wind Rises '' and `` Ernest & Celestine . ''

DeGeneres promises fun again as Oscar host

The Oscar race now shapes up as a battle between `` Hustle '' and `` 12 Years . ''

Both have their critics . For all the praise `` Hustle '' has received -- including a Golden Globe for best musical or comedy film -- it 's been called slick and hammy . McQueen 's `` 12 Years '' -LRB- which received the Golden Globe for best drama -RRB- has fewer naysayers , but even those who liked the film noted it 's difficult to watch .

Slate 's Dana Stevens described it as `` overpowering , '' and admitted she was having a hard time finding critical distance from the film 's portrayal of brutality .

Awards season : Does diversity matter more than wins ?

`` Buyers Club '' could sneak in . Like `` 12 Years , '' it has a high-minded subject the Oscars tend to like , and McConaughey and Leto have been widely touted for their performances .

`` Gravity '' may be a longer shot for best picture , but Cuaron 's amazing direction -- juggling state-of-the-art , computer-generated imagery with moving performances by Bullock and George Clooney -- has been greatly admired .

Of course , as much as the Oscar is about designating the best of Hollywood , it 's also supposed to be an entertaining show . This year , Ellen DeGeneres returns as host , and given a short ad shown just before the nominations announcement -- which featured DeGeneres dancing through a back lot accompanied by a growing army of tuxedoed dancers -- it could be a lot of fun .

The 86th Academy Awards will air March 2 from Hollywood 's Dolby Theatre . The show will be on ABC .
