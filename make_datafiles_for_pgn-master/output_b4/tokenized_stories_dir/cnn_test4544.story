The Peabody
Memphis , Tennessee

Perhaps the most famous hotel tradition of them all is the twice-daily duck parade that waddles through the lobby of this historic downtown Memphis property , as it has for the past 80 years . At 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. each day , five North American mallards depart their palatial rooftop enclosure , hitch a ride on the elevator -LRB- under the guidance of the official duck master -RRB- and then strut their stuff across a red carpet and into a large marble fountain in the middle of the lobby , where they swim and splash for a bit until it 's time to head back to their lofty penthouse . The Peabody 's ducks are so famous , they 've appeared in everything from an episode of `` Jeopardy! '' to one of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues .

The Algonquin
New York

This landmark Manhattan lodging also has a resident species its guests have come to know and love : a fetching feline named Matilda . A cat has been a fixture at the Algonquin since a stray wandered into the hotel looking for food and shelter in the 1930s . There have been 10 cats in all , the females all named Matilda and the males all called Hamlet -LRB- a moniker that reportedly came from famed actor John Barrymore , who was playing the Shakespearean prince at the time -RRB- . The current kitty , who was rescued from a local shelter in 2010 , is a fluffy , blue-eyed ragdoll who , despite having pretty much the run of the place , often opts to hang out by the front desk , chilling in the lobby 's plush chairs and greeting people as they check in .

St. Regis Atlanta
Atlanta

The nightly tradition at this upscale Atlanta accommodation certainly has a lot of pop . That 's because every day at approximately 6 p.m. , either the hotel 's wine butler or the general manager holds court outside the Wine Room and ceremoniously sabers a bottle of champagne to help celebrate evening 's arrival . The practice of opening a bottle of bubbly with a military-style sword dates to the days of Napoleon and became a ritual here from the moment the doors opened in 2009 . Wine master Jennifer Sollinger can even offer tips on how to saber your own bottle using an ordinary chef 's knife .

Hyatt Regency Lost Pines Resort and Spa
Lost Pines , Texas

Encompassing a 405-acre swath along the banks of the Colorado River just outside Austin , this resort makes full use of the gorgeous Central Texas landscape , presenting guests with the opportunity to participate in everything from kayaking and horseback riding to archery and trap shooting .

Le Pavillon
New Orleans

The Big Easy may be known for menu items like beignets and jambalaya , but peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are what visitors look forward to at this historic property known affectionately as the Belle of New Orleans . Ever since 1988 , when a hungry guest got a late-night hankering for the nostalgic nosh , the hotel has put out a complimentary spread of PB&J sandwiches along with ice-cold milk and toasty hot chocolate . The snacking begins each evening at 10 p.m.

Griswold Inn
Essex , Connecticut

Speaking of free food , this 238-year-old hotel , which is one of the oldest continuously operated inns in the country , is home to a longstanding but little-known tradition that rewards anyone arriving on horseback or via horse and carriage a gratis lunch at one of its three dining venues .

Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa
Lahaina , Hawaii

Centuries ago , Hawaiian royalty called this area of Maui home , including Chief Kahekili , who ruled over the land from 1749 to 1794 . He was known for mastering the ancient sport of Lele Kawa , which involved jumping feet-first into the ocean from rocky perches up to 400 feet high . In honor of the man known as the King of the Spirit Leap , the Sheraton Maui presents a nightly retelling of his story , which begins with a loincloth-clad warrior lighting torches set at the edge of a lofty promontory and proceeding with a lei offering to the ocean below before taking a daring plunge -- this time headfirst -- into the surf .

Westin St. Francis
San Francisco

As a one-of-a-kind amenity for its guests , this luxury property on popular Union Square washes every single coin that makes its way into its coffers . The custom began in 1938 , when the general manager decided that all silver coins should be cleaned so as to keep the female guests ' white gloves from getting soiled . Arnold Batliner , who was the official coin washer until he retired in the late 1980s , is said to have laundered an estimated $ 17 million in change throughout his tenure . Today , the job belongs to Rob Holsen , who spends an hour or so each week running the coins through a silver-burnishing machine in a small room behind the registration desk .
