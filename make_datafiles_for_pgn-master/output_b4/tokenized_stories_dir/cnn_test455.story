-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Leipziger Strasse in central Berlin looks like almost any another main traffic artery in the world these days . It 's four lanes in each direction , and high rise buildings with nondescript shops on the ground floors line the sidewalks .

But this used to be one of the main streets of Communist East Berlin , where the East German regime showcased its arsenal during military parades . It was also the place I spent five years of my childhood from the late 1970s .

My father , Fritz Pleitgen , was the bureau chief for ARD West German television in East Berlin , and with that title he became one of the people the intelligence service -- the Staatssicherheit or `` Stasi '' -- hated and spied on the most . Their code name for him was `` The Tiger . ''

`` It was a war of the airwaves much more than it was a war with weapons , because there was always this competition between East Germany and West Germany , '' my dad recently told me when we visited our old house at Leipziger Strasse 66 .

`` They broke into our flat , but also into our office , '' he said , describing the Stasi 's methods . `` They took pictures . And sometimes they wanted to show me that they were in . That I got the impression that I am being observed . ''

They tried to gather any sort of information they could on my dad . The Stasi also used directional microphones and , of course , many informants who tried to make contact with our family and those working for the ARD office in the Schadow Strasse in East Berlin . The files that the Stasi gathered were later made available to the public . When my dad went through his , he was amazed .

`` It was a total observation , '' he said . `` They wanted to know everything to try and determine what kind of guy I was , because they thought all Western reporters were spies . ''

He later discovered that all of our neighbors around the house we lived in were secretly reporting to the Stasi . There were some situations where it was pretty obvious that people were acting as informants , or `` Unofficial Employees '' as the Stasi called them . But it was impossible for Western journalists to know the full extent to which they were being shadowed .

The daily work was a cat and mouse game . The East German regime went to great lengths to try and prevent people in the German Democratic Republic -LRB- East Germany 's official name -RRB- from watching Western TV . And they also did everything they could to stop East Germans from talking to West German reporters .

`` They wanted to stop our contacts with the East German population , '' my dad said . `` That was their nightmare -- that there could be an alliance of West German correspondents with the people of East Germany . ''

One such encounter was recorded in 1979 when my dad and his crew drove out to the Berlin-Gr√É 1/4 nau district to try to interview the author and activist Stefan Heym -- a man who was not afraid to speak out and criticize the regime .

When the team arrived , Stasi agents were already waiting , and they tried to stop them from talking to Heym . The crew did what almost every TV crew does when confronted with government goons who want to stop them from doing their work : They started a long conversation while the cameraman secretly kept filming , and the Stasi people grew increasingly uncomfortable as the situation went on .

In the end my dad was allowed inside to speak to Heym , but the camera had to stay out . He would go on to interview the activist on many occasions , and they remained friends until Heym died .

As time went on , the East German government 's restrictions grew tighter and tighter .

`` They wanted a permission letter for everything , '' my dad told me . `` I could not even go up to you and just ask you what the weather is like . ''

One way to undermine the repression was to mislead the Stasi . In some cases the ARD crews would say they wanted to do feature reports about the beauty of the landscapes and towns of East Germany , when in reality they wanted to show the mood of the people there . Sometimes they would purposely talk about going to a certain area , knowing the spies were listening , and then go somewhere completely different .

Being a West German family living in East Berlin , we were allowed to pass through the Berlin Wall to West Berlin anytime . The children actually went through the Wall every morning to get to school and kindergarten . My parents have never forgiven us for purposely losing our identification cards whenever we did n't feel like going to school . That meant we were stuck in the East , and that my dad would have to fly to West Germany to get new IDs for us .

The constant harassing and spying also made life extremely difficult for my mother , who was doing an amazing job trying to raise me , my brothers Christoph and Benjamin and my sister Vanessa . My dad had promised her a glamorous life as the wife of a foreign correspondent with stints in Paris or New York . Instead she found herself first in Moscow from 1970 till 1977 , and then in East Berlin .

`` She always had problems with the border guards , '' my dad said . `` And she was not ready to talk to them with a smile because she hated their questions . ''

One of the dumbest things the guards always wanted was to see was my mom 's left ear . It was in their protocol that people passing the checkpoints had to show their left ear to be positively identified .

`` First of all , she always refused to get out of the car , '' my dad said . `` And at some point she told them , ` Listen , you have seen my left ear so many times , you must know what it looks like by now . I am not going to show you again . ' ''

It did n't help that my siblings and I did a lot to bring our parents into embarrassing situations . My father remembered how he once got a call because his children had stolen a border guard 's hat and thrown it around the inside of a bus . On another occasion we threw balloons filled with water from the 13th floor of our building and hit an East German `` Volkspolizist , '' as the regular police were called .

`` One of the questions that was asked in the police report was whether the balloons were filled with warm or cold water , '' my dad recalled with a smile on his face as we stood outside the apartment building .

I was 13 when the Berlin Wall came down . It meant nothing to me at the time . But today when I walk the streets of Germany 's capital it is truly amazing to see how far the city and the country have come -- first rebuilding it after the shame of the Nazis and World War II , and then re-unifying it after the long division of the Cold War .

I take great pride in the fact that my dad played such a prominent role opposing German division , and that he and my mother never gave up and always stood tall and strong . No matter how repressive , intrusive and abusive the East German regime was , it never broke the will of The Tiger .
