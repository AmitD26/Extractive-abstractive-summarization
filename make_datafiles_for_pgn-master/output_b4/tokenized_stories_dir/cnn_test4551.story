-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is an enormous tragedy for the families of the victims .

It is excruciating to live through the pain , helplessness , shock and anger . It is as hard to regain some degree of normalcy .

I know because I 've been there . In 1985 , my beloved father died on the Japan Airlines Flight 123 that crashed outside of Tokyo , killing more than 500 passengers and crew . It 's one the largest plane accidents in the history of aviation .

Sitting on the tatami mat in the city hall in the small village close to the crash site , surrounded by hundreds of other people looking for their loved ones , I felt desperate , scared and suffocated . Contemplating another day of looking at pine wood boxes with inscriptions like , `` part of left hand , possibly male , '' I thought the agony would never end .

How can I steel myself to keep on looking to try to identify some remains of what was once my dear father , hero to his family ? Emotionally , physically and in every way , I felt drained of life force , like the body fragments in the boxes we were going through one by one in our search for our loved ones .

All these years later the scars still sting when scratched , as they were when Flight 370 vanished . I want to share with the grieving , scared and frustrated relatives of Flight 370 victims that while life will never be the same , it will get better . It will take time , but you will laugh again and the sun will come out once more .

The lack of closure is the hardest part . How do you know for sure that those on the plane are gone since their bodies have not been found ? What if they are alive somewhere waiting for you to rescue them ? How do you have a funeral when there are no remains ? How can you be so sure ?

But the truth is that while you may hold out hope , the world is presuming they are gone forever . You have to accept it and move on .

Here are some steps that helped me recover from my loss . Perhaps it could be of help to the families of Flight 370 :

1 . Grieve . Allow the pain to be released . Cry , punch the pillows , share stories , do what you need to let the feelings out . Let the emotions flow .

2 . Get support . From your family , friends and experts . From your spiritual source , in prayer or in nature . In time , maybe join a bereavement group .

3 . Eat as healthy as you can .

4 . Get rest , even if you ca n't sleep well , take some down time .

5 . Move . Walk , exercise , play a sport , dance , do something physical so that the feelings can be dissipated .

6 . Go into nature . Nature is big enough to hold you and your grief . Nature is healing .

7 . Know that your loved one -LRB- s -RRB- are at peace and will be with you always .

8 . Help someone who may be in a worse situation than you . In my case I saw that a couple of American families did n't make the trip to Japan . I sent them notes to let them know that I prayed for their loved ones , and that everyone was very kind and respectful in the whole search process .

9 . Trust that something good will come out of this tragedy . We may not know what it is , or how , but it will happen . My father 's death helped me learn how to be more present , to survive adversity , and appreciate the wonderful kindness of strangers .

From disaster I 've learned to be strong and flexible , and to seek assistance when I need it . With faith and courage I can make a positive difference in other people 's lives . During the course of my life , I 've been fortunate to reach many of the goals I had set . I know that my dad was there , guiding , supporting and inspiring me the entire time . He smiled with pride with each new milestone that I crossed .

I believe all of us can grow and thrive through the trials of life with peace and happiness . It just takes one step at a time . The families of Flight 370 victims will come out of this tragedy different -- but they will endure and honor the memories of their loved ones .
