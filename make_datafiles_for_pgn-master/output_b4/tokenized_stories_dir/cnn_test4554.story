Monson , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In California , water flows uphill toward money and power . That 's a well-known maxim out here , especially in the Dust-Bowl-ready Central Valley -- that forgotten stretch of California that grows 40 % of U.S. fruits , nuts and other table foods .

Meet a few people and it 's easy to see why .

There 's Joel Sampedro , 56 , whose garden hose started spitting out sand , not water , about this time last year ; or Simona MagaÃ ± a , a 70-year-old former farm worker who stores water in buckets in the back of a rusty yellow pickup truck because her well is busted and there 's no reliable public system for her to hook up to ; she uses that nonpotable water to wash dishes , take showers and `` flush '' the toilet ; or Eunice Martinez , 48 , who , like many here , makes a distinction between `` water , '' which is the stuff that comes from her tap , and which is usually too polluted to drink , and `` drinking water , '' which is the stuff she buys in plastic bottles .

`` We 're in the United States of America . We should be able to turn on that water and drink out of it , '' Martinez told me , standing by her kitchen sink , which has a five-gallon water jug next to it for cooking . `` We ca n't ... It 's discriminatory , racist . ''

This is the invisible California -- the `` other California . '' A place of pickup trucks and pesticides . More West Texas than West Hollywood .

It 's the same California John Steinbeck chronicled in `` The Grapes of Wrath , '' the epic book about `` Okies '' who left the Great Plains during the Dust Bowl and fled to farms here . Some of them are still around . On Tuesday , I went to the town of Tooleville -LRB- nickname : `` Little Okie '' -RRB- ; and the unincorporated town of Monson . There , I met Clarence Harms , whose family came to this supposed promised land from Kansas and Oklahoma when the dust storms made life back there unbearable .

And it 's the California that 's going to be the subject of my next project in the Change the List series . I 'm fascinated by this forgotten valley and a major river , the San Joaquin , that cuts through it . The advocacy group American Rivers recently named the San Joaquin the `` most endangered '' river in the country . To figure out why , I 'm setting off on a three-week journey to try to kayak and walk along its path .

I 'm doing so because I want to understand the river and the people who depend on it -- beyond the screaming headlines about drought-year California politics .

I want to get to know this river , at a river 's pace , on a river 's terms .

I started the journey on Tuesday by going on a tour of the Central Valley with the Community Water Center in Visalia , California . I did that because I wanted to understand how and why water matters to people here . I found out it 's everything . Yet there 's not nearly enough to go around . Wells are going dry . Those who do have water have to deal with pollution from nitrate , which is linked to blue baby syndrome , kidney disease and other maladies . Some blame farmers for slurping up groundwater with virtually no regulatory oversight from the state . Farm advocates say there 's not enough river water for them , in part because of regulations to protect rare fish . They say they 're pulling groundwater to survive , too .

I 'm going to withhold judgment for now , but I plan to wade deeper into these and many other environmental and social issues on my trip down the San Joaquin . The adventure down the river starts for real on Wednesday . I 'm going to hike up to the untouched headwaters , high in the Sierra Nevada .

I 'm hoping to end beneath the Golden Gate Bridge in early July .

That 's assuming I do n't get lost or die of heat exhaustion .

You can follow the journey on Twitter , Instagram and Facebook . Or , to make it easier , there 's a page on CNN.com that will collect all that stuff for you .

I 'll be using the hashtag #endangeredriver .

I could ramble on about my plans , but you 'll get to hear all about them in the coming weeks . For now , let me leave you with this : Water is such a deeply personal topic out here in California that Marcelina Sampedro , the wife of the man whose hose started sputtering sand , told me she has two recurring dreams about it .

Both are about a river , but they 're slightly different .

Version1 : The water is clean and pure . Someone is struggling to swim , but Sampedro is able to grab this anonymous person and pull him or her out to safety .

Version2 : The river is polluted , which makes it not unlike the water that comes out of her tap . She and her husband use a $ 900 water filter/robot -LRB- it looks like a miniature version of Eve from WALL-E -RRB- to remove the nitrates from the water that comes out of their sink . They both work on fruit orchards , picking crops in the 100-degree heat , paid by the weight , and making about $ 26,000 , together , per year .

In that second dream , again , the person in the river is drowning .

She tries to help but ca n't .

The unnamed figure drowns .

She wakes up to a life where she and her husband would have no water at home if it were n't for the generosity of Clarence , their neighbor , who gives them water from his well . They 're all worried his well could go dry , too .

There are potential fixes for all this , and state programs that are trying to bring safe water to more people in the Central Valley and elsewhere .

But there 's just not enough water to go around .

So water continues to flow uphill .

Toward money and power .

That 's the history . And , if more 's not done , it 's looking like the future .
