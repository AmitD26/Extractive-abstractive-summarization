-LRB- WIRED -RRB- -- If you work for IBM , you can bring your iPhone to work , but forget about using the phone 's voice-activated digital assistant . Siri is n't welcome on Big Blue 's networks .

The reason ? Siri ships everything you say to her to a big data center in Maiden , North Carolina . And the story of what really happens to all of your Siri-launched searches , e-mail messages and inappropriate jokes is a bit of a black box .

IBM CIO Jeanette Horan told MIT 's Technology Review this week that her company has banned Siri outright because , according to the magazine , `` The company worries that the spoken queries might be stored somewhere . ''

Apple 's new ` spaceship ' campus : What will the neighbors say ?

It turns out that Horan is right to worry . In fact , Apple 's iPhone Software License Agreement spells this out : `` When you use Siri or Dictation , the things you say will be recorded and sent to Apple in order to convert what you say into text , '' Apple says . Siri collects a bunch of other information -- names of people from your address book and other unspecified user data , all to help Siri do a better job .

How long does Apple store all of this stuff , and who gets a look at it ? Well , the company does n't actually say . Again , from the user agreement : `` By using Siri or Dictation , you agree and consent to Apple 's and its subsidiaries ' and agents ' transmission , collection , maintenance , processing , and use of this information , including your voice input and User Data , to provide and improve Siri , Dictation , and other Apple products and services . ''

Apple and Samsung begin settlement talks

Because some of the data that Siri collects can be very personal , the American Civil Liberties Union put out a warning about Siri just a couple of months ago .

Privacy was always a big concern for Siri 's developers , says Edward Wrenbeck , the lead developer of the original Siri iPhone app , which was eventually acquired by Apple . And for corporate users , there are even more potential pitfalls . `` Just having it known that you 're at a certain customer 's location might be in violation of a non-disclosure agreement , '' he says .

Apple designer ` winces ' over some past product choices

But he agrees that many of the issues raised by Apple 's Siri data handling are similar to those that other internet companies face . `` I really do n't think it 's something to worry about , '' he says . `` People are already doing things on these mobile devices . Maybe Siri makes their life a little bit easier , but it 's not exactly opening up a new avenue that was n't there before . ''

But other companies have been pressured by privacy groups over the way they store customer data . Google , for example , has come under fire in the past for the way it handles a massive database of user search data . But IBM does n't ban Google . Neither Apple nor IBM could be reached for comment Tuesday , but there are a couple of important differences between Siri and Google that may have IBM worried : For one , Siri can be used to write e-mails or text messages . So , in theory , Apple could be storing confidential IBM messages .

Another difference : After being dogged by privacy advocates , Google now anonymizes search results -- making them difficult , if not impossible , to trace back to an individual user -- after nine months .

Maybe if Apple agreed to do something like that , Siri would be welcome over in Armonk , New York .
