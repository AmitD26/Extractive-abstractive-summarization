-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Can the media get over their collective obsession with weight ?

Fat chance .

For some strange reason , here we are again , talking about Michelle Obama 's derriere . And , for good measure , Chris Christie 's girth .

Watch : Why is Washington Post highlighting Michelle Obama 's rear ?

It 's easy , it 's fun , it 's good for clicks and ratings . It 's also kinda cheap .

The Washington Post used a pretty flimsy peg -- Alabama high school football coach Bob Grisham caught on tape -- to run a Style section piece on the weighty issue . `` Fat butt Michelle Obama , '' the coach is heard saying , declaring her overweight . Grisham was suspended by the school -LRB- he says he misspoke -RRB- .

But this is national news ? Really ?

Of course , the paper dressed it up with highfalutin ' sociology . `` The focus on this first lady 's posterior has historical antecedents , '' the article says , launching into questions about how black women have long faced scrutiny about their bodies .

Well , maybe . And yes , Rush Limbaugh and Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner have sounded off about Obama 's bottom . And yes , the fact that she has mounted an anti-obesity campaign does sort of put her in the crossfire .

But as the Post acknowledges , Michelle Obama is a 5-foot-11-inch woman with toned arms who is widely viewed as being in good shape . She 's not a triathlete ; she 's a working mother of two . So when the story asks , `` What is it with Michelle Obama 's critics and the fixation with her derriere ? '' I would turn that question around . What is the media fixation with publicizing it every time some bozo sounds off about her backside ?

This is an uncomfortable reminder that the media business celebrates models bordering on anorexic , making perfectly proportioned young girls and women feel heavy because they do n't have superthin -LRB- and often airbrushed -RRB- celebrity bodies . This may help promote the fashion industry , which considers normal women plus-size , but it bears little relation to real life .

Christie is a different case . Having endured endless jokes about his oversized frame , the New Jersey governor shrewdly decided the best path was to poke fun at himself .

So he appeared on David Letterman 's couch this week , one of his chief tormenters , and promptly shoved a doughnut into his mouth . He allowed that he did n't mind fat jokes if they 're funny . It was self-deprecating humor that showed Christie to be a real human being .

But the truth is that the teasing does bother Christie . And there is a serious question here beneath the laughter . Christie is grossly overweight , and his health would be a legitimate issue if he runs for president in 2016 . Which , as you may have noticed , is four years from now .

Doughnuts aside , Christie treated the matter more seriously at a news conference , saying that he 's `` remarkably healthy '' but that `` my doctor continues to warn me that my luck is going to run out relatively soon . ''

The governor showed he had lost none of his feistiness after Connie Mariano , a former White House physician , said on CNN : `` I worry that he may have a heart attack , he may have a stroke . ... I worry about this man dying in office . ''

Christie upbraided her Wednesday for diagnosing him without an examination : `` She must be a genius . She should probably be the surgeon general of the United States . '' He said she was just another hack seeking `` her five minutes on TV . ''

Well , you started it with your doughnut diplomacy , Governor .

If Christie becomes a White House contender , everything is fair game . He can hardly complain about other folks after his `` Late Show '' shtick . But I ca n't help but think it is easier for pundits to pontificate about Christie 's weight than to examine his record in Trenton .

Everyone who has worried about those extra pounds can relate to the story , but the coverage is out of hand .

If I never read another word about Michelle Obama 's behind , I may go celebrate with a Krispy Kreme .
