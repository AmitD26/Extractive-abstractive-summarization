Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of Frank Buckles , the nation 's lone living veteran of World War I , hopes he makes it to his 110th birthday about a month from now , despite troubling signs he is on the decline .

Buckles , who was born February 1 , 1901 , is thought to be the world 's oldest living war veteran . Buckles has slowed down considerably in just the past two months , according to his daughter Susannah Buckles Flanagan , who lives with him at the family home near Charles Town , in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia . A family friend who visited two weeks ago says he is awake just a few hours a day .

`` When he 's awake , he 's there with us , '' said David DeJonge , a Michigan portrait photographer who has spent the past decade documenting the final few veterans from the war that ended 92 years ago . With only one veteran left , DeJonge spends the remaining time helping Buckles represent the memory of his comrades .

Despite his advanced age , Buckles had been coming to Capitol Hill to try to persuade lawmakers to grant federal status to an existing World War I monument in Washington that was built in the 1930s . The monument currently honors only those who served from the District of Columbia .

`` I have to , '' Buckles told CNN when he came to Washington a year ago to testify as part of what he considers his responsibility to those who 've gone before him .

Although passed by the House , the legislation , known as the Frank Buckles Memorial Act , remains stalled in the Senate . Passage would bestow federal status to both the D.C. location and another WWI memorial in Kansas City , Missouri . His family is concerned he may never live to see the bill enacted .

Last month , Buckles was not strong enough and could not make a trip to Washington to review renovations as they began at the D.C. War Memorial . The National Park Service hosted a tour showing the first real improvements in decades at the site , fixing a neglected walkway and dressing up a deteriorated dome and marble columns .

Learning of Buckles ' decline , the office of Rep. Shelley Moore Capito , R-West Virginia , sent word to the family last week that `` she would like to offer her thoughts and prayers to him , '' at a time `` Mr. Buckles ' health has taken a turn for the worse . ''

As an Army corporal in what was known as the Great War , Buckles drove an ambulance in France .

Even if the monument becomes part of Buckles ' legacy , his family is concerned the Pentagon has not fully considered what can be done to honor him after his death .

His daughter says the Military District of Washington will support an honors burial at Arlington , including an escort platoon , a horse-drawn casket arrival , a band and a firing party . She has expressed concern that Army officials have told her they can not provide honor staff for any related memorial services that do n't take place at the National Cemetery .

A proposal from Rep. Ted Poe , R-Texas , calls for ceremonies in the Capitol , where Buckles ' casket would be displayed with honors . The family is concerned they would have to bear the cost of supporting the display and that the U.S military would decline to participate .

So DeJonge , the family friend who also serves as president of the WWI Memorial Foundation , told CNN he has asked American allies to help give Buckles a proper sendoff when the time comes .

`` The French are in , '' DeJonge confirmed , `` they plan to send a Defense Ministry official , and hope to contribute at least two honor guards and pallbearers . '' A British defense official has told the family that the UK would send the air-vice marshal and possibly the British ambassador .

`` It has long been my father 's wish to be buried in Arlington , in the same cemetery that holds his beloved General -LRB- John . J. -RRB- Pershing -LRB- commander of the American Expeditionary Forces in WWI -RRB- , '' Flanagan wrote , appealing for help from Sen. Joe Manchin , D-West Virginia . `` I feel confident that the right thing will come to pass . ''
