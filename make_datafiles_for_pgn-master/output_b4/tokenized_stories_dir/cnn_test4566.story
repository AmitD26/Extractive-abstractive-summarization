-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Yet again , politics and race got mixed up together today , and this time with an added bonus -- adoption .

In a segment on her MSNBC show , host Melissa Harris-Perry highlighted Mitt Romney 's family photo , in which the former GOP presidential candidate held his newly adopted African-American grandson on his knee . She encouraged her panel to `` caption that '' picture . What followed was unfortunate , thoughtless commentary from the panel . -LRB- One of the panelists , Dean Obeidallah , appears on CNN shows and writes op-eds for CNN.com . -RRB-

The exchange was a cold reminder of us of just how easy it is to flippantly do harm , and also of the dearth of understanding and sensitivity surrounding race and adoption

I am a transracial adoptee and advocate for children and families , so the complexities of race and adoption resonate on a personal level . I see myself in that Romney family photo .

I was adopted from foster care when I was about 8 months old . My white parents recall that during the adoption process , there was little conversation about race or what it meant to have a baby of another race enter the family . The `` non-identifying '' adoption records I received as an adult articulated the agency 's noncommittal stance on my race and noted that there was a birthmark present that `` could indicate '' I was of mixed race .

With the reality that race was not something that was going to be discussed , how could anyone expect me or my family to know how to deal with issues of race and adoption ? There was little to no education , so we were left to our own devices . When people did and said insensitive and cruel things , my sturdy New England parents simply loved me and cared for me the very best they could .

According to a 2007 National Survey of Adoptive Parents , about 40 % of adoptions in America are transracial -LRB- most are international adoptions -RRB- and that number is growing .

Most transracial adoptions are with white adoptive parents . While there is a strong sense of community support surrounding many intercountry adoptions -- such as from South Korea and China -- black and white adoptions tends to be more polarizing .

Thankfully , more resources are available today than during my 1971 adoption . Families can proactively seek out books , online help and support groups to be more in tune with the needs of their adopted children .

But they have to be self-starters because transracial adoption is poorly studied and not tracked appropriately . What 's lacking are longitudinal studies that focus on the transracial adoption experience . Without these , it 's difficult to create and target additional programs and support systems , indeed to even make the case that they are needed . While to many , research that would yield such information would be useful and important , it seems to fall low on the funding priority list .

Because of this , available data is old , limited and often inconsistent . This might also have something to do with issues of class , race and history that for many attend the idea of white parents adopting black and brown babies .

Today there is no set national standard for training pre-adoptive parents that want to adopt a child of another race . Some agencies make it their mission to do as much as they can to prepare families , while others simply do not include differences in race and what that means to a family as part of their training .

Against this backdrop , the misbegotten MSNBC jokes hurt . They do n't help . They are another reminder that adoptive families need to be always at the ready to support their children on matters of race and adoption . White parents will never fully understand what it means to be black or brown , but they can and should do their best to support their children .

And they should have help : Even the best adoptions managed by well-trained practitioners should offer robust post-adoption services and education that includes the language and tools to help adopted children as they grow and develop . When someone says or does something careless , the people that should know how to comfort the adopted person should not be at a loss .

I remember in my white neighborhood that people during the summer would ask me if I was a `` fresh air '' child . While I did not understand it , I got the distinct impression that I did not belong where I was for some strange reason . And kids in my school would throw out barbs such as `` at least I know who my real parents are . ''

So often , the thoughtlessness and carelessness of others results in deep pain for adoptees , who are already faced with navigating a life-ong search for identity that begins with losing their original family .

I ca n't help but feel for innocent little Kieran Romney as he is singled out at the very beginning of his adoption journey . When transracial adoption is mocked , it only works to undermine the foundation adoptees and adoptive families are trying to build . One hopes Kieran 's parents received guidance before adopting him on the challenges they could face .

Insensitivity , ignorance and intolerance will fuel negative comments . The answer is to better to prepare and educate adoptive parents , practitioners , educators and the media to the sensitivities of adoption and race . Transracially adoption children should be protected and empowered , not singled out and mocked .
