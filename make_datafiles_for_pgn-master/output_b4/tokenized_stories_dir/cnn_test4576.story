-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Icy beers , empty beaches .

It 's a compelling image , but it captures only a feeble percentage of the diversity and excellence that imbues one of the most incredible countries in the world .

Here are 10 things Mexico does better than anywhere else .

Celebrating death

Plenty of cultures do ancestor worship .

But who else turns the commemoration of their dearly departed into an annual fiesta of art , food and community ?

On November 1 , aka the Day of the Dead , Mexicans put together ofrendas -LRB- shrines -RRB- for loved ones who have passed away .

Every ofrenda includes pictures of the deceased , food , drinks , skull-shaped candies , candles and cempasuchil , the Aztec marigold or flower of the dead .

The belief is that souls of children come back to earth to visit family and friends on November 1 and the souls of adults do the same on November 2 .

Day of the Dead festivals take place across Mexico . Three of the most elaborate are held in San Andrés Mixquic -LRB- in Tláhuac , Mexico City -RRB- , Patzcuaro , Michoacán and Janitzio , Michoacán .

Horn sections

From symphony orchestras to oompah bands to soul and R&B horn sections , everyone loves a blast of brass .

Whereas most countries tend to save their horns for parties and special occasions , however , Mexico kicks out the brass jams on a daily basis .

Where else can you hear tubas -- actual tubas ! -- laying down bass lines on the radio every hour of the week ?

It all comes down to bandas , the heart of both traditional and popular genres of Mexican music .

Bandas are typically comprised of 10 to 20 musicians who play brass instruments , woodwinds and various percussion .

Every Mexico traveler is charmed by mariachi , but bandas are a part of several broader genres , the most characteristic being ranchera , quebradita and corridos .

Tequila

Mexico 's national liquor is a worldwide bar standard , with exports to 96 countries .

But do n't come to Mexico expecting to impress locals by chugging a syrupy sweet margarita or knocking down manly shots all night .

Tequila is meant to be sipped and savored , like fine whiskey , which , as any Mexican will tell you , the best tequila can compete with .

You can get a taste of the top-shelf stuff on the Tequila Trail , which includes some of the country 's most renowned distilleries .

Alternates are The Tequila Express tour operated by Casa Herradura and the Jose Cuervo Express tour .

Curing hangovers

Mexican parties are notorious for going berserk in the blink of a bleary eye .

That , of course , leads to a familiar disaster the following morning .

Fortunately , Mexico 's kitchens spring to life with the best hangover grub on the planet .

Wake up , guzzle water then inhale some spicy chilaquiles , carnitas -LRB- pork -RRB- or barbacoa -LRB- sheep -RRB- tacos with hot sauce and plenty of revitalizing grease -- maybe slam a light breakfast beer if you 're in really rough shape -- and you 'll be back making requests from the band by nightfall .

Double entendre -LRB- Albur -RRB-

Called `` albur '' in Spanish , double entendre is n't just a linguistic trick for Mexicans , it 's an art form requiring a nimble mind and the ability to convey smart but subtle messages , often laced with sexual or R-rated undertones .

Many languages , of course , employ veiled connotations and witty wordplay .

But albur is so important in Mexico that there 's a national tournament to crown the best alburero .

The current champ is Lourdes Ruiz , who 's won the competition every year since 1997 , defeating men and women . She even teaches albur courses .

Still not convinced Mexicans take double entendre more seriously than anyone else ?

What other country has a day devoted to the subtle intricacies of its language ?

In Mexico , Albur 's Day is celebrated on March 1 .

Diplomado de Albures Finos -LRB- Course of Fine/Classy Albures -RRB- classes are held at the Galería José María Velasco -LRB- Peralvillo 55 , colonia Morelos , Tepito , Mexico City -RRB- ; free admission ; participants receive a diploma .

Catholicism

Vatican City does a pretty fair job as the center of the faith and it has some decent paintings on its ceiling . But its population of 800 souls is n't exactly staggering .

Mexico , by contrast , ranks second in the world for number of Catholics -LRB- Brazil is first , the Philippines third -RRB- and , according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico , 83.9 % of the Mexicans are Catholic .

Nothing says `` Mexican Catholic '' like a reverence for the country 's seemingly endless manifestations of the Virgin Mary .

Which may be why the priest Miguel Hidalgo carried a symbolic flag of Guadalupe when he led the opening stages of the Mexican War of Independence in 1810 .

Our Lady of Guadalupe is the most venerated Virgin in Mexico , maybe the world .

The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City is also one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Mexico , reportedly the most visited Marian shrine in the world .

Each December 12 , about 5 million pilgrims from across Mexico visit the Basilica to thank the Virgin for her favors or to ask for a miracle .

Quick lunches

Known around the country as Vitamin T , tacos , tortas , tamales and tostadas are part of the everyday life .

Mexicans are constantly on the go , so it 's no wonder puestos and changarros -LRB- food stands -RRB- can be found on practically every corner .

It does n't matter if you 're in the subway , leaving school or taking a lunch break away from the office -- Mexico 's streets offer endless options for a fast and delicious meal cooked right in front of you with super-fresh ingredients .

Soap operas

In 1958 , Telesistema Mexicano produced `` Senda Prohibida '' -LRB- `` Forbidden Path '' -RRB- , the first Mexican telenovela -LRB- soap opera -RRB- .

Fifty-six years later , its successor Televisa has produced a whopping 740 telenovelas .

The formula has n't changed much .

A man and woman fall in love but , for tragic reasons , ca n't be together . After overcoming obstacles they finally get married .

Fifteen years after exporting its first soap opera , `` Los Ricos Tambien Lloran '' -LRB- `` The Rich Cry Too '' -RRB- , Televisa has found a rich market outside Mexico .

Of all countries that export soap operas , Mexico ships out the most , carving niches in other Spanish-speaking countries , as well as China , the Philippines , Israel and Saudi Arabia . -LRB- Link in Spanish . -RRB-

Televisa is n't the only network producing successful telenovelas .

TV Azteca and Argos Comunicación also create top-notch weepers .

Wrestling costumes

Professional wrestling -LRB- lucha libre -RRB- may be more Hollywood north of the border , and grittier in other countries , but nowhere is it as full of pathos as in Mexico .

Those hilarious/spooky masks are n't just fun to look at , they 're a major part of the drama .

Removing one from an opponent 's head is one of the greatest triumphs and most thrilling moments in lucha libre .

Matches are held at Arena Mexico in Mexico City on Tuesdays -LRB- 7:30 p.m. -RRB- , Fridays -LRB- 8:30 p.m. -RRB- and Sundays -LRB- 5 p.m. -RRB- . Tickets can be purchased from Ticketmaster .

Polite lies

Mexicans ' deep fear of appearing rude has given us a bred-in-the-bone aversion to uttering the word `` no . ''

Instead -- and unfortunately for those unfamiliar with the rules of courtesy here -- we 've developed a talent for white lies that allow us to say yes to fulfilling any request .

Even if we ca n't do anything about it .

White lies can be as clichéd as `` the dog ate my homework '' or as morbid as `` my beloved great aunt has suddenly developed pancreatic cancer . ''

But the granddaddy of polite lies is `` ahorita . ''

`` Ahorita '' literally means `` right now , '' but it 's almost never that .

When a Mexican tells you they 'll do something `` ahorita , '' be prepared to take a seat , because the wait can be long .

Think of ahorita as the Mexican art of procrastination -- it 's been passed from generation to generation -- a term that can mean anything from `` in 10 minutes '' to `` in three weeks . ''

Ahorita 's cousin in crime is `` I 'm on my way . ''

This really means , `` I 'm on my way to finishing this TV show , maybe getting off the couch , calling my sister , taking a shower , grabbing a snack and actually leaving home to meet you . ''

You 've been warned -- we 're great at it !
