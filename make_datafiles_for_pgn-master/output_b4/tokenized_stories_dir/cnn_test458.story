-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If you received shiny new gadgets for the holidays , you probably have some older device that is now unwanted or obsolete . If you ca n't regift your old computer , tablet or TV , make sure you get rid of it the smart way by selling , donating or recycling it .

Before you part ways with your device , make sure to wipe it clean and permanently delete any personal data .

Sell for cash

If you 'd like cash in exchange for your gently used gadgets , you can sell them online . How much money you earn depends largely on how much time and effort you 're willing to put into hawking the device . It 's easy to get caught up trying to get the best possible price for your old iPad or smartphone , and before you know it you 've wasted a chunk of your holiday vacation jockeying for an extra $ 50 .

Selling directly on sites such as Craigslist , eBay or Amazon can net the best prices , but it also comes with its own set of hassles , including the time commitment required to sign up and create a listing , as well dealing with flaky buyers .

Technology depreciates quickly , so you 're unlikely to make back the full $ 500 you spent on an iPad 2 just last year . To find out how much you can get , look at past eBay auctions for the same item . Do a search for the gadget name and select `` Completed Listings '' from the Show Only menu , then select the auction tab at the top of the list . Prices will vary according to condition . For example , an unopened Nexus 7 in the box recently went for $ 251 , while a Nexus 7 with a cracked screen sold for just $ 81 .

You can also check Pricenomics.com to see a list of current sales and a handy chart showing the average price of the device over time .

For an easier but less lucrative selling experience , consider using one of the many sites that specialize in buying used electronics . Gazelle.com buys back Apple products and some third party smartphones . NextWorth buys back iPhones and iPads , as well as cameras , e-readers , game consoles and other products . It will pay around $ 74 for a Nexus 7 in good condition . If you have an old cell phone , try ReCelluar .

Buy back kiosks are popping up across the U.S. EcoATM examines your device and offers a price based on its condition . If you decide to sell it , you 'll drop in you device and receive cash right away . You can search for the nearest EcoATM on the company 's website .

Trade for credit

If you 're going to use any profits to buy even more technology , trade-ins can offer a better deal than selling . Most major electronic retailers have established trade-in programs that offer store credit toward a future purchase .

First check with the manufacturer of your device to see what kinds of prices they 're offering . Apple has a Reuse and Recycling program that offers Apple Store credit for your old iPads , iPhones , iPods and computers . Wireless carriers including AT&T , T-Mobile and Verizon buy back old phones for store credit .

Amazon 's trade-in site will buy back Kindles as well a variety of other electronics . It even takes video games , music and movies . In exchange , you 're issued an Amazon.com gift card that you can use for any product on Amazon .

Other electronic retailers such as Best Buy , Game Stop , Target and Radio Shack offer store credit for phones , tablets , computers , TVs and more .

Donate for karma

You might not do much with the hundred or so dollars you get for that used laptop , but a local school or library could benefit greatly from having more working computers . There are many options for donating your old devices , from local charities to larger established programs .

Goodwill and Dell teamed up for the Reconnect program , which accepts donated computers at select Goodwill locations . The official site has a full list of items it will accept and locations near you . The Salvation Army also accepts used computers and electronics .

If you 're donating a cell phone , the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence , Cell Phones for Soldiers and the 911 Cell Phone Bank are just some of the many charitable projects that can do good with your old handset .

You can also call local schools or community centers directly to see if they accept donations . AmericanCellPhoneDrive.org will find nearby organizations accepting phone donations .

Recycle for the environment

If your device is too old or damaged to sell , do n't just chuck it into the trash can , recycle it . Most governments offer local options for electronics recycling . Check in your area for schedules and drop off locations . Recycling keeps dangerous chemicals out of landfills and saves natural resources by cutting down on mining and minimizing pollution resulting from manufacturing . -LRB- Recycle any batteries separately . -RRB-

Many electronics manufacturers also have mail-in and drop-off recycling programs for their old devices , including Apple , Samsung and Sony . Wireless carriers will take old flip phones at no cost .

Head to the nearest Best Buy and they will take electronics off your hands for free . In-person drop offs are also available at Office Depot and Staples , though sometimes a small fee will be charged to cover the cost of processing .
