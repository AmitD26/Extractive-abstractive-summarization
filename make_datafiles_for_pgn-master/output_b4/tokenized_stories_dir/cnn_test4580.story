-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a good thing that Barack Obama is only the president of the United States and leader of the free world , and that he does n't have a really important job like television sportscaster .

Because in that other role , as we learned a few months ago , a man is simply not allowed to publicly compliment a woman on her good looks without getting in big trouble .

Just ask Brent Musburger . In January , after the BCS National Championship game , the ESPN commentator came under fire in the media and blogosphere . At issue : off-handed comments that Musburger made about University of Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron 's girlfriend , Katherine Webb .

ESPN issued an apology , saying that the 73-year-old veteran sportscaster `` went too far '' in his commentary . In an interview with the New York Times , Michigan State University journalism professor Sue Carter called what Musburger said `` extraordinarily inappropriate . '' On the sports news website , BleacherReport.com , Jessica Isner suggested that his remarks were , at the least , `` weird and creepy . ''

It went on and on .

Opinion : Give Brent Musburger a break

So what did Musburger say back then that was so terrible ? As the camera focused on Webb , a former Miss Alabama , in the stands , the sportscaster turned to his co-announcer Kirk Herbstreit , a former quarterback at Ohio State University , and said : `` You quarterbacks , you get all the good-looking women . What a beautiful woman . ''

The cad .

Was this an overreaction ? And did Musburger get a bum rap ? Yes , and yes . But not many people said so at the time . Instead , the dominant narrative was that a public figure had succumbed to voyeurism and was essentially `` hitting on '' this young woman .

Opinion : Obama comment sexist ? I call it a compliment

By contrast , Obama is n't catching much criticism for a similar comment that he made Thursday during a swing through California . The wince-inducing remark may have been nothing more than innocent banter between old friends , as Obama supporters claimed . But it is also undeniably sexist .

How do we know ? Because the comment objectifies a professional woman , and it is not something that you 're likely to hear said about a man with the same credentials .

It all happened at a fundraising lunch Thursday in Atherton , California , as Obama was rattling off the qualities of California Attorney General Kamala Harris , who is often mentioned as a likely future gubernatorial candidate .

Those of us who live in California already know that Harris is smart , tough and likable . Now , thanks to Obama , we know something else .

`` She 's brilliant and she 's dedicated , she 's tough , '' Obama said in describing our state 's chief law enforcement officer . `` She also happens to be , by far , the best-looking attorney general in the country . ''

Obama 's ` best-looking ' quip : Appropriate in the real world ?

The fact that the crowd responded with a mixture of chuckles and groans must have signaled to the president that he had stepped in it .

`` It 's true , '' he told the crowd . `` Come on . ''

No , Mr. President , you come on . This is how you talk about a colleague , a fellow elected official , a fellow lawyer with the goods to compete head to head with any man in the country ?

All this talk about how Barack Obama is a different type of leader for a new century , one unencumbered by the prejudices and stereotypes that plagued earlier generations and one who symbolizes how far we 've come . And this is what we get ?

`` The West Wing '' meets `` Mad Men . ''

So , when a reporter for the Fresno Bee asked Patty Bellasalma , president of the California chapter of National Organization for Women , about the president 's comments , she could n't hide her disgust .

Not for the president . But for the reporter .

`` I wish -LRB- this call -RRB- was about something substantive , '' Bellasalma told the journalist . `` I think that is my reaction , is that that seems to be the only time that the California National Organization for Women gets called is n't when full-scope pregnancy coverage is being cut from the budget or something other that 's going to impact women in a detrimental way right here in this city in the state government . But we worry about whether the president thinks Kamala Harris is pretty . I guess my comment is no comment , because we 're too busy trying to protect women and girls . ''

Oh , brother . Talk about an overreaction .

On Friday , according to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney , Obama called Harris to apologize -- not for his comments , but for the `` distraction '' they created . The president , Carney said , did not want `` in any way to diminish the attorney general 's profession , accomplishments and her capabilities . '' He added that Obama `` fully recognizes the challenges women continue to face in the workplace and that they should not be judged based on appearance . ''

Harris ' communications director , Gil Duran , said in a statement that the attorney general and Obama `` have been friends for many years . They had a great conversation yesterday and she strongly supports him . ''

Those are nice statements . But they do n't end the controversy . The issue is n't just what Obama said but how folks are reacting to what he said .

There is only one reason the president is skating on these remarks . It 's because the people who normally complain about this stuff -- the folks who make up the grievance lobby -- are among his strongest supporters .

This is an example of selective outrage and double standards . That part of the story is n't pretty .

He says the remark objectifies a professional woman , and is unlikely to be said about a man
