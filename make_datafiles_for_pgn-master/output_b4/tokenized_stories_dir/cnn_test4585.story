-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was smooth sailing in the House , but things are looking much tighter in the Senate for a bipartisan budget proposal that aims to avert another government shutdown and relax sweeping forced spending cuts .

Still , despite strong opposition from Republicans to the compromise , supporters are within striking distance of rounding up the votes they need to pass it in the Senate next week .

Top aides in both parties privately expressed confidence on Friday the bill will get the necessary support , even if a couple of wary moderate Democrats end up voting `` no . ''

At least four Republicans told CNN they are committed to backing procedural votes needed to pass the measure .

That gets the 55 Senate Democrats â € '' most of whom are expected to support it -- close to the 60 votes needed to get the legislation through the chamber .

Final congressional approval of an elusive budget agreement that was overwhelmingly approved in the House and supported by the White House would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a Congress infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off .

It would also avert another government shutdown like the one in October that Americans largely blamed on Congress .

`` I think it would be outrageous to shut down the government and I 'm not going to do that to my constituents who I represent , '' said Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona .

Other key GOP members

In addition to McCain , Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , a moderate who often votes with Democrats , said she will vote for the bill . Sen. Richard Burr , R-North Carolina , and Sen. Jeff Flake , R-Arizona , said they are undecided on the bill itself , but both will vote with Democrats on the critical procedural motions .

Democrats think they have a chance of getting the support of Sen. Lisa Murkowski , R-Alaska , and Sen. Roy Blunt , R-Missouri . Each seemed to be struggling with their decision .

`` I would say it 's not as good an agreement I had hoped for but it 's a better agreement than I was afraid it might be . So I 'm certainly open to looking at it , '' Blunt said .

`` It needs to get done for a lot of good reasons ; we want to avoid a shutdown , clearly , '' Murkowski said . `` Do I like a lot of the stuff in it ? Eh , no . ''

Most GOP Senators , raising a variety of concerns , are expected to vote against the bill .

`` I 'm concerned we have once again kicked the can down now a long road , '' said Sen. Dan Coats , R-Indiana , who said he is undecided .

`` I 'm leaning strongly against it , '' said Sen. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , a veteran lawmaker who opposes some of the fees the bill raises .

Budget deal struck

The budget agreement , which was months in the making , eases spending caps for the next two fiscal years while softening the impact of across-the-board spending cuts , known as the sequester , on hard-hit defense and non-defense programs .

It does this , in part , by raising fees on airlines tickets , shrinking the retirement benefits of some veterans , extending some cuts to Medicare providers , and imposing other fees .

Current federal spending expires in mid January , raising the possibility of another shut down at that time without a new agreement in place to keep federal coffers filled .

The strong vote in the House on the budget plan on Thursday -- 332-94 -- brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters who initially thought it would sail through the Senate where bipartisanship has been more the norm than in the sharply divided House .

But after reading details of the agreement , many Senate Republicans -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill .

`` I 'd really like to stay within the caps , '' complained Sen. John Boozman , R-Arkansas . `` This busts the caps and as a result I 'll vote against it . ''

`` I believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees , '' said Sen. Lindsay Graham , R-South Carolina , in announcing his opposition .

`` We need to find a better way to save $ 6 billion than take it out of the hides of our retired veterans , '' said Sen. Roger Wicker , R-Mississippi who said he would vote against the bill .

Graham , Wicker , and Sen. Kelly Ayotte , R-New Hampshire , sent a letter to their Senate colleagues urging them to oppose the bill over the reduction in military benefits .

It was unclear if the emergence of the politically sensitive issue would increase opposition .

One Senator said outside interest groups for service members and veterans were caught off guard to the provision in the agreement and were just now beginning to mobilize against it .

Sen. Mike Johanns , R-Nebraska , said he finds the military pension issue `` bothersome ' but remains undecided on how to vote .

`` I would n't say leaning ` yes ' or leaning ` no . ' I 'm very concerned about the package but I can also see the merits of a two year deal . So I want the weekend to think about it , '' he said .

The retiring first-term lawmaker predicted the bill will pass the Senate regardless of the way he votes .

Midterm primaries , and 2016

The top Senate Republican , Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , has hinted strongly he will vote against it . He cites the weakening of budget sequester as a key complaint . The same is true for his top two lieutenants -- Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota -- both of whom have declared they will oppose the compromise .

McConnell and Cornyn are up for re-election and both facing primary challenges from the right . That might explain some of their sensitivity to giving up on the budget cuts , which are very popular with conservative voters .

Three leading tea party-backed senators -- Rand Paul of Kentucky , Ted Cruz of Texas , and Marco Rubio of Florida , -- each with 2016 presidential aspirations , also have come out against it for similar reasons .

`` The new budget deal moves in the wrong direction : it spends more , taxes more , and allows continued funding for Obamacare . I can not support it , '' Cruz said .
