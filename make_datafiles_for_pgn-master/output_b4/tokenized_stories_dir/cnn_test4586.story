-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Who was Robin Williams ?

In the wake of his death from an apparent suicide , that question looms large as fans and friends try to grasp how someone who brought so much happiness to the world could leave it under a cloud of such despair .

It 's the dichotomy of fame in that while a celebrity can be so well-known there are parts of their lives and selves they never share with the public .

And while only his loved ones truly knew the private aspects of the Oscar-winning actor whose performances could elicit tears as easily as they could giggles , Williams did allow us to see how multifaceted he could be .

These are just some of them :

The devoted dad

The last image Williams left for the world on his Instagram was a poignant one : a black and white image of the actor holding his then toddler daughter with the caption '' #tbt and Happy Birthday to Ms. Zelda Rae Williams ! Quarter of a century old today but always my baby girl . Happy Birthday @zeldawilliams Love you ! '' He posted a similar image earlier in honor of his son Zachary 's birthday .

He often spoke lovingly of being father to the pair and another son , Cody . `` My children give me a great sense of wonder , '' Williams said . `` Just to see them develop into these extraordinary human beings . ''

The prankster

Sure he was funny on-screen , but Williams also liked to pull a leg or two in real life . He told fans during a 2013 Reddit `` Ask Me Anything '' session that he once walked into a San Francisco sex shop in full Mrs. Doubtfire make-up and tried to buy a sex toy .

`` And the guy was about to sell it to me until he realized it was me -- Robin Williams -- not an older Scottish woman coming in to look for a very large -LSB- sex toy -RSB- and a jar of lube , '' Williams said . `` He just laughed and said `` what are you doing here '' and I left . ''

The husband

The actor was married three times . His union with Valerie Velardi from 1978 to 1988 produced his son Zachary . Williams was married to Marsha Garces from 1989 to 2010 , with whom he had Zelda and Cody . In 2011 , he married graphic designer Susan Schneider .

The breakups were costly for Williams , he told Parade magazine .

`` Divorce is expensive . I used to joke they were going to call it ` all the money , ' but they changed it to ` alimony . ' It 's ripping your heart out through your wallet . Are things good with my exes ? Yes . But do I need that lifestyle ? No . ''

The friend

There was a good reason Williams has been so deeply mourned by his show business colleagues . He showed himself to be incredibly loyal to friends such as Jay Leno and the late Christopher Reeve , who came to love Williams before he was famous .

After Williams ' death , Leno said , `` I saw him on stage that very first time he auditioned at the Improv in Los Angeles , and we have been friends ever since . It 's a very sad day . ''

Gilbert Gottfried : Robin Williams ' generous heart

It was while students at Juilliard in New York City that Williams and Reeve -- who would find fame in the role as Superman in the '70s and '80s -- cemented a bond . In fact , after Reeve was paralyzed in a riding accident , he credited Williams with making him laugh again .

Reeve was about to undergo a serious operation when Williams showed up dressed in surgical scrubs and speaking in a Russian accent , saying he needed to do a rectal exam . `` For the first time since the accident , I laughed , '' Reeve said . `` My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be OK . ''

The mentee

While so many younger actors looked to Williams for inspiration , he was a a huge fan of the late comedian Jonathan Winters , whom Williams discovered as a child while watching Jack Paar on `` The Tonight Show '' with his father . Years later , an adult Williams would share the `` Tonight Show '' stage with Winters and cast Winters to play his son on his hit show `` Mork & Mindy . '' When Winters died in 2013 , Williams wrote a moving appreciation of his mentor for The New York Times .

`` No audience was too small for Jonathan , '' Williams wrote . `` I once saw him do a hissing cat for a lone beagle . ''

The edgy actor

His skills as a zany funny man were legendary , but Williams could also deliver riveting dramatic performances .

2002 was especially a break-out year for him as he played a killer in the film `` Insomnia '' and a stalker photo technician in `` One Hour Photo . '' Williams not only changed his look for the latter to play Seymour `` Sy '' Parrish but he said in an interview that to prepare , he `` watched some interviews with serial killers -- ` Psychotics Through the Ages . ' It 's a collectible tape from Time-Life Books . But basically , it was using the material and extrapolating from there . ''

It 's a role that still astonishes .

`` Williams ' finely calibrated performance was utterly free of the tics and affectations that are so tempting to someone who has come to count on and crave the audience 's love , '' Washington Post critic Ann Hornaday writes . `` Rather than seek his fans ' approval with the actorly equivalent of ingratiating winks , Williams was willing to completely inhabit a character who was somehow terrifying , pathetic , creepy and vulnerable all at once . ''

The philanthropist

As one of the co-hosts for Comic Relief 's debut in 1986 , he helped raise both funding for and awareness about the homeless . But that was just one of the many charities to which Williams gave his time and resources .

Robin Williams ' legacy : A big heart for charity

`` Robin came from a family with money -- he was brought up with a silver spoon in his mouth , and I think he felt so blessed that he wanted to do something for people who were n't brought up like that , '' Comic Relief founder Bob Zmuda told The Los Angeles Times .

The sports enthusiast

Williams involvement with sports went beyond that time he dressed up a as Denver Broncos ' cheerleader for an episode of `` Mork & Mindy . ''

Robin Williams : His passion for cycling

Die-hard fans remember his hilarious stand-up routine about the origins of golf , and he would often end up on the cam at various sporting events . The actor was a close personal friend of then-professional cyclist Lance Armstrong , who he would join in training .

The sci-fi geek

Perhaps it was playing an alien that did it .

It turns out that Williams was a bit of a sci-fi geek who when asked his favorite book said , `` Oh my God , Isaac Asimov 's Foundation trilogy . It 's one of the greatest books of all time , and the greatest character is The Mule . ''

The man who struggled

As shocking as his death has been , Williams was open about his issues with substance abuse and stints in rehab . He blamed his relapse into drinking for helping to end his second marriage .

`` You know , I was shameful , and you do stuff that causes disgust , and that 's hard to recover from , '' Williams told The Guardian in 2010 . `` You can say , ` I forgive you ' and all that stuff , but it 's not the same as recovering from it . It 's not coming back . ''

Robin Williams and the dark side of comedy

Even then it seemed that Williams was trying to find his way . Asked whether he was happier in his life , he responded `` I think so . And not afraid to be unhappy . That 's OK too . And then you can be like , all is good . And that is the thing , that is the gift . ''
