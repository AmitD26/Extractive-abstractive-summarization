-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thailand 's new military ruler has added a personal touch to his junta 's post-coup charm offensive , penning the lyrics to a patriotic ballad vowing to `` return happiness '' to the country .

Performed by the Royal Thai Army band , the song , `` Return Happiness to Thailand , '' has so far racked up more than 200,000 views on YouTube since it was released on Friday . It is played regularly on Thai radio and television and has featured at the military 's goodwill concerts around the country .

Colonel Krisada Sarika , head of the Royal Thai Army band , was quoted in Thai media as saying Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha had rattled off the lyrics , in his own handwriting , in about an hour .

The song includes the couplet : `` Let us be the ones who step in before it is too late / To bring back love , how long will it take ? ''

Since the May 22 coup d'etat , the country 's 12th in 82 years , Thailand 's junta has embarked on an unprecedented PR campaign to win hearts and minds in a divided country .

The National Council for Peace and Order , as the regime calls itself , has held public festivals featuring mini-skirted dancers , free haircuts , petting zoos and stands where the attendees can take `` selfies '' with soldiers . On Sunday , the regime is promising free tickets to screenings of a patriotic movie across the country .

Thitinan Pongsudhirak , a political science professor at Bangkok 's Chulalongkorn University , said the PR campaign was far more intense than those following previous coups .

`` Earlier coups did not require as much PR campaigning because public expectations and media tools of scrutiny at home and abroad were less pervasive and powerful , '' he said .

The campaign has been conducted under the banner of `` happiness . '' On Friday , Prayuth delivered the first of a planned weekly TV and radio broadcast , `` Returning Happiness to the People , '' in which he repeatedly struck on the concept while outlining his junta 's vision .

`` We need to solve many issues ; from administration to the budget system , corruption , and even the starting point of democracy itself -- the election . Parliamentary dictatorship has to be removed . All these have caused conflict and unhappiness among Thai people , '' he said , in comments questioning whether Thailand was ready for democracy .

`` We intend to return happiness to everyone living in Thailand . ''

But the cheery overtures have been accompanied by an unrelenting crackdown on dissent , with hundreds of people rounded up , including academics , journalists , activists and politicians .

The junta has urged government officials to identify potential troublemakers among their colleagues , and issued warnings about liking dissenting posts on social media or flashing the three-fingered anti-coup salute co-opted from the Hunger Games films .

Pavin Chachavalpongpun , a Thai associate professor of Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University , described the happiness campaign as a `` gimmick , '' and a `` very crude form of populism '' that was unlikely to work .

`` I do n't think the majority of Thais will buy into this happiness project , because there is nothing to be happy about when your basic human rights have been taken away , when you can not even express how you feel in public peacefully , '' he said .

`` The reality is they 're continuing to hunt down and harass people . Happiness versus a climate of fear -- it does n't go together . ''

Thitinan said he believed the campaigning might help the regime , but only in the short-term .

`` Initially , the hearts-and-minds campaigns will seem to hold promise because of the complete dominance of the new regime and the lack of alternatives , '' he said .

`` But it would be surprising if these superficial and manufactured approaches succeed in resolving such deep-seated conflicts that have built up over many years . ''
