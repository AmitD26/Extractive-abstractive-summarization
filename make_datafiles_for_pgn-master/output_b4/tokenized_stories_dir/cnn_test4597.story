-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A spokesman for a national registry of radiologic technologists declined Friday to say whether the group was aware of a 2010 incident in which David Kwiatkowski allegedly tested positive for illegal drugs and was fired from an Arizona hospital .

After being fired from the Phoenix hospital , Kwiatkowski went on to work at four more hospitals in four other states .

He was arrested this month in New Hampshire in connection with stealing drugs from a hospital , and it 's believed he infected 30 people in that state with hepatitis C through infected syringes .

Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire said it consulted the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists before hiring Kwiatkowski and he held the required certification for his cardiovascular tech position .

The registry 's website says Kwiatkowski 's certification was `` summarily suspended '' as of July 2012 .

Kwiatkowski was working at Arizona Heart Hospital in 2010 when a fellow employee found him passed out in the men 's bathroom , according to documents obtained by CNN .

`` I looked in the toilet and spotted a 5 cc syringe and a needle floating in the water , '' the employee said in a statement submitted to the Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency . `` The label was a blue fentanyl label ... He then said ` Shit ... I am going to jail . ' ''

Fentanyl is a powerful narcotic frequently used in hospitals . Kwiatkowski flushed the syringe and needle down the toilet , according to the employee .

Kwiatkowski was immediately fired from Arizona Heart Hospital , according to a hospital spokeswoman . He then relinquished his license as a radiologic technologist .

`` I do n't have the resources nor money to fight the accusations , '' Kwiatkowski wrote at the time .

A few weeks later , he was working at Temple University Hospital in Pennsylvania , and then went on to work in Kansas and Georgia before working in New Hampshire .

The agency that placed Kwiatkowski in the Arizona job reported the incident to the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists , according to a spokeswoman for the agency , Springboard , Inc. .

A spokesman for the national registry said they 're investigating the allegations against Kwiatkowski . `` Because we have strict confidentiality policies , the status of an ongoing investigation is not released , '' the registry said in a statement .

Christopher Cook , a spokesman for the registry , declined to comment further .

The director of the Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency said officials stopped their investigation when Kwiatkowski moved out of state .

`` We had no jurisdiction , '' said Aubrey Godwin . `` If drugs or alcohol were involved , we would want to get blood tests done , but he was out of state , so it was sort of hard to implement . ''

An expert in so-called `` drug diversion '' said it 's not uncommon for healthcare professionals to leave a state when they 're being investigated for drug use .

`` They just move on to the next job , '' said John Burke , president of the National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators . `` This is a much bigger problem than most people realize . ''

Godwin , the director of the Arizona licensing board , said he 's not sure if his group reported the 2010 incident to the national registry .

`` It 's not clear . I ca n't say . It would have been just a phone call , and I do n't remember a phone call , but I 'm not sure on that one , '' he told CNN .

In the Exeter case , Kwiatkowski has been charged with obtaining controlled substances by fraud and tampering with a consumer product , namely a hospital syringe , according to an affidavit filed in federal court . He is suspected of stealing fentanyl , the affidavit said .

Hepatitis C is considered to be among the most serious of hepatitis viruses . It is typically asymptomatic , going undetected until liver damage shows up , according to the Mayo Clinic .

New Hampshire 's health department is asking everyone who was a patient in Exeter 's operating rooms and the intensive care unit between April 1 , 2011 , and May 25 of this year be tested .

Those are two areas that Kwiatkowski visited during his `` routine duties to transport patients , '' an Exeter Hospital statement said . But it added he `` was not involved with procedures or patient care . ''

Exeter , in a statement , said it conducted a background check and took other steps before hiring Kwiatkowski full time .

U.S. Attorney John P. Kacavas said his office interviewed employees at Exeter who said they had seen Kwiatkowski acting strangely , one time sweating profusely and with bloodshot eyes .

`` One of them described him as unfit to provide medical care and his supervisor sent him home , '' Kacavas said . `` He provided a plausible explanation for his condition , which was that he had been crying his eyes out because his aunt had died and he was an emotional wreck . ''

According to state , county and hospital officials , he worked as a radiology technician and medical technician in cardiac catheterization labs in the following locations :

-- Oakwood Annapolis Hospital in Wayne , Michigan , January to September 2007 ;

-- Saint Francis Hospital , Poughkeepsie , New York , November 2007 to February 2008 ;

-- UPMC Presbyterian , Pittsburgh , March 2008 to May 2008 ;

-- Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center , May 2008 to November 2008 ;

-- Southern Maryland Hospital , Clinton , Maryland , December 2008 to February 2009 ;

-- Maryvale Hospital , Phoenix , March to June 2009 ;

-- Johns Hopkins Hospital , Baltimore , July 2009 to January 2010 ;

-- Maryland General Hospital , Baltimore , January 2010 to March 2010 ;

-- Arizona Heart Hospital , Phoenix , March 2010 to April 2010 ;

-- Temple University Hospital , Philadelphia , April 2010 ;

-- Hays Medical Center , Hays , Kansas , May 2010 to September 2010 ;

-- Houston Medical Center , Warner Robins , Georgia , October 2010 to March 2011 .

-- Exeter Hospital , Exeter , New Hampshire , April 2011 to July 2012 .

Institutions say they are calling former patients and offering free testing , and that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is helping state health officers and hospitals tackle the problem .

Kwiatkowski was arrested earlier this month after police found him in a Massachusetts hotel room `` in an intoxicated state '' and took him to a hospital , the affidavit states . He is now being held in the Strafford County , New Hampshire , jail . He could face more than 20 years in prison if convicted .

Kwiatkowski appeared in New Hampshire federal court Tuesday and waived his right to a detention hearing . Kacavas said it is possible more charges could be filed .

Bjorn Lange , a public defender representing Kwiatkowski , told CNN Friday he would have no comment .
