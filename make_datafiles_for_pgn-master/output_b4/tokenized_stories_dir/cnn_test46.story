-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For the elite basketball stars of the NBA and WNBA , winning Olympic gold is a given . Silver is for the losers .

The U.S. men 's team has been champion 13 out of 16 times since 1936 . American women have topped the podium six out of eight .

`` Second place is unacceptable , '' says legendary center Hakeem Olajuwon , who was in the U.S. `` Dream Team '' that topped the podium in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics .

With teammates such as Shaquille O'Neal , Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen , the Nigerian-American , who was born in Lagos , quickly came to realize that reality .

`` Coming to the United States , being there for so long , then it becomes -- you are expected to win gold , '' he told CNN 's Aiming for Gold show .

Olajuwon , who is rated one of the greatest 50 NBA players of all time , came into the Atlanta Games having helped Houston Rockets win back-to-back NBA titles in 1994 and 1995 .

Security presence

While he enjoyed winning Olympic gold , the sheer fame of the Dream Team left them surrounded by an all-pervading security presence and he felt he missed out on the Games experience .

`` We ca n't go anywhere -- we were n't even free to go to the -LRB- athletes ' -RRB- village . So it was a different experience from that perspective .

`` The opening day you get all the different athletes but after that , of course , for security issues the Dream Team were by themselves . ''

But he added : `` The Olympic gold medal is a huge accomplishment and so is my career with NBA basketball . I 'm just happy that I get the opportunity to accomplish both . ''

Olajuwon retired in 2002 but is still involved in the game , acting as a mentor for the likes of current superstars LeBron James and Kobe Bryant .

Argentina 's Luis Scola followed in Olajuwan 's footsteps at Houston Rockets and to the top of the Olympic podium .

The Nightmare Team

The forward center achieved the feat at the 2004 Games in Athens , on the way beating a U.S. lineup which acquired the unfortunate label of `` The Nightmare Team . ''

It was a stunning upset , but proof that the rest of the world had raised their standards to match America 's NBA elite .

`` I take a lot of pride in the gold medal because of the whole experience that happened behind it , '' he told CNN .

`` When you talk to somebody here in the U.S. and they find out you played in the Olympics and they are like , ` Wow , the Olympics ? ' ` Yeah . ' ` How did you do ? ' ` We won it . ' They are stunned , they can not believe it really . ''

U.S. basketball chiefs were sufficiently stunned to revamp its organization and coaching staff so by the 2008 Olympics in Beijing traditional dominance had been restored .

Scola and his Argentina teammates took the bronze medal in China .

He will be in an Argentina squad attempting to cause another upset at the 2012 Olympics in London , but believes U.S. success is almost inevitable .

`` There are three big sports here : baseball , American football and basketball . Basketball is really the only one that 's played in the Olympics . So I think that plays a role too .

`` There 's a lot of talent in the U.S. , a lot of talent . There 's 10 different teams you can pick players from and that will be a very good team and eventually you can win a medal or a gold medal , no question about that . ''

Women 's star

For WNBA legend Lisa Leslie , defeat at the Olympics just was n't an option . She played in four Games and won four golds with an all-conquering U.S. squad from 1996 to 2008 .

`` I really loved that moment of being on the podium and having the gold medal placed around my neck , just listening to the chants and listening to our national anthem -- that always gives me chills , '' she told CNN .

`` That was my favorite sports moment . ''

Boosted by her record 488 points , 241 rebounds and 36 blocked shots in Olympic competition , Leslie and her teammates had a remorseless winning attitude .

`` Our main goal was one game at a time , one country , one goal , and that 's to win a gold medal . ''

Leslie , who retired from the Los Angeles Sparks in 2009 , will go down in history as the first woman to complete a slam dunk in a professional game .

The six foot five inch center achieved the feat in 2002 and went on to make it her trademark during a glittering career .
