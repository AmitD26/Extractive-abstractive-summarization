-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sri Lanka , the teardrop-shaped island that in 2009 emerged from more than a quarter century of civil war , has staked claim as one of Asia 's most exciting new destinations .

With the beaches of Negombo and Galle on the West Coast and World Heritage-listed ancient cities , Sri Lanka is experiencing a tourism boom .

As the country 's tourism offerings have grown more sophisticated , so have its hotels . Here are a selection of the best .

Reefs Edge

It 's only 20 minutes from the capital Colombo , but stand on the balcony of Reefs Edge and you 'll feel like you 're on a deserted island .

The view of the Indian Ocean is obstructed only by palm trees , affording guests front-row seats to blood red and beautiful sunsets .

A velvet green lawn runs 20 meters from the hotel to the beach , where sun beds and wicker domes beckon layabouts and drinkers of cocktails .

Though it has only 22 suites , Reefs Edge has the look and feel of a large hotel .

Inside , French oak flooring , pastel-colored furniture and open-air bathrooms decked out with rain showers and glass washbasins creating an aura of simple sophistication .

Complete with a day spa , gymnasium , steam room , seafood restaurant and a separate 250-seat banquet hall shaped like Noah 's Ark , Reefs Edge takes the edge off a vacation in Sri Lanka .

Reefs Edge , 300 Old Colombo Road , Uswetakeiyawa , Sri Lanka ; +94 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 11 789 1111 ; double standard room with breakfast $ 100 per night

St. Lachlan

Twenty minutes north of Reefs Edge , Negombo is Sri Lanka 's most popular beachside town , thanks to its proximity to the international airport .

Located in a quiet alleyway perpendicular to the main drag , the St. Lachlan is a boutique property with 16 rooms and suites .

The interior speaks colonial cool : it has 10-foot-high doors with giant brass knockers , richly varnished shutters and teak furniture everywhere you look , with antlers and indigenous artwork accentuating the walls .

A riot of giant freshwater prawns , snapper and spices , the seafood platter at Arias , St. Lachlan 's poolside restaurant , is among the best in Negombo .

Little wonder -- it 's run by Harpo Gooneratne , commonly known as Sri Lanka 's first DJ and popular restaurateur .

St. Lachlan , 25 St. Anthony 's Lane , Poruthtota Road , Negombo ; +94 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 31 227 5000 ; standard room $ 115 per night

Heritance Tea Factory

Take Willy Wonka 's Chocolate Factory and replace the chocolate with tea . Now convert it into a luxury hotel .

The result is the Heritance Tea Factory , a resplendent four-star hotel set at 2,000 meters above sea level in the rolling green tea-growing region of Sri Lanka 's southern highlands .

Latticed with green and red metal and brass , the hotel 's museum-like lobby is wallpapered with historic photographs . It 's centered around an atrium that houses the factory 's original steam engine .

Every evening , this mechanical colossus with its giant gears and camel-hair conveyer belt is turned on for 30 minutes .

The 54 rooms are carpeted and cozy , while the staff , attired in crisp white shirts , bow ties and bell hats , personify the sophistication of the British colonial period .

Jetwing Vil Uyana

Like something out of Luke Skywalker 's Tatooine , Sigiriya Rock Fortress is an ancient palace set atop a 200-meter-high natural stone column .

At the rock 's base lie a series of pools and cisterns . They 're interlinked by an underground conduit network that works as well today as it did when it was built 1,500 years ago .

Matching its sophistication is Vil Uyana , a luxurious ecolodge set in a wetland a 15-minute drive from Sigiriya .

Vil Uyana 's 30 chalets feature teak floors , palm-thatch ceilings , Balinese bathrooms and woven reed wall hangings .

Edging a mauve green lake brimming with birdlife , the swimming pool and lobby lead to a colonial-chic restaurant upstairs bookended by six-meter-high stone walls that are a nod to Sigiriya 's ancient architects .

Palagama Beach

In 2008 , while visiting his father 's family in Colombo , British advertising executive John Balmond snuck off for the weekend to the Kalpitiya Peninsula a two-hour drive to the north .

He stayed in a banana-leaf bungalow , one of three accommodation properties on the lush , palm-fringed finger of land that divides the Puttalam Lagoon from the Indian Ocean .

Today there are 42 properties on the peninsula , including Palagama Beach , owned by Balmond and designed by Cecil Balmond -LRB- designer of London Olympics Orbit -RRB- .

Set on a grassy parcel of land on the beach , the property features 14 generously spaced cabanas and villas that blend modern amenities , luxury touches and village style .

Other highlights include an infinity-edged pool , a restaurant and a banana-leaf bar/moonlight cinema .

Pledge3

Sri Lanka 's most sophisticated hotel is Pledge3 , a five-star oasis of luxury and retro style in busy Negombo .

Every corner of this boutique hotel screams cutting edge design .

The 12 suites are spread across two floors surrounding an internal flagstone courtyard .

The third floor is home to two apartment-size attic suites featuring executive work stations , private terraces and glass-encased bathrooms outfitted with his and her washbasins , egg-shaped bathtubs and presidential toilet bowls -LRB- whatever that means -RRB- .

The courtyard leads to an open-air restaurant where the decor -- cherry red support beams and white leather couches -- is as eccentric as the Japanese-Sri Lankan-Mediterranean fusion menu .

Beyond it lies a tropical garden centered by a saltwater pool where attendants with the reflexes of Wimbledon ball boys attend to guests ' every beck and call .

Pledge3 , 3 Kattuwa Road , Negombo , Sri Lanka ; +94 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 31 222 4005 ; deluxe double suite with breakfast $ 305 , or $ 405 for an attic suite per night
