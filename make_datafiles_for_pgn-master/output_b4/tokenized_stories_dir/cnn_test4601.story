-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After an apparent attempted military coup on Saturday , the people of the African nation of Lesotho are doing their best to return to every day life .

According to the South African Department of International Relations , Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has been forced into hiding because of the unfolding security situation and out of fear for his life .

Thabane became Prime Minister in 2012 and the next elections are due in 2017 .

During an interview that aired Saturday with South African broadcaster eNCA , he told the broadcaster he would not resign his position .

Lesotho has been praised for its coalition government and a peaceful handover of power in 2012 . But over the past few months , its growing instability had been a cause for alarm in the international community .

The whereabouts of the deputy prime minister , Mothetjoa Metsing , are also unknown . He has not officially taken power -- although it would be constitutional for him to do so , since the Prime Minister is not fulfilling his duties .

Sometimes referred to as the `` Kingdom of the Sky , '' Lesotho is completely landlocked by South Africa and is the only country in the world where all of the land lies above 1,000 meters -LRB- 3,280 feet -RRB- in elevation .

It has a predominantly Christian population of nearly 2 million people and covers an area slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Maryland , according to the World Factbook .

It has been independent from the United Kingdom since 1966 but continues on as a member of the 53-nation Commonwealth .

Residents return to normal

After Saturday 's unrest , Maseru , the nation 's capital , was calm .

Despite the early-morning chaos and confusion , as all radio stations were temporarily muzzled , by afternoon most residents had returned to their normal Saturday activities .

Since Friday was payday , many people withdrew cash from the ATMs , paid utility bills and shopped for groceries .

At one main supermarket , one woman wondered aloud , `` Who knows what may happen tomorrow or Monday ? ''

On the streets , thousands milled about .

Cows grazed by the side of the road . A trio of buddies lounged in wheelbarrows , soaking in the winter sun . Older women shuffled along the sidewalk , bundled in blankets . And amid the traffic , a wedding caravan honked , as the bride stuck her head out the window , ululating .

No signs of the military were anywhere to be seen .

Nereah Lebona owns a small beauty salon . She says she heard shooting around 4 in the morning , as she lives near police headquarters , where the main standoff occurred . But that did n't keep her from beautifying clients hours later .

`` I was worried , until the radio came back on and told us what had happened , '' said Lebona , 36 , smiling . `` But how else do I earn money if I do n't go to work ? ''

A stone 's throw away was more evidence that locals were carrying on as if nothing had happened and life had already returned to normal : a Lesotho Premier League soccer match . One of the teams was that of the Lesotho military .

Among the hundreds of spectators , one man named Thabo giddily noted , `` The same soldiers who were shooting this morning are now playing football ! ''

This tiny mountain kingdom has been faced with many tall challenges .

Lesotho has the world 's second-highest rate of HIV infection -- 23 % -- and a 40 % malnutrition rate for children younger than 5 .

The country is also known for its `` herd boys , '' children as young as 5 who tend flocks of cattle in remote locations and often miss out on education . Britain 's Prince Harry established a charity , Sentebale , to help the country meet educational challenges .

But residents in Maseru are prepared for more uncertainty -- some fearing that an opposition demonstration planned for Monday could turn violent .

Officials urge peace

Thabane told eNCA the Lesotho government is seeking the assistance of the South African government and other neighboring states .

Clayson Monyela , a spokesman from the Department of International Relations of South Africa , said the government has no immediate plans to send troops into Lesotho , but the South African government is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to consult with Southern African Development Community countries and the African Union Commission .

`` We ca n't have coups d'etat in 2014 . If there are political problems people must sit -LRB- down -RRB- and talk , '' said Monyela .

Monyela added that the Lesotho military 's actions `` bear the hallmarks of a coup d'etat . ''

Kamalesh Sharma , secretary-general of the Commonwealth of Nations , condemned the reported coup attempt and urged the military in Lesotho to respect civilian authority , constitutional order and the rule of law .

In a written statement , Sharma called for respect and urged all parties to `` refrain from violence and work together towards a peaceful and lasting resolution . ''

`` There is zero tolerance in the Commonwealth of any unconstitutional overthrow of an elected government , '' the statement read . `` Democracy and the rule of law are central tenets of our association ... and any action to subvert constitutional civilian rule is unacceptable . ''

Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma , chairwoman of the African Union Commission , echoed this sentiment in a written statement , saying that the AU `` will not tolerate any seizure of power by illegal means '' and giving `` full support '' to the SADC in addressing the challenges facing Lesotho .

Jen Psaki , a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department , said the United States `` is deeply concerned by clashes between security forces today in Lesotho . '' Psaki called upon all parties to `` remain committed to a peaceful political dialogue and to follow democratic processes '' in order to resolve the conflict .

CNN 's Nana Karikari-apau , Joshua Berlinger and Kay Guerrero reported from Atlanta . Michael J. Jordan reported from Lesotho .
