-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Storms in the lower Mississippi valley Tuesday night unleashed baseball-sized hail , high winds and twisters , including one that lifted a tractor-trailer , the National Weather Service said .

Meteorologists from Texas to Kentucky , a day after a similar round of storms , were flooded Tuesday evening with reports of severe storms or tornado touchdowns and resulting damage .

According to the agency 's Storm Prediction Center , there were 29 tornado reports -- many in northeast Texas -- by late Tuesday , but the actual number had not been confirmed .

Matt Bishop with the weather service 's Fort Worth office said the staff had heard of multiple reports of damage in northeastern Texas , although he was unaware of any injuries .

`` We 're in the middle of a severe weather outbreak , '' he said at 7:45 p.m. .

At least two rounds of storms had struck Kaufman , Texas , about 30 miles east of Dallas , by Tuesday evening and another was on the way .

`` It 's a little bit of everything around us , '' said Kaufman Sheriff 's Office spokeswoman Pat Laney . `` It 's been a chaotic afternoon . ''

She had heard of some damage , but no reports of injuries . `` We 've been very blessed , '' Laney said .

Two reported tornadoes touched down in Coahoma County , Mississippi , said emergency management director Johnny Tarzi . Two homes were destroyed in the city of Coahoma and five were heavily damaged in Friars Point , with about 15 sustaining minor damage .

Trees and homes also were reportedly damaged at Moon Lake , said Tarzi . There were no immediate reports of injuries .

Coahoma County is in western Mississippi , near the Arkansas border .

The Little Rock , Arkansas , office received reports of hail , downed tree limbs and the incident involving the tractor-trailer in Coy , on U.S. 165 , said forecaster Brian Smith .

About 24,000 people lost power Tuesday night in the Memphis , Tennessee , area .

A twister was reported at Marion , Arkansas , west of Memphis .

`` It 's going to be a busy night , '' said Z.E. Ingram of the weather service 's Memphis office .

The Shreveport , Louisiana , office issued about 15 tornado warnings , and had received many reports of funnel clouds and tornado touchdowns , meteorologist intern Matt Hemingway said .

Meteorologists at the Tulsa , Oklahoma , office tracked a string of storms and possible tornado activity near Fort Smith , Arkansas , said forecaster Chuck Hodges . There were reports of hail and winds reaching 80 mph near Fort Smith .

Forecasters issued a tornado watch for northeastern Texas , southeastern Oklahoma , eastern Arkansas , southeastern Illinois , western Kentucky , southeast Missouri , northwest Mississippi , western Tennessee , eastern Illinois , much of Indiana , northwestern Ohio and much of Michigan until 10 p.m. .

This is a `` particularly dangerous situation , '' the Weather Service 's Storm Prediction Center in Norman , Oklahoma , said of the outlook for tornadoes . Destructive tornadoes , softball-size hail , wind gusts to 70 mph and dangerous lightning are possible in and near this watch area .

The bad weather extended to the east . A tornado warning was issued Tuesday afternoon in Rome , New York . `` Very large hail and damaging winds '' can also be expected , forecasters said .

Typically , only a handful of days per year reach high-risk criteria , said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen .

On Wednesday , portions of Kentucky and Tennessee will be at moderate risk of severe thunderstorms , along with northeast and east-central Mississippi , the northern half of Alabama and northwest Georgia , the Storm Prediction Center said . An area between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains is `` likely to see a widespread/potentially dangerous severe weather event , '' forecasters said .

The stage may be set for a potential record-breaking month for tornadoes nationwide , according to the center . The long-term average for confirmed tornadoes in April is 116 . The previous record for April is 267 confirmed tornadoes in 1974 , which includes the historic `` superoutbreak '' of April 3 and 4 that year . According to the center , the likely total of confirmed tornadoes through April 24 is between 200 and 275 .

In Arkansas , more than 60,000 people were without power Tuesday after a rash of severe storms tore through the state Monday , leaving 10 dead and destroying more than a dozen homes .

According to the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management , four fatalities were storm-related and six resulted from flooding .

In Faulkner County , at least four people died in the severe thunderstorms , according to Faulkner County Office of Emergency Management spokesman Stephen Hawk .

Two people died in Madison County , one in Washington County , two in Benton County and one in Perry County .

Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe toured the Faulkner County town of Vilonia on Tuesday , telling CNN affiliate KATV , `` These folks have suffered some terrible losses . ''

House-to-house searches were being conducted in Vilonia , Hawk said . About 15 houses are destroyed , he said , and `` within the three-mile path of the storm , everything was affected . There are untold numbers of affected houses ... The only grocery store in town , the roof was pretty much torn off . ''

On Monday night , Madison County Sheriff Phillip Morgan said the bodies of an elderly man and woman were found after floodwaters swept away the couple 's car on Highway 23 south of Huntsville , in northwest Arkansas . The deaths are attributed to rising flood waters along War Eagle Creek .

Also in northwest Arkansas , the Washington County Sheriff 's Office confirmed the death of 38-year-old Consuelo Santillano , who authorities say was swept away by rapidly moving water across Highway 265 South .

And a possible tornado struck Little Rock Air Force Base in central Arkansas , damaging at least 100 housing units and knocking out power to some parts of the base , military officials said .

Bob Oldham , a spokesman for the base , reported two minor injuries and some damage to aircraft at the base .

Beebe told CNN later in the day that three C-130s were damaged to the point that , according to preliminary reports , they are inoperable `` without significant repairs . ''

The state also saw seven deaths in an earlier round of severe weather this month .

Other parts of the state were flooded after several days of unceasing rain .

Steve Wilkes of Fayetteville said his house was spared damage from a nearby flooded creek , but some of his friends are dealing with flooded basements .

`` I 've lived here for more than 20 years . I 've never seen anything like this in my life , '' Wilkes said . `` I saw water 2 to 3 feet deep across roadways that have never flooded . ''

In various parts of the state , the storms flipped over cars , damaged homes and knocked out power to tens of thousands , emergency management officials said . Some areas reported gusts of up to 70 mph .
