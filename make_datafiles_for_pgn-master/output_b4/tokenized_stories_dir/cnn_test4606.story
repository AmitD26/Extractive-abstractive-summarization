Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A year later , President Barack Obama will likely talk differently about Syria .

He addresses the nation Wednesday night to offer his strategy for `` degrading and ultimately destroying '' the ISIS jihadists who have swept across northern Iraq from Syria .

Exactly one year earlier -- on September 10 , 2013 -- Obama also spoke to the nation from the White House to explain why he called off asking Congress to approve air strikes on Syria over its use of chemical weapons .

A lot has changed in the ensuing 12 months , particularly the rise of the Sunni extremists who call themselves the Islamic State and who seek dominance over a swath of the Middle East .

Here 's a look at what Obama has learned about Syria in the past year :

1 -RRB- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is n't going anywhere

`` I have resisted calls for military action , because we can not resolve someone else 's civil war through force , particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan , '' Obama said last year .

While he added that the United States had no interest in removing another dictator from power , he hoped the tide of the Syrian civil war would go against al-Assad to force him out .

Instead , the Syrian leader got help from Hezbollah in Lebanon and , indirectly , from ISIS fighters who formed out of al Qaeda affiliates to seize the advantage over what U.S. and allied officials call the moderate opposition in Syria .

That forced Obama to start providing military aid to opposition forces it considers legitimate and like-minded to Western desires for democratic governance in Syria .

2 -RRB- Al Qaeda affiliates in Syria posed a broader threat

`` It 's true that some of Assad 's opponents are extremists , '' Obama said of al Qaeda fighters who worked against the Syrian government .

He added that failure to respond militarily to al-Assad 's use of chemical weapons would allow al Qaeda to `` draw strength in a more chaotic Syria . ''

In the end , there was no U.S. military response after Britain 's Parliament voted against taking part and Obama knew he would lack congressional approval .

While al-Assad gave up his known chemical weapon stockpiles , Obama 's prediction came true as ISIS fighters comprising remnants of al Qaeda strengthened dramatically enough to rampage through northern Iraq .

3 -RRB- The question of U.S. military action in Syria is complex

`` I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria , '' Obama said a year ago . `` I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan . I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo . ''

Now he may propose some kind of air campaign against ISIS targets in Syria , and voices in Congress are calling for ground troops from a coalition military force -- but no Americans .

The issue raises major geopolitical questions involving who would benefit or be harmed by military strikes in Syria , as well as the legality of doing so without approval from al-Assad 's government .

Attacking ISIS in Syria stands to benefit al-Assad by weakening what has become an internal enemy and allowing him to portray his country 's civil war as a battle against terrorists opposed by the United States .

Strikes by a U.S.-backed coalition in Syria also would give Russia , al-Assad 's main backer , fodder to justify its own border incursions in Ukraine .

4 -RRB- Secure the coalition first

`` I have , therefore , asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path , '' Obama said last year after Britain rejected joining a coalition to attack Syria over its chemical weapons .

This time , he is expected to detail support from global allies -- including some Middle Eastern countries -- in going after ISIS wherever the threat exists , possibly including Syria .

In addition , many in Congress question if Obama needs congressional approval to launch air strikes on ISIS in Syria , with several legislators saying Tuesday they doubted a vote would occur before November elections .

5 -RRB- It 's an election year

`` America is not the world 's policeman , '' Obama said last year . `` Terrible things happen across the globe , and it is beyond our means to right every wrong . ''

But when `` moderate effort and risk '' by the United States can stop atrocities halfway around the world to make America safer , `` I believe we should act , '' he added then . `` That 's what makes America different . That 's what makes us exceptional . With humility , but with resolve , let us never lose sight of that essential truth . ''

Expect to hear the same thing Wednesday night , less than two months before the congressional elections , as the President straddles the political fault line between conservative calls for exerting military power and liberal opposition to a renewed war footing .

His goal is to satisfy moderates and independents crucial to Democratic hopes of holding on to control of the Senate while not angering the party 's liberal base .
