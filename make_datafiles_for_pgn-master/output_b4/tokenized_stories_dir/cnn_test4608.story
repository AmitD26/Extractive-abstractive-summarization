-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Psy 's new song `` Hangover '' featuring Snoop Dogg dropped three days ago and the video has already racked up more than 31 million views on YouTube .

That 's actually a pretty slow start for the Korean superstar , considering `` Gangnam Style '' became the first video to pass two billion hits a week ago , while his follow-up single `` Gentleman '' also broke a record for the most views in 24 hours -- it currently has 694 million views on YouTube .

The `` Hangover '' video shows Psy taking Snoop on a ridiculous guided tour of what he does best -- hardcore drinking , Korean-style . This involves endless bomb shots , hanging out at a jjimjilbang -LRB- Korean bathhouse -RRB- , throwing up and karaoke with strangers -- with one particularly surreal scene of Snoop , Psy and and two Korean women blithely skipping through an amusement park , presumably drunk .

True to the premise , Psy told CNN he was actually hungover when the song came out .

Promotions for the new song kicked off Sunday on Jimmy Kimmel , with the unlikely trio of Kimmel , Psy and Snoop heading to a local karaoke bar in Los Angeles and bringing the house down with their yodeling .

We asked Psy to talk about his hot new collaboration .

CNN : How were you introduced to Snoop Dogg ?

Psy : My manager Scooter Braun put me in touch with him at my request . When I first wrote this track , I thought that Snoop 's slow rapping would fit perfectly with my rapping on this track , so I asked him to put me in touch with Snoop and it 's how it all happened .

CNN : Who came up with the ideas for the video ?

Psy : When I first spoke with Snoop on the phone to discuss the collaboration idea , Snoop loved the title of the song , and I immediately suggested to him during that first conversation to shoot the music video in Korea and show us getting drunk and getting hungover in the most traditional Korean way .

CNN : Where was the video filmed and who chose the locations ?

Psy : It was shot in Incheon . I chose that location because Snoop only had 18 hours to shoot the video . Since he was going to arrive at Incheon International Airport , I wanted to shoot the entire video in an area that is the closest to the airport to get the most out of those 18 hours .

CNN : What was the filming process like ?

Psy : I initially told him that the shoot would be very relaxed and that he would only be in five scenes to entice him to come to Seoul and shoot the video . He ended up being in more than 20 scenes in more than 10 different locations within those 18 hours .

CNN : Why did you decide to go with a different director this time ?

Psy : I co-directed this video so technically it 's the same director , but my co-director -LSB- Cha Eun-taek -RSB- was different from that of `` Gangnam Style '' and `` Gentleman '' -LSB- co-directed by Cho Soo-hyun -RSB- because the type of the song is different -- electronic dance music versus 808 hip hop -- and I also wanted my fans to experience something different .

CNN : What surprised you about working with Snoop Dogg ?

Psy : We all know how diligent Snoop is . He is all about working hard every time -- haha . I am just joking . I was very surprised working with him because he ended up shooting 20 different scenes in a short time -- it was a tough schedule , but he was a total pro and I appreciated it so much .

CNN : How did you celebrate passing two billion views of `` Gangnam Style '' ?

Psy : I really did not have a chance or time to celebrate because I immediately flew to LA for the Jimmy Kimmel Live appearance and other promos .

CNN : What are some events/concerts/collaborations coming up for you ?

Although I can not say at this moment who I collaborated with this past year -LSB- for an upcoming EP -RSB- , but what I can tell you is that I worked with some big name artists !

Psy 's new EP is slated to come out later this year . The lead single on the EP `` Daddy '' will be released this summer .
