-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Arizona mayor is comparing a Border Patrol proposal to put razor wire on portions of the U.S.-Mexico border fence to building the Berlin Wall .

`` We 've had a black eye because everybody is using the border as a political issue , '' Nogales Mayor Arturo Garino said .

The proposal , according to Garino , would put concertina wire on top of the 20-foot-high fence to the east and west of town .

`` Tucson Sector Border Patrol is considering a proposed deployment of concertina wire in the Nogales area , '' Border Patrol spokesman Brent Cagen wrote in an e-mail . `` Currently this proposal is still under review . Specifics concerning this proposal are unavailable at this time . ''

Should the U.S. be more like Mexico ?

Nogales is a major trade hub on the border , abutting the Mexican state of Sonora . It is considered part of the Border Patrol 's Tucson Sector , which consists of 262 miles stretching from the Arizona-New Mexico border to Yuma County , near Lukeville .

Garino , a former law enforcement officer and member of the Southwest Border Task Force , praised the Border Patrol for the `` tremendous '' decrease in drug and human trafficking in southern Arizona . But he said that adding razor wire will negatively affect international trade .

`` I strongly believe we do n't need it , '' he said . `` It 's an eyesore . It 's a dangerous thing . We need to build relations with Sonora and Mexico . Let 's become a power in the world economy . ''

Victor Brabble , public affairs manager for U.S. Customs and Border Protection , said Garino 's concerns will be taken into account before a final decision is made .

`` We are consulting with community leaders to evaluate the economic , environmental , political , and social implications our proposals may have on the communities we serve , '' he wrote in an e-mail .

Nogales City Councilman John Doyle , a Nogales native , echoed Garino 's opposition to the proposal and said he was shocked to learn about it .

`` We 've always been the home of the brave , and now we are living in fear , '' he said .

Nogales officials will meet with Homeland Security personnel this week to continue reviewing the proposal , which is being considered as a deterrent to would-be illegal crossers , Garino said .

`` Right now , it 's a proposal , '' he said . `` But if somebody says ` yes , ' it 's going up . ''

Garino also grew up in Nogales and said he thinks the best deterrent is increased manpower . Agents should be reassigned from checkpoints and interior bases to the border , he said .

`` Bring the Border Patrol to the border and have them do their jobs . ''
