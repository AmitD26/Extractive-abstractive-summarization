Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A CNN correspondent on Monday angrily rejected a report by the Fox network that he and other journalists were used as human shields by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to prevent a missile attack on his compound .

The Fox story , labeled `` exclusive '' and posted on the Fox website Monday , said the presence of news crews from CNN , Reuters and other organizations forced a British aircraft to call off firing seven Storm Shadow missiles at the area that already had been hit .

`` Officials from Libya 's Ministry of Information brought those journalists to the area to show them damage from the initial attack and to effectively use them as human shields , '' said the Fox report .

According to the Fox story , the curtailed strike `` led to a great deal of consternation by coalition commanders . ''

Nic Robertson , a veteran CNN correspondent who was part of the CNN crew cited in the Fox story , called the rival network 's report `` outrageous and hypocritical . ''

Robertson said a Fox staffer was among the journalists on the trip -- a fact left out of the Fox report -- and that the journalists in the group were hurried through their trip by their minders .

`` To say it was a human shield is nuts , '' Robertson said , later adding : `` I expect lies from the government here . I do n't expect it from other journalists . It 's frankly incredibly disappointing . ''

There was no immediate response from Fox to a CNN request for comment .

The incident involved a trip Sunday night arranged by Libyan authorities to the Gadhafi compound that had been bombed earlier by coalition forces .

Robertson said the 40 or so journalists on the bus were n't told ahead of time where they were going , and that there was no attempt by the Libyan minders to restrict anyone from getting on or off the bus before they left .

Upon arrival , the journalists spent about 20 minutes at the damaged building and then were hurried to a tent where they waited with Gadhafi supporters for him to appear , Robertson said . Gadhafi never showed up , and the journalists went back to their bus and departed , according to Robertson .

A government official even pushed him onto the bus as he tried to broadcast a live shot at the end , Robertson said .

`` If they wanted to use us as human shields ... they would have kept us there longer , '' Robertson said . `` That 's not what happened . ''

Robertson noted that the sole participant on the trip from Fox was n't normally a reporter or videographer , but was given a camera and told to go along . In general , Robertson said , the Fox team in Tripoli rarely goes on the reporting trips arranged by the government .

The CNN team goes in order to get whatever information it can to assess what happened and compare it to government versions of events , he said . Otherwise , he noted , the journalists are dependent on government-edited videotape that likely omits key details .

For example , U.S. officials called the Gadhafi compound a legitimate target because it included command and control capability , Robertson noted .

`` We want to go and see : Is it a command and control system ? What are the telltale signs there that the government would n't want us to see ? '' Robertson said .
