-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hari and Karl Berzins decided to build a tiny home for their family in Virginia 's Blue Ridge Mountains to free themselves of the financial burden of owning a large home .

They knew that moving two children , a dog and a cat into a 168-square foot space would be a challenge , though it would also eliminate the need for a mortgage and cut their utility costs .

But they did n't expect it to completely change their lives , Hari Berzins said .

The savings allowed the 39-year-old mother to scale back her hours working for a nonprofit and spend more time on the family 's 3-acre hillside property in Floyd , Virginia , she said . She now has more time to pursue her passion for writing , gardening , raising chickens and , most importantly , to enjoy her kids . Her husband , a chef , was able to leave a stressful restaurant and take a pay cut to work in a more creative environment .

The perks go beyond saving money or having a smaller environmental footprint , though both are huge benefits , Hari Berzins said . There 's also the intangible delight derived from cooking in a kitchen where everything is within arms ' reach , or eating off the beautiful china set that was locked in a cabinet when they lived in a 1,500-square foot home , she said .

`` Living mortgage-free has given us the freedom to make decisions based on what will make us happy , not what we have to do to pay the mortgage , '' Berzins said in a CNN iReport .

`` The things we have are beautiful , enriching our tiny space . We got rid of so much and kept the beautiful things , '' she said . `` Freeing ourselves from consumer debt and living mortgage-free has cleared the clutter to help us see what is truly important : our relationships , our happiness , each moment . ''

The Berzins are part of a small contingent of homeowners who have found solace living in less than 500 square feet . Many of them live in homes built on trailers so they can move around ; others , like the Berzins , live on property they own . Others live in Cob homes built of clay and mica . Some are motivated by a desire to lessen their carbon footprint while others want to own a home without worrying about property taxes .

Small homes are n't for everybody , but those who embrace the lifestyle tend to become their most enthusiastic boosters . Most of the iReporters who shared their stories of living small with CNN.com also build tiny homes or run businesses dedicated to helping others build their own .

The small home movement has been around for years in small cities and rural areas , but this summer , it made a big incursion into one of the country 's largest and most densely populated urban centers .

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg in July announced a pilot program to develop a new housing model for the city 's growing small-household population . The program , adAPT NYC , seeks to accommodate the need for smaller apartments for roughly 1.8 million households in New York that consist of one or two people .

The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development kicked off the program in July with a request for proposals from designers and development teams for self-contained `` micro-units '' between 275 and 300 square feet , including kitchen and bathroom .

The contest closed last week , drawing 33 submissions mostly from teams in the Northeastern United States , along with international entries from London and Amsterdam . The proposals suggest the use of modular design and some include sustainable design such as solar paneling , the housing department said Thursday .

The winning proposal will form the basis for a mixed-income rental building in the Kips Bay neighborhood of Manhattan consisting of micro-units . The winning applicant will be responsible for designing , constructing , owning and managing the property as part of the housing department 's model for developing city-owned property .

The housing department said it hopes to announce a winner in 2013 and break ground by year 's end .

Of course , many New Yorkers already live in micro-sized units or smaller . For iReporter Kristen Booth , living in her 214-square foot East Village studio is a rite of passage for living in New York . But after 13 years in the same small apartment , she 's ready for an upgrade and a bathtub .

Most of the city 's small apartments are in old buildings and there are n't enough of them . New York has 1.8 million one - and two-person households , but only 1 million studios or one-bedrooms , the housing department said .

The city wants to build more that `` have substantial access to light and air to create a sense of openness , '' the housing department said .

Clearly , renting a micro-unit in New York and building your own home in the country are two different animals . But there is some overlap between micro-units and tiny homes and the people who live in them .

Building codes and ordinances complicate matters and can prevent residents from living in the units full-time . New York City 's housing codes currently do not allow an entire building of micro-units , a housing department spokesman said . Under the pilot program , Bloomberg will waive certain zoning regulations at a city-owned site to test the market for this new housing model .

In Point Roberts , Washington , iReporter Jamie Dehner was surprised to learn that while there are no limits on how big you build a home , the same is n't true for building small . To get around Whatcom County regulations requiring a permit to build their 160-square-foot home with plumbing , the Dehners built their home on a trailer bed , subject to different regulations as a recreational vehicle .

The Dehners stayed there while working on a bigger home on their property , which is nearly done , she said . At 700 square feet , it seems like a mansion . But they enjoyed their time in the smaller dwelling for a variety of reasons .

`` A small space is easy to clean , heat and there 's a wonderful coziness about it . You are all tucked in with the things you need and use the most and that 's appealing psychologically , '' Dehner said in an iReport .

`` It 's a fantastically liberating experience to live in a small space that is also hugely fun and entertaining , not just for you as the builder and occupant , but for others who pass by and just want to peek inside . And whether you stay in a tiny house permanently or end up building , you 've got a perfect guest cottage that you can share with friends , family , sell or rent out . ''

While the amount of savings can differ greatly for a renter of a micro-unit versus a small-home owner , cost-effectiveness is definitely part of the equation in both models . The average rent for a regular studio apartment in Kips Bay is roughly $ 2,000 , according to the housing department . The department hopes to see proposals with rents well below that , though it has not set price or rental rate criteria as part of the competition .

iReporter Carrie Caverly and Shane Caverly rent the land on which they keep their 204-square-foot home , which they designed and built mostly from off-the-shelf building materials . The design allows for passive solar heating in the winter , has a metal roof for rainwater collection and uses an incinerating toilet to minimize water usage and avoid the need for sewage disposal , said Carrie Caverly , an architectural designer .

In total , their monthly expenses are around $ 300 and they own the home outright without having incurred any debt , she said in an iReport .

Many of the advantages of living in a small space were planned and expected , she said . But the couple is also enjoying unexpected advantages , like a connection to their community .

`` When humans can do everything in the sheltered enclaves of our homes , we rarely venture out ; we become isolated . Our small home encourages us to go outside and talk to the neighbors , go on hikes and meet people , go to coffee shops and restaurants , the library , the gym etc. , etc. . The list goes on , '' Caverly said in an iReport .

Downsizing has also produced benefits , she said .

`` I have been inspired to finally be tidy and clean ; always putting everything away in its designed location . This creates a sense of spaciousness and sanity I 've never had before in a home , '' she said .
