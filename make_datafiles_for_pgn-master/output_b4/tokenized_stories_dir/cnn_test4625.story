-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sixteen Emmy Awards .

That 's how many trophies the cast and crew of `` Breaking Bad '' have hauled home after five seasons of groundbreaking TV , with six of those honors being earned at Monday 's 66th Primetime Emmy Awards . The three-hour ceremony , hosted by `` Late Night 's '' Seth Meyers , nearly doubled as one long standing ovation for the AMC series , which ended its run in September 2013 .

Emmy Awards : ` Breaking Bad ' goes out on top

But as creator Vince Gilligan and stars Bryan Cranston , Anna Gunn and Aaron Paul laid `` Breaking Bad '' to rest with gleaming Emmys in their hands , elsewhere in the world the series is just getting started .

In September , Latin America will get its own , Spanish-language version of `` Breaking Bad '' called `` Metastasis . '' The premise is the same -- a science teacher decides to cash in on his specialized knowledge by entering the drug trade , to devastating consequences -- but the setting is Bogota , Colombia .

Instead of watching the evolution of a man named Walter White -LRB- played by Cranston in `` Breaking Bad '' -RRB- , potential fans will follow Walter Blanco , as played by Colombian actor Diego Trujillo . Walter Blanco has wife a named Cielo -- the Colombian equivalent of Anna Gunn 's Skyler -- and a partner-in-crime named Jose Miguel Rosas , the equivalent of Aaron Paul 's Jesse Pinkman .

The series debuted in the States on the Spanish language network UniMas in June , and has also made its way to Mexico . But `` in Colombia , not many people know about ` Breaking Bad , ' '' Trujillo explained in an interview from Bogota . `` There 's not a great cable culture here , people watch open television on the basic channels that we have . ` Metastasis ' is going to be a great surprise . ''

While adapting shows to another language is commonplace -- Trujillo previously worked on Latin American versions of `` Grey 's Anatomy '' and `` Desperate Housewives , '' and the U.S. turned Colombian series `` Betty La Fea '' into `` Ugly Betty '' -- producing `` Metastasis '' was no easy task . The cast had to film the entirety of `` Breaking Bad '' nearly shot for shot in just six months , and they did n't know how the story was going to end because the final season of `` Breaking Bad '' was still in development at the time .

Despite those challenges , the story does n't get lost in translation . Well-crafted symbolism , such as the noteworthy pink teddy bear that falls from a plane , appears in `` Metastasis , '' as do other scenes well-known to `` Breaking Bad '' viewers .

`` The themes that it touches are very universal , '' Urbina said . `` To me , the show is a moral question about how far you would go while exploring the complex character like that of Walter . ''

One of Walter 's scenes that strikes a chord with Trujillo takes place near the end of the series , when the `` Metastasis '' protagonist comes back to see his wife Cielo and say goodbye to her and their baby girl .

`` That 's Walter and that 's what all the characters are , '' Trujillo said . `` Every scene is full of contradiction , it 's full of humanity . ''

While both Trujillo and Urbina were certainly influenced by Cranston and Paul 's portrayals of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman , they made an effort to break away from the original and make the characters , and the show , their own .

`` When you start working with a different language , with a different director , a different cast , and our own traditions , at the end you really do your own version , '' Trujillo said . `` Characters come alive by themselves . You forget very soon what you saw , and the reference you have of the other actor . ''

When Urbina first began filming , he was too attached to Paul 's portrayal of Jesse , with the memory of `` Breaking Bad '' scenes ingrained in his mind . Yet by making a conscious effort to start from scratch , he said he reimagined his Jose Miguel Rosas .

`` I think the biggest difference between Jesse and Jose is they are both very insecure people , but I think Jesse 's character shows that through aggression and violence , while Jose , I tried to make him a little more vulnerable , '' Urbina said . `` I think you are able to relate more to him and feel what he is feeling . He 's not a character afraid of showing his sadness , his emotion . ''

There are other factors that distinguish `` Metastasis '' from `` Breaking Bad . '' The setting of Bogota moves the story into the urban environment of a big city , as opposed to Albuquerque 's suburban landscape . The city also lacks deserts , or the border and immigration issues prevalent in Albuquerque .

With its high elevation , Bogota is cold year-round , so the pool in Walter 's backyard is replaced by a fountain , which Cielo falls into as she 's having a dream . The RV where Walter and Jesse make their great escape in the `` Breaking Bad '' pilot is also replaced by a rickety school bus turned into a lab for `` Metastasis . ''

Although they 're sharing similar material , there 's no competition for the actors . Quite the opposite , actually : Urbina and Trujillo were both rooting for `` Breaking Bad '' to win at the Emmys on Monday .

`` Cranston 's performance is absolutely wonderful . He deserves all the awards , as well as the rest of -LRB- the cast -RRB- , '' Trujillo said . `` I think they are just great actors , and they did a great , great job . ''

So far , Urbina and Trujillo have n't been doing too badly with the roles themselves . The actors said Vince Gilligan admires `` Metastasis , '' and they 've received positive feedback from fans near and far .

`` I have gotten an amazing response from people all over , people in Mexico and the States , '' Urbina said . `` There was this one guy in Mexico that wrote to me , and it was very touching because he identified with the character . He went down on drugs and he lost his girlfriend and he was reaching out , not for help , but to connect and to grieve . So I think it has touched people in a very powerful way . ''

There is only more to come , as the much anticipated season finale airs on UniMas in mid-September , and `` Metastasis '' comes to Latin American audiences with Fox Live on September 1 .

`` The story is really well-adapted to our conditions here , '' Trujillo said . `` People are going to believe it , believe the people . It 's an amazing story , and I 'm sure it 's going to be really well received . ''
