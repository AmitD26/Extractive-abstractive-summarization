-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Technology has been changing the way we access , enjoy and discuss our entertainment . From smartphones and tablets with streaming movies to video game consoles offering TV shows alongside game play , consumers have increasingly become accustomed to their entertainment colliding and intertwining in new and interesting ways .

In an effort to expand that world , the creators of `` Defiance '' are banking on the combined power of an online third-person shooter video game and a weekly science fiction television series to keep fans hooked and actively involved in the franchise .

Trion Games and SyFy Network joined forces five years ago to create `` a truly unique entertainment experience , '' according to Nathan Richardsson , VP of development for Trion and executive producer of `` Defiance . ''

The `` Defiance '' world is set in the year 2046 on a transformed Earth ravaged by conflict and alien attacks . Mutants , evil alien races and robots terrorize what 's left of civilization and those who have the wealth and power have fled to Antarctica -- the last refuge for those who want to live comfortably .

The game takes place in the San Francisco area while the TV series is set in St. Louis , or what used to be St. Louis before alien terraforming technology destroyed most of the city . The town is now called Defiance , with a population of about 6,000 people of different races .

Creators say the geographic split of the story was necessary so each property could stand on its own . Mark Stern , president of original content at SyFy , said a gaming world where hundreds of players are completing missions would n't be a good environment for TV storytelling .

`` We really did need to keep them distinct and not worry about what we could and could n't do , '' Stern said . `` We did n't want lots of people running up and down our streets -LRB- in St. Louis -RRB- shooting everything . It was going to be very , very hard to keep those things separate in that very specific way . ''

That 's not to say the show and the game are completely separate . Events that happen in the game will refer to , and possibly affect , things in the TV series and vice versa .

Rob Hill , senior producer at Trion , points out the two main characters from the show , Joshua Nolan and Irisa , actually appear in the game before they show up in the series and go on missions with the player .

`` Those two characters leave the game , '' Hill said . `` They drive away from the player having gotten an object the player helped them get and then drive into the television show . -LRB- They -RRB- end up using that object , which really helps the solution to the pilot -LRB- episode -RRB- . ''

The game , which is available on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles as well as Windows-based computers , launched two weeks before the SyFy series premier to give fans of the `` Defiance '' universe a taste of what was to come in the show . However , you do n't have to watch the show to understand the game -- and vice versa .

Hill said the game and the show can stand alone , but the idea of expanding the world through different outlets at the same time was something they felt would enhance the viewer 's , or player 's , enjoyment of the franchise .

`` You 'll be missing a lot of background of what maybe happens from either the show or the game , he said . `` It wo n't be something you are confused by . It wo n't be ` Why did that just happen ? ' -LRB- But -RRB- if you play the game and are watching the show , you might have an inner knowledge that other people wo n't have about the show . ''

While both teams were telling a story in the same universe , Stern said the creative process was like digging a tunnel through opposite sides of a mountain to meet in the center .

`` They 're -LRB- Trion -RRB- building this deep , rich world and we were trying to create interesting character drama , '' Stern said . `` That was a great benefit to us to have a company working 24 hours a day building out this detail , like a 300-page world Bible , that we could tap when it did become time for us to worry about -LRB- questions like -RRB- ` What color are the trees ? ' ` What do the buildings exactly look like ? ' ''

Hill agreed , saying Trion pushed SyFy to think about larger details earlier when the show producers wanted to work in character details .

`` We need to define a universe early because our entire game is computer-generated graphics and they take a long time to build . They usually think about what the universe looks like , what it sounds like , and they usually figure that out after they 've got an initial script written , '' he said .

While some of the discussion about story development , environments and the overall reach of `` Defiance '' got heated , the idea of making something brand new kept both sides focused . Stern said there was genuine enthusiasm on both sides to make it work , but the pressure was intense .

`` There 's so much scrutiny because of what it is , '' he said . `` There 's also this real responsibility feel that , if this does n't work , you 've condemned the idea in general , which is not necessarily fair . ''

Are science fiction and gaming fans ready for this type of multilayered entertainment ? The crossover audience between those two genres seems to be a natural and large one .

'' -LRB- The SyFy show -RRB- is only on for an hour a week and 13 episodes a season , and then people have to wait for the next season , '' Hill points out . `` The fan base really gets into the universe behind these television shows and they do n't get to live in it outside of those 13 episodes . We give them the opportunity to come into the game and live in the universe 24/7 if they want to . ''

`` Defiance '' -LRB- the game -RRB- is available now for the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 and Windows PC . It is an online game so it does require an Internet connection to play at all times . It is rated M for Mature due to blood , drug references , sexual themes , strong language , and violence . `` Defiance '' -LRB- the show -RRB- premiered April 15 on the SyFy channel and will run weekly until July 8 .
