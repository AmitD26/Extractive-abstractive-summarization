University of Iowa President Sally Mason talks to the Board of Regents .

-LRB- UWIRE -RRB- -- The state Board of Regents has reopened its investigation into the University of Iowa 's handling of an alleged rape by two of its football players .

The regents unanimously voted to re-examine how the university handled the accusation during a special meeting on the University of Iowa campus Tuesday .

The mother of a woman who reported she had been raped in a Hillcrest dorm room in October 2007 sent letters in November and May to school officials complaining about the school 's handling of the case .

Those letters -- which President Sally Mason received copies of -- were n't turned over to the regents during the initial investigation , which concluded in June . In that investigation , the regents concluded that university officials had handled the situation correctly .

Now that the regents are aware of the letters , however , they want to know more .

`` This is a serious breach of trust , '' Regent President David Miles said . `` It undermines the credibility of the university and this board . ''

School officials say they welcome the second investigation , insisting that the findings will be the same as the earlier probe . The new report will be presented at the next regents ' meeting , scheduled for September 18 .

On July 18 , one of the letters from the mother was released . In the four-page letter , which Miles described as heart-wrenching , the mother contended that the university had mishandled her daughter 's case .

University of Iowa officials have not disputed the letter 's contents but insist there was no cover-up .

In October 2007 , the woman reported she had been assaulted in a Hillcrest dorm by two then-Hawkeye football players , Abe Satterfield and Cedric Everson . The men left the team late last year .

After a trip to the hospital , she and her father went to the athletics department with the allegations . According to the letter , she was interviewed by Gary Barta , the Iowa athletics director , head football coach Kirk Ferentz , and Fred Mims , an associate athletics director .

The woman claims that she was pressured to keep the case `` informal '' or within the athletics department .

The mother wrote that the woman was told a `` formal process '' would be `` long and arduous '' compared with the `` swift '' informal process led by the athletics department .

Satterfield and Everson were both charged with second-degree sexual abuse six months after the incident . Satterfield was also charged with third-degree sexual abuse .

The first letter was dated November 19 , 2007 , and was sent to various university officials . Mason said she saw the letter around Thanksgiving . Another letter was sent in May directly to Mason . Neither letter was given to the regents , a move that put into question the manner in which the investigation was handled .

The letter sent in May has not been released yet , University of Iowa Spokesman Steve Parrott said .

The original reasoning for not handing over the letters , Mason said , was an interpretation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act . This act gives parents and students the right to protect their educational records .

`` This original thinking ... is just not tenable , '' Mason said , apologizing to the regents . `` There is no excuse for the failure to turn over those letters as part of the -LSB- first -RSB- investigation . ''

Mason was informed of the misinterpretation by Marcus Mills , the University of Iowa vice president for Legal Affairs and the school 's general counsel , but who initially made the mistake was not disclosed . Mason apologized profusely for the incident to the regents and the family .

She declined to comment on whether safety policies were changed after the first letter in November .

In the letter , the woman also contends that the woman 's father attempted to call Mason on November 5 . That phone call was never returned .

Tom Evans , investigator and general counsel to the regents , attempted to contact the family after the case surfaced . The family declined to talk with him .

Barta , who attended the meeting , said he welcomed the second investigation , and he was confident that the regents would find that his staff had followed the correct steps .

`` Again , it has been very challenging to not be able to tell the full story , '' Barta said in a statement issued after the meeting . `` It has been especially trying the past few days as the integrity and character of Kirk Ferentz , President Mason , -LSB- and myself -RSB- has been publicly challenged .
