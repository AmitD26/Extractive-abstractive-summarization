BERLIN , Germany -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- His phone number was published in a German phone directory -- Rafid Alwan , whose claims that Saddam Hussein was producing biological agents helped launch the Iraq war .

Rafid Alwan says he wants to return to Iraq to work for his people and his country .

He was reluctant to speak on the record , initially denying he was Iraqi or that he was the defector dubbed `` Curveball '' by the CIA . But eight months after we first contacted him , Alwan agreed to an interview , and we met in an anonymous hotel room in a southern German town .

Trying to get details from him was difficult -- he spoke at length , often launching into a flowery history of Iraq or a description of Hussein 's crimes , and in Arabic , which meant we had to wait after each answer for a translation .

We spoke for more than three hours , Alwan sitting across the room from me , wearing a stylish black suit . But in the end , he had n't said very much at all .

In the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , Secretary of State Colin Powell delivered a dramatic presentation to the U.N. Security Council . The United States had first-hand accounts , he said , detailing how Hussein was secretly creating biological agents using mobile laboratories in `` road-trailer units and rail cars . ''

As slides depicting drawings of the supposed germ labs flashed on a big screen in the Security Council 's chamber , Powell drove his point home :

`` The source is an eyewitness , an Iraqi chemical engineer , who supervised one of these facilities . ''

Just days after Powell 's presentation , U.N. weapons inspectors presented evidence they said disproved those claims . But six weeks later , on March 20 , 2003 , the United States launched its invasion , toppling Hussein 's government in three weeks but locking itself in a war against an insurgency that has cost more than 4,000 American lives .

No biological weapons , no germ labs , no weapons of mass destruction of any kind were found in Iraq after the invasion . Curveball -- Rafid Alwan -- remained in hiding in Germany , where he had been interviewed by the German intelligence service , the BND .

Subsequent U.S. investigations into the intelligence failure around the claims found that German intelligence considered the defector `` crazy '' and `` out of control , '' while friends said he was a `` liar . ''

And , it turned out , the CIA not only never spoke with him , it never even saw transcripts of the German interviews , only the Germans ' analysis of the interviews .

Alwan brought with him to our meeting documents to prove his identity , certificates saying he has a degree in chemical engineering from Technical University in Baghdad and a student ID card from a German college . Multiple intelligence sources told CNN that the man we spoke with was , indeed , Curveball .

But Alwan told us he never told the BND that Iraq was producing weapons of mass destruction , and he said many other things said about him were false .

`` There are many wrong statements made about me , and I want to declare it one by one . I have documents proving that everything said about me is false , '' he said .

`` No , '' he said , `` I never told anyone Saddam Hussein was producing weapons of mass destruction . ''

When I pressed him about Powell 's use of his information , Alwan said in German with an Arabic accent , `` That is Colin Powell 's problem . ''

He said that as long as he is living in Germany , he will never tell the full story of what information he passed on to the BND .

`` It is not true that I am the only person who said things about Iraq , '' he said . `` There are so many other people who gave information as well . Right now I am trying to protect my children . They have been through hard times with me . ''

And then Alwan got nervous . He wiped his face often and lit a new cigarette after almost every question . He seemed uncomfortable in front of the camera .

Alwan had brought with him a second man , introduced only as `` Mr. Ali . '' Mr. Ali was also wearing a flashy suit with a peach-colored shirt , and he seemed to be coaching Alwan , making strange signals behind my back .

As I talked to Alwan , I could feel the wind from Mr. Ali frantically waving his arms . Whenever Alwan began to offer details , Mr. Ali made a time out signal with his hands , and Alwan stopped talking .

When he was n't prevented from talking by Mr. Ali , Alwan answered questions in a roundabout manner , sometimes backtracking and correcting himself , sometimes telling completely different stories in the same sentence .

Alwan came to Germany in 1999 seeking asylum and was picked up by the German intelligence service , which questioned him . According to intelligence sources , Alwan told the BND that Hussein had a secret biological weapons program , and that the cover was a seed purification plant in Djerf al Nadaf , a site just north of Baghdad , where mobile weapons labs in truck trailers would pick up the biological agents .

It begs the question : How could the BND and CIA trust Alwan 's information with the stakes so high ?

While he provided little detail during our interview , Alwan insisted that Hussein was producing weapons of mass destruction , and that he had worked on one of the weapons projects .

Norbert Juretzko , a former BND officer who is familiar with the Curveball case , now criticizes the German intelligence service for its handling of the matter . The BND wanted so badly to believe Alwan , Juretzko said , that the case officers did n't notice inconsistencies in his story .

`` He was put under pressure by the BND : ` Tell us something , ' '' Juretzko said . `` They were desperate for something . They gave him money , privileges , a visa and the like . And so this man used his imagination to get all these things . ''

Alwan , however , claims he was never `` an agent or spy for any intelligence agencies in the world . And I never got paid by anyone . ''

Tyler Drumheller , the CIA 's station chief in Europe at the time , said he tried to warn his superiors at the agency about using Curveball 's information . Drumheller said he thinks the Curveball case is one of the lowest points in the history of the CIA , but he does not believe Alwan was at fault .

`` He was driven by his own self-preservation , and then he got caught up in the story he was telling , and then he just had to keep going , '' Drumheller said .

Bob Drogin , who wrote about the case in `` Curveball : Lies , Spies , and a Con Man Who Caused a War , '' called the episode `` arguably the biggest intelligence failure in history . ''

`` Never before have we gone to war on the basis of such an utter and complete fraud , '' Drogin said . `` After 9/11 , what we heard from the authorities was that they had failed to connect the dots that led to that scandal . In this case , they made up the dots . ''

But Alwan made clear in our meeting that he does not feel remorse . He said he wants to return to Iraq to work for his people and his country . And , he said , he feels the Iraq war was justified .

`` I feel that America offered to Iraq what no other country can offer to Iraq , '' he said near the end of the interview . `` America sacrificed its people and its money and its position to free a dictatorial country . ''
