-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the blink of an eye , Uber has emerged as one of the most esteemed companies in the United States , soaring in recent days to a market value of $ 18.2 billion . That 's bigger than Hertz and Avis combined . But is the Uber story really as good as it seems ?

Taxicab drivers clogging the streets of Europe this past week , protesting against Uber , are only part of the challenge . Far more dangerous could be an emerging pattern of not paying sufficient respect to customers .

Companies like Apple , Zappos , FedEx and Amazon are passionately committed to building a love affair with consumers as the center of their universe . In contrast , Uber has embraced a take-it-or-leave-it approach that may be tough for consumers to swallow over the long haul .

Still , the business model is brilliant , the growth eye-popping and the initial Uber experience is generally excellent . In big cities like New York , on a rainy night , when cabs are always full , finding an Uber car quickly through your iPhone can be a godsend , even though you may have to pay a `` surge price '' at a multiple of twice or even more of the regular price . This adds up to Uber being a welcome disruption , blowing competition and free market pricing into the regulated taxi industries that do n't always serve the interests of consumers .

So what are the dangers ? Lack of transparency may be one . Consumers usually want a company to be proactive about explaining what they do and how that can affect their lives , especially when physical safety is at stake . Uber puts most of the meaningful detail on what service it actually provides into its Terms & Conditions , which most people do n't read when they download the app .

According to its Terms & Conditions agreement , Uber is not a transportation service . It 's a passenger procurement service for private car drivers . The car drivers are Uber 's actual customers .

Lack of accountability may be another danger . The entire risk of using the service is on the passenger . You are warned that you could be exposed to situations that are `` potentially dangerous , offensive , harmful to minors or unsafe '' . Surprisingly , Uber does not claim to `` assess the suitability , legality or ability '' of any third party providing services procured through Uber , and UberX drivers may not be professionally licensed or permitted .

Does all this mean you may have a hard time suing the company if your driver is negligent and you get hurt ? Lane Kasselman , Uber 's spokesman , did n't directly address this question of liability when I asked him about it in an email , but points to company attention to passenger safety , noting Uber is `` the first to ensure end-to-end insurance coverage for ridesharing . ''

Privacy is also a concern for consumers . As we saw with the fallout from the Target data security breach -LRB- which included the CEOs resignation -RRB- , people expect a company to protect their privacy . I am sure there are fellow riders who , like me , take issue with the company not disclosing their passenger rating in the Terms & Conditions or privacy policy for the app .

To me this raises further concerns : what are Uber 's rating criteria for passengers , what happens to the data , how can I see the data on me , what 's the dispute process if I disagree ? Uber 's Kasselman answered by writing `` Rider ratings are available easily by visiting t.uber.com/support or just by asking your driver . '' Sounds fair enough , but on their support site I was asked to submit an email request for my passenger rating and wait for a response . -LRB- I did receive it Monday afternoon . -RRB- And , again , I may not be alone feeling more than a little uncomfortable asking my driver for my rating . Uber 's blog says it is `` exploring ways to show the rider 's rating in the next generation of the app '' .

In addition to the security of corporate data , there is the issue of whether individual drivers have access to personal passenger information and how Uber protects riders from unauthorized breaches . When asked about this in an email , Kasselman , responded : `` Uber driver partners do not have access to any personal information through the platform , including credit card data . We use state-of-the-art anonymization technology , meaning the driver does n't keep a record of the rider 's phone number . Drivers and riders are able to connect either by calling or texting , with the anonymization described above , in place . '' From a logical standpoint , this makes sense , but from a brand standpoint they have yet to tell me that protecting my safety and privacy is crucial .

And then there 's change . Consumers both love and fear disruptive companies like Uber . People know that innovative companies create constructive chaos that usually benefits consumers . But disruptive companies can also be seen as dangerous .

For Uber to get the value of its disruption , in the form of consumer goodwill , people will need to know why Uber-instigated changes in the taxi industry are good , not bad .

Despite the surge in rider sign-ups during the European taxi driver protests last week , Uber 's challenge will be answering the same questions raised here , as more and more new people come online to use its platform . But the taxi driver action also creates the perfect context for Uber to explain why shaking up the regulatory environment -- and the ensuing mess -- is a good thing for both consumer and regulator .

If I were advising Uber on how to best achieve revenues that would justify its $ 18 billion valuation , I 'd focus on two things .

First , get very sharp about what you stand for and start building bridges with consumers that go beyond the functional role of delivering things from point A to B. Rise above the kitten delivery stunts and bull-in-a-china-shop attitude to establish the value of your company in consumers ' lives . That suggests being more transparent , protective , inclusive and explanatory about your business and the impact of your actions on their safety , privacy and overall riding experience .

Second , turn the negative fallout from disruption -- from forcing Uber 's model on municipalities and shaking up the status quo -- into a positive global movement . Explain to the entire ecosystem of drivers , riders , regulators , regulated , investors and employees the value and benefit of the turmoil Uber brings when it rolls out in new markets .

Investors have spoken , and they 're all in for Uber . But the jury may still be out with consumers . I happen to love Uber . But if Uber does n't seize this moment to build a valuable , trusted position in my life , and move beyond the emerging dangers , I will become a consumer who is confused about what it stands for .

This requires Uber to develop a true brand to manage its disruption and take control of the conversation with consumers . It must bring context to the chaos it creates and be known as a positive force for change that always acts on behalf of its consumers , not its business model . Otherwise , down the road , a competitor might more easily turn my head : one that delivers exactly what they promise me .
