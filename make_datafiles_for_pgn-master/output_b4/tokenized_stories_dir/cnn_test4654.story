-LRB- AOL Autos -RRB- -- Imagine this : It 's a gorgeous spring day in Miami and you 're thoroughly tempted to lower the top of your rental car and push the power pedal a little too hard in a bid to break free from the traffic crush on the Palmetto .

But , though there may not seem to be a heavy police presence on the freeways on this particular day , you can be pretty sure that someone up in the sky is keeping a close eye on speeding vacationers and the massive traffic tailbacks they 're trying to avoid .

Welcome to Florida and aviation law enforcement from the state 's Highway Patrol . It 's one of the few states in the U.S. that employs aircraft to monitor speeders , reckless drivers and , sometimes , soon-to-be felons fleeing a police pursuit -LRB- Nevada and Minnesota are among a dozen others -RRB- . And if you never quite realized what those strange white lines along the side of the highway mean , well , now you will .

Flight Captain Matt Walker , the Florida Highway Patrol 's chief pilot , says his job primarily involves monitoring motorists ' speed between these painted white lines , which are placed a quarter-mile apart in frequent intervals .

How it works

Surprisingly , aviation enforcement does n't involve radar : it 's a straightforward stopwatch time over distance equation that allows a pilot to work out whether a driver has broken the speed limit . Captain Walker , having clocked a motorist driving too fast , then radios the speeding car 's information to a waiting state trooper , or ground unit , who stops the car and issues a citation .

That is , if the driver stops . Sometimes , Walker says , they do n't , a felony offense . But this is where aviation enforcement really comes into its own . In certain cases , rather than pursuing a fleeing motorist , which can be dangerous for all involved , an order will be given for the troopers to stand down but the pilot will still pursue the driver .

Occasionally , the driver will head home , or even go shopping , completely unaware that his movements have been tracked from the air . Planes , after all , operate much more quietly than the helicopters often employed in other states in such pursuits . When the driver is quickly apprehended on the ground , usually they 're shocked to hear they 'd been tracked from high above .

`` The troopers will back off and we 'll follow the vehicle , '' Walker said . `` When the person does n't see the troopers ' lights , he 'll pull off and stop or he 'll drive to his house . And as he 's going into his house , the troopers are coming around the corner .

`` It takes the fleeing portion out of the pursuit . Sometimes he 'll still drive recklessly but the majority of the time he 'll operate within speed limits if he thinks nobody is chasing him . '' AOL Autos : Caught at 100 mph -- now what ?

Walker says that a fleet of seven Cessna fixed-wing aircraft operates in the skies above Florida . The combined fleet delivers some 45,000 citations on average each year , and speed will be a factor in about 38,000 of these citations .

The rest of the citations are made up of secondary factors , if the driver is drunk or not wearing a seatbelt , for example , or is driving on a suspended license . He says about 150 arrests are made each year where a pilot has spotted a clearly impaired driver , and aircraft enforcement results in the recovery of about 50 stolen vehicles annually .

`` The primary use of aircraft is for traffic enforcement , '' Walker said . `` The pilot has a stopwatch and observes traffic going down the roadway . He activates the stopwatch on the first line and calculates the average speed over the quarter mile . AOL Autos : How police catch you speeding

`` We 'll say , ` the vehicle is a red pickup truck in the inside lane , number 5 behind you , off to your left now , now he 's number 1 . The trooper looks out his window and will pull in behind that vehicle . We confirm the time and speed and the pilot will return to the lines and do it over again . ''

Impact of weather

The most challenging days for Walker and his team of pilots are busy holidays with heavy traffic and when the weather takes a turn for the worse . He says in those situations , or when a storm is looming , the fleet will be grounded . `` We do not fly in inclement weather , '' he says .

Walker , who was born and raised in Florida , says that any prospective pilot must have logged at least one year as a regular state trooper and 500 hours of flight time and gained a commercial or instrument rating . He says many pilots were former civilian fliers who paid for their lessons out of their own pocket , although they can gain the qualification when they 're going through the police training academy .

Walker was a trooper for five years before he took to the skies , and now spends about five hours a day in the air . He also has to testify in court should a motorist decide to challenge a citation .

David Haenel , a defense lawyer at fightyourticket.com , has gotten to know many of the FHP pilots well in his long career fighting speeding tickets in Florida courts . He says he has won many cases challenging the basic equipment used to issue a citation -- including radio and the three stopwatches that pilots may use to clock a vehicle -- and discrepancies in the timing of an issued ticket .

He says that a pilot must prove that their stopwatches -- which must be of a certain brand -- have been calibrated in the last six months . He says a description of the car , its time and its speed must be written on the ticket , and that the citation 's reliability must be proven beyond reasonable doubt . Which means that if there is a discrepancy between the time a pilot says he contacted the trooper and the time the trooper wrote on the ticket , even by a minute , Haenel has grounds to get the citation dismissed .

`` First and foremost typically a client will tell me , ` I did n't see the plane in the air ' , '' Haenel said . `` But I want to know the locations of where the lines are , if the ticket is written in the appropriate venue -LSB- or county -RSB- if the troopers come from different stations , if the ticket is valid on its face . ''

`` Every inconsistency goes in the benefit of the driver . The time on the citation is usually the most critical . If the pilot says 3.59 , but the ticket 's at 3.58 , or 4.01 , sometimes I do n't even take these to trial . ''

Tread warily the next time you 're tempted to put your foot down in Florida . You never know who might be watching . Or from where .
