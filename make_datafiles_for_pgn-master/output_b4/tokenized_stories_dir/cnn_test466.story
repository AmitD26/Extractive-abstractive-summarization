He went to check with the friends they had come to the game with and met up with at halftime . There was more room in their section and perhaps Kitterman , who was attending his first game , would be there . No sign of him .

There was no cell phone to call . Kitterman , 53 , does n't particularly care for them .

They went to the spot where they were supposed to meet after the game . No sign of him .

It was n't like Kitterman to just take off .

`` He would n't leave Jarod for all the money in the world , '' Tia Bakke , one of the friends who went to the game , said Monday night . `` He had plans the next day . He had things he wanted to do . ''

`` Paul is the best guy you could ask for . They do n't make them like Paul anymore , '' said Bakke , who met Kitterman through her boyfriend , who has known the missing man for a decade .
