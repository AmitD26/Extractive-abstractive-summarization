-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Barcelona put a turbulent few months behind them by sweeping aside Elche 3-0 at the Nou Camp in their opening game of the Spanish season .

Lionel Messi was the standout player as he scored twice and Barcelona dominated despite having Javier Mascherano sent off and playing the whole of the second half with ten men .

The omens initially were not good for Barcelona .

The club ended last season empty handed under Gerado Martino . The club 's president Sandro Rosell had to resign over alleged irregularities surrounding the Neymar transfer . And star striker Lionel Messi has been embroiled in allegations of tax avoidance .

Black cat = bad luck ?

But , more importantly , a black cat somehow found itself in the stadium a minute after kick off and delayed the match . It evaded several tackles before nonchalantly walking off the pitch on its own terms . A steward managed to grab the cat as it attempted to enter the stands and received several scratches for his troubles .

Messi , perhaps taking a leaf out of the feline invader 's playbook , evaded several challenges of his own to fire Barcelona ahead before half time .

But a few minutes later Barcelona were down to ten men when Mascherano brought down Elche striker Rodrigues . He was the last defender and , deservedly , received a straight red card .

But you would n't have known that it was Barcelona down to ten men given their second half performance . They enjoyed 79 per cent of possession as Messi added a second . There was also a goal for 18 year old La Masia graduate Munir .

The whereabouts of the black cat is currently unknown .

The underdog 's underdog

Meanwhile arguably one of the biggest underdogs in the history of top level Spanish football started life in La Liga with a shock victory .

A few months ago it was n't even clear whether SD Eibar -- a club from a Basque town of just 28,000 people which had never played in the top tier of Spanish football before -- would even be allowed to play .

The club appeared to fall foul of some idiosyncratic financial rules . Despite being self-sustaining and completely free of debt -- unlike a host of other Spanish clubs -- Eibar faced the prospect of relegation to Spanish football 's third tier .

Idiosyncratic

A 1999 decree requires every team to have a capital equal to 25 per cent of the average expenses of all sides in the second division , excluding the two clubs with the biggest outgoings and the two with the smallest .

It meant Eibar had to raise â ` ¬ 1.7 million -LRB- $ 2.3 million -RRB- if they wanted to play in the top division .

But a social media campaign allowed the club to raise the necessary cash to compete , a campaign that Basque rivals Real Sociedad probably wish had failed .

The two met in a Basque derby on the first day of the season , but it was Eibar that snatched a historic 1-0 victory thanks to Javi Lara 's first half free kick .
