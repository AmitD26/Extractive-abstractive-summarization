-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With Halloween right around the corner , it 's about time someone checked to see whether `` The Bachelor '' is cursed .

The ABC dating competition show does n't have the best track record when it comes to lasting love connections , and the show 's latest match , Juan Pablo Galavis and Nikki Ferrell , have reportedly called it quits .

This is n't entirely surprising , considering the couple has fought off rumors that they were ill-fated from the start .

During his season on `` The Bachelor , '' which aired this year , Galavis was reviled by fans for his apparent lack of sensitivity toward the women competing to be his love interest .

By the time he got down to his final two options , Galavis was n't interested in proposing to either contestant , although he did want to pursue a relationship with Ferrell . One of the big sticking points for fans was Galavis ' refusal to say whether he was in love with Ferrell .

The months that followed `` The Bachelor 's '' finale in the spring were filled with rumors of a breakup , and those rumors only became louder when Ferrell and Galavis signed up for season 5 of VH1 's `` Couple 's Therapy . ''

Apparently that therapy did n't stick . Over the weekend , Ferrell is said to have unfollowed Galavis on Twitter and Instagram , while posting a message on her own Instagram feed that many think was aimed at Galavis :

`` Is n't it pathetic how we waste so much time on certain people and in the end they prove that they were n't even worth a second of it , '' the message says .

According to People magazine , Ferrell 's romance with Galavis is definitely done .

`` It ca n't be saved , and they 're not even speaking anymore , '' a source told the magazine . The source added that Galavis was `` getting tired of her childish antics and temper tantrums , '' but it was Ferrell who `` decided that she did n't want to keep up the facade anymore . ''
