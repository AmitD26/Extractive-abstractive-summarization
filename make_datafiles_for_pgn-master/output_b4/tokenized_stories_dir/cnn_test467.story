-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ever since we saw him pop up on `` The Walking Dead '' last season , we 've been wondering : Does Eugene really have the cure for the show 's `` walker virus '' ?

Sunday night 's episode gave us a definitive answer to this burning question : Eugene is a fraud ; he 's not a scientist and does n't actually know how to cure the plague .

We spoke to Josh McDermitt , who plays Eugene , about his time on `` The Walking Dead '' and what might be next for the character -LRB- that is , assuming he 's OK after being beaten up by Michael Cudlitz 's Abraham -RRB- .

Also , we talked mullets :

CNN : Were you surprised at the truth about Eugene , or were you told ahead of time ?

Josh McDermitt : When I booked the role , I knew that Eugene was n't a scientist , but I did n't know it was gon na come this season .

When I sat down with -LRB- executive producer -RRB- Scott Gimple at the start of the season , we started to detail everything in vague terms about what 's gon na happen for the character and the season . He said , `` In episode five , we 'll find out he 's not a scientist . ''

I was like , wow , I did n't expect it to come that quick . I thought it would play out over the season . For it to happen that quickly , it will be fun to see where Eugene heads next -- if he 's alive !

CNN : What do you think of Eugene 's true motivation ?

McDermitt : I think we 'd all be scared in this apocalypse . Some people have the strength and agility to rise to the top , and then there 's people like Eugene who have to improvise and figure out a different way to survive .

Abraham says it 's to the point where everyone still alive is really strong , and either they help you or you kill them .

Eugene looks at himself as not having anything to offer to the group . It 's a scary place . I will defend the guy in terms of wanting to survive . I do n't know if I would lie like that , but I 'm just happy I did n't get Daryl killed or anything -- then everyone would hate Eugene for sure . Now they 're just upset the hope is gone .

CNN : What can you tell us about his current relationship with Abraham after this huge fight ?

McDermitt : It 's not just that , it 's the relationship he has with Rosita and Tara . He and Tara feel like outsiders , and she 's trying to work her way back into the group .

I think that 's where Eugene will want to go : `` How do I get back into this group ? How do I patch up the damage I 've done and figure out where my place is in this group ? ''

There 's a little bit of hope for Eugene , but at this point he 's a broken man , starting over .

CNN : How much did you know about `` The Walking Dead '' going in ?

McDermitt : I knew the comic but had n't read it . Once I found out who it was I was playing , I went back and quickly caught up . It was very informative to see the choices -LRB- creator Robert -RRB- Kirkman made that they did n't necessarily go with -LRB- on -RRB- the show . I was able to bring some of that from the comics into the character and that brings something to what we 're doing . I had to put it down for a while , because I was afraid I would influence it too much . I was a giant fan of the show and did n't want to be the one that ruined it . -LRB- laughs -RRB-

CNN : So we have to ask : How do you like having a mullet ?

McDermitt : In the audition they 're very secretive ; they wo n't tell you the character name . The character they had me reading had a mohawk . I got so excited that I might have a mohawk . Then when I found out it was a mullet , I was like this is the only haircut I could get better . To be able to go on TV and be instantly recognizable as this guy representing so many lost souls in our country . I do n't think we 've had a good mullet on TV since Uncle Jesse from `` Full House , '' so I 'm glad to bring it back .

CNN : What is next for Abraham 's army ?

McDermitt : At this moment , they 're still together . We 're not gon na flash-forward six months or anything . We 'll see how the damage is repaired , and it 's not pretty , I 'll tell you that .
