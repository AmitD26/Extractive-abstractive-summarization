Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- High school boys in a California town overlooking San Francisco Bay started a `` Fantasy Slut League '' targeting girls , school officials said Tuesday .

Piedmont High School Principal Rich Kitchens said in a letter to parents last week that boys organized `` a ` Fantasy Slut League ' in which our female students -LRB- unbeknownst to most of them -RRB- are drafted as part of the league , '' according to CNN affiliate KGO .

`` Male students earn points for documented engagement in sexual activities with female students , '' the principal wrote , according to KGO . `` Participation often involved pressure/manipulation by older students that included alcohol to impair judgment/control and social demands to be popular . ''

Opinion : Talk to your kids about sex

Kitchens , who said the school is investigating the accusations , could n't be immediately reached for comment Tuesday .

Piedmont Unified School District Superintendent Constance Hubbard 's office declined to release a copy of the principal 's letter .

But the superintendent is encouraging educators , parents and their teenagers to discuss how `` to make good choices and to treat each other with respect and dignity , '' she said in a statement Tuesday .

`` We wanted to communicate to families to encourage a dialogue and to inform parents of what we as a school community are doing to proactively address activities that are detrimental to the culture we want for our students , '' Hubbard said .

Piedmont , an affluent community of 11,000 residents , sits in Oakland Hills overlooking the bay . The tight-knit city consists of `` established , high-quality homes on quiet tree-lined streets , '' according to the city 's website .

The principal 's letter said school staff members learned of the boys ' activity during a recent assembly about date rape prevention , KGO reported .

The assembly , held for parents October 2 and for freshmen and new students the next day , involved members of the advanced acting class performing `` scenarios based on true stories from our school , '' the high school 's website says . The Parents Night was designed as a preview so parents could discuss the program with their children .

`` Achieve the Honorable '' is the longstanding school motto , the website says . Its Facebook page says U.S. News & World Report named the school one of the best in the country .

Piedmont interim Police Chief Scott Wyatt said his department of 20 sworn personnel has n't received any communication from the school system .

`` Everything we heard is from the media , and we 've had not any reports of criminal activity , '' Wyatt said .
