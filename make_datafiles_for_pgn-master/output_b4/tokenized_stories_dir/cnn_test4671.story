-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The midterm elections are less than three weeks away , but by several measures , Democrats have already won .

Sure , elections are about the race to the top between competing candidates , but they 're also a barometer on long-term trends , issues and party trajectories . While the winners of this season 's sprints have yet to be determined , Democrats look well-positioned for the lengthier political marathon . How ?

1 . There 's still a contest for the Senate

Historically , the party in the White House tends to lose seats in Congress during midterm elections . The second midterm election of a two-term president -- as this election is for President Barack Obama -- is usually brutal . Only six times since the Civil War has a president come close to gaining seats in both chambers in a sixth-year election .

Add to that this year there are simply more Democratic-held Senate seats up for grabs -- with more ranked `` toss ups '' than Republican-held seats -- and the very fact that Democrats still have a shot at holding onto the Senate is , as Vice President Joe Biden might say , a BFD .

2 . Democratic policies are emerging as third rails

Witness Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , running for re-election in Kentucky , and the dance he did around Obamacare during a debate . McConnell insisted that he would repeal Obamacare `` root and branch '' but somehow , miraculously , keep the law 's state-based health insurance exchange .

This shows that despite the lackluster rollout of the Obamacare website , voters still overwhelmingly support the particular details and programs of the law , even in places such as Kentucky , where over 400,000 people have enrolled for health coverage under Obamacare 's provisions .

As the law continues to take hold -- and become more effective and popular -- that rhetorical dance will get more uncomfortable for Republicans , who are still struggling to reconcile their opposition to equal pay legislation , raising the minimum wage , refinancing student loans and extending benefits for the unemployed .

When President Obama said -- `` I am not on the ballot this fall . Michelle 's pretty happy about that . But make no mistake : these policies are on the ballot '' -- he was right . And when the American people weigh in on Democratic policies , they 'll probably side with Democrats .

3 . Voters know about `` Republican War on Women ''

In 2012 , it was easy to say the whole `` War on Women '' thing was an aberration that can be blamed on a few errant GOP candidates such as Todd Aiken . But this year , Republicans doubled down on their attacks on women 's opportunity and reproductive freedom -- and the `` Republican War on Women '' brand will now forevermore stick .

In New Hampshire , the Republican platform has adopted `` fetal personhood '' into its state party platform , echoing conservative-backed referenda on the ballots in Colorado , Tennessee and North Dakota that would severely restrict women 's control over their own pregnancies . Republicans also opposed the mandate in Obamacare to make birth control affordable and accessible through all health insurance . They have also blocked equal pay legislation and held up re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act .

Economic equality and reproductive freedom are basic priorities for women voters , a group that Republicans already had a tough time winning over . The GOP even commissioned its own poll that found women voters are `` barely receptive '' to Republican ideas and think the party is `` intolerant '' and `` stuck in the past . '' By their own deeds , not to mention rhetoric , Republicans just keep reinforcing their war on women and driving voters away .

4 . Republicans appear desperate

Was n't this election supposed to be about Obamacare ? No , that did n't work . So Republicans tried to make the midterms about Benghazi . No luck there either . Now they 're just generally fear-mongering around ISIS and Ebola and hoping that would work .

But the constantly shifting Republican shell game shows how little substantive traction conservatives have with average voters outside their highly gerrymandered House districts . Every time they open their mouths , Republican candidates show that they habitually bash President Obama to distract from the impression that they have neither the intention nor ability to help solve urgent problems facing the country .

When you 're so worried about the outcome of an election you actively try to discourage Americans from voting , even if it means violating the constitution and values you 're sworn to protect . Mind you , it 's deeply disturbing that Republicans have used the fig leaf of voter fraud to justify disenfranchising countless legitimate voters to serve their partisan ends .

But voter ID laws are a kind of Hail Mary pass thrown by a GOP all too aware that if it just lets everyone keep voting , Republicans are going to keep losing elections -- especially as the American electorate gets younger and more racially diverse .

That Republicans do n't mind alienating voters by opposing same-sex marriage and immigration reform , which most young voters support , suggests a profound desperation -- namely , a party aware that it ca n't transform itself for the future and so willing to settle for last gasps of power with its old white voter base . Meanwhile , Democrats are registering new progressive voters in states such as Georgia and Texas at unprecedented rates .

We still do n't know which party will prevail on Election Day this November . But if these trends are any indication , it will soon become clear which party will increasingly prevail in elections down the road -- the kind of ultimate victory that really counts .
