-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sweden is having a very good year ... in America .

Anticipation is building for the film version of journalist Stieg Larsson 's immensely popular book `` The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo '' -LRB- due in theaters in December -RRB- , Stockholm-based streaming service Spotify just launched last month in the United States to acclaim from tech blogs , and branches of Swedish discount store H&M are opening in malls across America with their winning formula of designer duds at bargain basement prices -LRB- the first Texas outpost of the chain debuted last week in Dallas -RRB- .

But the way the Nordic nation is most influencing America this year is via several stellar singer/songwriters who are resonating with fans in a way not seen in the United States since acts like Ace of Base and Roxette ruled the airwaves and MTV .

Today , the names to know are Robyn , Lykke Li and Swedish House Mafia , all of whom have suddenly moved beyond cult status and crept into the mainstream , selling out shows and popping up on some of the largest radio stations in America . The United States ' embrace of Sweden this year has pleased one artist , Robyn , who has taken the proverbial long road to success over the past 15 years or so .

`` I have been touring this record since May 2010 to continue what I started with the last album , '' she said after an appearance on `` The Tonight Show with Jay Leno '' earlier this month . `` I wanted to build my audience in the U.S. in an organic way . It seems to work , although it 's very hard for me to say why . ... I hope it 's because the music is good . ''

For the humble performer , who is known for her quirky outfits and earnest delivery devoid of pop star artifice , being Swedish is paramount to her personality , and by extension , her music .

`` Because of where we are geographically , we probably see ourselves as outsiders , '' she explained when asked why Sweden seems to produce so many interesting artists who are winning fans across multiple genres of music at the moment .

`` We consume and are fascinated by Anglo-American culture , and I think that has made it possible for us to make music that makes sense in the big world as well , '' she added .

Proof of Robyn 's assertion could be found at Gothenburg 's Way Out West festival earlier this month , where progressive bookers reportedly laid out more than $ 2 million to land names such as Prince and Kanye West to play alongside homegrown talents such as Säkert and Robyn as a cross-pollination experiment -- providing a heady mélange of influences that thrilled and will likely inspire young Swedes who are already avid fans of rappers such as West as well as more traditional songwriters .

Just as Swedes are interested in uniquely American artists like Prince , so too are Americans becoming curious about quintessentially Swedish names such as Robyn .

The singer topped many critics ' Top 10 lists last year with her `` Body Talk '' series , which is still selling slowly , though steadily , this year as the passionate 32-year-old keeps converting new fans via video releases on YouTube and buzzed-about live shows .

But it 's not just Robyn cutting deep into the hearts of U.S. music fans . Lykke Li has seen surprising success abroad with a different sound that is proving no less appealing to many . The singer recently sold out shows at Los Angeles ' Greek Theater and New York 's Summerstage and has received airplay on influential rock station KROQ and elsewhere . Her new record , `` Wounded Rhymes , '' has so far sold around 62,000 copies , per Nielsen SoundScan , and is tipped as one to top many critical Top 10 lists this year .

In the indie rock world , where acts from Stockholm 's ripe experimental pop scene have long been championed , names such as Peter , Bjorn & John , Little Radio and The Teddybears continue to excite adventurous music consumers .

However , it 's dance music where Sweden has truly left its mark recently , and 2011 is proving a banner year for Swedish DJs such as Avicii , Swedish House Mafia and Dada Life -- all of whom are connecting with young fans of house music who flock to festivals such as Las Vegas ' massive Electric Daisy Carnival . The DJs spotlight sweeping , optimistic anthems that pulse with confidence and aspire outward with an escapist sound big enough to fill any void in a globally depressed economy .

`` It 's so cold in Sweden and there 's nothing much to do ... a lot of us dream of getting out , '' said Avicii , aka Tim Bergling , after a set in Europe where the 21-year-old played to a crowd of around 25,000 people . `` We see the success of people like Swedish House Mafia and it 's an inspiration . ''

It 's that success of Swedes abroad that seems to be the key to why Sweden outperforms its Scandinavian neighbors in the music industry . Despite a wealth of talent from countries such as Denmark , Finland and Norway , it 's only Sweden that has numerous blogs such as New York 's The Swede Beat and Chicago 's Swedesplease obsessively tracking new music from the Nordic nation .

Swedish influences are being felt in America in major U.S cities such as Los Angeles , which boasts bands aping the `` Swedish sound . '' Southern California , in fact , has long been connected to Stockholm in music circles , and the cities are only getting closer . Swedish producers living and working in L.A. , such as Max Martin -LRB- who has penned hits for artists such as Britney Spears and plans a permanent move to L.A. this fall with his family -RRB- and Red One -LRB- Lady Gaga -RRB- , have helped craft a sound that has all but taken over urban and pop radio formats in the United States . When labels or managers need an uplifting hit , Swedes often get the call .

So what 's the secret that 's made Sweden a virtual hit factory since the days of ABBA ? The reasons are myriad , but Malmö-born , L.A.-based producer/songwriter Tobias Karlsson has a few ideas .

`` There 's more focus on melody in Sweden , '' said the co-founder of music-licensing company Thunderhoney .

`` Sweden has a very strong folk music tradition spanning back 800 years at least which is almost all melody driven , '' continued the producer , who is fresh off work on a Carolina Liar record .

Robyn echoed the sentiment . `` Swedish folk music is so melancholic and melodious and I seem to find those qualities in Swedish modern music as well , '' she said .

`` A lot of countries do n't have that melody tradition , but us Swedes are pretty crafty . ... We like to engineer and make sure everything is perfect , '' Karlsson said .

For music lovers in America , that quixotic quest for melodic pop perfection has not gone unnoticed in 2011 .
