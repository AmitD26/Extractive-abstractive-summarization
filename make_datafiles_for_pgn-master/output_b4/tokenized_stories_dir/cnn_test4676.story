-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The best leaders make us feel unsure of ourselves .

This may sound counterintuitive . Are n't leaders are supposed to build confidence ? At times , encouraging people is effective .

Other times , when people are stuck seeing things one way or they are resistant to change , creating a little discomfort in the conversation could help them grow .

People need you to help them think through difficult issues even though they do n't feel comfortable in the process .

It is very difficult for any of us to question our beliefs and behaviors .

Our brain 's protective instinct keeps us from in-depth self-exploration . We can only see `` outside the box '' when we read or hear something that surprises our brains .

The best way to help people see outside the box to objectively consider their circumstances is to listen to how they describe their situation , reflect on what they are saying , and then ask questions that cause them to review their thoughts and behavior .

If your words break through their protective barriers , the moment will feel awkward . They might feel a pinch of anger , embarrassment , or sadness when their blind spot is revealed . Then they grow .

Generating insights create breakthroughs in thinking .

To create these breakthrough moments , try the DREAM model . It is a coaching approach where you encourage the person to talk as you listen for cluesâ € '' gaps in logic , faulty assumptions , fears , attachments to the past , and conflicting valuesâ € '' that could be blocks to seeing the way forward . You then share what you hear and you sense , allowing the person to accept or reject your comments .

The point is to help the person to think , not to change him or her . This coaching approach creates a two-sided conversation where the recipient feels respected . The steps include :

D : Determine what the person wants as a desired outcome of the conversation . Help the person to define what they want , not what you want for them .

Do they want to be seen by others as a leader ? Do they want more respect from their peers ? Do they want to feel less stressed ? Determine what is in the conversation for them so you can then move toward achieving this outcome .

R : Reflect on the experiences , beliefs and emotions expressed .

When you listen and clarify what you hear , people feel heard and understood . Then you can help them sort out truth from speculation , instantly giving them a view of what else might be true .

E : Explore possible sources of blind spots and resistance . Ask about the desires , disappointments , and fears you sense they are feeling .

Do n't worry about long pauses between your questions and their response . It takes a moment for blind spots to come to light .

A : Acknowledge the emerging awareness .

Have the other person clearly articulate the key takeaways . Many people will stop and say , `` Wow , I had not thought about it that way before , '' or `` Yes , I see what you mean '' and then plunge forward with a solution .

Acknowledging their `` aha '' insight reinforces their new perspective .

M : Make sure there 's a plan or commitment for what 's next . Ask the person what they will now do and when they will do it .

Even if they say they have to take some time to think about what they discovered , ask how they will do this and what impact their new thinking will have on the desired outcome they defined when you started the conversation .

When reflecting , exploring , and acknowledging , quiet your judgmental brain and refrain from jumping in and giving the person advice . The Discomfort Zone is full of tips and examples on how to use the process in your conversations . The best advice : They want you to be present more than they need you to be perfect !
