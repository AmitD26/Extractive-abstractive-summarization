Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Between the Ebola threat , fears about ISIS , a slow economic recovery and little enthusiasm for President Barack Obama or Congress , it 's hard to believe that many Americans feel good about anything .

But an overlooked piece of data in a recent CNN/ORC poll revealed a surprising number of Americans are upbeat despite the seemingly constant onslaught of bad news .

When asked , `` how are things going in the country today , '' 50 % of respondents said things were going either `` very well '' or `` fairly well . ''

Of course , that 's not an overwhelming vote of confidence in the state of the union . And , indeed , 49 % of people in the same survey felt the country was in bad shape .

Still , it is the first time at least half of the people who took part in CNN 's regular surveys expressed that much confidence since April 2013 . And it was only the seventh time at least 50 % said that they felt this good since early in 2004 .

In some ways this relative equanimity may not be as surprising as it may seem at first blush . For some time , researchers have seen a brightening mood in the country about the economy . And despite breathless concerns being voiced in several quarters that the existence of several Ebola patients would transform the U.S. into a sequel of the movie `` Contagion , '' the public has not become very worried about the disease .

According to Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director , the percentage of people who feel good about the current status of the country , `` has been ticking up the last few times we asked the question . It went down when the ISIS crisis started and before the Syrian airstrikes started . That tells me that people were worried about ISIS , but they became less concerned when the U.S. started taking some sort of action . ''

The optimism is n't much help to Democrats heading into the midterm elections weighed down by unhappiness with Obama . Majorities in the same CNN/ORC poll still disapprove of his handling of the economy , foreign affairs and health care policy . Half of those surveyed also disapprove of his handling of terrorism .

And the sanguine mood can also be ephemeral , changing from week to week as different news events impact the sense of calm . For example , the CNN/ORC poll was conducted before the death of Thomas Eric Duncan , the Liberian man who was hospitalized in Dallas with Ebola and the news that one of the health care working tending to him also contracted the disease .

There is no question that the CNN/ORC survey is out of step of most polls that depict the American public in a fearful and dour mood . Just this week , a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that two-thirds of registered voters felt the country is on the `` wrong track , '' while just a quarter believe it was headed in the right direction .

The varying results could be explained in the difference in the question 's wording .

Asking how things are going today prompts a person to make a clear-eyed assessment of the status of the country right now . The right track/wrong track question asks people to gage how things will be in the future . It is not inconceivable for a person to feel pretty sanguine about the current states of affairs , but very worried about what could be around the corner .

`` There have been times in American history -- and this may be one of them -- when people feel things are ok right now , but there are good reasons to be concerned about what may happen in the future , '' Holland said .

Beyond feeling somewhat better ISIS , there is the economy . It is possible that lower unemployment , an uptick in consumer spending and the robust growth in GDP growth may be starting to affect outlook .

`` There are a lot of polls showing improvement in the public 's perception of how the economy is doing , '' said Karlyn Bowman , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who specializes in analyzing polls and public opinion . `` Having said that , it 's been a long , slow road to full recovery . ''

While some experts say that the continued stagnation in wage growth contributes most to the publics displeasure with the economy , there is one trend that is making a large contribution to the improve public mood : gasoline prices .

Despite continued turmoil in the Middle East , prices at the pump are set to be at their lowest level since 2010 , according to gasbuddy.com , which tracks prices in North America . The website says 10 % of the country 's gas stations are pricing a gallon of regular gasoline under $ 3.00 .

While many economic statistics such as GDP growth and jobless figures are mere abstractions to most people , gasoline prices are a tangible marker visible on almost every street corner , every day .

`` One economic indicator you see once every few minutes while driving around your neighborhood is the price of gas , '' said Jared Bernstein , a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities . `` It registers with people when that improves and I believe it feeds into consumer confidence and polling results . ''

Happiness about the fall in gasoline prices could be offset by increases in the cost of meat , bread , milk and other food staples .

But since studies indicate that women overwhelmingly still do the grocery shopping , men are somewhat insulated from confronting fluctuations in food prices . In contrast , everyone sees changes in the price of gas as they drive around town . That may be one reason why 56 % of men felt things were going well in the country , compared to 44 % of women .

`` Gasoline is magical , '' says Tom Kloza , senior oil analyst for gasbuddy.com . `` Everybody knows what they pay for it . ''
