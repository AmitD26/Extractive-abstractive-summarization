-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A group of fans who support Russian soccer giant Zenit St Petersburg has unveiled a manifesto urging the club not to sign black players .

The Landscrona group posted the `` Selection 12 manifesto '' on its website Monday , prompting the club to issue its own statement to CNN emphasizing its policy of diversity and tolerance .

Zenit spent a reported $ 103 million on black players Hulk , from Brazil , and Belgium international Axel Witsel in September .

The Brazilian striker 's arrival has caused problems within the squad , with Zenit captain Igor Denisov dropped to the reserve team after complaining about Hulk 's arrival and the wages he commands .

Racism row shines light on Serbian football

In a detailed letter on its website , Landscrona stated their opposition to Zenit signing any players who are black or gay .

`` We 're not racists but we see the absence of black players at Zenit as an important tradition . '' the letter said . `` We are against representatives of sexual minorities playing for Zenit .

`` For us it is crucial -LRB- Zenit -RRB- has retained its own identity , and not turned into an average European team , with a standard set of foreign players .

`` We only want players from other brotherly Slav nations , such as Ukraine and Belarus as well as from the Baltic states and Scandinavia . We have the same mentality and historical and cultural background as these nations .

`` Any other continents except Europe , should not be a priority for -LRB- Zenit -RRB- . This does not mean that it is a taboo . But flying to Latin America only makes sense if we honestly and professionally tried everything possible to find a player in the region , Russia and Europe . ''

Russian soccer has been troubled by incidents of racism in recent years , with former Brazil player Roberto Carlos being abused while playing for Anzhi Makhachkala . The defender asked to be substituted in a game in 2011 after picking up a banana that was thrown at him from the stands .

The media attention given to Landscrona 's letter comes as Russia continues its preparations to host the 2018 World Cup .

Zenit responded with a statement , sent to CNN World Sport , stating the club does not `` support archaic values . ''

It read : `` FC Zenit has always been distinguished by its tolerant approach to players of various nationalities and confessions , and has always had diversity in its side .

Football grapples with anti-Semitism storm

`` Furthermore , our club has millions of fans from all continents of the world . St. Petersburg is an open city which historically has united various cultures .

`` Zenit invites players to the team exclusively thanks to their sporting qualities and achievements , not based on their nationality or skin color . The club 's policy is aimed at development and integration into the world football community . We do not support archaic values .

`` We continue to be sure that fighting all manifestations of intolerance is the only principle for development of our club , football , and sports as a whole in the world . ''

It is the latest racism controversy to blight European football in recent months .

Italian club Lazio was fined $ 52,000 by UEFA following racist chanting by its supporters during the Europa League fixture with Tottenham in September .

The Serbian Football Association was fined $ 105,000 following an Under-21 match in which opposing players from the England team said they were racially abused .

Meanwhile , In the English Premier League West Ham vowed to ban for life any fans found guilty of anti-Semitic chanting during their match at Tottenham in November .
