-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Valuable insight into our health is lurking beneath our city streets . `` We can reveal the invisible in a city . The underworld we do n't see every day , '' says architect Carlo Ratti .

The underworld Ratti is referring to is our sewers -- home to the most personalized waste a city has to offer . As director of the Senseable City Lab at MIT , his `` Underworlds '' project is using this waste to open up a new world of information on human health and behavior through a platform he calls `` Smart Sewage . ''

`` New techniques in biology allow us to characterize bacteria and viruses leaving our bodies . -LSB- This is -RSB- the microbiome of us , '' explains Ratti . His team is currently designing prototype smart platforms that collect sewage , filter it and use computational techniques to analyze any genetic material present to identify any viruses and bacteria , as well as spotting specific chemicals using a technique known as mass spectrometry .

Ratti aims to characterize a city 's microbiome -LRB- the vast community of microbes that lives in the human body -RRB- and ultimately `` see epidemics before they happen . ''

Detecting infections

The main benefits lie in the real-time aspect of the technology , providing insight into the diseases circulating in a community before the people affected know for themselves . `` The steps involved in disease diagnosis are slow , '' Ratti explains . First , people need to notice symptoms of illness , and then they have to begin the process of doctors ' appointments and tests to get a diagnosis . Testing sewage could be a faster way to predict the presence of infections among the population .

To begin with , the project will primarily look for influenza and gastroenteritis-related outbreaks , such as salmonella and rotavirus infections , but the potential public health benefits go beyond outbreak prediction and surveillance .

`` Most of what 's going in and out of a city is the water going in and sewage coming out , '' says Eric Alm , professor of Biological Engineering and Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT , who runs the Underworlds project alongside Ratti . `` The change in water in and out reflects a broad array of human activity going on in a city , '' he adds . But Alm admits there are many challenges ahead and that it 's not as straightforward as getting DNA from the sewage and sequencing it . `` It 's only useful if we can figure out what kind of sewage water it is , '' he says .

The water in our sewers is a mix of water from showers , toilets and rain , and the resulting chemicals and microorganisms will vary depending on the source . `` The second challenge is , who has contributed to that water ? '' explains Alm .

But he believes his team can build a robust platform to not only monitor changes in health , but also see what chemicals are being released into the water by industries , as well as monitor chemical security threats and even assess the impact of health policies by looking at other biological factors . `` There 's a whole host of applications we can use , '' says Alm .

Live trials

The first city to trial their prototype will be the one local to MIT -- Boston . This will be piloted in 2016 , ready for a bigger prototype set to be implemented in Kuwait City the following year , where the team has formed a partnership with Kuwaiti stakeholders including its Ministry of Health .

Trials are essential to understand the true sensitivity of such a technology and the extent to which microorganisms such as viruses can be detected .

`` It 's a clever idea in principle , '' says Sandy Cairncross , professor of Environmental Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine . But he remains unsure whether the bacteria and viruses being targeted can be easily found .

`` Some organisms are more fragile than others and will die in the sewers , some are difficult to detect in small numbers and some are more numerous than others , '' he says . Cairncross recalls a cholera study that took swabs of sewage from manholes in Dhaka , Bangladesh , but failed to find a single one these bacteria . `` It has potential but will take a lot of trial and error to find which results are reliable or meaningful , '' he adds .

The concerns are shared by the team at MIT . `` We need to figure out how far down from somebody 's home or business you can still see organisms , '' explains Alm , who also suggests they may need to time sampling to `` peak poop hours '' during the day , such as the morning .

But they have had some success . `` We did some early studies last year and detected some flu viruses , which we were very excited about . '' Their sewage success was indeed exciting as the types of organisms expected to be found are those associated with the gastrointestinal tract , such as salmonella , whereas flu viruses are respiratory . `` I 'm optimistic , '' says Alm .

Smart toilet

Whilst the short-term plan is to use this technology platform to collect information about entire populations , in the future it could become more personalized , via a smart toilet .

`` We will be able to monitor the microbiome individually , and tell you about your body , '' says Ratti about the overall vision for the technology , `` to monitor and detect this before you fall sick . ''

Alm monitored his own microbiome for a year back in 2009 , which involved noting every food item consumed and analyzing his every bowel movement . But the arduous task provided detailed insight into the microbial communities living inside his body and the impact any changes in travel , diet or health had on their composition .

The smart toilets are likely to begin simple , with a device to drop into a toilet rather than a toilet you buy outright with technology installed . But the information provided could add to the growing field of personalized medicine and healthcare .

The immediate future , however , remains the glamorous task of mining sewage to visualize urban health patterns . `` Sewage is the most logical start point , '' concludes Alm about his goals to find the bugs infecting a city . `` You never know until you go out and find it . ''
