LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When people think of coffee , words such as caffeine , aroma and energy may spring to mind . ` Good breath , ' however , certainly is n't one of them .

Mel Rosenberg at work in his ` smell laboratory ' found that coffee can lead to good breath .

So researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel , were in for a surprise when their study into the relation between coffee and bad breath , showed that coffee can actually lead to good breath .

Breath specialist Mel Rosenberg of the university 's Faculty of Medicine found that there are certain components in coffee that inhibit the bacteria that lead to bad breath -- preventing these bacteria from making their presence felt , or smelt .

`` Everybody thinks that coffee causes bad breath , '' Rosenberg told CNN `` and as a latte drinker , I believe that too . ''

But the malodor does n't necessarily come from the coffee itself , said Rosenberg : `` We think that coffee , which has a dehydrating effect on the mouth , can ferment into bad breath when mixed with substances such as milk . ''

This meant that until recently , coffee was up there with not eating a healthy breakfast , not drinking enough water and consuming alcohol as causes for unpleasant mouth odors .

But until Rosenberg 's study , no one had ever scientifically shown the link between the consumption of coffee and bad breath .

Rosenberg 's team wanted to prove just that . They did the research by taking saliva and incubating it with different brands of coffee including the Israeli brand Elite coffee , Landwer Turkish coffee , and Taster 's Choice .

`` We thought this coffee and saliva mixture would have a terrible odor , but incredibly it had the opposite effect . ''

Rosenberg -- who also created popular mouthwash Dentyl pH -- is now thinking about creating a mouthwash , toothpaste , or chewing gum based on coffee .

The effects could be similar to plant extracts such as clove oil , which have also been shown to have anti-bacterial properties that prevent bad breath .

But first Rosenberg would have to find which of the hundreds of components in coffee are the ones that have these beneficial properties . `` That will take a long time '' said Rosenberg .

`` But this research has already been a lesson in humility , showing that assumptions are not always correct . '' Rosenberg -- who also writes children 's books such as ` Mel the Smell Dragon ' -- told CNN .

`` And sometimes , getting it wrong can create even more interesting outcomes . ''
