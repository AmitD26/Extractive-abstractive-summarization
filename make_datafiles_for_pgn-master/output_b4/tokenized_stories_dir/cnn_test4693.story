-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- No sooner had Luis Suarez appeared to have taken a ` bite ' out of Giorgio Chiellini 's shoulder , social media was already sinking its teeth into the Uruguay striker .

Suarez , who has previously been banned twice for biting , was accused by Italy 's Chiellini of trying to have a quick nibble during the final stages of Uruguay 's 1-0 World Cup victory .

`` Suarez is a sneak and he gets away with it because FIFA want their stars to play in the World Cup , '' Chiellini told Sky Sports Italia after the incident .

While the referee may not have witnessed the incident , millions across the world soon weighed in with their own opinions on the matter .

The 27-year-old Liverpool forward might be left chewing over this one for quite a while given the volume of online activity .

Suarez was banned for 10 games in April 2013 after being found guilty of biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic .

He was also guilty of biting during his time in the Netherlands with Ajax where he was banned for seven games after leaving a scar on the collarbone of Otman Bakkal .

And Twitter users were quick to remind him of his former transgressions with even Major League Baseball getting involved .

While most of the comments on Twitter criticized Suarez 's actions , some took the opportunity to offer the forward the opportunity to dine out on his latest antics .

McDonalds in his home country offered him a meal while he can always visit his local Nando 's in Liverpool upon his return to England if he 's short of a mouthful .

There was also a word for Suarez from someone who knows exactly what its like to have their ear bitten off -- literally .

Evander Holyfield , the retired former heavyweight boxer once had part of his ear bitten off by opponent Mike Tyson during a fight in 1997 .

And he was quick to throw a jab Suarez 's way on Twitter .
