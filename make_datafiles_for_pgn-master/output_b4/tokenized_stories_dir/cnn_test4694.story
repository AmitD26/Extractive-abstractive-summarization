The disorder broke out as about 5,000 Russian fans reached Warsaw 's Poniatowski Bridge , on their way to the National Stadium , the Interior Ministry said , with `` hooligans '' from both sides seeking to start a fight .

Riot police took `` decisive '' action to stop it from escalating , the ministry said . Some 6,000 police were on duty Tuesday in Warsaw .
