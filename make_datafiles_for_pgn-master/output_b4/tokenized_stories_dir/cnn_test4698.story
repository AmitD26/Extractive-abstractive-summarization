-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Far from the sea , a man-made coral reef is taking shape -- and it could change medical operations forever .

Step inside the OkCoral lab in Israel 's Negev Desert and you 'll find row after row of quietly bubbling fish tanks , each containing a precious substance .

It is hoped the coral grown in this surreal `` farm , '' could one day be used in bone operations -- encompassing everything from dental implants to spinal procedures .

Unlike animal and human bones , coral ca n't be rejected by the body , say medical experts at the company CoreBone , which manufactures bone replacements from coral .

Grown in the lab , this coral is also free from the diseases you might find in the oceanic variety .

Start-up science

Assaf Shaham founded the unusual laboratory six years ago at a cost of $ 2.5 million , with an ambitious vision of tapping into the billion dollar worldwide bone grafting industry .

But first he 'll need the approval of authorities in the European Union and U.S. , with a decision expected next year .

The father-of-two 's dedication to the business is astounding -- if not a little disconcerting .

`` In six years of growing corals , I have n't left these four walls for more than 12 hours -- not even once , '' he said .

`` For me , it 's 100 % learning as I go . I take the mother colony , and I cut off a branch of the coral with a diamond saw . Then I glue it to another base made out of cement . ''

The delicate ecosystem needs constant care to ensure the water 's salinity , temperature , and chemical make-up is perfect -- any variations and the coral could die .

The fish swimming around each tank are essentially the `` worker bees '' of the artificial reef . They eat the algae growing on the coral , their feces helps feed the coral , and finally , their movements in the water keep the coral strong .

And much like the traditional canary in the coalmine , if the fish die , you know something 's not quite right in the water .

Clever company ?

Happily for Shaham , his ambitious experiment appears to be thriving , with coral in the lab growing at ten times the normal rate .

Just a small container of the coral costs roughly $ 5 to $ 10 to produce , and sells for around $ 250 .

One of the biggest benefits of the business is its environmental sustainability .

`` We have a constant supply , '' says Ohad Schwartz of company CoreBone .

`` We do n't have to worry that in several years , harvesting from the sea could be forbidden . ''

It 's a concern they 'll never have to think about , when harvesting these remarkable fruits of the desert .
