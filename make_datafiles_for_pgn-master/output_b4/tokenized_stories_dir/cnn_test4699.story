Lviv , Ukraine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ukraine and the European Union ratified a political and economic agreement Tuesday in a step leaders hailed as a `` historic moment . ''

The EU Association Agreement includes free-trade provisions , although they will not come into force until January 1 , 2016 .

Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych 's decision to drop the agreement last year in favor of closer ties with Moscow triggered the popular unrest that led to his ouster , Russia 's annexation of Ukraine 's Crimea region and months of fighting in eastern Ukraine .

European lawmakers backed ratification in a vote in Strasbourg , France , while Ukraine 's parliament voted at the same time in Kiev to approve the deal .

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tweeted afterward , `` 355 votes for . EU Association Agreement has been ratified . Glory to Ukraine ! ''

Addressing his parliament before the vote , he said the Ukrainian people had `` reversed the express train going East '' toward Russia and thanked the EU for its support .

`` This is an historic moment , '' European Parliament President Martin Schulz told EU lawmakers .

` Special status '

Ukraine 's parliament also voted Tuesday in favor of legislation that would give `` special status '' to rebel-held parts of eastern Ukraine 's Donetsk and Luhansk regions and grant amnesty to the separatists .

A shaky ceasefire is in place between the pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces who have been battling for control of the region .

The `` special status '' legislation applies only to the area of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions currently under the control of the separatists , according to the Ukrainian parliament 's official website .

The granting of amnesty will apply only after the separatists have given up their weapons , handed over all those being held hostage and ended their occupation of public buildings , according to the legislation . This , in effect , means disarmament must take place before criminal cases are dropped .

The amnesty will not apply to those suspected of carrying out the July shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine . All 298 people on board the plane died .

Rebels reject disarmament

However , Andrey Purgin , the first deputy Prime Minister of the self-declared Donetsk People 's Republic , told CNN that the Ukrainian government in Kiev can forget about disarmament in exchange for amnesty .

`` It will never happen , '' he said in a phone conversation .

Purgin said the Donetsk rebel leadership considered the special status legislation as no more than a basis for future negotiations with Kiev , and felt under no obligation to accept its initiatives because it does not consider itself part of Ukraine .

`` This was a decision of the Ukrainian parliament , not of our parliament , '' he said , adding , `` This law will not stop the fighting . ''

Purgin also said the legislation marked a step forward in one sense because it represented a partial acceptance by Kiev of the existence of the Donetsk People 's Republic , whereas previously the rebels had been simply dismissed as terrorists .

Under the new legislation , a vote for local deputies will take place on December 7 , and a new `` people 's police force '' will be created in that area .

Also among the powers being granted are the right to use the Russian language rather than Ukrainian in all areas of public life , including public institutions , courts and education . Local authorities will take part in the appointment of prosecutors and judges , rather than the decision being solely in the hands of government in Kiev .

There are many Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine , which historically has had close ties to Russia .

U.S. envoy : Road map to democracy

Moscow has made clear that it is opposed to Ukraine 's pivot toward the West .

But Western leaders -- who accuse Moscow of sending troops and military equipment over the border into Ukraine to help the pro-Russia rebels -- have welcomed the move .

The U.S. ambassador to Ukraine , Geoffrey Pyatt , said via Twitter that the ratification of the Association Agreement would provide a road map `` for building a prosperous , European democracy , grounded in rule of law/anti-corruption . ''

The decision to delay implementation of the free trade part of the agreement for more than a year followed talks Friday between representatives of the EU , Ukraine and Russia , the Kremlin said .

The EU and United States have imposed economic sanctions against Russian interests over Moscow 's intervention in Ukraine .

Military exercises

Meanwhile , more than 1,000 European and American forces are engaged in training exercises this week in western Ukraine , far from the Russian border .

The speaker of Russia 's lower house of parliament , Sergey Naryshkin , opened a new autumn session Tuesday in which he warned that `` the updated version of the Cold War is becoming a reality nowadays . ''

He was critical of NATO , which has voiced its clear support for Ukraine , although the country is not a member of the defense bloc .

`` By supplying Kiev authorities with weapons , NATO countries would be meddling with Ukraine 's internal affairs and aiding in war crimes , '' he said .

Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said Tuesday the deployment of `` a full-scale , self-sufficient '' military force in Crimea was a priority in light of current events in Ukraine , state news agency Itar-Tass reported .

NATO issued a statement Tuesday condemning elections reportedly held in Crimea on Sunday .

`` We continue to condemn Russia 's illegal and illegitimate ` annexation ' of Crimea and its continued and deliberate destabilization of eastern Ukraine in violation of international law , '' NATO said .

`` We stand united in our support of Ukraine 's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders . ''
