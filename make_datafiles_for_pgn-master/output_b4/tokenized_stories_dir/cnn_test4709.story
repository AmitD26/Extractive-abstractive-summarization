-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With a climate that ranges from desert dry to tropical lush to freeze-your-North-Face-off in the Andes , Peru packs a ton of diversity between its sea level elevation Pacific beaches and the 22,204 foot top of its highest mountain , Nevado Huascaran .

There 's pisco . There 's ceviche . And , yes , there 's that famous trail .

Do n't worry , we 'll get to all of those . First some things you may not already know .

Peruvian food : From guinea pigs to pisco sours

1 . Lima is worth seeing

While most international travelers land in Peru 's current capital , many immediately continue on to the country 's former capital , Cuzco , in their rush to get to Machu Picchu .

That 's a mistake .

Lima is Peru 's largest city by far . It 's home to more than a quarter of Peru 's roughly 30 million people , has wonderful food , the beautiful Miraflores district -LRB- where you can drink while overlooking beaches lined with small rocks that form eye-catching patterns each time the tide rolls out -RRB- and excellent museums .

The Museo Larco and its Erotic Gallery is devoted to sculptures from more than a thousand years ago celebrating sexual congress in all of its least procreative forms . Reproductions of these works pop up all over Peru , notably in the form of a bottle of pisco shaped like a fellow in an extremely good mood .

2 . You 're gon na love the ceviche

Fresh , raw fish marinated in citrus juices and spiced with chili peppers and sometimes other tongue-tingling spices , ceviche is Peru 's most popular dish , a must-try for any visitor .

In Lima , internationally famed La Mar is a great place to try it , but ceviche is prepared differently throughout the country , from humble street stalls to elegant restaurants .

3 . There 's more to Peru than Incas

Most tourists come to Peru to see Machu Picchu or other Inca ruins , with maybe a few Catholic churches thrown in for balance . This makes it easy to conclude , `` There were the Incas , then the Spanish came , which brings us to where we are now . ''

In fact , the Inca were a bit like Mitt Romney 's Bain Capital : They had a knack for taking control of long-established things and making them their own . The Incan state did n't emerge until the 1200s . It became an empire in the 1400s , and its final sovereign emperor died in 1533 , officially ending the period of constructing the buildings and roads that lure visitors to this day .

That said , the Norte Chico people of Peru built a civilization 5,000 years ago and the centuries that followed saw the emergence of other significant cultures , such as the Paracas and the Moche .

Was the Incan era a highlight of Peruvian history ? Unquestionably .

But when Peruvian museums boast artifacts from before Christ , focusing exclusively on Atahualpa and his predecessors is akin to being so impressed by books that you conclude world history began with the Gutenberg press .

4 . Pisco rules

Peru 's beverage of choice is pisco , a brandy made from grapes . It 's also adored in Chile , inspiring an epic rivalry over which nation is its true birthplace .

Available in numerous brands at varying prices , pisco is usually consumed in cocktail form , meaning other ingredients largely hide its nuances , which can be a good thing for novices unaccustomed to pisco 's blowtorch nuances .

The most famous cocktail is the pisco sour , consisting of lime juice , simple syrup , egg white , ice and Angostura bitters . There are assorted variations , such as the coca sour for those who feel the pisco sour requires more bitterness .

If you 'd rather just have a beer , you 're in luck -- the local brews are good , with CusqueÃ ± a being a particularly refreshing option .

5 . Cash is king , ideally in small bills

Travelers in less trafficked areas of the world often find businesses that wo n't take MasterCard or Visa , much less American Express . Peru offers an extra twist : occasionally shops refuse these cards despite displaying signs advertising them .

In general , Peruvians like their soles -LRB- the currency is the nuevo sol -RRB- in small denominations : a fifty -LRB- roughly $ 20 -RRB- is OK , but denominations of twenty and under are better to ensure merchants can make change .

That noted , Peruvians tend to put great stock in U.S. dollars , so even if an establishment does n't take credit cards and you do n't see an ATM , you may still be able to buy dinner or souvenirs . Make sure your U.S. and other foreign currency is in pristine shape -- many merchants and hotels will reject torn or overly worn bills .

6 . Altitude adjustment amounts to common sense

Peru is a mountainous land , and you have to handle heights if you 're going to Cuzco , Machu Picchu and other landmarks of Incan culture .

How to prepare ? The easiest method is drink lots of water , get plenty of sleep and ease off the booze -- just imagine how your mother would like you to conduct your life at every elevation and you 'll be fine .

You can also consume stimulating coca leafs , whether in tea or by chewing them .

7 . The plumbing requires some TLC

Expect to see trashcans in bathrooms next to the toilet . While Peruvian plumbing handles your waste , it does n't do toilet paper , which must be put in the bin next to the bowl .

Some bathrooms have signs stating this rule , others assume you know : remember and spare yourself begging for a plunger in broken Spanish .

8 . The Inca Trail is genuinely difficult

Along the famed trail you 'll often be reminded of the Peruvian proverb : `` When the road is long , even slippers feel tight . ''

The Inca Trail largely consists of stone stairs -- often steep ones -- and those stone stairs were n't meant to be covered by mortals . The result is that the steps feel quite high for those who do n't answer to `` Kobe '' or `` LeBron . ''

If just reading this makes your knees swell , you may be in trouble .

In addition , while altitude sickness tends to be exaggerated , there 'll come a moment when you 're going up a hill and find that your lungs have betrayed you .

Throw in the chance of heavy rains -- test your `` waterproof '' gear pretrek to make sure it 's just that -- and the trail can feel less like vacation than boot camp .

9 . There are ways to ease your Inca pain

Depending on the company guiding you on the Trail , it 's possible to get porters to carry your tent , sleeping bag , food and ... well , they 'll essentially carry everything , including you , should your body completely fall to pieces .

Porters race ahead to the night 's camp and assemble everything before parties arrive , then cook and serve multiple-course meals , in certain cases on white linen table clothes . The result after a hard day 's walk is that you feel like you 've stepped out of `` Deliverance '' and into `` Howard 's End . '' Speaking of porters ...

10 . Porters are the toughest guys in the country

Whether you 're on your own or traveling like an English lord in the colonies , you 'll encounter porters on the Inca Trail . These men tend to be farmers or laborers looking to earn extra money .

They carry up to 20 kilograms -LRB- 44 pounds -RRB- of gear -- the weight limit is a recent development , they used to handle positively spine-shattering loads -- and they carry it fast . Some actually run along the trail , somehow avoiding shredded ankles as they navigate uneven , wet stones just to ensure all 's ready before the tourists stagger into camp .

If you feel like racing your fellow hikers , great . Do not test the porters : They 're pros , and you 're at best a promising amateur .
