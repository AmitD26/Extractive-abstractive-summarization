-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Give Miley Cyrus some credit : she 's ridden this ceaseless wave of publicity all the way to No. 1 .

Her latest album , `` Bangerz , '' is at the top of iTunes in 70 countries , and the expectation is that she 's going to arrive at the top of Billboard 's 200 album chart as well .

While her success could be brushed off with the industry motto `` all publicity is good publicity , '' those who 've closely watched the 20-year-old 's development say that 's not the whole story .

In CNN 's `` The Life of Miley Cyrus , '' which examines Cyrus ' music , message and personal journey , insiders who 've intimately come to know the singer/actress say that her transition from a childhood of ATVs and cheerleading to adult superstardom was no accident . Instead , Cyrus has executed her transformation with total control .

Shirley Halperin , music editor for The Hollywood Reporter , tells CNN she gives Cyrus `` a lot of credit for her own street smarts and her own understanding of what consumers want . ''

After all , Halperin says , `` there was a time when people thought Miley Cyrus would never be on Top 40 radio , because Disney was too squeaky clean . Well ... she 's certainly turned that around . ''

And how did she do that ? By systematically shedding her reputation as a tween celebrity . Cyrus herself has never been `` squeaky clean '' -- even before she turned 18 , her actual image was occasionally at odds with the image those parents paying for tickets to `` Hannah Montana '' concerts expected .

According to Josh Eells , the Rolling Stone writer who went skydiving and to a tattoo shop with Cyrus for Rolling Stone 's recent cover story , believes the beginning of this transition happened at 17 , when Cyrus was filming the comedy `` LOL '' in Detroit with Demi Moore .

`` She said that was the first time that she was really ... basically by herself . There were other -LRB- s -RRB- -- obviously the rest of the cast and crew was around -- but she was kind of living on her own , '' Eels said . `` She would go out to clubs , which she 'd never really done before . I think it was probably easier for her to be anonymous or kind of fly under the radar in Detroit a little bit . She said she learned a lot from -LRB- Moore -RRB- , and I think she got into hip-hop more up there . ''

While `` LOL '' failed to make a dent in Cyrus ' rep , a certain haircut that same year definitely did . In August 2012 , the singer made one of the biggest statements a young celebrity can make : she drastically changed her look with a super-short , platinum blonde haircut , a clear departure from anything she 'd done before .

According to Steven Peterman , an executive producer on Cyrus ' old show , `` Hannah Montana , '' that sort of risk-taking is nothing new .

`` The thing that makes you wonder , ` What 's she gon na do next , ? ' I 've been asking that about her since the day I met her , '' Peterman said .

When Cyrus was first auditioning for the part , `` she was the least likely person to get this job , '' Peterman continued . But with her combination of vocal talent and that unpredictability , she wound up winning the creative team over to her side .

`` There was something about her that was so alive and so fearless , and that 's what we all talked about in the room , '' Peterman said . `` That 's part of who she is . And it 's part of , as an artist , what she probably needs to be . It means that she 's going to , at times , make mistakes . But I think she 's strong enough to get through it all and come out the other side . ''

Of course , as Cyrus has peeled off the layers of adolescence -- along with several layers of her actual clothes -- many have `` tsked '' at her seemingly new image : There are the references to marijuana -LRB- super lemon haze is said to be her strain of choice -RRB- ; the sexually suggestive music videos ; the risquÃ © , semi-nude photos - not to mention her `` Wrecking Ball '' video - both courtesy of Terry Richardson .

And then there 's that tongue .

But , Eells suggests , `` the things that we see that seem crazy are very calculatedly crazy . Pharrell -LRB- Williams -RRB- phrased it in a very long text message that he wrote to her : ` You 're not a train wreck , you 're the train pulling everyone else along . ' -LRB- Cyrus -RRB- seems to be totally together and with it and knows exactly what 's going on . ''

Halperin agrees , noting that it is n't easy to simply wake up and decide to aim for the top of the hot singles chart .

`` That requires a great deal of planning to say , ` Here we are in 2007 , by 2010-2011 , we want to be on top 40 radio . It takes four years to develop an artist like that , '' she said . `` And that 's what we 've seen . We 've seen her development . And it 's not an accident ; it is very strategic . ''

In order to build any longevity , Halperin explains , `` we need to see her go through these musical phases and these stylistic changes , too . We can look back at any -LRB- act -RRB- -- Justin Timberlake or 'N Sync -- and laugh at what they wore , what they sang . But at the moment , it was perfect for what the audience was looking for . -LRB- Cyrus -RRB- knows what her audience wants .

Right now , Cyrus knows that her audience wants honesty -- sometimes of the naked variety . And with `` Hannah Montana '' getting farther in her rear view , frank vulnerability is what the pop star can offer .

With `` Bangerz '' and all the changes it has brought , Cyrus told CNN that she 's now `` able to be just more honest as an artist . And that 's really what my record is about . ''
