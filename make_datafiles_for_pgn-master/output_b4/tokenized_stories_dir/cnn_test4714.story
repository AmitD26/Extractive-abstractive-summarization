-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Before he died this year , a 14-year-old boy wanted to do something for his community .

That 's why Martin Romero asked the Make-A-Wish Foundation to donate his wish to improve the local baseball fields that were his second home .

Martin was diagnosed with stage IV brain cancer last fall , his parents told CNN affiliate KRQE .

Originally , he wanted to skydive for his wish .

`` Because of his tumor , they would n't allow that , '' mom Cindy Romero said . `` He would have had to get permission from his physicians . ''

When his condition worsened in January , Martin decided he wanted to upgrade the Albuquerque , New Mexico , fields where he had played baseball since he was 6 years old .

Make-A-Wish donated $ 2,000 for improvements at South Valley Little League Baseball Field .

Martin died in January , before he could see the renovated fields .

His father said the new asphalt between fields makes it easier for people using wheelchairs , walkers or strollers to watch the games up close and support their teams . A painting of the young man was also added at the park .

`` It 's a situation where you ca n't even walk up and not shed a tear , '' John Romero said . `` Just remembering him on the field . ''

This week , the Bernalilllo County Commission will consider renaming one of the fields after him . If the commission approves the naming , a county naming and memorial committee will make the final decision .
