Leshan Giant Buddha -LRB- Sichuan , China -RRB-

This 71-meter -LRB- 232 feet -RRB- stone statue was built during the Tang dynasty and can be found at the confluence of the Minjiang , Dadu and Qingyi rivers .

Construction of the Buddha , which forms part of a UNESCO-listed site , started in 713 AD , though it was n't finished until 803 .

A local Chinese monk called Haitong believed that the presence of a stone Buddha would calm the rivers it overlooked .

Funding ran out and Haitong killed himself in despair , but when a local governor decided to undertake completion of the project , Haitong 's wish came true -- though not quite in the way he intended .

During construction , so much rock was removed from the cliff face and deposited in the river below that the water became shallower and easier to navigate .
