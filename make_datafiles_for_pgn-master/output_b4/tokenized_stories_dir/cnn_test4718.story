-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The American held in North Korea , Matthew Miller , begins his six-year sentence of hard labor on Thursday .

A North Korean government official released a photo of Miller , taken on Wednesday . Dressed in a blue-gray prison garment with the number 107 and his head shaved , Miller is seen with his eyes downcast , staring away from the camera .

Details about where he 'll serve his sentence or what labor he will be required to do were not released .

Miller was convicted of committing `` acts hostile '' to North Korea and sentenced earlier this month . North Korea has accused him of ripping up his visa on arrival to the country so he could go to prison and expose human rights violations there , according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency .

KCNA described him as `` rudely behaved , '' saying he was sent to infiltrate prison as part of a United States campaign against North Korea .

`` He perpetrated the above-said acts in the hope of becoming a world famous guy and the second Snowden through intentional hooliganism , '' state media said .

Before being sent to prison , Miller asked his family for help in a phone call on Wednesday , according to a source .

He has also written a letter imploring U.S. officials for help . The letters have been sent to Miller 's family in which he addressed Speaker of the House John Boehner , Sen. Mitch McConnell , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , Sen. Barbara Boxer , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and first lady Michelle Obama .

Miller 's family lives in Bakersfield , California , and has not spoken to the press .

Miller told CNN 's Will Ripley in a brief interview earlier this month in Pyongyang that he `` prepared to violate the law of DPRK before coming here . And I deliberately committed my crime . '' But he did n't elaborate on what his `` crime '' was .

It 's unclear whether his statements were made freely or under coercion .

Miller is a 2008 graduate of Bakersfield High School , according to CNN affiliate KBAK .

Imprisoned American wanted to become ` second Snowden '

He traveled to North Korea this year after arranging a private tour through the U.S.-based company Uri Tours , which takes tourists into North Korea .

The U.S. State Department warns American citizens of arbitrary arrest and detention in North Korea .

Two other Americans , Kenneth Bae and Jeffrey Fowle remain detained in North Korea .
