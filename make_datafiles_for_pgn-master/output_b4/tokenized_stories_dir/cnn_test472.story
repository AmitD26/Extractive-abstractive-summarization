Arusha , Tanzania -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In most doctors ' waiting rooms , it 's the nurse who calls the mother and child for their vaccination . In Tanzania 's Arusha National Park , nurse Neema Baynet has to go out and find her patients .

With the Maasai tribes constantly on the move searching for water and fresh pasture for their cattle , Baynet can spend up to five days traveling 100 km searching the savannah for remote communities for whom her mobile immunization clinics are the only protection against deadly disease .

`` A week before we set off , we send out a message to the communities and ask them to spread the word that we are coming so we can vaccinate as many children as possible , '' says Baynet . `` Tell them the chanjos -LSB- vaccines -RSB- are coming . Bring your children ! ''

Despite the beauty of the backdrop of mountains , lakes and stunning savannah , Arusha 's geography poses severe logistical challenges that leave Maasai mothers waiting days rather than hours for the nurse -- not because of a backlog of patients but because the nurse struggles to reach them .

There are rivers to cross , rough tracks that turn into mud beds in the rainy season , impassable even for 4x4 vehicles , and sometimes no real track to follow . The terrain means health workers often sleep in their vehicle and are forced to complete their journey by foot -- in a region renowned for its dangerous wildlife .

`` We do not often see lions , '' says Baynet , `` but we can hear them at night and see their tracks by day . ''

In the soaring temperatures of Arusha 's equatorial climate , Baynet 's quest to find her patients is also a race against time : modern vaccines must be kept cool to preserve their powers of prevention , and a cold box packed with ice is Baynet 's very temporary defense .

Yet the children of the Maasai can not afford to miss out on the protective powers of vaccines .

`` When a child falls sick in such areas , the greatest problem is getting them medical help , '' says Osmand Swai , clinical officer at a health center in the Maasai village of Gelai Lumbwa . `` They have to be carried over vast distances to reach the nearest doctor . When they arrive , they are usually in a very bad condition . ''

Nasieku Engishon lives in the Maasai settlement of Engirirat , near Gelai Lumbwa . She almost lost her 10-month-old daughter to pneumonia and diarrhea . `` When a child becomes sick , we carry them to the health center , '' she says . `` Carrying a sick child , it can take four to six hours to get there . ''

As a tribe that was decimated by disease and famine in the 19th century , the Maasai themselves are keenly aware of the importance of vaccinating their children .

`` There was an outbreak of measles here last August and a lot of children became very sick , '' says Narangrang Laiseri , from Gelai Lumbwa . `` They took them to hospital , but five from this area died . I was lucky -- my son had been vaccinated against measles and he was one of the ones who got better quickly . ''

The need to get to hard-to-reach people like the Maasai and the rest of the estimated 8 % of Tanzania 's population that do not receive basic life-saving vaccines has taken on a new urgency with the country 's recent launch of a five-year development plan .

The government wants to shift the national economy up a gear in its drive to transform Tanzania into a middle-income country by 2025 , and it is now widely acknowledged that investing in children 's health through vaccination is critical to building solid economic foundations . Healthy children do better in school and have a better chance to reach their full economic potential .

Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikweke is hosting this week 's high-level gathering of over 650 immunization experts in the capital , Dar-es-Salaam . The GAVI Alliance Partners ' Forum -LRB- 5-7 December -RRB- will focus on how to achieve equity in children 's access to life-saving vaccines .

To mark the event , the health ministry will launch two new vaccines into the national immunization program -- pneumococcal and rotavirus -- tackling the primary causes of pneumonia and diarrhea -- two of the leading killers of under-fives in Tanzania .

Tanzania 's One Plan aims to ensure that these new vaccines reach all children , from the Maasai in the north to the islands of Zanzibar , where boats are used to deliver medicine to the more remote of the archipelago 's many islands .

`` We have a strategy to reach every child with vaccination and we engage communities in planning and implementing it , '' says Yussuf Makame , manager of Zanzibar 's Expanded Programme on Immunisation .

However , Maasai mothers remain fearful that the sheer geographical scale of Arusha means that for them the waiting game is destined to go on .

`` Of course we know how important it is to vaccinate our children , '' says Laiseri . `` Whenever we hear the vaccinators are coming , people bring their children . But sometimes they are so far away , they do not hear about the vaccination in time . ''
