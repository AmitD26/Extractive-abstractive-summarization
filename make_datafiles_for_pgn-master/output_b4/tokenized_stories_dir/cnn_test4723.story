Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A threatened Israeli attack on Iran 's nuclear program carries enormous risks for the Jewish state , including international isolation , retaliation at home and abroad , and steep economic costs .

And that 's if it works .

While Israel has the most advanced military in the Middle East -- including a suspected-but-undeclared nuclear arsenal of its own -- Israeli analysts say there 's no guarantee that a unilateral strike will roll back an Iranian program it sees as a threat to its survival .

Yet that 's the choice observers say the Jewish state may soon face , and some argue the benefits would outweigh the costs military action would incur .

A successful raid would set back Iran 's uranium enrichment effort by `` several years , '' said Ephraim Kam , the deputy director at the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies .

And in a recent op-ed in The New York Times , Amos Yadlin , Israel 's former head of military intelligence , argued that previous Israeli strikes against nuclear installations in Iraq and Syria successfully forced those countries to drop their nuclear programs .

`` This could be the outcome in Iran if military action is followed by tough sanctions , stricter international inspections and an embargo on the sale of nuclear components to Tehran , '' Yadlin wrote . `` Iran , like Iraq and Syria before it , will have to recognize that the precedent for military action has been set , and can be repeated . ''

Israeli authorities argue that if Iran develops nuclear weapons , it would trigger a Middle Eastern arms race among Iran 's rivals for regional influence .

`` Failure to prevent Iran from nearing the nuclear threshold will undoubtedly intensify the drive of other states in the region for nuclear weapons , '' said Shmuel Bar , director of studies at the Israeli Institute of Policy and Strategy . `` The initial countries , which will attempt to acquire a military nuclear capability , would include Saudi Arabia , Turkey , Egypt , Iraq , Libya and in its path , other North African countries . ''

A successful Israeli attack on Iran would eliminate the need for other countries in the region to develop such programs , proponents argue .

And a severe blow to Iran could also weaken its proxies along Israel 's borders , Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza . Both groups receive generous Iranian backing and have staged attacks against Israel and Israeli targets overseas .

Weakening Iran could free Israel to act more aggressively in combating those groups in the future , according to some Israeli analysts who fear the groups would become more brazen backed by a nuclear-armed Iran .

`` If the Iranian regime weakens as a result of a successful attack , this would undoubtedly have an impact on Hamas and Hezbollah , '' said Yossi Melman , an independent Israeli commentator on security and strategic affairs . He said Hezbollah `` is likely to suffer a heavy price if it chooses to join the battle and attack Israel , '' while by knocking out Iran 's nuclear fuel plants , `` Israel will show its determination of not allowing Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon in hope that it understands the message for the future . ''

But Iran has pledged a swift and powerful response to any attack , most likely through missile attacks on Israel .

`` This may come in the shape of a large number of rockets and missiles fired from Iran itself , possibly also by Hezbollah and Hamas , '' Kam said .

According to Israeli military estimates , there are tens of thousands of short-range rockets that could be fired from Hezbollah-controlled southern Lebanon and the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip , while a much smaller number of long-range missiles could be launched from Iran .

`` The whole of Israel is vulnerable , '' Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor warned recently . `` They are not just going to hit Israeli soldiers . The main aim is at civilian populations . ''

And Kam said Iran and its allies may respond indirectly as well , by carrying out attacks `` against Israeli and Jewish targets around the world . ''

In addition , it might try to disrupt the world energy markets and antagonize Persian Gulf Arab regimes by closing the Strait of Hormuz , the choke point for about 20 % of the global oil trade .

Iran says its production of enriched uranium is strictly to fuel civilian power plants and a medical research reactor . But the United States and Israel accuse it of working toward nuclear weaponry . The International Atomic Energy Agency , the U.N. nuclear watchdog , says it can no longer verify that the Iranian program is strictly peaceful .

Analysts CNN consulted say an Israeli attack may spur Tehran to pursue the bomb openly .

`` Even if a few nuclear plants are destroyed , it will take several years to rebuild them and give Iran legitimacy to say , ` We were attacked by a nuclear power , and now we must defend ourselves , ' '' Melman told CNN .

Meanwhile , Meir Javedanfar , an Iran expert at Israel 's Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya , warns that an attack could lead Iranians to rally around the flag , bolstering the hand of theocratic government and further setting back the Western hopes for regime change .

`` The regime is likely to use such opportunity to eradicate any form of opposition against it in the country , '' Javedanfar said .

And an unsuccessful attack could further tarnish the reputation of an Israeli military that came under severe criticism at home following its 2006 war with Hezbollah . Hezbollah claimed victory after that conflict and enjoyed a surge in regional popularity , while Israeli commanders came under fire for being inadequately prepared for the fight .

`` During the operation , one needs to take into account that it may fail , that targets will not be destroyed and that a large number of Israeli planes would be taken down , '' Kam said .

In addition , an Israeli attack conducted without prior notification to the United States could severely strain relations with Washington , its leading ally -- especially if American military or civilian sites in the region were targeted as part of an Iranian retaliation .

Israeli relations with Jordan and Egypt , the two Arab countries with which it maintains peace treaties , could be hurt . A sharp rise in energy prices as the result of a regional conflict would not do Israel any favors in the court of global opinion , possibly prompting boycott and sanctions campaigns .

Israeli airspace could be closed to commercial traffic , and the country 's lucrative tourism industry would be expected to grind to a halt . And a prolonged conflict could result in the closure or slowdown of a variety of industries and businesses costing the Israeli economy billions of dollars .

`` The economy could lose a year 's growth and even go into negative growth , many will lose their jobs and unemployment will rise , '' Adam Reuter , chairman of an Israeli investment house and the CEO of the Financial Immunities consulting firm , recently told Israeli news portal Ynet .

Couple those prospects with the high cost of rebuilding damaged civilian and military infrastructure , and the price tag of a unilateral strike quickly goes up .

`` The biggest disadvantage of all is war , '' Melman said . `` There is always an uncertainty . Once you start a war , you never know how it is going to finish . ''
