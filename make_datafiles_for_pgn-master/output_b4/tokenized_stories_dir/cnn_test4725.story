-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When this season 's World Cup alpine ski champions stepped up to the podium to receive their prizes , they were following in some famous footsteps .

The Dalai Lama , designer Karl Lagerfeld , Oprah Winfrey and boxing star Wladimir Klitschko have all been there .

No , not the FIS winners ' pantheon . Not yet at least -LRB- although Vanessa Mae 's appearance at February 's Sochi Winter Olympics should offer some encouragement to wannabe ski-celebs -RRB- .

Each has been the recipient of a piece of fine crystal designed and manufactured by JOSKA Kristall , a German glassblowing specialist .

The Bavaria-based company is renowned as the maker of awards presented to many a famous face -- also including Arnold Schwarzenegger , Mikhail Gorbachev and Claudia Schiffer -- but it is perhaps best known for the iconic FIS World Cup globes that are dished out to the kings and queens of the snow .

Some 64 World Cup trophies are awarded yearly to the discipline and overall winners at the various FIS ski , snowboard , Nordic , ski-jump and cross-country World Cup finals events .

Recipients in 2014 have included alpine skiers Anna Fenninger and Marcel Hirscher , who posed for the cameras with the freshest batch after picking up the overall titles for the ladies ' and men 's events respectively this month .

Yet behind these triumphant images of sporting glory lies a tale of intricate craftsmanship that is as painstaking in its quest for perfection as the preparations of any winter athlete .

A glass apart

Founded in 1960 , JOSKA began as a glass-cutting enterprise before later adding a blowing factory , specialist engraving facility and hand-painting operations .

It first manufactured the crystal sphere trophies in 1987 , with the first FIS globe handed over in 1989 . The process has since become part of winter sports tradition .

Where football has its 18 carat gold World Cup trophy and ice hockey the silver and nickel Stanley Cup , winter sports have the crystal globe .

`` Every season we have 33 of the small cups -LRB- for the winners of individual events -RRB- , 17 of the big cups -LRB- for the overall winners -RRB- , 17 for the nations cups and 177 medals of glass , '' JOSKA 's operations manager Alouis Adam told CNN 's Alpine Edge series .

`` I think of the last 25 years we have made over 2,000 different small and big cups . ''

Adam says the production of a World Cup trophy spans two days and a number of complex stages .

Each is primarily forged using a 1,200-degree Celsius mass of molten glass which is then painstakingly shaped by JOSKA 's glassblowers .

These skilled technicians inflate the hot glass to the required shape via a blowpipe , sweating profusely as they go . After a 24-hour cooling off period , the trophy is brought to a glasscutter who uses diamond disks to carve an intricate snow crystal design into the trophies .

The FIS logos , the relevant discipline and sponsor names are then engraved into the glass .

Once finished , the selected globes are packed up into specially designed shipping cases and transported from JOSKA headquarters to the relevant World Cup venue .

Of the hundreds of globes made each year , only the finest are used -- JOSKA selects the 33 best trophies out of a total of 60 smaller globes produced annually .

An emotional send-off

Having worked at the JOSKA for nigh on 42 years , Adam has seen hundreds of athletes pick up his company 's prized trophies .

He attended this month 's World Cup finals and was as effusive as ever on witnessing the world 's best skiers , snowboarders and cross-country athletes ' joy at receiving the fruits of his company 's labors .

`` That 's a beautiful feeling . I -LRB- have -RRB- watched all the World Cup finals the last 25 years and we are very proud when the winners have our product , '' he said .

`` This goes out around the world and we are very proud -- the winner looks at the trophy and says it 's a wonderful trophy . ''

JOSKA also manufactures trophies for cycling 's Tour de France as well as the German and Polish football federations .

But while fond of these items , Adam believes there is something unique about the World Cup globes .

'' -LRB- This is an -RRB- absolutely special design which displays a globe for the best in skiing , '' he said .

Those winter sportsmen and women fortunate enough to have their hands on the prized crystal will be sure to agree .
