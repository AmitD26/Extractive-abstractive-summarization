-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday issued a sharp warning to ISIS militants , saying after the United States is done grieving the death of two American journalists , their killers will have to answer for their actions .

`` They should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice , '' he forcefully told an audience at an event on the New Hampshire-Maine border . `` Because hell is where they will reside . Hell is where they will reside . ''

Biden opened his remarks in memory of Steven Sotloff , the journalist who was beheaded by ISIS militants Tuesday , two weeks after James Foley was executed in the same horrific manner on video . Foley was from New Hampshire , while Sotloff lived there for boarding school .

Describing the perpetrators as `` barbarians , '' Biden vowed that Americans would not be frightened or intimidated by the heinous acts .

`` We came back after 9/11 . We dusted ourselves off and we made sure that Osama bin Laden would never , ever again threaten the American people , '' Biden said . `` We came back Boston strong , blaming no one but resolve to be certain that this did n't happen again . ''

`` As a nation , we 're united , and when people harm Americans , we do n't retreat , '' he later said . `` We do n't forget . ''

ISIS executions heighten fears for Western hostages

The vice president , who 's mulling a 2016 presidential bid , made his remarks at the Portsmouth Naval Yard in a speech about the economy . He was accompanied on stage by U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , a New Hampshire Democrat who 's running for re-election this year .

Previewing Biden 's trip , the campaign for former Republican Sen. Scott Brown , who 's challenging Shaheen for her seat in this year 's midterms , released a Web video that shows footage of the vice president supporting President Barack Obama 's foreign policy , an agenda the Brown campaign labels a `` failure . ''

` Degrade and destroy '

After Sotloff 's killing , Obama faced a chorus of bipartisan calls from Congress to act more aggressively and come up with a concrete strategy to combat ISIS , beyond the already ongoing targeted air strikes .

Speaking Wednesday , Obama addressed his much criticized statement last week that he has no strategy on ISIS . He said he was referring to a military strategy in Syria that `` might '' require congressional approval .

`` Our objective is clear . That is to degrade and destroy -LRB- ISIS -RRB- so it 's no longer a threat , '' he said . `` We can accomplish that . It 's going to take some time , it 's going to take some effort . ''
