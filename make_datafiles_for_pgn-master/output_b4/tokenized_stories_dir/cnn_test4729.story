Detroit , Michigan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dave Bing was once the kind of guy who might sing a little Motown in the shower , or even club-hop with actual Motown artists .

What different times those were for the mayor of Detroit .

Bing was born and raised in Washington but long ago built a life in the city symbolic of the country 's rise and crash . He was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in 1966 and played with the team for nine seasons . After his basketball career ended , he returned to the city to launch an automotive supplier , Bing Group . He spent 29 years building the business , he said , and by 2008 he thought maybe it was time to retire .

Wrong .

Bing had once supported former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick , but not after Kilpatrick tumbled deep into scandal that led to his resignation and a jail sentence . A small group of friends convinced Bing to run , he said , and he won the chance to finish Kilpatrick 's term in 2009 . Later that year , he secured a full term .

Sports , Bing said , taught him how to work on a team , to understand skills and weaknesses . Business showed him how to find and grow talent , how to recognize his own skills and weaknesses . None of it could have prepared him to run Michigan 's largest city . Bing has n't announced yet whether he 'll run for re-election next year .

`` It was in much worse condition than I ever anticipated , '' Bing said of Detroit . `` We 're working through the process as I speak , but it 's probably the second most difficult job in this country behind the president . ''

Indeed , he 's facing the threat of bankruptcy , stalemates with city council and hard , sometimes raucous talks with Detroit residents and city workers . This summer hecklers riled about city pay cuts shouted him down during a community meeting .

One day later , Bing was calm , too busy to think long about chants and criticism . There 's no time for it , he said . No time anymore to sing , no time for late nights on the town . There 's hardly time to sleep , he said . But it does n't change his belief in the city that fills his memory and dominates his thoughts .

So , CNN asked Bing : In a city notorious for its troubles , what would you want visitors or residents to see ?

Here are some of his answers .

Detroit 's riverfront

`` We have something that 's distinct from almost any city in the country , '' Bing says , a view across a waterway and into another country .

`` It 's beautiful , '' he said .

Detroit 's riverfront draws together public space , art and events , especially along the River Walk . Within a few years , he expects there to be more attractions , commerce and living space along the water . It 's the Motor City , but the city needs to give more people more reasons to get out and walk , he said .

Detroit Institute of Arts

High on Bing 's list of must-sees for Detroit is a trip to the Detroit Institute of Arts , a 658,000-square-foot , 100-gallery museum founded in 1885 . Its collection features American , African-American , European , African , Asian , Native American , Oceanic , Islamic and ancient art , as well as collections of modern and graphic art .

`` I think the Detroit Institute of Arts is probably renowned worldwide , '' Bing said .

Earlier this year , metro Detroit voters went for a property tax increase that will supply the museum with an estimated $ 23 million annually for 10 years . The funding is expected to help stabilize the museum 's budget and dodge dramatic cuts to exhibitions , education and hours . The museum now offers free admission to residents of the three counties that approved the tax .

`` Huge investments had been made in a lot of our cultural institutions , '' Bing said . Even as other parts of the city struggled , `` I think that 's one thing we 've held on to . ''

Motown Museum

When Bing moved to Detroit in the 1960s , he came as a basketball player , a celebrity of sorts . He slipped right in to the nightlife of the time , and that meant Motown .

`` The athletes , we always thought we were entertainers , and the entertainers thought they were athletes , '' he said . `` We really got together quite often . ''

Smokey Robinson , the Temptations , the Four Tops , the Supremes -- he said he knew them all well .

`` You fell in love with them because they were true entertainers , '' he said .

He 's too busy now to sing , but anybody who comes to town should know that history , he said . Some of it is kept up at the Motown Museum , a music-studio-turned-museum known as Hitsville , U.S.A. , founded in 1985 .

`` People do n't realize how Motown got started , where it got started . I mean , it was a little house , '' Bing said . `` For all the success they had out of that one little place , people need to see that . ''

Detroit 's Tigers , Lions , Red Wings -- and Pistons ?

Bing is proud to call Detroit home to four professional sports teams -- the Tigers , Lions , Red Wings and Pistons . He loves the energy of a game , the pride teams bring to the city and the crowds in stadiums and restaurants .

But as an NBA Hall of Famer who came to Detroit for basketball , he 'd rather the Pistons move back to the city from their suburban home , the Palace of Auburn Hills .

He did n't lay out a plan for how to make it happen , but he said it 's a goal .

`` My whole career in basketball was downtown , and I think that 's where it belongs , and I 'll do everything I can to try to get it back downtown , '' he said .

The future

`` There are several very strong neighborhoods in our city , '' he said , the areas around Midtown and Detroit 's downtown , especially . But he 's optimistic about what comes next .

Here 's his prediction for what visitors and residents will see in a decade :

`` Instead of seeing the vast amount of empty land where there 's nobody there , I think we 've got to do some different things . Urban farming is something we 've been talking about for some time . We will probably see some of that .

`` We would see people living out in neighborhoods where there 's only one or two homes . We 're not going to see that . We 're going to try to convince those people to move so there 's density in all of our neighborhoods , so we can really look out for each other , we can help protect each other , we can bring people and families back together again like it used to be . Where we care for each other , where we support each other . That 's the kind of city I see . ''
