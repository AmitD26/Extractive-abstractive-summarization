-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The iPad from Apple is the latest member of a new , multi-use generation of technology . It 's a book , it 's e-mail , it 's your social network or your office , it 's your music and your photos plus the apps for all of that .

And the more ways we can use a device , the more we 'll want to take a look at how using it affects those around us .

In a nutshell , that 's how `` old '' etiquette is applied to new technology .

If you have an iPad , here are a few places you might find yourself :

First , be prepared for jealous looks , curious stares and questions from strangers . Do n't break it out in public unless you 're ready to play show and tell , and possibly share . `` Can I see it ? Can I touch it ? Can I try it ? '' Know your answer , because like a proud momma with a new infant , all the old ladies will want to hold your baby .

Have kids ? Set the rules for use first thing . Tell them it 's only for mommy 's or daddy 's work , or else be prepared to lose your latest spreadsheet when you walk in the door .

Back at the office , think about your work culture . Will the iPad be a handy tool , Mr. Early Adopter , or overkill ? Be explicit with colleagues about what you 're using it for , such as taking notes or checking a calendar , so they do n't think you 're playing online Scrabble during your morning meeting .

The reading feature is a huge component of iPad use , so feel free to pull it out during your morning commute . The upside : No more awkwardly folding your newspaper into a postage stamp . The downside ? People are bound to read over your shoulder ; until iPads are ubiquitous , curiosity will draw wandering eyes .

When you 're with your family , equate iPad reading to the same choices you make with your books and magazines . For example , if your family is watching `` So You Think You Can Dance '' but it is n't your thing , and you 'd be reading a magazine during the show regardless , fire up the iPad . Just consider dimming it if the room is dark .

But if the idea is to spend quality time interacting with your family , put it away . Even if you think you 're paying attention , you wo n't look like it -- and that 's all that 's going to matter to your spouse .

Without question , turn it off at the dinner table . Reading in bed is another time to think about dimming the iPad . Again , how will it affect others ? If their light is out , it 's time to dim .

What about reading in the car ? It 's sad to have to spell this out , but never use it if you 're the driver ! Causing an accident is the ultimate rudeness , to say the least .

You know what else is rude ? Getting carsick . No matter how excited you are to read the latest updates on Twitter , the laws of physics still apply . Have an iron stomach ? While catching up on `` CSI '' may be a good idea , using headphones might be a better one if you 'll spoil it for the driver who ca n't watch .

The internet abounds with free recipes , making the iPad handy in the kitchen . Greasy fingerprints on your new gadget are n't so nice , however . If you share your iPad with someone else , wipe it down after kitchen use .

As for the bathroom , this debate may continue to rage as it does now for magazines . But since the iPad 's resting place in your home is n't likely to be the back of the toilet , this is the one time treating it like a magazine is n't such a hot idea .

The iPhone has already created a debate with its access to answers anywhere , anytime . Need to know the capital of Bolivia to win an argument at the dinner table ? Pulling out your iPad may win you the debate , but trumping others this way may come off a bit know-it-all .

Then again , it could be a huge success . The point of etiquette ? Know your audience , and think before you trump .

Technology and etiquette have a fascinating intersection . Etiquette lets people know how to act in common -- and sometimes uncommon -- situations , and how to expect others to react .

But the pace of technology is blazingly fast and creates new situations daily . So we have to apply a basic tenet of etiquette -- be considerate of those around us -- to constantly adapt to how we , as a society , want to use technology .
