-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At long last , Maria Toorpakai Wazir can indulge her life 's greatest love without fear of persecution .

Hounded out of the notoriously dangerous tribal region that borders Pakistan and Afghanistan -- once referred to as `` Hell 's door knocker '' -- salvation has been found thousands of miles away on a different continent .

She survived death threats , spent countless hours alone in her room and masqueraded as a boy for years .

And all for her love of squash .

Now Pakistan 's number one female player , who is ranked 53rd in the world , is homing in on her quest to become the best female player in the world , under the tutelage of Jonathon Power , the Canadian star whose name was inscribed on the first racket she ever owned .

It is a fairytale story that has taken the 22-year-old a world away from a treacherous existence in the mountains of Pakistan , to Power 's academy in Toronto , and morphed her into an agent for social change in her native country .

`` I think positive and I do positive so I think people in Pakistan need to be educated , need to take part in sports and skills so they have high integrity , high self-esteem and so they use energy in a positive way , '' she told CNN 's Human to Hero series .

`` They will start holding rackets and bats rather than holding guns and grenades . I do n't want militancy or Talibanisation -- I just want a brighter future for all the kids . I do n't want them to end up as suicide bombers . ''

Growing up in South Waziristan provided Wazir with a crash course in conservatism , a prevalent theme in a territory with a reputation for fierce tribalism .

`` It was an area in between mountains and mud houses and as it was 100 or 200 years ago , '' she explained . `` The girls are deprived of all those basic rights . They stay inside the home and get married off at a young age .

`` My whole family was different to the rest of the people in the area -- you could see the progress , the different mindset -- but they were still living in the Stone Age .

`` They had no awareness about education or any health or exercise , or women 's rights or child 's rights . They did n't know how any education can be important for one person as a human . ''

Exasperated at the barriers placed in front of her , Wazir took drastic action aged just four , burning all her dresses , putting on her brother 's clothes and shearing off her long , dark hair .

`` My dad believes that it is your choice and your right to live the way you want , '' she said . `` He laughed and he gave me a boyish name Genghis Khan , the greatest warrior in the history of the world . He said ` So , we have a fifth son , and his name is Genghis Khan . ' ''

However for Wazir and her family , domestic tolerance came at a price .

In a society cloaked by repression and inequality , even being seen unaccompanied in public could be perceived as a betrayal of her culture and Muslim religion .

And the liberal attitude of her father , Shamsul Qayyum Wazir , who encouraged his wife to continue her education and allowed their daughter to play outside with her brothers , was contradictory to the prevailing attitude of ultra-conservatism .

So much so that he family decided they 'd had enough after a campaign of intimidation that included the stoning of the family house , attempts on their lives and an imposed spell in an asylum for the father .

The family moved to the city of Peshawar -- another Taliban stronghold -- where Wazir 's scrapes intensified , with one scuffle leading to a head injury that required 12 stitches .

Realizing she needed to channel this aggression , her father enrolled her in weightlifting classes at a local sports club , keeping up the pretense she was a boy .

Wazir went on to win a junior weightlifting championship , but she also grew fixated on squash , having seen it played on her breaks from training .

She earned a place at a squash academy run by the Pakistan Air Force , though she had to reveal her true identity to the director .

Such was his delight at seeing a girl enraptured by squash he donated a racket to Maria bearing the name of Jonathon Power -- who won 36 top level events during his 15-year career at the top of the sport .

But as word spread of her emerging talent , the anonymity Wazir had reveled in for so long evaporated .

`` Attitudes changed , they started bullying but I used to find a way , '' she explained . `` I used to go early in the morning when there was no-one in my way .

`` I used to repair those balls that were bad and torn in the squash court that guys used to throw away with tape and glue . ''

Taliban 's unwanted attention

A steady improvement in her game led to appearances in high profile tournaments and prominence in the Pakistani media .

Awards from then president Pervez Musharraf and prime minister Shaukat Aziz were a mark of her pioneering spirit , but they also attracted the Taliban 's unwanted attention .

`` It was exhausting at every step , '' she said . `` It was hard to let people know all I want is to play squash . That 's how I can live happy but I had to change my life with time .

`` For the last eight years I 've been trying hard to come through to the common people and today I 'm getting threats from Taliban . I was totally exhausted . I did n't know what to do .

`` I stopped going to the academy because it 's the biggest dishonor if a daughter is kidnapped . That 's -LRB- why -RRB- I locked myself in my room and started hitting from evening to morning . ''

Her absence was noted and when she relayed the threats she 'd received the issue was debated in parliament , who reacted by beefing up security around her .

`` They put so many attack posts on the way to the squash court and around the squash court too , '' she said . `` Above the squash court they put snipers .

`` I was going once a week or twice a month but at that time I completely stopped because if a bomb happened -- there is so much glass in the squash court itself -- it would kill the innocent kids .

`` I did n't want it to be the reason so I stopped going and started playing in my room for three-and-a-half years . ''

It was during this time Wazir says she knew she had to leave Pakistan to follow her dream .

`` My dad said ` If a baby bird wants to learn flying , he has to leave the nest ' and at that time I realized I can not learn flying while am here .

`` For three-and-a-half years I did n't get any email from anyone and one day I got an email back from Jonathan Power saying that he 's going to help me , support me , teach me how to play squash so I can play at tournaments and become a world champion for Pakistan . ''

Power himself was sent to London as a 12-year-old to train with former Pakistani world champion and all-time squash great Jahangir Khan , and was immersed in the culture of Khan 's country , traveling to play there on many occasions during his career .

Wazir 's plea struck a chord with Power , who flew her to Toronto and has since been working on building her strength and stamina , and molding the rawness of her technique into a formidable weapon .

`` I recognized right away this girl is special , she 's very courageous girl and I wanted to help , '' said Power .

`` She 'll run through that wall 10 times until she finally breaks it . She thinks working hard just means killing your body and you 'll get better , but sometimes you have to work smart .

`` It 's so rare to find somebody who has so much drive and so much passion , who is just dying to absorb knowledge . I think she 's going to make it to number one in the world .

`` She knows it 's going to take a lot and she 's prepared to sacrifice whatever it takes . I think she has the skills and the mental ability to make it all the way . ''

Building bridges

As for Wazir , her ambition to be the finest player on the world is now allied to a desire to campaign for other young girls in Pakistan to have the freedom to explore sport .

`` I feel the luckiest person and I think whether my hard work turned me into being lucky or if I am the chosen one to bring change to the world , '' she said .

`` I learned it 's more about humanity . It 's not about religion , it 's not about culture or caste or tribe or where you 're from or the value of the background of the person .

`` It 's all about being a human . I learned a lot and squash taught me . Through squash I made it and learned otherwise I 'd be stuck in those tribal regions .

`` I want to create bridges between east and west , friendship between country and country , family to family and people to people . It 's all about brotherhood -- sharing knowledge , skills , helping each other and sharing love and care for each other . ''
