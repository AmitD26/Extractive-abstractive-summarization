-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Redemption is not easy to attain .

Four years on and the scars still remain .

When France 's footballers left for Brazil , they were under no illusions -- it can not happen again .

At South Africa 2010 , `` Les Bleus '' became a laughing stock as players and coaches clashed , strikes were threatened and results embarrassed a nation .

Players were suspended , the entire country waged war on a group which had imploded and exited at the group stage after failing to win a single game .

Four years ago the picture was grim .

Fast-forward to the present and perhaps , just perhaps , France may get the opportunity to shock the world for all the right reasons .

A 2-0 victory over Nigeria in Brasilia on Monday ensured its progress to the quarterfinals and a meeting with Germany , which beat Algeria 2-1 after extra time .

It is a far cry for the disillusionment and disappointment which cast a shadow of French football during its last foray into the World Cup .

`` What happened , happened , '' coach Didier Deschamps said when he announced his 2014 World Cup roster on national television .

`` That wo n't go away . It put a stamp on our history . But we do n't need to discuss it again . ''

Deschamps and his players have spoken at length of moving on from the embarrassment of four years ago -- but few expected them to achieve much in Brazil .

After all , this is a France side which only just scraped into the tournament courtesy of a 3-0 playoff victory over Ukraine in Paris after suffering a 2-0 victory in the first leg .

But Deschamps , a World Cup hero on home soil in 1998 , has brought about a unity in the squad which has not been seen for many a year .

His decision to leave out Manchester City 's Samir Nasri caused controversy outside of the squad -- but it did not surprise those who know Deschamps as the single-minded man that he is .

He commands respect -- it helps if you 've won the World Cup and European Championships as well as a host of titles at club level .

And his players are responding -- even when not at their best as they were during the first half against Nigeria .

But such is the quality at his disposal , Deschamps never panicked , even when Nigeria appeared to take the game to his side in the opening 45 minutes .

Paul Pogba 's 79th minute header and an own-goal from Joseph Yobo smoothed France 's passage into the next round following a difficult afternoon .

`` I am very proud of everything we did from the start , '' Deschamps told French television after the game .

`` There was tension out there . They are a very strong side and there were a lot of duels .

`` But we 're through . We 're in the quarter finals and we 'll do everything we can to go a stage further . ''

Only three African teams have ever reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup -- Ghana the last to do so four years ago .

But Nigeria 's campaign has been blighted by inconsistency and rows over appearance fees -- a matter so serious that the country 's president , Goodluck Jonathan , was forced to intervene and assure players they would be paid .

Form has also been a problem -- a drab goalless draw against Iran in its opening game of the tournament was followed by a narrow victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina .

A 3-2 defeat by Argentina , in which Lionel Messi scored twice , ensured Nigeria qualified in second place despite having only managed a solitary win .

But France , a side which won its group with a style and swagger which was so sorely lacking four years ago , hinted at a far more difficult challenge .

After all , Nigeria had managed just one victory in its previous 11 World Cup matches and suffered defeat on both occasions it had reached the second round in 1994 and 1998 .

But if anyone had expected France to simply brush Nigeria aside , they were sorely mistaken .

The Super Eagles , who won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 , arrived in Brasilia as underdogs , not that you would have known it during the early stages of the contest .

While France appeared slow and sluggish , those in green began in sprightly fashion and thought they had taken the lead after 19 minutes .

Ahmed Musa , the man who terrorized Argentina with two fine goals , picked out Emmanuel Emenike inside the penalty area and the striker turned the ball home .

Unfortunately for Nigeria , Emenike had strayed just offside -- not by much , but enough for the flag of the assistant referee to be held high and bring a curtailment to the celebrations .

Perhaps that piece of luck awoke France from its slumber as just moments later a fine move almost broke the deadlock .

Paul Pogba , one of the most exciting young midfielders in the game , burst into space before feeding Mathieu Valbuena .

Valbuena , free of any Nigeria pressure , then produced an inch-perfect cross that Pogba met with a rasping volley which Vincent Enyeama saved in spectacular fashion .

Enyeama , who plays his club football in France with Lille , kept more clean sheets than any other in Ligue 1 last season .

But that save apart , he was a mere spectator in the first half with France failing to register another shot on target .

France , which had lost two of its previous three World Cup games against African opposition , might have been expected to emerge a different side after the interval .

But that fluidity so evident in group-stage victories over Honduras and Switzerland still proved elusive .

Instead , Nigeria continued to look the more threatening of the two sides -- Peter Odemwingie 's fierce effort bringing a sharp save out of Hugo Lloris in the French goal .

By that time , France could have and possibly should have been reduced to 10 men following a horrific tackle by Blaise Matuidi on Ogneyi Onazi .

U.S. referee Mark Geiger showed a yellow card -- much to the consternation of the Nigerians , who believed the challenge warranted more than just a caution .

It was only with the introduction of Antoine Griezmann in place of the disappointing Olivier Giroud up front that France began to look dangerous .

It was Griezmann who helped create the chance of the game with 20 minutes remaining .

The Real Sociedad forward played a one-two with Karim Benzema , sending the Real Madrid striker in on goal -- but his effort was partially saved by Enyeama and hacked off the goal-line by Victor Moses .

Suddenly , it was France which began to take control , with its passing game finally causing Nigeria problems .

First , Benzema crashed an effort across goal which had those in green shirts panicking , while Yohan Cabaye 's spectacular 20-yard effort smashed across the crossbar with Enyeama beaten .

But , with 11 minutes to go , France finally got the breakthrough it had threatened .

Enyeama came to deal with a corner and when he could only flap at the ball , Pogba nodded home from close range .

`` There are no words to describe this , '' said Pogba after helping his side past Nigeria .

`` I know there is a whole country behind us . Scoring that goal really liberated us . I am so happy for the team and all France . I 'm speechless .

`` To score a goal for your country , especially in an important match like this to get into the World Cup quarter finals , it 's one of the best moments of my life . ''

Pogba 's goal -- the 146th of the tournament , one more than was managed at the entire 2010 World Cup -- set up a frantic finale as Nigeria pushed forward in search of an equalizer .

But every time those in green swarmed forward , France moved to exploit the space and only a wonderful save by Enyeama stopped Griezmann from doubling his side 's advantage .

The second goal appeared inevitable and it duly arrived during stoppage time when Joseph Yobo , making his 100th international appearance , deflected Mathieu Valbuena 's cross into his own net .

It was a sad end to an afternoon which had begun with such promise for Nigeria -- but for France , the chance for redemption remains .
