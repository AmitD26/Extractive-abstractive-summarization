-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When the Winter Olympics roll around , Canadians pretty much always expect the national hockey team to win gold .

Sure enough the squad ultimately did n't disappoint in Sochi , claiming the finale 3-0 against Sweden on the final day of the Games .

It was Canada 's second straight men 's gold at the Olympics and third in the past four . And coupled with the women coming out on top in the women 's competition , it gave Canada a much coveted hockey double .

Russia crumbled amid heavy expectations in the men 's hockey but the host nation , helped by a sweep in cross country skiing 's 50-kilometer mass start Sunday , led the way in both medals won with 33 and gold medals tallied with 13 .

Canada finished third in golds and fourth overall after it blanked Sweden at the Bolshoy Ice Dome .

With Canada hockey mad , questions were asked about the roster prior to the Olympics and eyebrows raised following unconvincing victories over Norway and Latvia in Sochi .

But Canada picked it up when it mattered , overcoming the U.S. in the semifinals and also blanking the Swedes .

`` I think anyone knows the talent and ability this team has , '' centerman Jonathan Toews told Canada 's CBC . `` A huge credit goes to our commitment to playing a team game and will to win .

`` People were doubting whether we can score goals in this tournament . It 's easy for a group like that to go press and try and create offense and get away from our game plan but we stuck with it every single night . Here we all are on top of the podium so it feels really good . ''

Carey Price -- who plays for the Montreal Canadiens , perhaps the most storied hockey franchise around -- made 24 saves Sunday after keeping out 31 shots in the semis .

Pittsburgh Penguins superstar Sidney Crosby , Toews and Chris Kunitz scored for Canada and it was more than enough given Price 's stellar performance .

`` Playing behind that group of guys was a lot of fun , '' Price told the CBC . `` That work ethic that those guys brought to the ice every day made my job easier . ''

As he did following the semifinals , Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper took to Twitter to congratulate the team .

Sweden entered the clash short-handed , with key centerman Nicklas Backstrom of the Washington Capitals testing positive for a banned stimulant .

`` I 've got absolutely nothing to hide , '' Backstrom told reporters . `` It was shocking to me and at the same time I 'm here right now and I have to deal it .

`` I have n't done anything differently in the past seven years and I 've been playing internationally all that time . ''

The NHL issued a statement and said it would n't take any action against Backstrom .

`` We understand that Nicklas Backstrom tested positive for a substance banned ` in competition ' by the International Olympic Committee , '' said NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly .

`` It is our further understanding that the positive test was the result of a common allergy medication taken by the player knowingly , with the approval of the team doctor and without the intention of gaining an illegal or improper performance-enhancing benefit .

`` In addition , the specific substance that resulted in the positive test is not currently on the League 's Prohibited Substances List .

`` Subject to confirmation of the facts as we understand them , and given the fact that the substance is neither prohibited in the NHL nor was used in an improper manner here , we do not anticipate there being any consequences relative to Nicklas ' eligibility to participate in games for the Washington Capitals . ''

Russian 1-2-3

Russia was tied with Norway for gold medals won prior to Sunday and led the U.S. by two overall . The 1-2-3 finish in the cross country ensured glory in both categories .

Alexander Legkov edged Maxim Vylegzhanin by 0.7 seconds , with Ilia Chernousov capturing the bronze in a photo finish . Legkov 's time was a shade past one hour , 46 minutes .

`` This is priceless , '' Legkov told reporters . `` It 's more valuable than my life . I ca n't express how I feel . For 15 years I 've been trying for this result . ''

Alexander Zubkov added to Russia 's tally of golds in the four-man bobsleigh , his quartet squeaking past Oskars Melb√Ñ
