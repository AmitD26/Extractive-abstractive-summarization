-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In footballing terms , Landon Donovan is n't a marquee name in Europe . He endured a miserable stint at behemoth Bayern Munich and only when he played in a less pressurized environment on another loan deal -- for Everton in the English Premier League -- did he excel .

On the domestic front , it 's an entirely different matter . Donovan can rightly claim to being the talisman for the national team for the past decade or so , featuring in three World Cups and holding the distinction of scoring more goals than anyone else for the U.S. .

He was , unquestionably , the leading figure as the U.S. transitioned from football minnow to respected outfit .

If his omission from the World Cup squad by manager Jurgen Klinsmann could n't be compared to , let 's say , a Lionel Messi being snubbed by Argentina or a Cristiano Ronaldo being dropped by Portugal , it 's not far off .

`` It is a very tight race for those spots , '' Klinsmann , hired in 2011 and last year given an extension until 2018 , told reporters in May . `` We feel like the other players , without naming any of those guys , are a tiny bit ahead of him .

`` That 's why we made that decision , which is obviously and understandably the biggest topic out there . ''

Most in the U.S. 's growing footballing community have disagreed with the man who `` shockingly '' left out Donovan -- that was the word used by the 32-year-old 's MLS team , the L.A. Galaxy -- but Germany 's Klinsmann tends to court controversy , or at least divide opinion .

Here 's someone who , for all his scoring prowess during his playing days , will be forever linked with diving .

Pedro Monzon 's challenge on ` Klinsy ' in the 1990 World Cup final was reckless but the latter 's exaggerated air time could be compared to a high-jumper performing a forward roll .

For good measure , when he hit the ground , Klinsmann resembled a fish when first out of the water -- flopping from the shock . Monzon became the first player sent off in a World Cup final and Argentina 's fate was sealed .

Fast forward to his time as Germany manager .

There can be few more uplifting scenarios than an adored former player guiding a national team to World Cup glory on home soil -- Klinsmann made 80 international appearances , netting 38 times -- and the Germans indeed almost prevailed in 2006 , falling to bogey side and eventual champion Italy in the semifinals .

But current Germany captain Philipp Lahm all but wrote in his autobiography that Klinsmann did n't play much of a role , saying he was tactically deficient . Instead he praised then assistant Joachim Low -LRB- who just happens to be Lahm 's current boss with Germany -RRB- .

Lahm lined up , too , under Klinsmann at Bayern Munich in 2008/2009 , when Klinsmann did n't last the season .

Klinsmann and Lahm will meet again , since Germany -- as well as Portugal and Ghana -- landed in the U.S. 's group .

`` There was very little technical instruction and the players had to get together independently before the game to discuss how we wanted to play , '' Lahm wrote .

Klinsmann 's deep focus on fitness and nutrition , and fondness for yoga , is well known . Players have even been given aptitude tests , not their usual fare .

`` I do n't know if I 'd like his rules , '' U.S. international keeper Marcus Hahnemann , not making the trip to Brazil , told CNN . `` I 'm way more laid back than most are .

`` I would maybe struggle but that 's the way he wants to run it . ''

Judging by a story in the Sporting News last year , Hahnemann has company in not being entirely convinced by Klinsmann 's methods .

Speaking anonymously , people linked with the U.S. team opened up about Klinsmann 's apparent tactical naivety , and the author stated there was `` building resentment over the perceived importance and attitude of the German-born players . ''

Although it 's not strange for players born in one country to represent another -- in-demand striker Diego Costa picked Spain over Brazil for the World Cup -- Klinsmann selected more than merely one : Jermaine Jones , John Brooks , Timothy Chandler and Fabian Johnson were all born in Germany .

Bayern Munich 's Julian Green , meanwhile , mostly represented Germany under the senior level .

`` Jurgen has made it clear that looking at all possible options for discovering players will be exhausted , '' Tony Meola , who earned a century of caps for the U.S. , told CNN . `` My biggest concern is always , ` Are you playing for the love of the jersey and what it represents ? '

`` If the answer is an emphatic , ` Yes , ' I have no problem with it but anything less , I would be concerned .

`` We are in a different era and one that is changing the face of the game . ''

Klinsmann 's brutal assessment of his charges ' chances at the World Cup -- `` I think for us now , talking about winning a World is just not realistic '' -- also did n't go down well in the court of American public opinion .

With all the second guessing , you might be hard pressed to believe that the U.S. has made inroads under Klinsmann , who has lived in California for more than 15 years and is married to an American .

But how else to describe the U.S. beating powerhouse Italy for the first time -- in Italy -- and overcoming arch-rival Mexico in Mexico , also a first ? Note that Donovan played a combined 45 minutes in those landmark successes .

Klinsmann has n't shied away from pushing for friendlies against top sides and has attempted to make the U.S. play a more proactive brand of football , rather than defend and counter .

Klinsmann has n't been the lone manager targeted by the outspoken Lahm -- he came down harshly on the new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal -- and Hahnemann admits the U.S. has `` definitely made progress . ''

`` In terms of the tactics , he has certainly tried to change the way we play , '' added defender Jonathan Spector , who featured against the Italians . `` We have the players for it , and I think it 's just going to take some time to adjust to that .

`` You ca n't argue with the results we 've had . He 's been very successful as a national team coach , both with Germany and with the US .

`` In terms of sports science and that , I think there 's a place for that in football and he 's a very personable man . He 's easy to talk to . ''

So , Klinsmann has his supporters and detractors . Results in Brazil are sure to sway opinion further .
