-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The White House has announced that on Wednesday , at the invitation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel , President Obama will speak in Berlin at the city 's landmark Brandenburg Gate . The president 's subject will be the transatlantic alliance and the enduring bonds between the United States and Germany .

Berlin comes as a welcome relief for Obama . It gives him a chance to put aside for the moment the difficulties he is having in the Middle East and with the National Security Agency spying scandal . The president 's Berlin appearance also reminds us that he is following in historic footsteps .

June 26 marks the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy 's famous `` Ich bin ein Berliner '' speech , praising the citizens of West Berlin for their refusal to be intimidated by the massive East German-built wall that since 1961 had divided their city .

The reaction of the crowd listening to Kennedy address them in front of West Berlin 's City Hall was so overwhelming that , on the plane leaving Germany , he remarked to his aide , Ted Sorensen , who had written most of his speech , `` We 'll never have another day like this one as long as we live . ''

Kennedy is always given style points for his Berlin speech because of its easy-to-remember rhetoric . But the speech is worth recalling today because it amounted to such a profound pivot away from the prevailing nuclear logic of the Cold War . In Berlin , Kennedy recast how he believed the Cold War should be waged in the future in a way that made his thinking clear to the European and American public .

For Kennedy , the chance to speak near the Berlin Wall two years after it was built was a major opportunity to redefine his foreign policy leadership .

In his 1961 Vienna summit meeting with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev , Kennedy had gotten off to a rocky start . In 1962 , during the Cuban missile crisis , he had regained his footing . He had resisted calls by some of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a massive airstrike against Cuba and made sure he and the Soviets avoided backing each other into a nuclear exchange .

In Berlin , Kennedy showed that he had learned from both confrontations . Instead of treating the Cold War as simply a battle over which side had the most military power and the will to use it , he framed it as a battle that also included the fate of captive peoples and their right to self-determination .

It was an emphasis that would bear fruit in the Prague spring of 1968 , in Poland 's Solidarity movement and finally in Ronald Reagan 's 1987 Brandenburg Gate speech with its memorable line , `` Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall ! ''

Kennedy 's rhetoric in Berlin was equal to his good intentions . `` Two thousand years ago , the proudest boast was ` civis Romanus sum ' -LRB- `` I am a Roman citizen '' -RRB- . Today , in the world of freedom the proudest boast is ` Ich bin ein Berliner , ' '' Kennedy declared . His words paid tribute to those Germans trapped in a divided Berlin , but his overriding point was , `` Freedom is indivisible , and when one man is enslaved , all are not free . ''

Kennedy was doing the opposite of saber-rattling . He was updating the ideas behind the Declaration of Independence so they spoke directly to contemporary Europe . When his audience heard Kennedy 's words , they were reminded of the Berlin Airlift of 1948 , in which America responded to the Soviet ground blockade of West Berlin with an airlift that brought West Berliners the food and supplies they needed without U.S. troops firing a shot .

Earlier in June 1963 , Kennedy had established the groundwork for his Berlin speech with an address he gave at American University in Washington . There , he spoke about establishing the conditions for an `` attainable peace '' that was neither a Pax Americana nor a peace of the grave .

The Soviet Union , Kennedy cautioned , needed to abandon its distorted view of an America ready to unleash a preventative nuclear war , but at the same time America needed to make sure that it did not fall into the same trap as the Soviets by seeing Russia through a distorted ideological lens .

Ever the practical politician , Kennedy conceded that he had no `` magic formula '' for bringing about such a change in the world 's two superpowers , but it was possible , he concluded , to debate the Cold War without each side making new threats . `` We can seek a relaxation of tensions without relaxing our guard , '' he insisted .

Today , the American University speech is widely praised , but at the time , the speech was seen primarily as a policy statement . The public reaction to the speech was minimal . One day later , the American University proposals were replaced as a front-page story by the highly charged racial confrontation between the Kennedy administration and Alabama Gov. George Wallace over the admission of two African-American students to the formerly all-white University of Alabama .

Berlin was a different story in terms of its popular impact and a sign that Kennedy was becoming increasingly sophisticated in using his personal popularity to promote policy change .

In Berlin , the still-young president took advantage of being on the global stage to make it easier for friend and foe alike to see him as a leader eager to steer America and the world away from nuclear confrontation .

His efforts were not wasted . Two months after his Berlin speech , the United States , Great Britain and the Soviet Union signed the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty , the first such agreement since atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
