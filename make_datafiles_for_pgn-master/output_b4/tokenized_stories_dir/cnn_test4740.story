Theater . Art . Fashion . Shopping . Nightlife . Meals you 'll never forget -LRB- and that can be meant , now , in a good way . -RRB-

Is there anything she does n't do superlatively ?

Like every glittering metropolis , however , it can be easy to miss the highlights amid all the noise and haste .

This mini-guide is filled with the information you need to get in and out of London while impressing the clients and co-workers and still having time to eat royally , take jealousy-inducing pictures and pick up the kinds of souvenirs the folks back home will actually keep .

Fastest airport transport

London has several international airports and all are serviced by public transportation into central London in around an hour and a half .

But why struggle on and off trains with luggage if you do n't have to ?

By far the most comfortable way to get from the airport into the city is by using a car service .

One of the most reliable local services is Addison Lee . The company says it can get you into central London from Heathrow in 45 minutes -LRB- $ 72 -RRB- and from Gatwick in an hour and 20 minutes -LRB- $ 111 -RRB- .

Good news if you use ride-share service Uber . It works in London .

Great rooms , great views

London has plenty of high-end accommodations , from heritage hotels to glossy futuristic skyscrapers .

For Old World style , Claridge 's is a top choice .

Its opulent art deco interiors have played host to stars like Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant .

Some Deluxe King rooms have views of Brook Street , a Mayfair parade lined with fine restaurants and lavish boutiques .

For quirky design and English eccentric styling , the Ham Yard Hotel in vibrant Soho is a good bet .

Each room is individually designed with bold patterns and luxurious fabrics .

Room 302 offers views over the bohemian party district .

If the diversions of Soho are n't enough , the hotel has its own movie theater and bowling alley .

For London 's most breathtaking views , you ca n't go wrong with the new Shangri-La at The Shard , in London 's tallest building .

It 's located in the London Bridge area , which gives easy access to The City and is a few steps away from Borough Market , the city 's finest open-air food market .

Best meals

London is teeming with competitive foodies and the best restaurants are often filled weeks in advance -- it 's wise to book ahead .

Michelin-starred Gymkhana is an elegant `` Raj-era India '' place to sample high-end Anglo-Indian -- a kind of adopted national cuisine in the UK .

For the perfect experience , chef-owner Karam Sethi recommends Muntjac biryani , which combines Indian spices with the best British game produce .

He also suggests kid goat keema -- and opt to add `` bheja , '' brains , for extra richness .

Another London institution that gives international flavors the modern British treatment is Ottolenghi , owned by Jerusalemite chef Yotam Ottolenghi , who 's known for his bestselling cookbooks .

The menu changes regularly but Ottolenghi says roasted aubergine is a must -- it 's always on the menu and currently with nutty almond yoghurt , pickled chili and paprika toasted almonds .

Night owls who like views as fancy as the food should try Duck and Waffle , on the 40th floor of a skyscraper near London 's hip East End . It 's open 24/7 .

Executive chef Daniel Doherty advises diners to order the signature dish : a fluffy Belgian waffle with a fried duck egg and mustard-infused maple syrup .

For traditional English with a twist there 's Dinner by Heston Blumenthal , at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hyde Park .

The celebrated restaurant serves big flavors inspired by recipes from the UK 's daddy of molecular gastronomy .

Iconic dishes include Tipsy Cake with spit-roasted pineapple and meat fruit -LRB- a tangy layer of fruit jelly , shaped like a mandarin , encasing a silky chicken liver parfait -RRB- .

Unique clothes

All the big international brands are represented in London and there are plenty of high-end department stores , but the best-kept secret is the city 's boutiques , which show off the wealth of homegrown fashion .

For immaculate tailoring with eccentric touches , both men and women head to British institution Paul Smith 's newest shop in Mayfair to invest in their business wardrobes .

These include this season 's Chartreuse Cashmere-Blend Epsom Coat and Slim-Fit Navy Wool Suit , with trademark modish tailoring .

Contemporary British menswear is all about a minimalist , utilitarian look .

You can nail the style with a few pieces from Albam in Soho . There 's the New Slim Jean made with Japanese selvedge denim or the Scottish Virgin Wool Shawl Neck Sweater .

But you have n't shopped in London until you 've been to Liberty .

A department store with the feel of a boutique , it stocks high-end cosmetics , designer sunglasses , jewelry , vintage handbags and home wares , as well as an impressive selection of items from international and British designers .

Among these are the Oxblood Liberty Print rucksack and the Barbour Olive Hooded Game Parka .

Best selfie spots

As London was named selfie capital of the world earlier this year , it 'd be wrong to leave without getting a few .

The obvious places remain the best .

For the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben , you 'll get the best shot by walking halfway across Westminster Bridge , which crosses the Thames .

For a stunning picture of yourself next to St. Paul 's Cathedral , go to the Millennium Bridge , which runs between the cathedral and the Tate Modern art gallery .

If you can round up a few friends , there 's always the crossing at Abbey Road , where you can recreate the iconic 1969 Beatles album cover and appear on the new Abbey Road Studios Crossing Cam .

Neighborhoods in a nutshell

One of the joys of London is its neighborhoods . Locals talk about each area as a `` village '' with its own identity and feel .

Here 's a brief selection that you wo n't regret taking time out of your day to explore .

Covent Garden

The charms of this theater , shopping and eating district are hard to beat .

Covent Garden was one of London 's first markets and the marketplace still stands in the Piazza , where you 'll find street performers and al fresco stalls .

For shopping , you can head for the narrow streets near the tube station or see if you can score a last-minute ticket at the Royal Opera House .

Bloomsbury

The heart of London 's academic district is a stone 's throw from the West End .

Leafy and grand , full of garden squares and Georgian terraces , this is where you 'll find The British Museum and The University of London .

It 's also culturally significant , giving its name to the Bloomsbury Group of artists , the most famous of whom was Virginia Woolf .

Karl Marx and Charles Darwin worked on their theories here , too .

British Museum , Great Russell Street , London ; +44 -LRB- 0 -RRB- 20 7323 8299

Notting Hill

A few tube stops west of central London , this well-heeled area around Westbourne Grove and Ledbury Road is full of boutiques and cafes , while Portobello Road , lined with charming terraces of pastel-colored houses , has an excellent antiques market .

One of the surprises of the area is the cultural mix , with Afro-Caribbean roots culture and trendy wealth rubbing against each other .

The mix finds its full expression each August at the Notting Hill Carnival , the largest street fair of its kind in Europe .

Decent souvenirs

There 's no need to go home with a pair of Union Jack boxer shorts or a gold-edged plate with a picture of Kate and Wills in the middle .

London 's many art galleries all have shops attached and are a great source of presents and souvenirs that are tasteful and different .

At the Tate Modern shop , you can pick up a reproduction of a 1950s Matisse exhibition poster -LRB- $ 40 -RRB- or a tea towel printed with a Turner landscape -LRB- $ 12 -RRB- .

Alternatively , the award-winning Snowden Flood shop specializes in well-designed souvenirs .

Highlights include a beautiful Regent 's Park Scented Candle , perfumed with oak , bay and rosemary oils , or a Tower Bridge dinner plate .
