-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Frank Lowe 's 5-year-old son may not be able to write his name yet , but he can tell you if your shoes are ratchet .

OK , that 's not really true , but it 's funny , which is the point of Lowe 's Twitter persona , @GayAtHomeDad : to use humor to normalize the concept of gay parenting and show mainstream America that `` gay is OK . ''

`` I think when people are uncertain or uncomfortable about something , humor is the best way to break down some of those barriers , and gay parenting is definitely a new concept to a lot of people , '' he said .

Not long ago , Lowe was a fairly normal gay man working in fashion . Then he moved to Connecticut with his partner , adopted their son , Briggs , and became a stay-at-home dad .

That 's when he transformed from a `` bitchy gay guy '' to a `` bitchy gay dad '' and began deploying sardonic wit in 140 characters on timely topics in parenting , pop culture and politics .

Lowe launched the Twitter persona in 2012 in response to what he perceived as `` a significant lack '' of gay fathers in the media and pop culture , except for Cam and Mitchell on `` Modern Family . '' To riff on the gay dad stereotype , he started @GayAtHomeDad as both a `` self-deprecating joke '' and a way to encourage gay youth to be comfortable in their skin .

It took off , thanks to the compelling username and outlandish comments such as `` When my kid scrapes his knee , he gets a Prada Band-Aid , '' or `` As IF I 'm going to ruin his hair using s **** y tears-free shampoo . He can cry . ''

`` I thought ` what 's funnier than an outlandishly crazy , lewd gay dad ? ' and literally there 's nothing , '' he said .

He also wants to put out the message to the gay community that being a gay parent does n't mean you have to be a perfect parent . `` Gay parents are expected to behave a certain way , because heaven forbid we mess this up , and I think that 's bulls *** . I am definitely a lot more cautious now that I 'm a parent , but I still am the same person I was before having a kid . ''

His 81,000 followers seem to like his style , engaging in his musings on such topics as marriage equality , the ice bucket challenge and some of his favorite performers . And his range is growing , with a YouTube channel and a feature on the `` Today '' show .

He also really likes `` American Horror Story , '' especially Jessica Lange , whose presence imbues much of his time line .

But @GayAtHomeDad is an online persona , he says . The real Frank Lowe is a lot less brassy and flamboyant .

`` My sense of humor is still sharp and inappropriate , but I do n't walk around with resting bitch face , '' he said .

He 's gay , but he 's a father first and foremost -- on Twitter and in real life .

`` There is nothing like the relationship I have with my son , and I love him more than anything on this planet , '' he said . `` Once we adopted him , I had to relinquish a lot of my selfish ways , and that was very cathartic and healthy . He constantly makes me want to be a better person and a better father . ''
