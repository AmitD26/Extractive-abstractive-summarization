Jerusalem woke up on Tuesday to horrific images of slain Jewish worshipers , and scores injured in a terror attack on a synagogue . The assault which took place in the western Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof , shocked Israel to the core , as well as many others around the world . This is not surprising considering both the brutality of the attack and the fact it was carried out in a holy place , where innocent religious people were worshiping .

The two assailants , cousins from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal Mukaber , were shot dead by the Israeli security forces . The incident in addition to the ongoing violence since the beginning of summer , left the city of Jerusalem more divided than for a long time .

The attack this week should have also sent a clear message to both leaderships that if they will not take measures to calm the situation down , further escalation and worse violence is around the corner . Regrettably , the Hamas praised the attack in Jerusalem and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the situation as the `` Battle for Jerusalem . ''

He also accused the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas of involvement despite the latter 's condemnation of the killing . Both sides are employing inflammable language , although it is hard to blame the Palestinian president for feeling angry considering Israeli behavior since the collapse of the peace process in April .

To make things worse , it emerged in recent days that Israel has also decided to return to a policy of demolishing houses of terrorists ' families , even if they were killed during the attack .

The Israeli security establishment argues that this form of punishment serves as a deterrence for any other would-be assailants . Regardless of the fate they face , their families are going to pay a heavy price and will be left homeless .

In a society where three generations of one family might live under the same roof , one act harms quite a few people , from babies to the elderly . To prove the seriousness of their intentions , the Israeli security forces already demolished a home on Wednesday . The home in Silwan was that of the Palestinian who drove his car into a crowd last month , killing two people . He was killed in the attack . The Army also moved to demolish the houses of the two who carried out the killing at the synagogue in Jerusalem .

Ironically the policy of demolishing houses as a form of deterrence was abandoned back in 2005 at the request of the Israeli army . A report produced , following an investigation by the Israeli security establishment , found this action counter-productive .

There is actually evidence that house demolition led to a rise in the number of attacks . House demolition of Palestinian militants ' houses is a form of collective punishment and an act of revenge , concealed behind a claim of deterrence . A similar `` standard '' was never applied to a Jewish terrorist . For instance when a Jewish settler , Baruch Goldstein , slayed 29 Muslim worshipers in the Cave of Patriarchs , no one suggested to demolish his home as a deterrence .

According to the Israeli human rights organization B'tselem , in the height of the Second Intifada , between 2001-2005 , 664 Palestinian homes were demolished in the occupied Palestinian territories as an apparent deterrence .

There is no evidence that the misery inflicted on thousands of innocent Palestinians enhanced Israeli security . It is worth remembering that the demolition of Palestinian houses in the West Bank also takes place for the purpose of expanding settlements , something which aggravates an already hostile population .

Arbitrary house demolitions represent not only a bad policy , but are also illegal and immoral . This is a clear violation of international law , more specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention , clearly prohibits forcing individuals and groups out of their homes within an occupied territory .

Any demolition of houses when there are no overwhelming military reasons is regarded as a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and could potentially lead to a war crime charge . And there is also , of course , a moral aspect . As deplorable as some of the acts committed by a few individuals , their punishment should not extend beyond their death or what the court decides .

Their families , as a result , suffered a loss too , for no fault of their own . To condemn them to destitution for an act that they did not commit is a moral travesty .

The decision by the Israelis to resume Palestinian house demolition following an attack on Jews in Israel is not a security decision but a political one , aimed to satisfy an angry public and extreme right-wing members of the current coalition . The Israeli coalition depends on satisfying their demands .

However , the lack of credibility of the deterrence argument , combined with the immorality and illegality of house demolitions should serve as an overwhelming reason not to resume this abysmal practice .
