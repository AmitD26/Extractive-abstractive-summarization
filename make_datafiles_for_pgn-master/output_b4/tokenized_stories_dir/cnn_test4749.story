Qassim Shesho stands on Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq , overlooking a vast mountain range that rises from the desert . The calm is deceptive .

He worries about the village behind him . Sheref ad-Din holds one of the holiest shrines for the Yazidis . ISIS militants are only two miles away .

`` ISIS wants to exterminate us and they want to establish an Islamic caliphate , but Islam is not like what they are doing to us , '' Shesho says . He says he commands about 2,000 Yazidi fighters .

Just months ago , he lived a peaceful life in Germany .

`` I came back because my people are here . ISIS are terrorists . I came to defend my land , my family and my religion , '' he tells CNN by phone , speaking in Arabic .

He did n't come alone . Shesho 's 26-year-old son , Yassir Qassim Khalaf , is with him . Yassir arrived in September , shortly after ISIS 's initial attack on Yazidis left thousands stranded on the mountain without food , water or medical care . Their plight captured the world 's attention .

The Iraqi air force and fighters with the Kurdish fighting force -- the peshmerga -- rescued some families in a dramatic helicopter mission . U.S. airstrikes helped clear a path for thousands of Yazidis to escape the mountain into neighboring Syria and to Iraqi Kurdish territory .

Yet the nightmare continues for thousands who remain on the mountain , surrounded by ISIS forces intent on eradicating anyone in their path .

`` You ca n't just stay in Germany , live in luxury and leave your family and your people alone while you are watching it all on TV , thinking , ` It 'll work itself out , ' '' Yassir says in German .

Shesho 's troops , in many ways , are fighting an existential fight .

Yazidis are one of the oldest religious communities in the world , with a population estimated at only 700,000 . They have suffered persecution through the ages . Many Muslims consider them devil worshipers .

Yazidis captured by ISIS have been forced to convert to Islam . Gruesome reports have emerged of Yazidi women being enslaved , raped and sold off by ISIS members while men and boys are executed .

The United Nations concluded that the actions of ISIS `` may amount to an attempt to commit genocide . ''

Who are the Yazidis and why does ISIS want to kill them ?

He came to ` defend , ' not to ` fight '

`` I decided to defend Sinjar , not to fight . They decided to fight , '' Shesho says of ISIS . `` We defend our land and our holy places . I have lived in Germany for 24 years and have always abhorred killing and fighting . ''

Shesho 's troops receive weapons and humanitarian aid from the Kurdish regional government . Kurdish forces airdrop food and weapons . U.S. airstrikes on ISIS also have helped , but Shesho says it 's not enough .

`` ISIS wants to ruin the whole world . We want more American airstrikes between Sinjar and Dahouk so we can go back to our lands and live in peace . ''

At one point , Shesho 's five sons fought ISIS alongside him in the mountains . Three have returned to Germany . Yassir and an older brother , Haydar Qassim Shesho , remain .

They keep in touch with friends and family in Germany as much as fighting and bad cellular reception allow . Yassir says his mother worries . They try to console her .

`` Three times a week , we try to send her pictures and messages to say that everything is OK here and that she does n't need to worry , '' Yassir says .

His mother and brothers are in a German town of 50,000 called Bad Oeynhausen , in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia .

` I just could n't bear to witness the suffering '

The family fled Iraq in 1990 , when Saddam Hussein ruled the country . They went to Germany and eventually became citizens .

Yassir was 2 .

`` When I 'm in Germany , I 'm grateful that I 'm able to be there . But if it comes to it , then I 'm ready to die here , '' he says .

Before coming to Iraq , Yassir worked part time in crafts services for companies and hotels around his hometown .

`` I actually wanted to be here from the beginning because I just could n't bear to witness the suffering of the Yazidis . ... How our honor is tainted , how our families and wives are being captured , '' Yassir says .

`` To go from luxury to war is not pleasant , but you got ta do what you got ta do . ''
