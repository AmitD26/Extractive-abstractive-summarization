An Israeli soldier was killed Sunday in a shooting along the Israel-Lebanon border , according to the Israel Defense Forces .

The soldier was treated at the scene , then evacuated to a hospital . He later died of his wounds .

Later , around midnight , as soldiers in the area conducted an investigation , `` suspicious people '' were identified and `` due to a threat , precise shots were fired at the suspects identified as Lebanese soldiers , and one suspect was hit , '' an Israel Defense Forces statement said .

Earlier Sunday , a spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon , or UNIFIL , had said that a `` serious shooting incident '' was taking place along the Israel-Lebanon border .

It was not immediately clear who was shooting at whom , Andrea Treneti said then . Commanders from both sides were talking to the head of the UNIFIL mission to establish what happened .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon 's office issued a statement deploring the shooting and calling for restraint on both sides . Israeli and Lebanese forces are cooperating in the investigation , the statement said .

The soldier was shot while driving along the border near Rosh Hanikra , according to the IDF .

An initial inquiry confirmed the sniper is a member of the Lebanese Armed Forces , it said , adding that further investigation is under way .

According to the Lebanese National News Agency , army troops opened fire on Israeli soldiers near the border .

UNIFIL has been in southern Lebanon since a 1978 conflict with Israel .

After the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon 's Hezbollah militia , the peacekeepers ' mandate was expanded to include helping Lebanon keep the country 's south `` free of any armed personnel , assets and weapons '' other than government troops .

Cross-border fire has been rare since the Israel-Hezbollah war .

In late August , the Israeli air force conducted a strike in Lebanon between Beirut and Sidon , a day after rockets struck northern Israel , according to the IDF . There were no casualties .
