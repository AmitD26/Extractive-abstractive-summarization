Raffaele Sollecito was a 23-year-old computer science student when his girlfriend 's roommate , Meredith Kercher , was found dead in the house she shared with Amanda Knox in Perugia , Italy , in 2007 .

The discovery was the beginning of what Sollecito has called `` a nightmare '' he would n't wish on anyone .

In 2009 , he and Knox were convicted of Kercher 's murder . In 2011 , the pair were acquitted -- only to have that decision overturned by Italian Supreme Court judges two years later . A retrial began in Florence in September 2013 .

The initial guilty verdict at the 2009 trial had not been the result Sollecito had been expecting .

`` When the sentencing was read , I did n't understand what was happening and even now it seems impossible and still I do n't understand why I was convicted , '' he said in a prison interview through his lawyer the week after the sentencing . He said then he dreamed of returning to his studies .

Sollecito is from Bari , on the Adriatic coast , far south of the central Italian university town where he was studying . In his prison interview , he said he missed the smell of the sea , among other things .

`` Above all my family , '' he said in the interview conducted via attorney Luca Maori . `` I also miss my friends , the everyday life , the walks in my town 's square . ''

Sollecito finished his computer science degree while in prison , according to media reports . He was not studying at the same university as Knox , and was not held in the same prison .

In the prison interview , he described how the verdict brought the world collapsing down on him and Knox .

But he denied then that he was still in love with her , saying , `` I feel close to her because I consider her my companion in misadventure . ''

He rejected the idea that Knox was capable of murder . `` I do n't even dare think a thing like that . It is absurd and inadmissible . She is a very sweet girl , '' he insisted .

When their successful appeal saw Knox and Sollecito freed in 2011 -- after four years in prison -- they set about trying to rebuild their lives , a continent apart .

Sollecito had hoped simply to blend in in his hometown of Bari .

`` I only hope to be forgotten ; the sooner the better . I want to have a normal life , '' he said before his release . `` I do n't want to be recognized when I leave the prison . ''

` Journey to hell '

Sollecito published a book in 2012 , the first by someone directly involved in the chain of events sparked by the discovery of Kercher 's body .

The memoir , `` Honor Bound : My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox , '' draws heavily on diaries he kept and letters he wrote to friends , family and his hometown newspaper during his years in prison , the preface says .

Sollecito chronicles the day of the murder , admitting that he and Knox smoked marijuana that afternoon , which he says he regretted because it clouded his memory of what happened . While maintaining his innocence , he says he does not clearly remember even if Knox spent the night with him .

He and Knox made mistakes the morning of the discovery , including trusting police investigators , he writes .

Sollecito acknowledges that at times , he was uncomfortable with Knox 's `` bizarre behavior , '' which he says prosecutors used against both of them .

In the epilogue , he recounts how he went to visit Knox in Seattle after their release , but he was nervous to see her . `` I was n't at all sure it was a good idea and I continued to waver back and forth even after I booked my ticket .

`` We had been through so much ; perhaps we owed it to each other to live our lives and leave each other in peace . ''

Rather than that hoped-for peace , Sollecito 's nightmare began again following the 2013 ruling of the Supreme Court judges in Rome that there should be a retrial .

In an interview with CNN soon after the retrial opened in September 2013 , Sollecito maintained his innocence .

`` I just think that in the Italian system , there 's something really wrong in the rules that they sometimes are not respected or they are turned to hurt people . And they can hurt actually innocent people , '' he said . `` My life now is a hell . ''

Sollecito took the stand to defend himself in November .

`` I would like to make you understand that these charges against me are absurd , '' he told the court .

`` There was not a basis to charge me , to put me in jail ... I do n't wish anybody on Earth to go through what I went through . ''

He said that evidence against him -- a knife that was a key part of the prosecution 's case -- was `` an illusion . ''

`` I ask you ... to really look at reality , '' he implored the judges . `` For me , it 's a nightmare that goes beyond imagination ...

`` Right now , I do n't have a real life . ''
