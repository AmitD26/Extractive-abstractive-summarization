Italian explorer Marco Polo spent 17 years working in the court of Kublai Khan 's China , but today most foreigners seeking to live and work in the country are n't looking for the same time-invested cultural exchange .

`` It 's the place to make money , '' explained Aynura Askerova , a Russian who has lived in the southern Chinese metropolis of Guangzhou for four years .

Work as a fashion model has taken Askerova across China and the rest of Asia , but `` now it 's time to find a real career , '' she said last month , in an overly-illuminated hotel conference room in the city 's China Marriott Hotel .

Like hundreds of other visitors from across the world , the graduate in software development from Kazan State University was there for the Jobs Fair for Foreigners ; one of three annual events organized by the Chinese government , where expats get a rare chance to meet prospective employers face-to-face .

The events have been a honeypot for job-seeking expats , particularly since the global economic crisis of 2008 . While economic growth in China has slowed in the last year , the 7 % to 8 % predicted growth is positively booming compared to Europe and the United States , leading many to believe their prospects there might be better than at home .

However the perception that expats , particularly from western countries , can just walk into a job or career in China is now out of date .

`` The novelty of being a foreigner has worn off , '' said Shanghai-based Simon Lance , regional director in China for recruitment firm Hays . `` Employers are seeking value . Demonstrating a genuine commitment to China is key . ''

That can include language skills and being willing to spend more than just one or two years in the country , he added .

According to a report by the state-run Xinhua news agency , nearly 7 million new Chinese graduates entered the jobs market last year . It 's a figure that is set to increase in the coming years as China expands its number of higher education institutions , adding to the challenge for foreigners embarking on their careers in the country .

`` That side of the workforce there 's almost an oversupply of junior end candidates , '' said Lance . `` So it 's hard for expats to compete . Without Mandarin or local language skills I 'd say it 's almost impossible . ''

Nick Cucinella , CEO at CareerBuilder China , advises graduates to have a CV in both English and Chinese , even if they do n't speak the language , and that taking the initiative and targeting prospective employers and Chinese companies is the best path to a job .

`` Not many people do that , but if they do they will be very well received . Too many just use jobs sites and search engines , '' he said .

However for those with established careers and particular skill-sets , demand exceeds supply in many industries .

Big infrastructure projects in China mean that recruitment companies are seeing a desire for experienced architects and design engineers , plus a strong demand for those in the pharmaceutical industry , as local and international companies invest in R&D facilities in the country .

`` Chinese companies realize they have to offer more than just a job , but show that the city is good place to live , raise children and there 's enough going on , '' said Cucinella .

The recruitment process in China could also seem quite strange to many westerners .

`` At a market in China you 're expected to haggle and that applies in some way to job negotiations . Westerners do n't want to feel like they 're haggling over their life , they want to feel wanted , '' said Cucinella .

However a larger trend is localizing the workforce across positions , believes Lance .

If the employers he recruits for have a wish-list it is usually for a Chinese national who has gained many years of experience studying or working abroad .

These `` haigui , '' or sea turtles as they are called in China , hit the employment sweet spot with `` both the cultural connection and the language skills , '' according to Lance .

`` They provide a pretty good compromise between being able to connect and communicate with local Chinese staff , but have a good understanding of western business and management practice . They bridge the two worlds quite well . ''

For those expats at the Guangzhou event swimming against the rising tide of competition , employing a number of techniques is necessary to make it in China -- local connections being one of the most useful .

`` Having a connection , or ` guanxi , ' is important , '' said German national Max Storz , who found a sales job in Guangzhou through a contact of his girlfriend . `` It helps a lot to find a job and get things done in general . ''

It 's worked for Askerova , too . With business partners she met in China , she has been able to register a trading company in Hong Kong alongside developing a modeling career .

`` There are cultural differences to work out , and it was hard for me at first -LRB- living in Guangzhou -RRB- , very different , '' she said . `` But there is really nowhere else like it . ''
