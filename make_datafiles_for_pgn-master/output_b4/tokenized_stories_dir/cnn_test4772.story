If the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 caused a rift in China-Malaysia relations , the two countries appear to have put it behind them .

Recent comments by officials in both Kuala Lumpur and Beijing have emphasized the active cooperation between the two countries , while also downplaying accusations lodged by Chinese families against the Malaysian government .

According to Hong Kong 's South China Morning Post , China 's Ambassador to Malaysia sought to distance these `` radical views '' from his country 's official position . They `` do not represent the views of Chinese people and the Chinese government , '' he was quoted as saying .

Some of the Chinese relatives of passengers aboard the missing Boeing 777 have been openly critical of the investigation . They went so far as to release a statement calling the Malaysian government and its military the `` real murderers '' of their loved ones .

In a press conference Saturday , Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein made it clear China will be an accredited member of the investigation team . A few days earlier , he spoke about Malaysia 's duty to keep its Asian neighbor informed about all progress .

James Chin , professor of political science at Monash University in Melbourne , Australia , said the rift always appeared larger in the media than at an official level . `` I think among the diplomats they do understand this is just a small thing within the larger context of Malaysia-China relations and this will not alter relationships in the long term . ''

Trade partners

At stake between the two countries is a thriving economic relationship . According to Malaysia 's Ministry of International Trade , China was Malaysia 's largest trading partner for the fifth consecutive year in 2013 . Trade between the two countries that year grew by 12.5 % to US $ 63.4 billion .

Tourism numbers were equally positive , with 1.79 million people visiting from China last year -- an increase of 14.9 % from the previous year .

Ramon Navaratnam , former Secretary General of the Malaysian Ministry of Transport , said he did not expect trade between the two countries to deteriorate , despite the initial protests by some of the Chinese families of missing passengers on MH370 in Beijing .

`` I do n't see it happening as the Chinese authorities , especially their envoy -LRB- Huang Huikang -RRB- to Malaysia , has given very measured statements and not blamed Malaysia for MH370 , '' said Navaratnam , who is currently the chairman of the Center for Public Policy Studies at the Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute .

Navaratnam , who has authored several books on economics in Malaysia , said the business environment would not change unless the governments decided otherwise .

Lee Hwok Aun , an economics lecturer at the University of Malaya , agreed bilateral trade is not expected to fall off as Malaysia 's primary exports to China consist of electrical components and raw materials such as crude rubber and palm oil -- critical to China 's own economy .

`` Tourism may suffer some minor setbacks initially but exports wo n't change much as China needs raw materials , '' said Lee . `` It 's much harder to organize a boycott of component imports and China too wants a steady supply chain . ''
