What would you do if you only had one day to live ? Probably not spend time downloading and fiddling with a mobile app , we 're guessing .

But a new app , Sobrr , wants you to embrace life in just that way . It lets you create a social network geared toward meeting new people around you , sharing photos and videos of what you 're up to and supporting other users who are also living it up . Or whatever .

Using GPS , Sobrr identifies other users close to you and shows them your posts . They may then `` cheer '' or comment on those posts and , if both parties agree , they can become `` 24-hour friends . '' There 's an option for users who hit it off to make each other permanent parts of their network .

The kicker is that , anything you do using the app is totally erased after 24 hours . Texts you send to other users disappear after a few seconds and photos or videos you share can go away nearly as quickly .

The app 's co-founder , Bruce Yang , says that in an era when your third-grade teacher can find you on Facebook and anyone you 've ever met at work wants to network on LinkedIn , people are craving an app like Sobrr . It lets them share without worrying their actions will go down on their permanent record .

`` It promotes sharing only the most refreshing contents and leading a casual relationship with no strings attached , '' said Yang , an alum of Fitbit , LinkedIn and Microsoft .

So , you can call Sobrr the anti-Facebook . But if you want to call it Tinder meets Snapchat meets Foursquare , you would n't be that far-off either .

The app 's name reflects the moment the idea first dawned on Yang -- the morning after a Las Vegas bachelor party . He says he noticed all of his fellow partyers rushing onto their social media accounts to make sure they had n't shared any incriminating info about the previous night .

No , Yang says , his app is n't just another tool for the hookup culture or a way to send naughty photos without having to answer for them later . But if somebody wants to use it that way ? He 's not here to stop them .

`` From the party animals that I 've surveyed , more than half admitted that they want to meet new people in the party , and crave for a one-night stand , '' he said .

Sobrr lets users post content `` that they might otherwise feel too embarrassed to post on other platforms , '' he said . Yang also said it 's important for users `` to have their own space and little secrets . ''

But he maintains that `` naughty stuff '' is only a small part of what users have been sharing in the month since the app 's release .

`` We understand that ` hooking up ' is the need of many users on the platform , but we really value more of the casual interaction and conversation on the platform -- the foreplay of hooking up , '' he said . `` People are more attracted by each other based on their life moments or a common interest . ''

It 's possible the Silicon Valley startup is onto something . In the past year or so , ephemeral messaging apps such as Snapchat , Confide and Wickr have flourished .

So far , the app 's user base remains relatively small , boasting 10,000 users in the weeks it 's been available exclusively for Apple 's mobile devices . Whether more folks will flock to it to live a more carefree social media life , or merely hide the evidence from their wild nights out , remains to be seen .
