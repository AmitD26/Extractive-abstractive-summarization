It 's late in Iran on a dark night , moonless or with heavy clouds . Suddenly the silence is broken by sonic booms , followed by the sound of jets roaring overhead .

Flying in tight formation , Israeli fighter planes drop bunker-busting bombs on a nuclear enrichment plant built into the side of a mountain .

Iranian pilots race for their own jets to fight back , but by the time they take to the sky , it 's too late . The Israeli jets streak away .

That , at least , is what Israel would like to happen if it decides to attack Iran in an effort to prevent it from acquiring the ability to make nuclear weapons .

But would it be as easy for Israel to destroy Iran 's nuclear sites as it was for the Jewish state to strike an Iraqi reactor in 1981 or a suspected one in Syria five years ago ?

Experts inside and outside Israel say no .

They envision a much more complicated attack , one that would involve more than 100 planes -- from fighters to refueling tankers -- flying hundreds of miles to bomb up to eight targets around Iran .

Possible site of Iran explosive tests identified , think tank says

Israel hit one target each in Iraq and Syria , but Iran 's nuclear assets are spread over multiple sites in different parts of the country . One is buried under concrete . Another is dug into a mountain . Surface-to-air missiles and electronic warfare systems protect them all .

They also are significantly farther away from Israel than the targets in Iraq or Syria .

And they may not be the only sites Israel would need to destroy to achieve its goal .

Bombing Iranian nuclear facilities would be `` very complicated , '' said Ephraim Kam , deputy director of Israel 's Institute for National Security Studies .

`` It is a very large-scale operation , much greater than the one carried out in Iraq 30 years ago , '' said Kam , a former colonel who served with an intelligence research division in the Israeli military .

Israel would most likely attack Iran with fighters jets -- the F-15I and the F-16I -- rather than missiles fired from submarines , Kam and other experts said .

`` In order to create proper damage to the nuclear plants , you need extremely accurate weapons , '' Kam said . `` I do n't know that the missiles are accurate enough . ''

According to the London-based defense analysis group Jane 's , Israel has one squadron -- about 25 planes -- of F-15I jets , which are similar to the F-15 Eagle fighters of the U.S. Air Force . Israel calls its version of the fighter Raam , or Thunder .

It has four squadrons of F-16Is , the Israeli version of the U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcon . The Israeli jet is known as the Suefa , or Storm .

The Israeli fighters lack the range to reach most of the likely targets in Iran , so Israel would also need to put tanker aircraft into the sky , said Douglas Barrie of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London .

Israel has at least seven KC-707 tankers that it could use for airborne refueling , Barrie said .

It also has at least four KC-130H tankers , versions of the giant Hercules aircraft , but is not likely to use them because their slow speed means the jets would need to slow down to link with them , wasting fuel , he said .

The strike aircraft would carry bunker-busting GBU-28 bombs -- 5,000-pound bombs to `` go after hardened and buried sites , '' Barrie said .

Each F-15I could carry up to three bunker-busters , he said , depending on whether they are configured to carry the maximum number of bombs or the largest possible amount of fuel .

The American military has an even larger bunker-buster , the 30,000-pound GBU-57 , but there 's `` no indication the Israelis have requested that weapon '' or that Israel has the B-2 or B-52 bombers needed to deliver it , Barrie said .

Like other experts , he based his analysis on the assumption that if Israel mounted an attack , it would do so without American help .

There would be at least four primary targets , said Emily Chorley , a nuclear expert at Jane 's : the Natanz and Fordo nuclear enrichment plants , the Esfahan uranium conversion facility , and the Arak nuclear complex .

Esfahan and Arak are above ground and are `` relatively vulnerable to aerial attack , '' she said .

But Natanz , in the center of the country , is buried under 33 feet of earth and 6 feet of concrete , Chorley said , making it `` very hard to penetrate . ''

Fordo , near the holy city of Qom , is `` even more difficult '' because it is deeply buried in a mountain , she said .

Dropping a bunker-busting bomb on Fordo actually might make it less vulnerable , Chorley said , since collapsing the entrance without destroying the facility would protect it from further bombing .

`` It 's questionable whether Israel is capable of destroying it in an air-launched attack , '' she said .

`` Just getting Natanz and Arak without getting Fordo would n't be worth the risk , '' she argued , since Fordo is enriching uranium to higher levels than the other sites .

All four targets are protected by S-200 and Hawk surface-to-air missile batteries , said Chorley 's colleague , Jim O'Halloran , a specialist in land-based air defense .

Israel would have at least two secondary targets as well , Chorley predicted -- the Tabriz and Imam Ali missile bases in the west , `` to prevent a retaliatory missile attack '' on Israel .

It also could try to strike the controversial Parchin military base east of Tehran , which inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency have been trying to visit , Chorley said .

Israel also might target the Bidganeh military base , which suffered a mysterious explosion in November . That would bring the number of potential targets to eight .

Iran 's single declared civilian nuclear reactor probably is safe , Chorley said .

An attack on the Bushehr reactor would risk spreading nuclear contamination , and could mean killing Russian personnel at the Russian-built facility , infuriating Moscow .

Israel has three potential routes of attack , according to Jane 's and other experts , assuming its fighters do not fly all the way around the Arabian Peninsula . Jane 's says the Israeli Air Force does not have enough refueling capacity to travel that distance .

The northern route would go through Turkey , with which Israel has tense relations . The southern route would go through Saudi Arabia , which fears its rival Iran getting a bomb but is openly hostile toward Israel .

The central route is the shortest . It runs through Jordan and Iraq . Jordan and Israel are at peace , but there 's no guarantee Jordan would formally give Israel permission to fly over its territory .

Iraqi air defenses , meanwhile , `` can not prevent violations of sovereignty , '' said Charles Hollosi of IHS Jane 's . That makes it the `` most likely location for air refueling . ''

Israel will need to decide what altitude its planes would fly at on the way in . Flying higher would protect them from the defenses of the countries they fly over , but will expose them sooner to Iranian radar .

`` You 're going to be in the cockpit three hours-plus before you get to the target unless you go the central route , '' said Barrie , the International Institute for Strategic Studies ' senior fellow for military aerospace in London .

He doubts the Iranians would be able to detect them coming that far away .

`` I do n't imagine them having two hours ' notice . The Israelis will be desperate to give them as little notice as possible .

`` They will try to ensure their aircraft remain below their radar as long as possible , '' he said . `` If you 're in an Israeli fast jet you do n't want it to be anything like a fair fight . ''

Barrie noted the Israeli military 's success in attacking a suspected nuclear site in Syria in 2007 .

`` The Israelis , with a mix of electronic warfare and electronic attack , degraded Syrian air defenses to the point where they did n't see the strike package coming in , '' he said .

`` Can the Israelis pull off tactical surprise the way they did with the Syrians in 2007 ? Going after three or four strike targets is much harder , '' he said .

Iran 's air force has American-made F-14 Tomcats acquired under the shah 's regime , which ended in 1979 , Barrie said , as well as Russian-made MiG-29s . On paper , they are not a match for the Israeli planes .

`` Israel remains the pre-eminent air force in the region -- well-equipped , and they have trained long and hard , '' he said .

`` The Iranians are at an obvious disadvantage in terms of the age and quality of the equipment they have , but they also train hard and will be motivated , '' Barrie said . `` I would be surprised if the Israelis are underestimating the Iranians . ''
