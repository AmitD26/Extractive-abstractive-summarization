Melissa Atkins Wardy calls it her `` a-ha '' moment .

There she was looking for her first sippy cup for her then 6-month-old daughter . Her choices : Mickey Mouse , Diego and `` Toy Story '' characters for boys , and princesses -- and more princesses -- for girls .

Already fired up , she walked through the toy aisles and saw what she describes as a further gender divide . Girls were offered baby dolls , princesses and sexy fashion figures ; the boys section had superheroes , building blocks , science kits and dinosaurs .

`` That was it . There was no middle ground . I did n't see any dolls or cooking sets for boys , nor building blocks or fire trucks for girls , '' writes Atkins Wardy in her new book `` Redefining Girly : How Parents Can Fight the Stereotyping and Sexualizing of Girlhood , from Birth to Tween . ''

After that experience , she said in an interview , `` Everything clicked and made sense to me . ''

`` I hear parents saying that all the time . They 're like , ` Oh , I just had my sippy cup moment ' ... They were at a restaurant and the clown came to the table and offered the boys a whole bunch of selections for what balloon animal to make and then he offered the girl a flower or a tiara , '' said Atkins Wardy , a mom of two .

`` The mom 's like , ` What if she wants a light saber , too ? ' ''

The birth of a cause

After Atkins Wardy 's eye-opening shopping experience , she decided to start a business creating empowering T-shirts for girls and boys . Her company , Pigtail Pals and Ballcap Buddies , offers selections such as a girl doctor with the headline `` Call me in the morning '' and another that says `` I 'm growing up , '' and lists words like inquisitive , fearless and daring .

Her business led to a blog and ultimately , a cause : trying to raise awareness about gender stereotypes and how damaging they can be .

`` One pink pacifier or sippy cup or Lego set is n't a big deal ... it 's when the lowest common denominators of femininity become the marketing catalyst for every product that 's made for females , '' said Atkins Wardy , who has an 8-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son .

The fact that there are `` girl '' products and `` boy '' products at all is also part of the problem , she said .

`` It teaches children there is only one way to be a girl and one way to be a boy , '' she said . `` When you have a little girl like mine who is obsessed with the ocean and giant squids and insect infestations in homes , she 's considered weird or odd or a tomboy when in fact , science and things like that should be considered girly . ''

As a mom of two girls -- including one who hopes Peyton Manning of the Denver Broncos calls her to play on his team in this week 's Super Bowl -- I can totally relate . I , along with so many other parents , am frustrated about the definitions of what 's girly and what 's not , and the separate products and clothing offered to girls and boys .

` Pink and pretty to hot and sexy '

A larger question is just whether this gender differentiation in products and fashion actually leads to another big concern , especially for parents of daughters , the sexualization of our young girls .

Atkins Wardy of Janesville , Wisconsin , says there 's a correlation .

`` You have to connect the dots , '' she said . `` With princess culture and all these pink toys that are almost always focused on fashion and beauty and how a girl can please somebody else , either by keeping a nice house or looking like a perfect princess , that all segues into the sexualization side of the market .

`` Once you 're done with princesses , if you are growing up in that girly-girly culture , the next thing offered to you are these sexualized dolls and you are growing up too fast , '' she said . `` You are being introduced into adult concepts of sexuality that otherwise would n't be present in toys and it does n't allow a girl to develop on her own , and at her own pace .

`` The pretty princess culture focuses on appearance and that segues -LRB- from -RRB- ` sweet and pink and pretty ' to ` hot and sexy . ' There 's no room for girlhood in that space . ''

Encouraging girls ' ` personal brand '

So what 's a parent to do ? Atkins Wardy 's book , which she hopes is almost like a `` recipe book for parents , '' offers step-by-step advice .

She encourages us to teach our children to think critically , which can be as simple as watching a television show and raising questions about why girls are portrayed a certain way . For instance , if the girl character is getting rescued by a boy , we can tell our girls the story could easily have been changed so the girl is doing the rescuing .

`` I talk about parents teaching girls a personal brand , '' she said . `` She kind of has this benchmark that ... when these toxic messages come in and out from culture , she can then bounce against -LRB- them -RRB- or not and say , ` Well this does n't fit what my mom and dad taught me . ' ''

There are not enough parents having these kinds of conversations with their girls and boys , Atkins Wardy said .

Moms on Facebook might see something inspiring such as a new ad by Dove encouraging women to love themselves , no matter what . `` They all click like and they love it , '' she said , `` But are you taking that second step and sharing that with your kid and really talking about it ... and just being conscious of the media you are taking in ? ''

Parents can also make their voices heard , Atkins Wardy said , whenever they see a product , ad , or clothing that they believe stereotypes and sexualizes girls .

When Disney gave Merida , the heroine from `` Brave '' a makeover , more than 250,000 people signed a `` Keep Merida Brave '' online petition . Disney ultimately backed down from changing the character 's look and dress .

`` Once you aggregate these parents ' voices and the tens of thousands of voices , you really can start to make change , '' she said .

` Once you see it , you ca n't unsee it '

Atkins Wardy often tells parents in her community that once they become aware of the stereotyping and the sexualization , they wo n't be able to look away .

`` Once you see it , you ca n't unsee it , '' she writes .

It 's also never too late to start doing something about it , she says . That includes letting our girls know they can be whatever they want to be .

`` There are many ways to be a girl and ` Redefining Girly ' is about giving girls the space to show us who they are , '' she said .

So if the Broncos needs an extra player Sunday , I 'll be sure my 6-year-old gal is ready !
