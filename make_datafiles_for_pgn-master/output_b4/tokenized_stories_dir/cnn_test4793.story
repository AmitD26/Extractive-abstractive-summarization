-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Teta Isibo had always had a flair for design but she did n't realize she could make a career out of it until the time she asked an artisan to craft a pair of earrings she 'd drawn .

`` My friends all loved them , '' recalls the Rwandan designer . `` So friends started placing orders , and then friends of friends -- so it 's gradually evolved through the years from a hobby to an actual full time business . ''

That business is Inzuki Designs , the startup Isibo launched in 2010 after deciding to quit her land management job to embark on her entrepreneurial journey . Fusing traditional craftsmanship with contemporary bold designs , the Africa-inspired fashion brand quickly had people buzzing .

`` Inzuki means bees , '' says Isibo , explaining the inspiration behind the company 's name . `` It 's an attitude , like a sweet but fierce attitude ; the way bees give honey so they have that sweet aspect , but then you ca n't really mess with them because they would sting you . ''

What started with one pair of earrings has now become a growing business that specializes in handmade jewelry , accessories and interior dÃ © cor . Its colorful and vibrant products are made with local raw materials by various cooperatives in and around the Rwandan capital of Kigali .

`` Rwanda has so much potential in terms of the traditional craftsmanship skills , in terms of the raw materials you can find here , '' says the young entrepreneur , `` but I felt that we were n't really living up to that potential .

`` Everything you 'd find on the market was ... very touristy stuff and I wanted to create something that Rwandans as well would love to wear , -LSB- something they -RSB- would love to say ` this was made in Rwanda . ' ''
