-LRB- CNN -RRB- Shortly after the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War , paralyzed veteran Tomas Young spoke with me about why he intended to end his life .

He did n't know what people would say about him after he was gone . All he wanted , really , was to be remembered as a nice guy .

He spoke with me by phone as a pump at his side helped him inject painkillers . His speech was so distorted that I had difficulty understanding him . He sent me photos showing how long and thick his hair and beard had grown . He said he seldom left his bed and that he popped a dizzying assortment of more than 30 different pills every day .

Read why Young wanted to end his life

Young 's ordeal began in 2004 when two rounds from a sniper 's AK-47 severed his spinal cord .

Tired of suffering , Young penned a scathing letter in 2013 to former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney . He laid out the painful circumstances of his life and blamed the former administration for the many casualties of that war . He said he would refuse his feeding tube and allow himself to die .

He was the subject of the 2007 documentary , `` Body of War , '' and had become a vocal anti-war activist . He again made headlines when his death wish became public .

But he did n't die then .

He said he wanted to spend more time with his wife , Claudia Cuellar . Former television host Phil Donahue , co-director and executive producer of `` Body of War , '' said Wednesday that Tomas and Claudia made a remarkable love story .

`` Theirs was a true love like I have never witnessed before , '' Donahue said . `` Tomas made it clear she was the reason he was alive . ''

The Uncounted : War 's true toll

On Monday , Young died at home in Seattle . The cause of death was not immediately clear , according to media reports .

Donahue said he had been waiting almost 10 years to hear what he heard on the phone Monday .

`` This was a catastrophic injury , '' Donahue said . `` Tomas was imprisoned in bed . He could n't even cough . ''

Young had moved with his wife to Portland , Oregon , where , as he stated in his Twitter profile , he was a `` happily married man who 's happy to live in a medical maryjane state . '' He was referring to legalized medical marijuana .

I learned of his passing on Veterans Day . Appropriate , I thought , for as controversial as Young had been , I believed he remained true to his convictions .

When we spoke last year , he asked me about my experiences covering the war in Iraq . We talked about the soldiers I met who lost their lives or returned home with serious injuries , both physical and psychological .

A soldier 's war on two fronts

Cuellar told me then she was frightened at the prospect of losing her husband , but that she always returned to thinking about how difficult it was for him every single day .

`` There will be time to mourn when he dies , '' Cuellar told me . `` Until that day , I will love and cherish and celebrate him and try to make each day as loving and happy and comfortable as possible for him . ''

And she did .

In a video posted on YouTube Tuesday , Young 's sister-in-law , Amanda Young , captured his 34 years of life -- from a baby who put a gleam in his mother 's eye to a companion for his brother Nathan ; from a young man who felt compelled to serve his nation after the terror attacks of 9/11 to a wounded veteran who became a poster child for those who opposed the U.S. role in Iraq .

Young returned home from war a broken man . He is now free from his pain .

In an online memorial , people thanked him for his service .

Young was a self-avowed atheist , but somehow I could feel him smiling down at his friends , glad that they were remembering him as a nice guy .
