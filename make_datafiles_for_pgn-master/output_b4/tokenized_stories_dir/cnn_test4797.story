It was one small interview for astronaut Neil Armstrong ... and one giant scoop for an Australian accountant , of all people .

In the year 's most out-of-this-world get , the first man to step foot on the moon sat down with CPA -LRB- Certified Practicing Account -RRB- Australia 's Alex Malley to narrate his historic lunar landing in an extremely rare interview .

Armstrong was the commander of NASA 's three-man Apollo 11 mission that landed on the moon on July 20 , 1969 . Armstrong and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin spent about two hours on the surface before returning to the Eagle lunar module .

The 81-year old American is famously reluctant to discuss the moon landing and has granted very few interviews in the last 40 years -- so why choose to open up to CPA Australia ? Malley thinks he knows the answer .

`` I knew something a lot of people did n't know about Neil Armstrong -- his dad was an auditor , '' said Malley in the first of the four part interview with Armstrong posted on the CPA website .

In the 45-minute interview Commander Armstrong discussed his childhood in Ohio , walking on the moon , and what it 's like to sleep on a spaceship .

Armstrong also recounts the moment he got the call to ask him if his crew were ready to land on the moon .

`` The bosses asked , ` Do you think you and your guys are ready ? '' Armstrong recalled . `` I said it 'd be nice to have another month , but we 're in a race here and we had to take the opportunity when we had it . I had to say we are ready , we are ready to go . ''

`` I thought we had a 90 % chance of getting back safely to Earth on that flight , but only a 50-50 chance of making a successful landing on the first attempt . ''

Armstrong also details the crew 's harrowing 12-minute descent to the moon , when he realized that the Eagle lunar module 's auto-pilot was preparing to land the crew on the slope of a huge moon crater .

`` The computer showed us where it intended to land , and it was a very bad location , on the side of a large crater about 100-150m in diameter with very steep slopes covered with very large boulders -- not a good place to land at all , '' he said .

Armstrong took over the craft manually and managed to land it like a helicopter in a smoother area to the west with just 20 seconds of fuel left . `` Houston , Tranquility Base here . The Eagle has landed , '' were Armstrong 's words to mission control on earth .

As for `` That 's one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind , '' Armstrong says he did n't think of those immortal words until after they 'd landed safely .

The first few moments when Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the Eagle and onto the surface of the moon were tender , he remembers .

`` We recognized that we would n't have been there if it had n't been for our competitors in the Soviet Union -- it was a competition that made both of our programs able to do what we achieved . We put medallions for our fallen colleagues on both sides , and that was a tender moment . ''

Armstrong laughed off the conspiracy theorists who believe the 1969 moon landing was faked , telling CPA Australia 's Malley that `` 800,000 staff at NASA could n't possibly keep a secret . ''

`` People love conspiracy theories , but it was never a concern to me -- because I know one day someone 's going to go fly back up there and pick up that camera I left , '' he said .

As for the future direction of space travel , Armstrong worries about cuts to NASA 's budget , and says the space program remains an important source of motivation for young Americans .

NASA 's 2013 budget for the exploration of Mars was cut by 38 % , and the budget for planetary exploration overall was reduced by $ 300 million -- a major concern , according to Armstrong .

`` NASA 's been one of the most successful public investments in motivating students to do well and achieve all they can achive , and it 's sad that we are turning the program in a direction where it will reduce the amount of motivation it provides to young people . ''
