-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- African American Jesse Owens remains the most iconic Olympian of them all .

Owens defied Hitler by winning four gold medals in Berlin in 1936 .

Although there have been more successful athletes in Olympic history , Owens ' four gold medals at the Nazi-dominated 1936 Berlin Games earned him a unique place in the sporting hall of fame .

Born James Cleveland Owens -- he was nicknamed Jesse by a school teacher -- he was the son of a sharecropper and grandson of slaves .

Despite suffering from chronic bronchial problems as a child , he excelled as a high school athlete , and attracted national attention in May 1935 when , at a Big Ten athletics meet in Ann Arbor , Michigan , he set three world records and tied a fourth , all in the space of an hour .

It was the Olympic Games of the following year , however , that secured Owens ' place in popular mythology .

Held in the German capital , Hitler had intended the Xlth Olympiad to stand as a testament to the racial superiority of white Aryan athletes , openly denigrating Afro-American performers as `` non-humans . ''

In one of the greatest sporting rebuffs of all time , Owens -- one of 18 black athletes on the U.S. team -- duly won four gold medals in the 100 meters , 200 meters , long jump and 4x100 meters relay .

His 100 meters time of 10.3 seconds equaled the Olympic record , while his performances in the 200 meters and long jump -- 20.7 seconds and 8.06 meters respectively -- set new world records .

The 39.8 seconds recorded by U.S. 4x100 meters team also set a world record , one that stood for 20 years .

Although the Nazi press was openly scathing , condemning the U.S. team 's use of ` black auxiliaries ' , the German spectators recognized Owens ' achievement and gave him a standing ovation .

The first person to congratulate him after his long jump victory was German silver medallist Luz Long .

`` It took a lot of courage for him to befriend me in front of Hitler , '' Owens later commented .

`` You can melt down all the medals and cups I have and they would n't be a plating on the 24-carat friendship I felt for Long at that moment . ''

Ticker-tape parade

Owens returned to the U.S. a hero . Despite that , he was unable to escape the racial prejudice and segregationism of his fellow countrymen .

Although he received a New York ticker tape parade , he was forced to ride in a freight elevator to a reception in his honor at the Waldorf Astoria .

`` Although I was n't invited to shake hands with Hitler , '' he said , `` I was n't invited to the White House to shake hands with the President , either . ''

He failed to attract the endorsements and sponsorship deals enjoyed by white athletes , and was reduced to running exhibition races against dogs and horses to make ends meet .

It was not until the 1950s , 20 years after his Berlin triumph , that he finally achieved a measure of financial security , opening a public relations firm and becoming a highly successful public speaker .

In 1976 he received the Medal of Freedom , the highest civilian honor the U.S. can bestow , and in 1990 , a decade after his death from lung cancer , President George Bush awarded him a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor .

In perhaps the most fitting memorial to his achievements , a street in Berlin was renamed in his honor in 1984 .
