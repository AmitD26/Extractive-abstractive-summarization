Two weeks before he tested positive for Ebola in Liberia , American journalist Ashoka Mukpo talked about the bleak situation there .

`` Man oh man , I have seen some bad things in the last two weeks of my life , '' he posted on Facebook last month from the Liberian capital of Monrovia .

`` How unpredictable and fraught with danger life can be . How in some parts of the world , basic levels of help and assistance that we take for granted completely do n't exist for many people . ''

The 33-year-old freelance cameraman for NBC News started feeling achy and tired Wednesday , and he quarantined himself . A day later , a test at a Doctors Without Borders facility in Monrovia confirmed that he had Ebola .

Anxious parents

Mukpo was among a team working with Dr. Nancy Snyderman , the agency 's chief medical correspondent .

In an interview with NBC 's `` Today '' show Friday , his mother said he 'll leave for the United States on Sunday . NBC News has said the entire team will return aboard a private charter plane .

`` The enormous anxiety I have as a mother ... is the delay between now and him leaving on Sunday , '' Diana Mukpo said . `` The State Department has been fantastic . They 've been compassionate . I can only hope and pray that his symptoms do n't worsen . ''

Mukpo 's father told the `` Today '' show that although he is able to walk around and has only a mild fever , his son is worried .

`` Obviously , he is scared ... he has been filming what 's happening in Liberia for two weeks and seeing the death and tragedy , '' Dr. Mitchell Levy said . `` And now it 's really hit home for him . But his spirits are better today . ''

Sick a day after he was hired

NBC News hired him Tuesday , and Snyderman said she 'd worked with him for only a few hours when he started feeling sick .

`` My suspicion is that he was infected before we met him and then he became symptomatic once we met him , '' Snyderman said Friday on the `` Today '' show . `` The amount of virus in his body is low . We should have a very good prognosis . ''

Before working for NBC , he wrote for a series of other international media , including Al Jazeera and Vice News .

His passion for Liberia comes through in his work , which makes references to visits to the nation dating years ago .

`` He spent two years in Monrovia working with a nongovernmental organization , and really made a strong connection to the Liberian people , and ... wanted to go back and see if he could make a difference , '' Levy said .

Team to be put in isolation

The rest of the medical team does not have any symptoms , but when the team members return to the U.S. , they will be quarantined for 21 days -- the disease 's incubation period -- as a precaution .

The cameraman is believed to be the fourth American stricken by the disease while in Liberia .

Dr. Kent Brantly , Nancy Writebol and Dr. Rick Sacra all contracted the disease while working in the country .

All three recovered after they were evacuated from Liberia and treated at hospitals in Atlanta and Omaha , Nebraska .

Ebola has killed more than 3,000 people in Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone , and the United Nations says those numbers are vastly under-reported .
