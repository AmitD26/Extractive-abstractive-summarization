Elliot Rodger left behind a 107,000-word `` story '' of what the shooting suspect called his `` twisted world . '' While he e-mailed it to his parents and a therapist the day he allegedly went on a terror rampage , investigators and journalists soon found it .

The central theme of `` My Twisted World : The Story of Elliot Rodger '' is his intractable virginity , which he blamed on `` the cruelness of women . ''

Here are five revelations from this disturbing document :

1 . ` A bitter form of envy '

Elliot Rodger grew up on the edges of Hollywood but was not quite a part of it .

His father , Peter Rodger , aspired to make films , but he mostly directed commercials . His mother `` dated George Lucas for a short time '' and was a friend of Steven Spielberg 's , he wrote . His stepmother , Soumaya Akaaboune , acted in a few movies and was a regular on the French version of `` Real Housewives , '' produced in Los Angeles .

These connections got him into a few `` Star Wars '' premieres and the premiere on March 12 , 2012 , for the first installment of `` The Hunger Games , '' for which his father worked as a second-unit director .

Rodger wrote that the movie was `` entertaining '' and the premiere `` was an extraordinary experience , '' but he said he `` felt very bitter that I was n't able to bring a girl with me as a date . The majority of men at the event had a date with them , and I felt so pathetic for not having a date . If only a girl at my collage had been attracted to me ; I would have gladly brought her to the premiere as my date . ''

He attended a private Katy Perry concert the night before , thanks to wealthy friends who gave the tickets to the Rodger family . Elliot wrote about how seeing how rich families enjoy life made him resent that his `` damnable mother '' had not `` married into wealth instead of being selfish . ''

`` I could n't help but feel a bitter form of envy at all of the rich kids at the concert . They grew up in lavish mansions , indulged in excessive opulence , and will never have to worry about anything in their pleasurable , hedonistic lives . I would take great pleasure in watching all of those rich families burn alive . Looking at all of them really drilled in my mind the importance of wealth .

`` Wealth is one of the most important defining factors of self-worth and superiority . I hated and envied all of those kids for being born into wealth , while I had to struggle to find a way to claim wealth for myself . I had to be ruthless , and do whatever it takes to attain such wealth . After all , it was my only hope of ever being worthy of getting a girlfriend and living the life of gratification that I desire . ''

Rodger lamented being `` a kissless virgin . ''

2 . ` Love Potion # 9 ' advice

Dale Launer , who wrote and directed several movies about relationships , tried to teach Rodger how to get a girlfriend , according to Rodger 's writing . Launer , a friend of Rodger 's father , wrote `` Blind Date , '' `` Love Potion # 9 '' and `` Ruthless People . ''

`` He wanted to help me overcome my troubles because he is a so-called expert with women . He even showed me pictures of all of the gorgeous women he has dated in his life , and there were a lot of them . This man truly lived .

`` A few men who are successful with women have offered me help and advice about this in the past , but nothing ever came of it . I suppose they want to help because it would be a boost to their already big egos , and also because they feel sorry for me . People should feel sorry for me . My life is so pathetic , and I hate the world for forcing me to suffer it . I feel sorry for myself .

`` In truth , there is nothing men like Dale can really do to help me attract girls and lose my virginity . They ca n't mind-control girls to be attracted to me . My brief friendship with Dale would , however , spark a few more interesting e-mail conversations where I confide to him about how cruel I think women are by nature . He would only be amused by this . Of course he would be amused . Women were never cruel to him . They gave him sex and love all his life . ''

CNN e-mailed Launer 's rep for comment Sunday evening but has not heard back yet .

3 . Winning a lottery : ` The only way out '

Rodger became convinced that winning the Megamillions lottery was his destiny . He began obsessively playing it and even drove to Arizona from California four times to buy Powerball tickets . `` I saw winning the lottery as the only way out , '' he wrote .

`` I knew I was always destined for great things . This must be it ! I was destined to be the winner of the highest lottery jackpot in existence . I knew right then and there that this jackpot was meant for me . Who else deserved such a victory ? I had been through so much rejection , suffering , and injustice in my life , and this was to be my salvation . With my whole body filled with feverish hope , I spent $ 700 dollars on lottery tickets for this drawing . As I spent this money , I imagined all the amazing sex I would have with a beautiful model girlfriend I would have once I become a man of wealth . ''

Grieving father after rampage : ` When will this insanity stop ? '

After repeatedly not winning the lottery , Rodger saw that his plan for his `` Day of Retribution '' against the world `` was more real than ever before . ''

`` Without the prospect of becoming wealthy at a young age , I had nothing to live for now . I was going to be a virgin outcast forever . I realized that I had to start planning and preparing for the Day of Retribution , even though I had n't yet had any idea of what day that would be . ''

4 . Rodger 's three guns

Rodger began practicing shooting at a gun range in Oxnard , California , after failing to win the $ 120 million Megamillions lottery in September 2012 , according to his writing .

`` I had the knowledge , in the back of my mind , that the Day of Retribution was very possible now . Going to the shooting range while I waited for my laptop gave me the perfect opportunity to gain some initial training in shooting guns , which will be the main weapons I use as vengeance against my enemies when the Day of Retribution ultimately comes to pass .

`` I walked into the range , rented a handgun from the ugly old redneck cashier , and started to practice shooting at paper targets . As I fired my first few rounds , I felt so sick to the stomach . I questioned my whole life , and I looked at the gun in front of me and asked myself ` What am I doing here ? How could things have led to this ? ' I could n't believe my life was actually turning out this way . There I was , practicing shooting with real guns because I had a plan to carry out a massacre . ''

Rejection , jealousy and vow to kill ` beautiful girls '

His first `` act of preparation '' for the massacre was the purchase of his first gun , he wrote .

`` I had already done some research on handguns , and I decided to purchase the Glock 34 semiautomatic pistol , an efficient and highly accurate weapon . I signed all of the papers and was told that my pickup day was in mid-December . That fell in nicely , because that was when I was planning on staying in Santa Barbara till . After I picked up the handgun , I brought it back to my room and felt a new sense of power . I was now armed . ''

He bought his second handgun in the spring of 2013 , when he `` began to seriously think about planning the Day of Retribution , '' he wrote .

He bought a third gun a year later . `` I needed to buy a third handgun , just in case one of them jams . I needed two working handguns at the same time , as that was how I planned to commit suicide ; with two simultaneous shots to the head . I also needed to buy magazine clips and ammunition , as well as knives and carrying cases for my equipment . ''

5 . Vengeance against men

Rodger wrote that the `` first phase '' of his massacre plan would be to stab his two male roommates to death .

`` These were the biggest nerds I had ever seen , and they were both very ugly with annoying voices , '' he wrote . `` If they were pleasant to live with , I would regret having to kill them , but due to their behavior I now had no regrets about such a prospect . In fact , I 'd even enjoy stabbing them both to death while they slept . ''

`` After that , I will start luring people into my apartment , knock them out with a hammer , and slit their throats . I will torture some of the good looking people before I kill them , assuming that the good looking ones had the best sex lives . All of that pleasure they had in life , I will punish by bringing them pain and suffering . I have lived a life of pain and suffering , and it was time to bring that pain to people who actually deserve it . ''

The Santa Barbara County Sheriff 's Office identified the three men found dead in Rodger 's apartment as Cheng Yuan Hong , 20 ; George Chen , 19 ; and Weihan Wang , 20 . Hong and Chen were his roommates , while Wang was visiting the apartment , the sheriff 's office said . The three students died from `` multiple stab wounds '' before the shooting rampage , the sheriff 's office said .
