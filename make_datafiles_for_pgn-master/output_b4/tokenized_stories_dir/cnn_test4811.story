Yaya Toure has retained his title as African Player of the Year after fighting off the challenge of Didier Drogba .

The 29-year-old , who helped guide Manchester City to the English Premier League title last season , enjoyed a stunning year with the club .

The Ivorian , who overcame fellow countryman Drogba and Cameroon 's Alex Song , was obviously touched after being confirmed as the winner .

`` I have a lot of emotion , '' he said after getting onto the stage in Accra , Ghana . `` I think this night is so special for me . ''

Drogba and Katongo lead nominations for African Player of Year

Toure scored six goals last season as City pipped rivals Manchester United to the title , while he also helped his country reach the final of the Africa Cup of Nations .

The 29-year-old has now equaled the achievements of Senegal 's El-Hadji Diouf by winning the award twice in a row .

But he will face a challenge to make it three on the bounce as Cameroon 's Samuel Eto'o did between 2003-2005 , before the Cameroon striker collected the award for a fourth time in 2010 .

Drogba seals big-money move

Former Chelsea star Drogba had been highly-fancied to win the award after his stellar year at Stamford Bridge .

The 34-year-old , now playing in China with Shanghai Shenhua , was an integral part of the team 's European Champions League triumph as well as its FA Cup success .

His equalizer in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich and his winning penalty kick led the club to its first every triumph in the competition .

But it was Toure , who helped City win its first league title in 44 years , who won the vote , with Song of Barcelona coming third .

`` Being in competition against Yaya and Alex was very difficult for me , '' Drogba told reporters . `` I do n't mind if Yaya wins . I 'm very proud . ''

Zambia win Africa Cup of Nations

Meanwhile , Zambia was named as the National Team of the Year following its incredible victory at the Africa Cup of Nations .

Manager Herve Renard took the Coach of the Year accolade after leading Zambia to the title following his side 's triumph over the Ivory Coast on penalties .

Egypt and Al Ahly midfielder Mohamed Aboutreika was named as African Player of the Year Based in Africa .

The 34-year-old collected the prize for the second time having also won it back in 2008 .
