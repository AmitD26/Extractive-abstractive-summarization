It 's been seven years since `` Team Aniston '' and `` Team Jolie '' T-shirts were flying off the shelves . Now , with rings on their fingers , it seems both women have moved on , yet the saga continues .

Many people are referencing Brangelina in the wake of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux 's engagement . And if countless headlines like , `` Anything Brad can do ! As Pitt set to wed Angelina Jolie , ex-wife Jennifer Aniston announces her engagement ... '' are any indication , the media has no intention of giving up on the love triangle .

Even CNN commenters have taken sides , perpetuating a fictitious -LRB- we imagine -RRB- rivalry between the actresses .

Opinion : We care that Aniston 's getting married . Why ?

`` Brad so traded down ... Congrats Jenn & Justin I hope you all beat the odds and live happily ever after , '' commenter Wilder Napalm wrote .

Some commenters ' well wishes were masked by unkind words for Jolie : `` She 's the underdog ! we always root for the underdog . Brad Pitt left her for a puffy lipped bomb shell ! She got dumped ! plus the entire world talked about it . . So you Go Jen ! '' james648 wrote .

Aniston has also received her fair share of flak : `` Something must be wrong with her , Brad dropped her like a bad habit . ''

So why continue picking sides ?

`` We like to take sides on everything , '' said Fraser Ross , who owns Kitson , a boutique that sold Team Aniston and Team Jolie shirts back in 2005 . `` The thing with Jen is that she was in peoples ' living rooms for -LRB- 10 -RRB- years . ... People felt like they were one of her friends ... whereas Angelina was n't in our living rooms . ''

That might be why Team Aniston shirts sold faster than Team Jolie shirts , Ross said , adding , `` It was 25 to one at the beginning . ''

But do n't feel bad for Jolie just yet . Her fans have since shown support by purchasing `` Adopt Me Angelina '' paraphernalia .

`` My guess is that most people on Team Jolie would not be focusing on the fact that Brad Pitt left Jennifer Aniston for her , '' said James C. Kaufman , a professor of psychology at California State University at San Bernardino and editor of the APA journal of Psychology of Popular Media Culture . `` They 're more seeing Jolie as this strong independent single woman who is both happily -LRB- engaged -RRB- and successful in her career and doing all this stuff with the travel and the charity and these generally positive things . ''

`` Team Aniston , '' Kaufman added , `` more identifies with the girl next-door side who has been screwed over by her man . ''

Even though both women are engaged , Ross said he does n't anticipate any `` Mrs. Pitt '' or `` Mrs. Theroux '' T-shirts .

`` We do n't want to dig up the past , '' he said .

Some CNN commenters , like Kkkkatie , echoed his sentiment : `` I do n't condone cheaters -LRB- if that is what happened with Brad and Angelina , who REALLY knows -RRB- but what I do know is that life is too short to stay in an unhappy marriage . I think it 's absurd that the public want to paint Jen as this ` wronged ' woman for the rest of her life . My God folks , lets just move on and let it go ! ''
