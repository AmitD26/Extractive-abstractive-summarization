-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A federal judge declared a mistrial Monday in the case of two U.S. security contractors accused of killing two Afghanistan civilians .

The jury in the case against Christopher Drotleff and Justin Cannon told Judge Robert Doumar that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict .

A retrial has been scheduled for March 1 , 2011 .

Drotleff and Cannon worked as security contractors for a subsidiary of Xe , the military contracting firm formerly known as Blackwater Worldwide .

Each were charged with two counts of second-degree murder and one count of attempted murder in connection with a May 2009 shooting in Kabul , Afghanistan .

The 12-count , 19-page indictment returned by a federal grand jury in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia also included weapons charges against the two men .

Trey Robert Kelleter , the attorney for Drotleff , expressed disappointment with Monday 's mistrial declaration in the federal court in Norfolk , Virginia .

`` We thought the evidence showed Chris had acted in self defense , '' Kelleter said . `` It is a real hardship on his family . ''

Kelleter said his client remained in custody pending a detention hearing scheduled for Wednesday . According to Kelleter , a retrial is likely because of the deadlocked jury .

Peter Carr , the spokesman for the U.S. Attorney 's office , declined to comment .

Both Drotleff and Cannon were in Afghanistan working for the security company Paravant -- a subsidiary of Xe -- to help the U.S. Army train Afghan troops .

Drotleff , Cannon and two other contractors , Steven McClain and Armando Hamid , were driving their interpreters on a busy Kabul street called Jalalabad Road on May 5 , 2009 , when they said a car slammed into one of their two cars .

The men said they got out to help their colleagues , and the vehicle that had struck the car did a U-turn and headed back at them .

The contractors said they fired at the oncoming vehicle in self-defense .

The incident spotlights the issue of the role and conduct of U.S. security contractors in Afghanistan .

A similar issue arose in Iraq after a September 2007 confrontation involving then-Blackwater contractors that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead .

Blackwater lost its contract there after Iraq 's government refused to renew its operating license . The company then changed its name to Xe , and it continues to receive multimillion-dollar contracts in Afghanistan .
