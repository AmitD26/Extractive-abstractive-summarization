Charles Smith insisted Sunday that the former NBA players who went to North Korea for a basketball diplomacy trip , led by Dennis Rodman , were n't paid by the repressive regime .

`` Absolutely not . I think I am astute enough to understand the dynamics , especially collecting monetary dollars from North Korea . No , we did not get paid from North Korea at all , '' he told CNN in a lengthy exclusive interview on `` New Day Sunday . ''

Smith , who retired from the NBA in 1997 after nine seasons , said an Irish online betting company and a documentary film crew paid expenses for the ex-players turned hoops ambassadors .

Last month the Irish company , Paddy Power , said it had removed its name from Rodman 's project after the execution of Kim 's uncle and top aide , Jang Song Thaek . But it said it would honor its `` contractual commitments '' to the team .

Speaking by satellite from Beijing , Smith said it was n't about the money . He saw it as an opportunity to go to a reclusive country and exchange cultural information with other athletes and citizens . But he did n't see it as a birthday present for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .

`` That 's the date that was set . I did n't know it was his birthday , '' he said in the half-hour interview . `` And it did n't matter to me once I found out that it was his birthday . ''

Smith said he felt for Rodman , who asked for his help organizing the trip and who really seemed to want to pull off a big event .

`` I saw the pressure mount . I saw him change , and it was very difficult keeping him and everyone together -LRB- once controversy began over traveling to North Korea -RRB- , '' he said .

Rodman arrived at Beijing airport on a flight from Pyongyang on Monday morning , the last of the team 's players to leave North Korea .

The players ' trip also met with criticism because North Korea still holds Kenneth Bae , a U.S. citizen who was arrested in November 2012 , convicted last spring by Pyonyang of `` hostile acts '' intended to topple the government , and sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp . Some questioned whether the players would advocate for his release , but they did n't -- at least not publicly .

`` We did n't go there for that . We went there to do what we normally do , and that 's to be cross-cultural ambassadors and use the game of basketball as a bridge for exchange , '' he said .

Smith said the difference between this trip and other sports exchanges was that the players were n't sent as representatives of the United States .

`` We 're athletes doing it ourselves , '' he said .

When celebrity meets brutality

Smith said he has no regrets about going . He said he was able to meet some North Korean citizens and even came across one man who winced before shaking the hand of the first African-American he had ever met . Smith said the man told him they did n't have a very good view of African-Americans . The man rubbed his hand as if the color would come off , Smith said .

`` Then the next day after we talked for a while , he came up to me and said he was sorry , '' Smith said .

The former NBA player , who now travels frequently as a basketball ambassador , said he did n't go to any areas where people are hungry .

Smith also swapped sports stories with North Korea 's sports minister and basketball players from the national team . He thinks that will be a positive outcome from the trip .

`` We accomplished a relationship on the sports side in North Korea , '' he said . `` Where it goes from there , I do not know at this point in time . But we established a relationship . They 've asked us to come back . Whether we go back or not , I 'm not sure . I do n't know . But there was a relationship established between a group of individuals in two different countries that do n't communicate . ''
