-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- According to the Obama administration , the fact that Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab boarded a plane for the United States with potentially exploding underwear was caused by a systemic failure in intelligence . That 's true . In the same way that an auto accident is caused by two cars crashing together .

Saying the system failed is merely describing what happened , and Obama 's plan will do nothing to address the underlying problem . The real problem is what we need to be talking about , not just because it 's at the core of our intelligence crisis , but because it 's the same problem that broke our economy , made health care unaffordable and hobbled the U.S. auto industry .

And unless the Obama Administration gets smart about dealing with this larger problem , and fast , our skies wo n't be safer any time soon .

The problem is organizational culture . As Peter Drucker , the late father of modern management , said : `` Culture eats strategy for breakfast . '' Culture says it 's OK to not think creatively about how a lead might connect to other information . Culture says that following up on leads eventually is soon enough . Culture says that doing what 's in our job description is `` good enough for government work . ''

Obama 's plan to fix the intelligence system boils down to integrate the components , clarify roles and responsibilities , add additional steps to the screening process , invest in newer technology , deploy more air marshals and work cooperatively with other governments . None of these actions will do one thing to effect people 's relationships with each other and with their work , which is the essence of culture .

Let 's be honest . When we go through a Transportation Security Administration line in the United States , we 're not blown away by organizational brilliance . We see people plodding through the same steps , in the same way , often doing the minimum to not get fired . -LRB- That 's not to say that all TSA cultures are that bad ; a few are quite effective . -RRB-

Most people assume that the culture in the intelligence community is better . Actually , the odds are against it . In a study of 24,000 people published in 2008 in Tribal Leadership , John King , Halee-Fischer-Wright and I found that 25 percent of workplace cultures are as stupid as our worst TSA experiences . These groups express a `` my life stinks '' view and show almost no innovation , initiative or ownership -- precisely the behaviors necessary to reform our intelligence systems .

Even more frightening , 48 percent of organizational cultures express the view that `` I 'm great -LRB- and you 're not -RRB- '' . People in these workplaces rise to the challenge , but as individuals , not as groups . Star performers hoard information , work on outshining each other and act with the real goal of advancing themselves . They hoard information , build silos and erect walls between groups .

So imagine these two cultures -- accounting for about three out of four workplaces -- responding to Obama 's plan to reform the intelligence system .

People in `` my life stinks '' cultures will react by rolling their eyes , making sarcastic jokes and looking at their watches . Nothing will change .

People in `` I 'm great '' cultures will respond that the problems are easily solved as long as everyone gets behind their plan . The problem is , everyone is advancing their own ideas , and ultimately , their own careers . -LRB- Sound like Congress ? -RRB-

As a consultant who logs almost as many miles as the George Clooney character in `` Up In The Air '' and a scholar of organizational performance , I 've hoped that the Obama Administration 's reaction would focus on the heart of the problem , that the agencies and organizations that we rely on have stupid workplace cultures . I 'm not saying the people involved are stupid . I 'm saying the culture makes people stupider than they really are .

-LRB- And while we 're on the subject , `` my life stinks '' is the dominant culture in the U.S. auto industry , which is why it failed in the first place . And `` I 'm great '' cultures run Wall Street , which is why greed went unchecked until it became pathological . -RRB-

Until we target culture as the issue , all we 're accomplishing with systemic fixes is the illusion of action .

No amount of Obama-style fixes will make a stupid culture any smarter , and remember , culture eats strategy -- and systems -- for breakfast .

In his press conference , President Obama said , `` Ultimately , the buck stops with me . When the system fails , it is my responsibility . '' The question is : Why is no one taking responsibility for the cultures that produce these failures ?
