Italian football club Lazio must play their opening home game of the season with a section of their fans banned from the match as punishment for racial abuse .

Organisers of Italy 's top-flight championship Serie A said in a statement that it had found Lazio fans guilty of `` shouts and chants expressive of racial discrimination against three players of the opposing team '' during the Italian Supercup final Sunday .

The match , which was won 4-0 by defending Serie A champions Juventus , was held at Lazio 's Olympic Stadium in Rome .

League chiefs said Lazio supporters in the Curva Nord stand twice directed sustained abuse at the players involved in the traditional Serie A curtain raiser .

As punishment , that section of the ground will now be closed for Lazio 's match against Udinese on 25 August .

France midfielder Paul Pogba was one of the Juventus players targeted by abuse by some of Lazio 's more hardcore supporters .

He told the French news agency AFP : `` What can I do ? I 'm alone against 30,000 fans . They do that even though there are blacks in their team .

`` It 's also a lack of respect towards their own players .

`` It 's really not nice to come to a football match and hear those sort of things but I 'm a player , I concentrate on my job . ''

Italian football has been plagued by racist discrimination , with the sport 's authorities struggling to eradicate the problem despite repeated efforts .

In June the Italian Football Federation brought in new rules allowing referees to stop matches and warn fans about their behavior , while players and clubs could potentially face tougher sanctions .

Last season Lazio fans were found guilty of racist behaviour by Uefa four times .

Following Sunday 's Supercup final , Juventus and Lazio were also both fined by 5,000 euros after fans lit flares in the stands .
