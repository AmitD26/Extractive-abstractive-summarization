Manama , Bahrain -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- People prayed and demonstrated late Thursday outside a Manama hospital , where scores had come for treatment following a pre-dawn raid by government forces on an encampment of protesters that left at least four dead .

Army vehicles , meanwhile , were patrolling the streets of Bahrain 's capital . They filled the void left by government security forces , who hours earlier had stormed protesters gathered in Pearl Roundabout , a landmark circle in the city center .

The throngs congregated Thursday night near the Salmaniya Medical Complex and chanted , `` With our blood and our souls , we will fight for the martyrs , '' voicing their resolve in the face of a government clampdown that has elicited sharp criticism in Bahrain and internationally .

Six people have died since protesters took to the streets Monday demanding reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy . The tiny but strategically critical island nation of Bahrain is an American ally and houses the headquarters of the U.S. Navy 's Fifth Fleet .

Those killed in the Pearl Roundabout raid included Ali Abdullah , a 22-year-old who went to the protests with his 20-year-old brother , his father told CNN . The college senior , majoring in engineering , died at the hospital Thursday from his injuries .

Ahmad Abdullah blamed Bahrain 's prime minister -- Prince Khalifa bin Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa , uncle of King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa who has held his position since 1971 -- for his son 's death , calling the leader a `` killer . ''

Witnesses described a blunt show of force by police firing pellets , rubber bullets and tear gas to force protesters out of the square , where thousands had been rallying and in some cases encamping throughout the week .

Zainab Farda said she was in a large tent for women and children with her two daughters , ages 6 and 8 , when they woke up to tear gas . She said they placed onions over their noses , but had to flee after security forces set fire to their tent .

`` After all that has happened , we are not going to quit , '' Farda said . `` If we quit now , we 're going to die . ''

Before word of the latest death , health minister Dr. Faisal Ben Yacoub Al Hamar said on state television that three people had died and at least 225 had been injured in the raid .

Bahrain is one of the latest countries in the Middle East and North Africa to face a surge of dissent following the revolts that toppled longtime autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt .

While Bahrain 's interior ministry said in a statement Wednesday that those responsible for the two earlier deaths had been detained , authorities on Thursday defended their actions at the Manama roundabout .

They said security forces used a minimum of force and found firearms , knives and flags of Hezbollah , a Lebanon-based group that the United States lists as a terrorist organization .

In a news conference , Foreign Minister Khalid al Khalifa claimed protesters had attacked disciplinary forces -- saying he was surprised that they had , given the available freedoms in Bahrain . He added he plans to raise the issue of what happened in Manama with the country 's king .

Al Khalifa also disputed an assertion that troops came from neighboring countries , insisting that all those involved are from Bahrain .

According to the state-run Bahrain News Agency , an interior ministry official said security forces evacuated the people after `` exhausting all opportunities for dialogue with them . ''

`` Some of them have responded and left quietly , while others refused to comply with the law , which called to intervene in order to disperse them , '' the official said .

Bahrain 's army asked citizens to `` distance themselves from gatherings in vital areas in the capital '' because it will `` create fear and shock '' and cause serious traffic disruptions .

But Ali Ahmed , 34 , who said he has slept at the square since Monday night , said the attack only emboldened demonstrators . He called claims that police had warned protesters to evacuate `` a lie . ''

Ahmed had been one of about 3,000 people who laid out blankets and pitched tents at Pearl Roundabout this week , with police nowhere to be seen at times .

But by the time police had completed their raid early Thursday , the circle was cleared of protesters and convoys of more than 50 military armored personnel carriers , each armed with machine guns , had driven into the area . Some of the trucks had razor wire .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon was among the international leaders who weighed in on Thursday , urging restraint and opposing government-led violence . He said that he is `` disturbed by the violent means used to disperse demonstrators . ''

The British Foreign Office confirmed Thursday it had temporarily closed its embassy in Bahrain . British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he spoke with his Bahrainian counterpart and stressed the `` need for peaceful action to address the concerns of protesters . ''

Jennifer Stride , a U.S. Fifth Fleet spokeswoman , said there 's no `` indication the protests will cause significant disruption '' for the U.S. military , which she said is not being targeted . The fleet has more than 30 ships , including the aircraft carriers USS Enterprise and USS Carl Vinson and their respective carrier strike groups

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said , meanwhile , that the United States has told Bahrain it has `` deep concerns '' about the crackdown on anti-government protesters and said the protesters ' funerals and Friday prayers should `` not be marred by violence . ''

`` We call on restraint from the government , to keep its commitment to hold accountable those who have utilized excessive force against peaceful demonstrators , and we urge a return to a process that will result in real , meaningful changes for the people there , '' Clinton said .

Bahrain 's king has asked Abdul Latif Bin Rashid Al Zayani -- a former major general who headed Bahrain 's public security for 10 years -- to be an unofficial envoy to the United States to deal with diplomatic fallout from the crisis , according to senior State Department officials and other sources familiar with the appointment .

Zayani was already in Washington holding meetings as the incoming leader of the Gulf Cooperation Council , and the king asked him to stay to talk with U.S. officials , the sources said . He met Thursday at the State Department with Under Secretary William Burns , Assistant Secretary Jeff Feltman and Dennis Ross , a White House adviser on the Middle East .

Still , the most significant political reaction may be within Bahrain itself . Hours after the crackdown at Pearl Roundabout , the Al Wefaq political party announced it had decided to withdraw from parliament , party official Abdul Jalil Khalil said .

Al Wefaq had been the most well represented party in the lower chamber of parliament , with 18 out of 40 seats .

Khalil , who has been head of the Al Wefaq parliamentary bloc , explained that the unrest is `` a turning point '' for the nation of about 1 million people . He noted that the casualty figures are `` large scale '' given the size of the population .

`` After what happened today , people are asking us to leave parliament . Quit the government , '' Khalil said .

Al Wefaq is a Shiite party in a country that , despite the fact two-thirds of its population are Shiites , is ruled by a Sunni Muslim royal family .

In recent years , younger Shiites have staged violent protests to complain about discrimination , high unemployment and corruption . Any Shiites say the country 's constitution has done little to improve their condition .

Barak Seener , a Middle East fellow at the Royal United Services Institute , a London-based think tank , said he thinks the party 's withdrawal will lead `` to the greater disenfranchisement of the Shia majority '' and that the upheaval is `` very , very dangerous '' for the United States .

`` It 's so important for the United States to have a friendly regime there , '' Seener said .

He emphasized that Bahrain `` has no choice but to clamp down '' and ca n't afford to `` blink '' amid the turmoil .

`` A disenfranchised Shia population is very dangerous because it has the ability to destabilize Bahrain and it also is vulnerable to Iranian penetration , '' he said . `` There 's been numerous cells of Shia terrorists that have been uncovered with extensive links to the Iranian regime . Iran uses them as a proxy to extend their sphere of influence . ''

Al Khalifa stressed to reporters Thursday that both Shiite and Sunni Muslims in the country are loyal and patriotic .

`` We belong to one homeland , '' he said .
