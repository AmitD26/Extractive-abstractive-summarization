A former prosecutor who declined to bring charges against Bill Cosby a decade ago said Wednesday that he wishes he could 've nailed the comedian on an allegation that he drugged and molested a woman at his Pennsylvania home .

Bruce Castor also told CNN that he believed Cosby -- a beloved figure who , with his wit and boyish smile , has charmed audiences as a family-friendly stand-up comic , the voice of Fat Albert , the host of `` Picture Pages '' and the star of a wildly popular eponymous sitcom -- lied to authorities .

In January 2004 , Andrea Constand , then a 31-year-old staffer for the women 's basketball team at Temple University , Cosby 's alma mater , was at the comedian 's Cheltenham , Pennsylvania , home when Cosby provided her medication that made her dizzy , she alleged the following year .

She later woke up to find her bra undone and her clothes in disarray , she further alleged to police in her home province of Ontario in January 2005 .

Cosby 's attorney in the case , Walter M. Phillips Jr. , called the allegations `` utterly preposterous '' and `` plainly bizarre '' at the time , yet in a civil filing , Constand 's lawyers said they had found 13 `` Jane Does '' with similar stories . Cosby settled the civil suit in 2006 .

The terms of the settlement were not disclosed , but when journalist and publicist Joan Tarshis came forward with another similar story this weekend , Cosby attorney John Schmitt denied her claim and others ' , labeling them `` decade-old , discredited allegations . '' Schmitt later amended that statement to say he was n't referring to Constand , who resolved her differences `` to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago . ''

` I could n't check her blood '

Castor , who was the district attorney for Montgomery County , Pennsylvania , when Constand came forward in 2005 , now tells CNN he thought Constand was credible , and he thought Cosby was evasive in his interview with prosecutors . Castor , whose assistants interviewed Cosby , said he felt the comedian was setting up a defense that Constand was at his house on her own volition and that anything occurring between them was consensual .

`` Back then , the desire on our part to move forward was pretty strong , '' he said . `` The problem with the case was she waited a year until she told police about it . ''

This left Castor no way to corroborate Constand 's allegations , he said . He could n't check her blood , urine , hair or fingernails for traces of drugs , he could n't obtain hair or fiber for analysis , and he could n't obtain a warrant to search Cosby 's home for evidence .

`` I had a theory that Cosby had drugged the woman using something to make her sleepy and to make her defenseless or unable to recall what happened , but because of the delay , I could n't check her blood , '' he said .

Of Cosby 's interview with prosecutors , Castor said , `` I thought he was lying . I thought he was evasive , and I thought that those things would be of value if I had another piece -LRB- of evidence -RRB- to go forward with . ''

The case would have come down to she said , he said , and while Castor felt strongly that Constand was telling the truth , her statements alone were not going to be enough to convict Cosby , the ex-prosecutor said .

`` Did I think he probably did something inappropriate ? Yes . Did I think that I could prove it beyond a reasonable doubt based on available , credible and admissible evidence ? No , I did n't , '' he said .

Castor released a statement on his office 's website in 2005 , saying that he found that `` insufficient credible and admissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be sustained beyond a reasonable doubt . '' Constand 's attorney filed the civil suit two weeks later .

Latest in line of accusations

Castor 's account comes a day after former supermodel Janice Dickinson became the latest of a handful of women to accuse the 77-year-old comic of sexual assault publicly . She told `` Entertainment Tonight '' that Cosby raped her in 1982 after giving her a pill and a glass of red wine during a dinner in Lake Tahoe .

`` The last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe , dropping his robe and getting on top of me . And I remember a lot of pain , '' she said .

Dickinson did not return a telephone call from CNN seeking comment , but Cosby has repeatedly said previous allegations are untrue . He has never been prosecuted .

His attorney , Martin Singer , addressed Dickinson 's allegations specifically in a statement , calling them a `` fabricated lie '' and saying they contradicted what she wrote in her autobiography and what she said during a 2002 New York Observer interview .

Since 2005 , several women have come forward with remarkably similar stories about being drugged and sexually assaulted by the comedian . This year , the accusations resurfaced , and earlier this month , a seemingly harmless post on Cosby 's Twitter account turned them into a social media storm .

After the accusations gained steam again , one of his accusers , Barbara Bowman , turned to the public once more with an article in The Washington Post and interviews with CNN . Bowman alleged she was drugged , then raped , though she said she never saw drugs .

`` I woke up out of a very confused state not in my clothes , '' she said .

On Saturday , NPR broadcast an awkward interview with Cosby in which he did n't utter a word when repeatedly asked about the accusations .

NPR host Scott Simon filled the airtime by saying Cosby was just `` shaking his head no . ''
