Al Qaeda gunmen killed at least two people Monday , including a French employee of the European Union 's mission to Yemen , in one of the latest acts of violence in the country 's capital after the government 's crackdown on the terror group , two high-level Yemeni government officials said .

The attack shows that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is responding to a weeks-long government offensive with `` open warfare , '' an official said on condition of anonymity .

`` AQAP is taking the battle to the capital , '' said the official , who was not authorized to speak to the media .

There was conflicting information about the nationalities of those who were killed Monday . Three Yemeni Interior Ministry officials said two French nationals died and another French national was injured . But the two high-level sources said a French national and a Yemeni security officer were killed , and a foreigner of an unconfirmed nationality was injured .

The victims were in a vehicle when gunmen blocked it and started shooting . The gunmen fired 20 bullets in the vehicle 's direction before fleeing in a pickup , a senior Interior Ministry official said .

The attack came more than two weeks after Yemen 's government launched a military offensive against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and amid an uptick in violence in the capital . Since Sunday , two military officers have been assassinated in Sanaa , authorities said .

Al Qaeda `` had threatened they would target government targets and foreign targets in the capital , '' the anonymous official said .

`` This military campaign has opened a Pandora 's box , and things will only get worse , but it had to happen , '' the official continued . `` This is a decisive battle , and either we win or they win . ''

The crackdown killed more than 60 suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen from April 19 to April 21 , Yemeni officials have said . Twelve more were killed Thursday , according to a high-level Yemeni government official .

Operations have included attacks by Yemeni commandos and suspected U.S. drone strikes , according to a Yemeni official .

U.S. Special Operations troops have played a role in the offensive , in part by flying Yemeni forces to a remote , mountainous spot in southern Yemen . But no Americans took part in combat , a U.S. official has said .

After Monday 's shooting , authorities set up checkpoints on roads leading to the building that houses the European Union mission to Yemen .

The French Foreign Ministry did n't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday .
