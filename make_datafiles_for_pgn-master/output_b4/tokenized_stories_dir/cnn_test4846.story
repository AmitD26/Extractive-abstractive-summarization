-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's an entirely preventable disease , and when diagnosed early , it 's easily treatable . Yet Malaria still claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year .

All it takes is a single mosquito bite and you can become infected . In 2012 , the tropical disease caused 627,000 deaths internationally , 90 % of them in sub-Saharan Africa . Ashley Uys , a South African biotechnologist-turned-enterpreneur , is hoping to bring that number down to zero .

Through his company Medical Diagnostic , Uys has developed a self-testing kit that can diagnose the disease in less than 30 minutes , and put sufferers on the path to recovery faster .

`` I decided to look at what is the most needing product in Africa at the moment . And malaria , malaria is big , '' says Uys .

`` I then decided to look at a malaria test that can actually show you the strain of malaria you have -- the type of malaria -- so -LRB- doctors -RRB- know which treatment to give you , and then also to see if the treatment is working or not . So I developed a test that can do all of that . ''

Merging science and business

The best think about Uys ' test is the price : they cost roughly 30 cents each , a fact Uys takes immense pride in .

`` The fact that -LRB- they are affordable -RRB- of course makes it more accessible to the public . For me . it is very satisfying to know that a farm worker in a rural area does n't have to worry about going to a doctor . Our product can be used at the point of care , '' he says .

`` You do n't need skilled labor to use it : prick -LRB- your finger -RRB- , run the test and wait for results . There 's a lot of diamonds in the rough -LRB- is Africa -RRB- , a lot of potential , and diseases and epidemics are killing off this potential . So it has a knock-on effect that is important . ''

Given Uys is only 30-years old , he 's achieved an incredible amount . Like many young entrepreneurs , he has drawn inspiration from his childhood and surroundings . Using this experience , Uys creates local solutions for everyday problems . For the Cape Town native , malaria prevention is just the beginning .

Saying ` No ' to drugs

Uys has turned his attention to another scourge affecting his community : Drug use .

`` On the Cape Flats , there was a big problem of drugs abuse , '' he recalls .

`` People abusing methamphetamine , et cetera . Fortunately for me , although I grew up on the Cape Flats where it 's very prevalent , I used sport to keep me away from bad habits and getting involved with the wrong crowd . ''

Now , as the founder of his own biotech company , Uys created a test capable of detecting a range of drugs , including amphetamines , benzyls , cocaine , methamphetamine , heroine and morphine . The idea first came to him when , following a survey of users , he identified the correlation between drug use and eye movement . Following this revelation , Uys had a light-bulb movement that would take his product development to the next level .

`` We get five to 10 megapixel cameras on mobile phones . I thought to myself : ` imagine developing an app for your phone where you can actually test your kids for drugs by using the flash as a light stimulus . The camera can capture the movement and calculate the speed of your eyes and action , or -LRB- tell -RRB- if they 're dilated or constricted . ''

Uys is still working on the prototypes for his Oculus ID pupil scanner , but he hopes the product will be ready to go into the market in coming weeks .

`` I 'm looking at innovation as the challenge for me . If you look at the first world countries it 's satisfying for me to see that we are innovating on that level or even better .

`` And me coming from Belhar , I did n't go to Harvard , did n't have a rich dad who could buy me what I wanted -- I had to work for everything . I had to work and study . I used to pack fish when I was a student . And that motivated me to work harder , '' he says .
