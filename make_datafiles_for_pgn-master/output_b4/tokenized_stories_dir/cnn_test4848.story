Kanye West has been called many things , but these days the best description -- according to him -- is family man .

The 36-year-old rapper appeared on Kris Jenner 's daytime talk show `` Kris '' on Friday to discuss his relationship with Jenner 's daughter , Kim Kardashian , and their new addition , North .

But if Kanye was smart , he 'd hire Jenner as part of his PR team . The reality TV momager , who has extended her family 's brand from E! to Fox with this test run of her talk show , reiterated several times that the stone-faced and difficult Kanye portrayed in the media is not the man she 's come to know . -LRB- Kanye , after all , is now living in her home . -RRB-

`` I 'm so excited that I 've gotten to know you like I have , '' Jenner said . `` There are a lot of things that people do n't know about you that are so interesting to me that I want other people to hear . ''

Kanye spoke about the effect of the birth on his outlook .

`` To me it 's such a blessing , and I feel like it 's going to give me the stability that I need to really create and really do God 's work in the way I should , '' Kanye , wearing a `` what would Jesus do '' bracelet , told Jenner .

`` Someone to be accountable , someone to be responsible for . After I lost my mother there were times I felt like I would put my life at risk , I felt like sometimes I did n't have something to live for . Now I have two really special people to live for , a whole family to live for . I want people , when they remember me and my family , their thought association to be someone who helped , someone who brought joy . ''

He did bring plenty of joy to Jenner 's show , as she beamed while displaying North 's photo for the audience . North , who was born June 15 , has her mother 's eyes and father 's cheeks , according to Jenner .

`` The thing I think about as a dad is just protection . That 's my only goal , to Kanye said his goal is `` to protect my daughter . That 's my instinct . ''

`` To give my daughter as many opportunities to just be a child . Of course , a big thing that plagues us is this idea of the paparazzi chasing a 5-year-old around and screaming at them . ... You have enough things to deal with and to learn being a new parent and you add that on top of it , and it becomes really intense . ''

According to Jenner , Kanye 's been into his girlfriend for a long , long time , and would even use Photoshop to draw himself into the yearly Kardashian-Jenner Christmas card . -LRB- Seriously -- Jenner showed proof . -RRB-

Although he could n't quite remember the first time he met Kardashian , 32 , Kanye did know it was love at first sight .

`` I 'm trying to remember if the first time we met was her being in the studio when she was Brandy 's assistant , and I think she brought us in , like , something to drink , '' he said . `` Or it might 've been when I was doing Brandy 's video and I remember asking my manager , ` Who is that girl right there ? ' ... I was in love with her before I even got to talk to her . ''

Kim , he said , was always someone he dreamed about being with , but more importantly , he feels that they 're `` equally yoked . ''

`` Being in the limelight , you have to have a match , or someone that 's equally yoked , '' he told Jenner . `` It 's difficult , because there 's people that you would date who would try to date you to maybe be more famous , or people who would want you to be less famous than you were , and just not accept who you are in life . And when I would be on the phone with her , even at my lowest moments , she 'd give me energy and remind me of who I was . And I needed that support at all times . ''

Kanye knows that there are those who think he and the Kardashian family would n't have much in common . But he 's trying to grow both spiritually -- `` I 'm a Christian , '' he said , `` That 's what 's important to me , that I grow and walk and raise my family with Christian values . ''

`` People feel that me and my girlfriend 's mother are of different brands in a way , '' he said . `` But it 's not about any of us being at odds , it 's about us helping each other and improving each other . I might be one of the only guys in the world that knows how to pick out a pair of shoes for a girl , but I have improvements that I need to make as a human being ... the way that I talk to people , being too sharp with people , or being too edgy . As a creative guy , sometimes it 's hard for me to small talk . ... And that 's something that -LRB- the Kardashian -RRB- family and Kim are teaching me , helping me to be a better person . ''

Given the negative press he 's had -- from that infamous mic-jacking at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards to more recent run-ins with the paparazzi -- does he have any regrets ? Not exactly .

While there are things he wishes he could change , he also believes that `` everything happened for a reason , and I 've grown from it , '' he said . `` I feel that I 'm very , very , very blessed , and with that comes great responsibility . With the way my parents raised me and the information that they gave me and this feeling that I have that I want to help , I think anything that could be considered a mistake will help me to make better decisions in the future .
