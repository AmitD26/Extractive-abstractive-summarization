-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There are plenty of country songs about how to be a man . One way is to face the music , and two country crooners did that on Thursday .

Ty Herndon and Billy Gilman came out as being gay .

Herdon went first , in interviews with People Magazine and Entertainment Tonight . His revelation inspired Gilman to do go public as well .

Gilman posted a message to YouTube , thanking Herndon for breaking the ice . He preferred telling his fans directly , from the comfort of home , to sitting down with the press , he said .

But an encounter with a journalist also prodded him to spill the beans before someone else did . The reporter bumped into Gilman in a public place and snapped a photo of him -- with his partner .

`` It was in that moment that I knew that I 'd rather it be from me than you reading it somewhere else , '' Gilman told fans . He also feared being ripped over his sexuality in an article .

Country and LGBTQ

In the genre of country , Thursday 's tune was a tough one to sing , Gilman said . `` Being a gay , male country artist is not the best thing . ''

At age 26 , he 's had a long career , having rocketed up the charts at age 11 with his then silky , pre-voice-change alto pipes , according to his biography on AllMusic.com .

But currently , he 's hitting snags .

Rumors about his sexual orientation have been going around , he said , and he thinks major music labels may have thumbed their noses at him over it .

`` I knew something was wrong when no major label wanted to sit down and have a meeting and listen to the new stuff , '' he said .

In his video , he turned directly to fans with his latest song , giving them a preview on his laptop of the music video to `` Say you Will , '' which is still in edit .

Facing fans on Monday

`` Today , I get to tell the world that I 'm an out , proud and happy gay man , '' he told `` People . '' But he 's worried how fans will take the news .

He may find out in just three days , when he performs at the `` Mother Church of Country Music , '' the Ryman Auditorium .

It 's home to the Grand Ole Opry .

Herndon is playing a Christmas charity bash for children in need along with Charlie Daniels , Phil Vassar , Andy Griggs and Jamie O'Neal .

The Ryman has said the concert would be sold out .

Herndon , 52 , is hopeful he wo n't face outrage , because he thinks attitudes are changing in the country scene .

Singer Chely Wright came out in 2010 and the open-minded Kacey Musgraves has a song titled `` Follow Your Arrow '' that was just named the Country Music Association song of the year .

`` I felt so proud of my city , '' he said . `` I hope that trend continues ; I pray it does . ''

Faith and fear

As a child , Herndon , a devout Christian , was stricken with fear over his sexual feelings .

`` I was 10 , sitting in church and horrified that I might be a homosexual . Whatever that word meant , I knew that I probably was one , '' Herndon told `` People . '' `` And I know there 's a lot of those kids still out there . Telling my story is an opportunity to help just one of them . ''

He started coming out to family members in his 20s . But the `` What Mattered Most '' singer , who had a number of hits in the 1990s , kept the news close to the vest .

It was n't until he attended a Tony Robbins seminar in 2009 that he decided to become more public , he told the magazine .

`` I realized I had an incredible story that could possibly help someone 's son or daughter or grandchild 's life not be as difficult as mine has been , '' he said . `` Maybe they would n't have to go through as much pain and suffering . It 's time to tell my truth . ''

Dropping hints ?

Some of the conflict between Herndon 's sexuality and his faith bled through a song he published last year -- `` Lies I Told Myself . '' A sign with the word `` Equality '' has the most prominent place in the music video .

`` Yeah , praying 's just a waste of time , so why even start , '' the last verse begins . `` The good Lord ai n't got time for guys like me . Forgiven 's something you wo n't ever be . ''

A handwritten sign appears in that verse . It reads , `` I 'm a sinner . ''

Herndon has since reconciled who he is with God , he said . He loves God , and God loves him back .

One of the lies he told himself , he said to `` Entertainment Tonight , '' was that he ca n't be gay and be in country music at the same time .

Now , he thinks that 's not true .
