Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan fully reversed his anti-abortion position and came out as pro-choice in an op-ed published on Tuesday .

`` I have come a long way since being a single , 26-year-old state senator , and I am not afraid to say that my position has evolved as my experiences have broadened , deepened and become more personal , '' Ryan wrote in the Akron Beacon Journal .

`` I have come to believe that we must trust women and families -- not politicians -- to make the best decision for their lives , '' he said .

After running for Congress on a pro-life platform in 2002 and initially voting with Republicans on the issue , Ryan , who is Catholic , has shifted leftward on abortion . In recent years , he 's drawn criticism from pro-life activists that once supported him for voting to protect public funding for Planned Parenthood and access to contraception .

Ryan wrote in the op-ed that his shift was inspired by conversations with women during his political career , but the move also puts him in a better position politically as he contemplates a potential 2016 challenge to Sen. Rob Portman , a Republican .

Ryan told Roll Call that `` we 're certainly looking very closely at '' a Senate run .

And while he 's won re-election to his heavily Democratic district with comfortable margins nearly every cycle since 2002 , Ryan 's pro-life stance could have been an obstacle for him in a Democratic Senate primary in the swing state .

Indeed , Portman himself has shifted on a key social issue since he was elected in 2010 with Tea Party support . He came out in favor of gay marriage in 2013 , also in a newspaper op-ed , citing his experience with his gay son as partial inspiration for the shift .

Ryan , however , dismissed speculation that his change of heart was politically motivated .

`` I realize that people can be cynical about politics and think this is something tied to a Senate aspiration , '' Ryan told the Plain Dealer . `` The reality is , this is just where my heart is right now . I want to be clear about that . I would be abandoning my own conscience and my own judgment if I somehow led people to believe I was supporting a position I no longer thought was the appropriate position to have . ''
