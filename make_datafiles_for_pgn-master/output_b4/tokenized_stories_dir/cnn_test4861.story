`` E.T. '' may have soared in the movies . But as a video game , it was an epic turkey .

When electronics pioneer Atari rushed a game based on the 1982 Hollywood blockbuster to market for its then-dominant home consoles , it was a flop , compounded by the fact that the infant industry was hitting its first slump at the time .

So Atari literally buried the project , dumping truckloads of unsold games in a desert landfill in New Mexico . And amid a decade of entertainment-industry disasters bookended by the movie `` Heaven 's Gate '' and Milli Vanilli , the `` E.T. '' game quickly faded into urban legend .

`` Riiiight , '' you say .

No , really . And over the weekend , with a couple of hundred onlookers watching , excavators led by a documentary film crew began to unearth stacks of 30-year-old Atari cartridges from a landfill outside Alamogordo .

`` Urban legend CONFIRMED , '' Larry Hryb , one of the creators of Microsoft 's Xbox gaming platform , reported via Twitter from the dig site . Microsoft 's Xbox Entertainment Studios is one of the backers of the planned documentary , tentatively titled `` Atari : Game Over . '' Hryb also tweeted a photo of the first cartridge to be dug out .

Not so fast , Atari historian Curt Vendel said Monday . `` E.T. '' cartridges were just one of more than 20 titles found over the weekend , and may not make up more than a fifth of the estimated 700,000-plus units the ailing Atari discarded in 1983 , he said . As far as he 's concerned , the great `` E.T. '' caper remains `` a myth . ''

`` This was a write-off dump , '' said Vendel , the co-author of a 2012 book on the company . Atari was being hit from all sides by a saturated market for arcade games , competition from other companies making games for its famous 2600 console and by a large volume of returns from retailers -- a problem it had never before faced and was n't prepared to handle .

`` Poor sales , the video game crash , ` E.T. 's ' not a great game -- the whole thing kind of snowballs together , and then you find Atari is dumping cartridges in the desert , '' he said . `` That 's how this whole myth kind of self-generated . ''

One of those on hand at the landfill Saturday was Howard Scott Warshaw , the game 's designer . When excavators started to retrieve the first of what may be hundreds of thousands of copies of his misbegotten baby , `` Everybody went nuts , '' Warshaw said .

`` I 've been carrying this thing , the theoretically worst video game of all time , for 30 years now , '' he said . `` It was a game that was done in five weeks . It was a very brief development . I did the best that I could , and that 's OK . ''

But seeing the cartridges emerge from the desert dust was a rush for Warshaw , who 's now a Silicon Valley psychotherapist .

`` Something that I did 32 years ago is still creating joy and excitement for people , '' he said . `` That 's a tremendously satisfying thing for me now . ''

Today 's Atari , which still sells games but no longer makes its own platforms , did not respond to a request for comment Sunday . The original company folded in 1984 , and several successive companies have bought the name , Vendel said .

`` E.T '' was rushed to stores in time for Christmas 1982 , hobbled not only by its short development time but by a license and royalty agreement that promised the film 's director , Steven Spielberg , $ 21 million , Vendel said . The company needed to sell out of the 5 million units it produced to break even ; it sold about 3.5 million by the following fall , he said .

By that time , Atari was collapsing . About the time `` E.T. '' hit the shelves , a poor and badly delayed earnings report spooked investors , `` and everybody started running to go sell , '' Vendel said . At its peak , it employed about 11,000 people ; it was shedding employees by the thousands in 1983 , and had only about 900 left by the time it closed down .

`` They were just cutting the meat off the bone , '' he said .

And so in 1983 , the company dumped 14 truckloads of merchandise from its service center in El Paso , Texas , in the Alamogordo landfill , about 90 miles away , Vendel said . To keep scavengers from reselling them , the cartridges were covered by a layer of concrete .

None of the `` E.T. '' cartridges unearthed over the weekend was playable , Warshaw said . But he said there may be as many as 750,000 of them in the landfill , with many successful titles mixed in with the `` E.T. '' games .

`` It was the end of the first product life cycle , and nobody really knew what they were doing , '' Warshaw said . Now , manufacturers are designing their next systems even as their new ones start shipping to stores .

`` It was a very wacky company , but that 's one of the things that made it amazing place to work , '' said Warshaw , who 's come to embrace the game 's infamy .

`` I do n't really believe it 's one of the worst games ever , but I really like it when people identify it that way , '' Warshaw told CNN . And because he also designed of one of Atari 's best-rated games , `` Yars ' Revenge , '' he said , `` I have the greatest range of any game designer in history . ''
