-LRB- CNN -RRB- CNN Senior International Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh spent two days in the Kobani , Syria , covering the heavy fighting between Kurdish forces and ISIS militants that has devastated the city . Thousands of civilians still live in the city , either unwilling or unable to flee .

Paton Walsh described his experiences -- including meeting a group of children who played in a makeshift graveyard and hid under cushions to protect themselves from ISIS shelling -- in an ask me anything chat on Reddit .

Here are the highlights from the hourlong conversation . Some of the posts have been edited for grammar and clarity .

Q : `` I 'm sure you saw and experienced a lot of devastating things in your time over there . What was the most heartbreaking thing you saw ? Do you think outside/foreign involvement over there is having more of a positive or negative impact on the people ? '' asked smedynski .

Paton Walsh : `` The kids in their cushion shelter is always tough . I also remember a bomb shelter some kids made -- two years ago now -- in a refugee camp in Bab al Salama . They were literally digging a cave with their hands .

Foreign help comes in many forms . ISIS have some foreigners . The Turkish are just across the border , but the Kurds claim they are impeding resupply . The Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga help a lot with heavy weapons . And the coalition airstrikes also keep ISIS back and have helped the Kurds hang on . But in the end the sheer volume of outside parties now with stakes in the fight for the town means that it will go on a long time . ''

Q : `` Hi Nick , amazing report from Kobani - how long were you there and how did you get in ? '' asked SuzanneLavery .

Paton Walsh : `` Thanks . We were there just under 48 hours . I ca n't really say much about how we got in -- it was a mix of simple and complicated -- but we are grateful to the Kurds for their hospitality and care . ''

Q : `` What 's the current situation for journalists there ? Interested to know about how you get your stories out , how you manage the day to day ? '' asked ithinkandroid . `` Thank you in advance . ''

Paton Walsh : `` It is complicated . Anyone attempting entry should spend weeks thinking about it , and not file until out . Day to day , you need the full invitation and hospitality of the Kurds to operate in any way . ''

Q : `` Did you feel safe under the Kurds care and hospitality ? '' asked monhen .

Paton Walsh : Yes , as safe as one can there .

Q : You probably are n't allowed to answer this , but , I 'll ask anyways .

`` How does your personal understanding and experience being there , seeing things , and working there differ from what is ultimately reported ? Perhaps it does n't ? Or , maybe it does ? In either case , I am curious to hear your thoughts . And , thanks for taking the time to do this AMA ! '' asked rurd .

Paton Walsh : `` It 's the same . There is n't some process by which we see and feel a lot of things that we then ignore and follow a preordained script . You see what we do . I know that 's hard to believe in this social media age of micro-digestion , but it 's true . ''

Q : `` Did you interview any ISIS members ? '' asked shouldbeworking23 .

Paton Walsh : `` The nature of ISIS means that in person you are unlikely -- or ill-advised -- to interview them . Social media interaction and Skype are possible -- and my colleagues have managed that . The Kurds did not have any ISIS prisoners at the time we were inside Kobani . ''

Q : `` Thank you and your team for being professionals and risking your lives for the story . Did you meet any foreign nationals fighting for the Kurdish side ? Is there any truth to the reports of ISIS getting resupplied from the Turkish side of the border ? How effective do you think are the allied airstrikes on ISIS ? And last but not least , have you ever touched Wolf Blitzer 's beard ? Again , thank you . '' asked Rihannas _ forehead .

Paton Walsh : `` No , no foreign nationals . We were told there may be some , but saw none .

ISIS are not , as far as we can see , getting any resupply -- the Turkish are in a bind as they are both presumably trying to not end up in an open fight with ISIS , whilst securing their own borders .

The coalition airstrikes are being effective in terms of denying ISIS the chance to take all of Kobani . The strikes have also meant ISIS have had to pour in and lose fighters and equipment . They ca n't finish the fight off , though . That will take better equipping for the Kurds .

Wolf 's beard is off limits . Period . ''

Q : `` Hey Nick . What do you see as the best solution for the situation in Syria right now ? Any ideas how to remove Assad from power -LRB- if that is even the best way to go about reaching some level of peace -RRB- ? '' asked ceclimber22 .

Paton Walsh : `` You ca n't tackle ISIS without also addressing the reason why such extremism has a constituency -- the three years of massacres of Sunnis that Assad forces perpetrated . but an overall solution for Syria is outside of the resources the U.S. wants to commit at this point . there are also too many other players who want an opposite outcome -- Iran/Russia . the U.S. should be , and perhaps has been , mindful that their increased presence -- like ground troops -- has often become the lightning rod for all anger -- adding a new problem rather than fixing the original one . In end , Syria is going to be a conflict that tires of itself . One key problem is that this war has become a proxy conflict for many sides and keeps expanding -- dragging in Iraq , and more different militias . So the point in which the combatants get exhausted keeps staying out of reach . It will take a singular seismic event that prompts serious international action , or more likely eventual exhaustion , to stop this war . ''

Q : `` What are your thoughts on the CIA ISIS torture videos released yesterday ? Do you think the videos will provoke ISIS to expedite their attacks on U.S. soil ? Also , from your perspective , how concerned should we be in regards to ISIS growth ? The news reports they 're growing rapidly was this evident during your time in Syria ? '' asked Britney _ Lewin .

Paton Walsh : `` ISIS grew most rapidly when they were not on the global radar , and then when they ran into Iraq , taking Mosul . Since then , their victories have been incremental . They have n't had the huge storming win they need for recruitment -- the constant forward motion that many analysts say makes them attractive to future recruits . They are growing in terms of infrastructure and organization perhaps , but not geographical reach -- if you exclude a handful of pledges of allegiance in other countries that are symbolically worrying , but not game-changers . ''

Q : `` Does ISIS/ISIL actually consider the term ` Daesh ' as offensive ? I have only seen the one report by `` residents '' in Mosul saying that the fighters and leadership see it as offensive . Will renaming them , across all fronts , actually do anything ? Thanks ! '' asked zib _ al-jihad .

Paton Walsh : `` I do n't think renaming them Daesh makes any difference . It might mildly annoy those who watch French politicians on TV . But in the end , a slightly more forcible strategy is required than intellectualized name-calling . ''

Q : `` If you could tell the American public just one thing about ISIS , what would it be ? '' asked oHolo .

Paton Walsh : `` A decade of policies in the Middle East helped create them . You need to help find and fund the solution , or it will become a problem on your soil , not just the Middle East . ''
