The nation 's 44,000 airport screeners would lose the title `` officer , '' their metal badges and maybe even the stripes down their pant legs under a bill sponsored by a Transportation Security Administration critic .

Called the `` STRIP Act , '' for `` Stop TSA 's Reach In Policy Act , '' the bill was introduced by Rep. Marsha Blackburn , R-Tennessee , on Thursday in response to a series of alleged strip searches by TSA officers .

The TSA denies that strip searches were conducted .

`` Congress has sat idly by as the TSA strip-searches 85-year-old grandmothers in New York , pats down 3-year-olds in Chattanooga , and checks colostomy bags for explosives in Orlando . Enough is enough ! , '' Blackburn said in a statement . `` The least we can do is end this impersonation , which is an insult to real cops . ''

The bill , which has 25 co-sponsors , would prohibit airport screeners from using the title `` officer '' and would ban them from wearing a metal badge resembling a police badge or a uniform resembling that of a federal law enforcement officer unless they receive law enforcement training .

When the TSA was formed after the 2001 terrorist attacks , screeners wore white shirts with embroidered patches . But in 2005 , the TSA reclassified screeners as `` transportation security officers , '' and in 2007 introduced new uniforms in an effort to professionalize the workforce and boost morale . In 2008 , metal badges were added to the uniform .

At the time , the association representing federal law enforcement officers opposed the badges , saying that they would mislead the public into believing the screeners had traditional police powers . Transportation security officers are unarmed , do not have arrest powers and can not use force , the association said .

But the association on Friday opposed the changes .

`` I think it is wrong to strip away the title . It 's not the screener 's fault , '' said Jon Adler , president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association . `` I think the bill in Congress should focus not so much on taking away a title but in assuring that the training and experience support the title . The answer is to build upon it ; do n't strip it away . ''

The union representing screeners called the bill an insult .

`` Every single member of Congress should be supporting federal employees , not trying to demean them , '' said John Gage , president of the American Federation of Government Employees .

`` Reps. Blackburn , -LRB- Florida Rep. John -RRB- Mica and their other cohorts in the House need to stop bullying the TSA workforce , and maybe just worry about doing their own jobs , '' Gage said .

`` Instead of actually helping to fight terrorism , '' he said , `` they are inspiring the type of unnecessary and disrespectful behavior by a few members of the public with an agenda that in fact diverts attention from securing American skies . ''
