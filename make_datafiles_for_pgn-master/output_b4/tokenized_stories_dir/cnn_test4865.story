Lawmakers in Bahrain have passed tough new laws for `` terrorism acts '' ahead of massive protests planned by the opposition next month .

The National Assembly , in a session Sunday , approved new penalties for those who commit or incite `` terrorism , '' including stripping Bahrainis of citizenship .

Legislators also banned any demonstrations in the tiny kingdom 's capital , Manama .

The anti-government opposition bloc has called for mass protests on August 14 .

According to BNA , Bahrain 's National Institution for Human Rights praised the efforts `` to protect the Kingdom 's gains and future generations and -LRB- face -RRB- the recent dangerous escalation that aim at pushing the country to unrest and political tension , which is contrary to the Islamic values and international norms , conventions and treaties . ''

But global human rights activists have denounced what they call appalling human rights abuses by Bahraini authorities , particularly in the past few years .

In April , Human Rights Watch said Bahraini security forces had raided homes and arbitrarily detained a number of prominent anti-government protest leaders .

Bahrain is an ally of the United States and home to the 5th Fleet , a large U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf .

Tensions in the kingdom remain high following the 2011 uprising , in which the majority Shiite population protested against the ruling Sunni minority .

The protests were spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt .

But the demonstrations failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state , backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates under the banner of the Gulf Cooperation Council .
