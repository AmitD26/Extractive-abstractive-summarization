By the time we depart Moscow 's Sheremetyevo International Airport , we will have spent 36 hours on the ground . Like Edward Snowden , whose exact location here in the transit lounge remains a mystery , we can not step foot on Russian soil without special visa clearance .

We arrived early Tuesday morning on a mission -- to find the former U.S. surveillance specialist in the transit zone . As it turns out , this airport has an expansive area for transiting passengers and we now know nearly every corner of it .

Snowden and those who are reportedly handling him are here , according to Russian President Vladimir Putin .

`` He is a transit passenger in the transit zone and is still there now , '' Putin said Tuesday . `` The sooner he selects his final destination point , the better both for us and for himself . ''

That statement came after we 'd already landed on the ground in Sheremetyevo . It piqued global interest in the story . Putin broke his silence on Snowden , after leaving initial diplomacy to his seasoned Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov .

Legally , Moscow has taken the view that Snowden has not cleared passport control , therefore is not on Russian soil .

Along with our Berlin-based camerawoman Claudia Otto , we scoped out the lay of our new land : Terminals D , E and F. First order of business , the infamous Capsule Hotel in Terminal E.

Contrary to its appearance on the outside , the Capsule does not reflect futuristic , space age technology on the inside . The rooms are the scale of large walk-in closets in the U.S. but with much poorer insulation .

The kind receptionist at the front desk has heard of Edward Snowden but without hesitation insists he or anyone assisting him has not stepped foot in the Capsule . We check in and use the hotel as our airport production base .

10 best boltholes : where on Earth could Snowden go next ?

After a few hours on the ground we produce a mini video report on Snowden 's movements , the locations he could be at the airport and why Lavrov says insinuations by Washington of harbouring Snowden are not acceptable .

Once the story is filed , we conduct a live report from Terminal E with nothing more than a hand-held camera , a laptop , a microphone and a fist full of phones to liaise with our operations in Atlanta , New York and London .

Putin then moves into action while on a bi-lateral visit in Finland . Global interest reaches a crescendo . The next thing we know , CNN is the only international broadcaster inside the transit zone and we begin conducting two-three live shots an hour .

We do this from the center of the terminal . Around us , passengers come and go to places such as Almaty , Amsterdam , Split , Tallinn and Vienna .

We , of course , take particular interest in Aeroflot flight number 150 , which is bound for Havana . A day earlier , that same flight carried journalists -- including our Phil Black -- hoping to travel with Snowden , possibly on his way to Quito , Ecuador . Again , no Edward Snowden , but we take stills and video shots just in case .

This global game of `` cat and mouse '' appears to have entered a new phase . The Russian President compares the situation to trying to shave a piglet . A lot of noise , Putin noted , but very little hair to be had .

By this point we are showing up on the radar of airport security , and so our very own game of cat and mouse ensues as we try to continue doing live reports while being tracked by burly Russian guards .

Outside the airport walls , international diplomacy is also getting fractious . Secretary of State John Kerry , traveling in India , asks Russia for reciprocity . Washington handed over seven Russians , Kerry points out , when asked to by Moscow . This administration wants Snowden in return .

Opinion : Why U.S. is being humiliated by the hunt for Snowden

The two former Cold War adversaries cooperated on the Boston Marathon bombings investigation , but when it comes to Edward Snowden and his treasure trove of leaked documents , it does not appear Russia is prepared to do so .

We finish our last live report at 0400 Moscow time Wednesday , 21 hours after arrival . Edward Snowden is very likely still here , spirited away in a room designed to keep him out of sight but certainly not out of mind .
