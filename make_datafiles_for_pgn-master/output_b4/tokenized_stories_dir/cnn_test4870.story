Nigerians took to the streets Thursday to demand the government do more to rescue scores of girls abducted by militants more than two weeks ago .

Militants seized about 230 girls in the dead of the night at a high school in the nation 's far northeast , a hotbed for Islamist group Boko Haram .

Armed men herded the girls out of bed and forced them into trucks on April 14 in the town of Chibok . The convoy of trucks then disappeared into the dense forest bordering Cameroon .

Roughly 200 girls are still missing , although the authorities and parents differ on the number .

Nigerians have rallied for days to criticize the government 's handling of the rescue efforts . Hundreds wept and chanted `` bring back our girls '' during protests in the capital of Abuja on Wednesday . A day later , protesters gathered in Lagos .

Shortly after the abductions last month , frustrated Chibok residents went into the forest in motorbikes to search for the girls .

During their nine-hour trek , they never saw a single soldier in the forest where authorities believe the militants took the girls , said Enoch Mark , whose daughter and two nieces were among the kidnapped .

`` A total of 230 parents registered the names of their daughters who were missing on the day of the kidnap , '' said Asabe Kwambura , principal of the Government Girls Secondary School . `` From my records , 43 girls have so far escaped on their own from their kidnappers . We still have 187 girls missing . ''

Angry relatives

In Chibok , angry parents accused authorities of playing politics with the lives of their children .

Witnesses have seen militants in dozens of vehicles headed to nearby Cameroon , said Ayuba Alamson , whose two nieces were among the kidnapped .

In a statement Thursday , Nigeria 's Defense Ministry said it 's committed to the search .

`` A lot of information has been received in the efforts at securing the freedom of the girls . The armed forces assures all Nigerians that it will continue to appraise every information received during this operation accordingly , '' it said . .

`` While it will not relent in its efforts in this search , the armed forces is mindful of the fact that some of the information with which it has been inundated are actually a ploy to distract it from its goal of dealing with terrorism and other violent crimes aimed at crippling the nation . ''

What is Boko Haram ?

Borno state Education Commissioner Musa Inuwa Kubo similarly said that the government and military are doing whatever it takes to secure their release .

`` This is a delicate situation that requires careful handling , '' Kubo said . `` When you have heavily armed men holding close to 200 girls hostage , you have to be very careful in your approach so as not to risk the safety of these girls you want to rescue .

He said authorities are withholding information for safety reasons .

`` It is a security issue and we just ca n't be divulging all the efforts we are making to get these girls freed , '' the education commissioner said .

Why terror group kidnaps schoolgirls , and what happens next

#BringBackOurGirls

But angry Nigerians said authorities are not doing enough . They took to social media using hashtags #BringBackOurGirls and #BringBackOurDaughters to demand more from the government .

David Peter , a sound engineer , music producer and recording artist in Lagos , sent CNN an iReport in which he calls on the government to do more .

`` If you 're not safe anywhere in the world , you should be safe in your house , in your own back yard . We mandate the federal government to bring back our daughters , and our children , '' he said .

Boko Haram 's name translates to `` Western education is a sin '' in the local language .

The group especially opposes the education of women . Under its version of Sharia law , women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands , not at school learning to read and write .

Rights groups say the militants kidnap girls to perform chores and sexual services .
