-LRB- CNN -RRB- An uncle of a Jordanian pilot captured by ISIS in Syria and threatened with beheading has appealed to the terrorist group to release its prisoner .

`` It is in their benefit as well and the benefit of all us , '' Yassin AlRawashdeh , a former diplomat , told CNN on Friday .

ISIS should set Moaz al-Kassasbeh free in order to gain more sympathy in the region , AlRawashdeh said .

`` Otherwise , they will get the anger of the whole people of Jordan and the anger of the whole world , '' he said .

ISIS had pushed Jordan to bring a convicted terrorist , Sajida al-Rishawi , to the Turkish border by Thursday evening . The Jordanians did n't , so governments and relatives were still waiting Friday to see whether ISIS followed through on its threat to kill al-Kassasbeh , followed by the beheading of a Japanese journalist , Kenji Goto .

Another of the pilot 's uncles , Fahed Al-Kasasbeh , said the family has n't received any information from official sources . And there has been no proof of life from ISIS .

`` But we hope he is still alive , '' AlRawashdeh said .

Al-Kassasbeh 's father , Safi , made a similar appeal for his son 's release Thursday , after the sunset deadline .

Jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al-Rishawi for the pilot . But Jordan 's key condition is proof that al-Kassasbeh is still alive .

`` At this point , we want to emphasize that we have asked for proof of life , and we have not received anything as of yet , '' government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said Thursday afternoon , about an hour before the purported deadline .

The lack of proof of the pilot 's health is concerning , but Al-Kasasbeh said the family had received some information from `` unofficial sources '' that was comforting .

Kidnappers are in a commodities exchange business , said Chris Voss , a former FBI hostage negotiator . And `` proof of life is part of this type of negotiation . ''

`` The Jordanians have no business going forward until they get it . ''

Al-Kassasbeh was captured after he ejected from his F-16 jet last month near Raqqa , the extremist group 's de facto capital in Syria .

Coalition warplanes and drones continue flying over ISIS strongholds in northern Syria , looking for any signs of unusual activity -- perhaps a convoy moving toward the border with Turkey .

But hope is fading .

`` Given the fact that ISIS has executed every hostage that they have publicly produced on a videotape except one British hostage , it does suggest that ISIS is not that interested in serious negotiations and is principally interested in the ability to get a lot of attention for its cause , '' said Peter Bergen , CNN 's national security analyst .

The 47-year-old Goto left Japan last fall , when his youngest daughter was 3 weeks old . His wife , Rinko , who heard from his captors first on December 2 and most recently in a Wednesday email with their `` final demand '' -- pleaded for his return .

`` I hope our oldest daughter , who is just 2 , will get to see her father again , '' his wife , Rinko , said .

Thursday 's deadline was the third that ISIS set in less than a week .

The wait began with a video showing two Japanese hostages , Goto and aspiring security contractor Haruna Yukawa . And an outrageous demand from ISIS : a $ 200 million ransom from Japan within 72 hours , or else both captives die .

The first deadline passed a week ago Friday . Grim proof soon followed : An image of Goto holding what appeared to be a photo of Yukawa 's headless body .

Goto apparently was spared .

`` What it shows is that they are reacting tactically , '' said CNN military analyst Ret . Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling . `` They no longer have a strategic plan . ... They are just trying to get the best thing going . ''

Days later , came a change in demands : ISIS now sought the release of al-Rishawi , a female jihadist imprisoned in Jordan for her role in a 2005 suicide bombing at a wedding reception that killed dozens . And if the swap was n't made , the group threatened to kill both the pilot and the journalist .

Wednesday night brought yet another deadline : deliver al-Rishawi to the Turkish border by sunset Thursday , or al-Kassasbeh and Goto would die .

The relentless back-and-forth has raised hard questions about whether ISIS is truly negotiating , and whether Jordan made a mistake to try .

`` They are attempting to elevate themselves into some sort of status as a political movement and a state , '' Hertling said . `` They are not . They are terrorists . ''

CNN 's Kareem Khadder , Barbara Starr , Anderson Cooper and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report .
