It is an age-old question : will humankind ever defeat old age ?

Plenty of skin care companies would like us to believe so . And now , the multinational tech giant Google would like us to think it might be possible too .

Last month Google announced a new medical company called Calico , whose explicit aim is to take on aging itself . But what will Google 's approach be ? And what other research into prolonging life already exists ?

With its proliferation of businesses , products and services , it would be easy to forget that not so very long ago Google was just a search engine . Today , offshoots of the sprawling global corporation can be found researching self-driving cars , developing their own smart phones and tablets and even launching giant balloons into near space .

Amid this growing portfolio of diffuse interests and initiatives has been added their latest company : Calico .

Calico -- or the California Life Company -- has been set up to research subjects related to aging and its associated diseases . Announcing Calico at a media briefing , Google said that the new and independent company will largely focus on age-attendant conditions such as Alzheimer 's , cancer and heart disease .

Larry Page , Google 's ever youthful CEO said : `` Illness and aging affect all our families . With some longer term , moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology , I believe we can improve millions of lives . ''

But the question is , what will Calico actually do ? At the moment the company is n't giving much detail away : '' -LRB- Incoming CEO Arthur Levinson -RRB- and I are excited about tackling aging and illness , '' Page wrote in his Google + blog post . But repeated requests from CNN to interview either Page or Levinson were politely declined .

In the absence of any real information , many commentators have speculated that Calico will pursue a ` big-data ' approach to health : gathering massive amounts of information from patients and ` crunching it ' to help speed the way to health care discoveries . Some have suggested that Calico 's new CEO will take the view that the best way to tackle aging is to focus on preventing diseases .

Aubrey de Grey , an expert in the field of regenerative medicine , told CNN that it is too soon to speculate on what Google 's approach will be : `` in relation to Calico , I think it 's vital to keep in mind that there is essentially no concrete information about their planned direction and emphasis , and any guess that they will take a heavily data-driven approach is no more than a guess . ''

However , he does think that Calico will not limit its focus to a single disease : `` The statements from Page and Levinson thus far indicate quite strongly that the emphasis will not be just cancer , or even just a range of specific diseases , but will be ` aging itself ' : Page in particular has highlighted the paltry longevity gains that would arise even from totally eliminating cancer . ''

João Pedro de Magalhães , a Portuguese biologist who leads the Integrative Genomics of Aging group at the University of Liverpool , agrees : `` From what I 've read , I do n't think the company will mostly focus on cancer . In the Time interview Larry Page clearly states that solving cancer is ` not as big an advance as you might think ' . This is reminiscent of what experts studying aging have been saying for a while , which is that to really make a difference in human health and longevity you need to tackle the aging process rather than individual age-related diseases .

So where might Calico 's focus lie ? A broad range of technologies and therapies that promise life extension through different means are currently being researched and tested . CNN Labs takes a look across the scientific landscape to bring you the view from the front line of the war against aging .

Cryonics

Cryonics is a process where the body -- or occasionally just the head -- is suspended in liquid nitrogen to ` preserve ' it indefinitely . The idea is that in the future the body will be able to be resuscitated and brought back to life .

Once the preserve of celebrities and multimillionaires , cryonics is now gaining traction among the broader public . Several months ago , The Sunday Times reported that three senior staff at Oxford University have signed up to have their bodies frozen with two U.S.-based cyonics organizations : the Cryonics Institute and the Alcor Life Extension Foundation .

The cost of cryonics can vary wildly . The lowest price at the Cryonics Institute is reportedly $ 28,000 for ` cryopreservation ' ; Alcor Life charges customers up to $ 200,000 for similar services . But does it work ?

The Cryonics Institute underline on their website that , as yet , their treatments are based on projections of technology to come rather than present day science : `` We firmly believe that with the incredible advances being made in nanotechnology , medicine and science today , cryonics has the same potential to become an everyday reality in the not-so-distant future ... The goal of cryonics is to halt -LRB- the ` dying ' -RRB- process as quickly as possible after legal death , giving future doctors the best possible chance of reviving the patient by repairing or replacing damaged tissues , or even entire organs using advanced computer , nanotech and medical equipment and procedures '' .

Cryotherapy

The related field of cryotherapy has gained currency in some quarters of athletics , with coaches immersing their athletes in cryotherapy chambers during or after exercise in a bid to aid training and heal injuries . The French soccer team used cryotherapy during the European Cup in 2012 , and the Wales rugby union squad use it as well . Cryotherapeutic chambers expose players to very low temperatures -- around minus 256 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- minus 160 Celsius -RRB- -- for short periods . Some theorists believe that doing so can help speed the body 's recovery , but others say that the evidence is incomplete .

Self-healing worms and telomeres

In 2012 a group of scientists at Nottingham University discovered that a species of flatworm -- the Planarian worm -- can divide ` potentially forever ' and thus heal itself . Some researchers hope that the discovery will provide fresh insight into how it may be possible to alleviate aging in human cells .

Dr Aziz Aboobaker from Nottingham University 's School of Biology , said : `` Usually when stem cells divide -- to heal wounds , or during reproduction or for growth -- they start to show signs of aging . This means that the stem cells are no longer able to divide and so become less able to replace exhausted specialized cells in the tissues of our bodies . Our aging skin is perhaps the most visible example of this effect . Planarian worms and their stem cells are somehow able to avoid the aging process and to keep their cells dividing . ''

According to researchers looking at the worm , the key may be in understanding the function of telomeres -- the ends of a chromosome that protect cells against degradation .

In 2009 three scientists won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on how telomeres protect chromosomes from degradation .

One theory suggests that if we can work out a way to preserve telomeres , then we would be another step closer to defeating aging .

Cloning and body part replacement

Another major area of investigation is looking into organ creation and replacement . Many people die due to organ failure , but imagine if you could just create your own new liver and replace a faulty one ?

Scientists have already successfully implanted functioning lab-grown kidneys into rats . If the therapy could be successfully -LRB- and affordably -RRB- replicated for humans , it could help overcome the significant organ donor shortages that persist in many countries . Early work into creating organs using 3D printers has also yielded promising results .

Nanotechnology

Organ replacement will probably only ever be part of the solution however . Many scientists believe that longevity through repairing the human body requires a broader focus than just replacing individual parts .

Ray Kurzweil , an American author , inventor and futurist argues in his book The Singularity is Near that by the 2020s , nanotechnology may be able to help cure disease . Kurzweil says that deploying tiny robots -LRB- or ` nanobots ' -RRB- in the body could help overcome the problems of incorrect DNA replication -- one of the central causes of aging .

de Grey says that nanotechnological research is interesting , but that he believes it is further away from finding a solution to aging than some other treatments : `` I pay attention to molecular manufacturing -LRB- the discipline that coined the term `` nanotechnology '' but then effectively had it stolen by the field of nanomaterials -RRB- , but I think its relevance to medical interventions , whether in aging or otherwise , still seems likely to be further off than the more traditionally biomedical work '' .

So will Google 's new company discover a workable solution to aging and death ? Only time will tell .
