The battle for control of Ramadi , the capital of Anbar province , is shifting in favor of Iraqi and tribal forces fighting ISIS militants , Iraqi officials said Monday .

Iraqi forces , with the help of coalition airstrikes , have pushed back ISIS militants and have retaken territory lost after ISIS fighters launched a coordinated assault on the city Friday .

They have also regained control of the only military supply line into Ramadi from a nearby airbase , according to Faleh al-Issawi , the deputy governor of Anbar .

While fighting continues in parts of Ramadi and in an eastern suburb , al-Issawi is optimistic Iraqi forces will be able to retake the city , but only if coalition airstrikes continue , he said .

A fierce battle has been raging since Friday just 1,000 feet from the government complex of Anbar province that houses the regional government and security headquarters . Officials say that ISIS has retreated farther away and the fighting is less intense .

At least 41 people have been killed including security forces , tribesmen and civilians since the fighting began Friday , officials said .

Those casualties include 23 members of the al-Bu Fahd tribe who were found executed in one of the areas retaken from ISIS .

ISIS still controls large parts of Anbar , but Iraqi forces say they 've made progress in the past week in Diyala province with the help of coalition airstrikes .

Iraqiya state TV has been reporting that the strategic towns of Jalawla and Saadiya , located a few kilometers apart , have been retaken by Kurdish Peshmerga forces , Iraqi military and police and Shiite militias .

They retook Baiji refinery , the country 's largest refinery that was lost to ISIS in June .

Iraqiya TV also aired footage from the city of Khanaqin in the Diyala province showing Peshmerga fighters who were interviewed and talked about their readiness to fight ISIS .
