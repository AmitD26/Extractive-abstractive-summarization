-LRB- CNN -RRB- Pope Francis has stirred up a hornet 's nest with remarks in which he said it 's OK for parents to spank children , so long as they do it with dignity .

The comments came in his general audience Wednesday in St. Peter 's Square , when Francis was talking about the importance of a good father within a family .

`` I once heard at a wedding a father say , ` I sometimes have to hit my children a little but never in the face , so as to not demean them . ' How nice , I thought , he has a sense of dignity , '' the Pope said .

`` When he punishes , he does it right and moves on . ''

The principle of not humiliating the child while doling out the punishment appears to be central to the Pope 's justification of spanking , as is that of forgiveness .

`` A good father knows how to wait and knows how to forgive from the bottom of his heart . Of course he can also discipline with a firm hand : he 's not weak , submissive , sentimental , '' he said .

`` This father knows how to discipline without demeaning ; he knows how to protect without restraint . ''

The issue of corporal punishment for children is divisive in many countries , and the Pope 's remarks prompted an outpouring of both support and criticism on social media .

Father Thomas Rosica , a Vatican spokesman , told CNN that it was important not to take the Pope 's words out of context -- and that there was an important distinction to be made between discipline and punishment .

`` It 's about time that we stop and allow the Pope to speak the language of most ordinary people , especially parents , who understand the Pope far better than those who parse every single word and statement that comes out of his mouth ! '' he said .

`` Let us not read into the Pope 's words anything other than what is there . He speaks constantly of mercy and tenderness . He speaks as a pastor and loving father figure who loves children and wants the best for them . ''

Francis showed this affection in a Google Hangout with disabled children from around the world Thursday , Rosica added , and `` speaks about disciplining children and never punishing them . ''

The pontiff also met with street children on a visit to a shelter in the Philippines last month .

According to the website of the Global Alliance to End Corporal Punishment of Children , children in at least 43 states are protected by law from all corporal punishment .

They include more than 20 European nations , as well as countries in Africa and Latin America .

The United States is not one of the nations where corporal punishment is banned , but an anti-spanking movement has gained momentum there .

The case of NFL star Adrian Peterson , given probation , a fine and community service in November after he admitted whipping his 4-year-old son , stirred up the debate . The NFL also suspended the Minnesota Vikings star running back for the rest of the season .
