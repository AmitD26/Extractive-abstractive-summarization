New Delhi , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- There 's no shortage of politicians in India . But the capital of the world 's largest democracy appears set to hand over the reins of power to an activist .

New Delhi votes this weekend to elect a new state administration . In the race for the city state 's top job are two anti-corruption protesters -- Kiran Bedi and Arvind Kejriwal .

Both were comrades-in-arms some four years ago when a massive anti-graft movement swept the country . They also share a common background as civil servants .

Now , the two stand as rivals to rule the state of New Delhi , the center of India 's politics .

Prime minister Narendra Modi 's Bharatiya Janata Party -LRB- BJP -RRB- has handpicked Bedi , a former policewoman , as its candidate for the city 's chief minister . In this , it sidestepped old , political loyalists .

The move , analysts say , was calculated .

In New Delhi , the BJP is faced with stiff competition not from career politicians but from Kejriwal 's two-year-old Aam Aadmi -LRB- Common Man 's -RRB- Party or AAP . The upstart group of activists stunned the country 's politics when it surged to a close second place in city elections in 2013 .

Kejriwal , a former tax official , became the capital 's chief minister after he struck a coalition deal with the Congress party that his AAP had pushed to the third spot in the legislature . With that , the BJP lost the opportunity to govern New Delhi despite winning the largest number of seats .

`` This time , it has taken the pulse of voters . It has fielded Bedi , an activist without a political record , as its face in the capital . This completes the setting by pitting an activist against an activist . One of them is going to make it , '' said K.G. Suresh , a New Delhi-based political commentator .

Kejriwal 's stint as New Delhi 's chief minister lasted 49 days , when he resigned after New Delhi lawmakers from other parties rejected an anti-corruption bill his government proposed last year . His short term was marked by his trademark activist-type sit-ins and run-ins with electricity and water utilities over tariffs .

Critics labeled him a quitter for resigning prematurely . And his party flopped in last year 's national elections .

Still , Kejriwal remains a darling of a large section of New Delhi voters divided along layers of economic classes facing day-to-day problems in the congested city , observers say .

Known for his populism , the 46-year-old maverick is seen to be successfully tapping into his constituency of lower-income groups .

His AAP has promised 500 new schools , 20 new colleges , greater investment in public transport and tens of thousands of new public toilets in the city of more than 17 million people .

`` His support base among the middle-class and the elite may have eroded for quitting office abruptly last time , but he appears to have the backing of economically-weaker communities because of his promises , '' says Suresh .

Kejriwal and Bedi were two of the main strategists of the 2011 anti-corruption agitation that rattled the then federal government of India 's oldest Congress party .

During those demonstrations , Bedi rose to prominence after her scathing attacks on politicians and flag-waving made her a central figure . Then , hundreds of thousands of Indians hit the streets to protest endemic graft and called for cleansing the nation 's political system .

A winner of Asia 's premier Magsaysay award , Bedi has a history of courting public attention , which has made her a household name in India . As a young traffic officer , she was nicknamed `` Crane Bedi '' for her clampdown on wrongly-parked cars . She also received international acclaim for reforming Tihar jail , India 's largest prison complex , after taking over as its inspector-general in 1993 .

As the candidate for BJP , Bedi faces a close contest against Kejriwal .

But the Congress party appears out of the picture and headed for its worst-ever defeat in New Delhi , according to opinion polls released this week .

As front-runners for chief minister , both Kejriwal and Bedi have vowed to make the city safer . The fatal attack and rape of a student in a moving bus in 2012 brought international spotlight on New Delhi and its public safety .

In its election manifesto , AAP has promised a million CCTV cameras across New Delhi and free wifi .

The upcoming election in India 's capital megacity is also billed as a popularity test for prime minister Modi . His grand rise to national power last May is often called the Modi wave . The prime minister has received praise for his reform-minded initiatives and impressive oratory .

At the same time , his BJP and affiliate Hindu groups have come under fire for sporadic Hindu-Muslim clashes over the past few months in parts of the country .

Also , Modi 's party is in a minority in the Rajya Sabha , the upper house of the Indian parliament . That limits his efforts to push his economic agenda .

Winning states in the coming years is therefore crucial for Modi 's government as regional lawmakers play a key role in electing the upper parliament members .
