-LRB- CNN -RRB- Metro systems that travel underground in the United States may be unprepared for smoke or fire emergencies , National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway said Tuesday .

The board wants a nationwide audit of transit systems , with emphasis on trains that operate in enclosed tunnels .

The huge undertaking would be the first of its kind , Holloway said .

The call for an audit comes as investigators look into a January 12 fatal accident that happened near the L'Enfant Plaza Metro Station in Washington . An electrical malfunction inside the tunnel caused train cars to fill with smoke . Passengers who were trapped inside said they struggled to breathe . One female passenger died .

The Washington Metro system , operated by a multistate compact known as WMATA , has ventilation fans at strategic locations designed to remove smoke and heat from the tunnels , but investigators found they were inadequate .

`` The ventilation strategy that WMATA implemented during the accident was not consistent with best practices . '' the NTSB said .

Investigators also found Metro employees had no written procedures for dealing with ventilation during smoke and fire events underground .

`` The investigation to date has revealed that WMATA does not currently have the means to determine the exact location of a source of smoke in its tunnel network , '' the NTSB said .

The findings in Washington raised concerns there could be similar problems in other transit systems across the country .

Transit networks with significant portions of their tracks underground will be the focus of the audit .

New York City 's MTA , Washington 's WMATA , Atlanta 's MARTA , San Francisco 's BART , Los Angeles 's MTA , Boston 's MBTA and Philadelphia 's SEPTA would be included .

In a letter , board members called on the Federal Transit Authority , a division of the Department of Transportation , to conduct the examination of tunnel ventilation systems as well as written emergency procedures for fire and smoke .

The FTA has not yet decided if it will investigate .

The agency said it `` has not yet determined how an audit of this nature would be conducted or the potential impact such an audit would have on the transit riding public . ''
