-LRB- CNN -RRB- Supermodel Carmen Dell ` Orefice 's latest magazine cover celebrates the beauty and longevity of a modeling career that has spanned nearly 70 years .

After posing for Salvador Dali at 13 and for her first Vogue cover at 15 , Dell ` Orefice recently told New You magazine that she 's actually worked more in the past 25 years than ever before .

`` I had a very respectable career but I did n't have a specific look , '' said Dell ` Orefice . `` I was a chameleon . ''

`` Fortunately , there was always somebody who knew I was good when I showed up , was responsible , not temperamental , and could do the job well , '' she said . `` Today I am in a territory that business considers unmarketable : age and white hair . Slowly , however , I started to own that territory little by little because I stood up for age . ''

The cover of New You 's spring issue features Dell ` Orefice , still sporting striking cheekbones and a full mane of silver hair , looking timelessly elegant in black and pearls .

`` Carmen is the embodiment of being able to do anything you want no matter what age you are , '' said Ruchel Louis Coetzee , co-executive editor of New You , which targets women ages 35 and older . `` She defies age . ''

What Dell ` Orefice does , Coetzee said , is listen to her body and take care of it , so she can do whatever she wants to do .

A woman turning age 65 today can expect to live , on average , until age 86 . In a world where people are living longer , it makes sense for magazines to target older women .

That may be why some advertisers are following suit . Oscar winner Helen Mirren , 69 , and longtime model Twiggy -LRB- real name Lesley Lawson -RRB- , 65 , are both modeling for L'Oreal Paris .
