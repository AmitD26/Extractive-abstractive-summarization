-LRB- CNN -RRB- A few weeks ago , metro Atlanta residents gleefully noted that a Georgia groundhog , ahem , failed to see his shadow -- a sure sign of an early Southern spring .

Looks like it wo n't be all that early .

Forecasters are calling for a wintry mix of precipitation Wednesday into Thursday from the lower Mississippi Valley to the Carolinas and southern Virginia .

Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley declared a state of emergency , with ice , sleet , snow and freezing rain expected in various parts of the state .

In North Carolina , Gov. Pat McCrory said he was prepared to declare a state of emergency , with back-to-back storms expected to bring measurable snowfall to most of the state by the weekend . One person was killed Tuesday when a car apparently slid off a slick road and struck a tree , McCrory 's office said . More than 1,700 collisions were reported since Tuesday morning .

Tennessee has reported 30 weather-related deaths in the past eight days , including car accidents , cases of carbon monoxide poisoning and hypothermia . As of Tuesday evening , there were 32,600 customers without power over six counties . Things will get interesting again by Wednesday afternoon .

In Georgia , Gov. Nathan Deal ordered state government offices in 50 northern counties closed on Wednesday and declared a state of emergency for disaster preparedness , starting at 2 p.m.

`` With forecasts showing we could see accumulation by 4 p.m. , I want to make sure we get as many commuters home before then as possible , '' Deal said . State and local officials were heavily criticized for their response to a January 2014 storm that left a traffic nightmare and motorists stranded . Officials stress they have been well-prepared for this season 's weather .

The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning in north Georgia for Wednesday through Thursday , with snow , rain and subfreezing temperatures in some areas .

In addition , a fresh blast of Arctic air will swirl into the Upper Midwest and Northern Plains , cooling much of the eastern two-thirds of the country later this week . That means the Plains states will see temperatures more than 30 degrees below average Thursday and Friday . The Northeast will awake Thursday and Friday with temperatures 20 to 25 degrees below average .

In case you 've forgotten , Southerners are n't good with ice .

And we 're not talking just a little bit into the South , ice is possible nearly to the Gulf Coast .

Officially , forecasters call it a wintry mix . That 's code for snow , sleet , rain and freezing rain . Weather advisories are posted from east Texas to Virginia .

Here 's what the the nation is facing and how it 's coping .

An American Airlines plane skidded off a taxiway at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Monday night . The pilot was taxiing to the terminal when the plane got stuck . No one was hurt .

Lake Charles , Louisiana , is only 30 miles from the Gulf of Mexico , yet freezing rain is in the forecast . The gators say this is a croc .

Even though it 's been on the chilly side for the last week -- virtually a lifetime for folks below the Mason-Dixon line -- Southerners still have a ways to go before perfecting their winter sports skills .

Look for a scapegoat when all else -LRB- or is that all Elsa ? -RRB- fails . Police officers in Hanahan , South Carolina , tried to put the impending storm on ice by arresting the Disney princess lookalike.Sure it was a noble cause , but at what cost ? How many little girls will cry themselves to sleep thinking Elsa is behind bars ?

While the South struggles with winter , a Boston man has found a way to profit from it . For $ 89 , he 'll express ship 6 pounds of snow to anywhere in the United States . It 's packed in a Styrofoam container so it should n't melt too much . Ship Snow , Yo sold out the first day and with 70 inches of the white stuff on the ground , the company should be able to fill orders for some time to come .

You know winter has gone on too long when the New York Times writes an editorial about it . Trying to ease the Big Apple out of its cabin fever , the headline simply reads : `` This Winter Has Gotten Old . ''

Actually there 's not much hope in the article , except that `` New Yorkers are relieved not to live in Boston . Bostonians , snow-buried , may be grateful not to be on the ice planet Hoth , where it 's Boston winter everywhere , all the time . ''

And , if the snow and ice were n't bad enough , Floridians are acting all superior about their good fortunes . A week ago , parts of the Sunshine state were in the deep freeze . Now they 're getting cocky .

`` A ridiculous 84 in Orlando today ! '' tweets meteorologist Tom Terry . `` Soaking in the warm air as another ice/snow storm hammers the South . ''

Is hate too strong a word ?
