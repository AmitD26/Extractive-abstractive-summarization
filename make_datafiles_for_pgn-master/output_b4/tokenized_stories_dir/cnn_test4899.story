Barcelona 's unbeaten run under new coach Tito Vilanova came to an unexpected halt on Wednesday as the Spanish side failed to clinch a place in the knockout stage of the European Champions League after losing 2-1 at Celtic .

Lionel Messi 's late goal , his 74th of 2012 , proved a mere consolation as the Scottish champions celebrated a famous victory to mark 125 years of existence .

The result left Barca still on top of Group G , while Celtic 's hopes of reaching the last 16 were greatly improved as a first-half goal from Victor Wanyama and an 83rd-minute strike from teenage substitute Tony Watt put Neil Lennon 's team in second place with two games left .

Spartak Moscow dropped to the bottom of the group after losing 2-0 at Benfica , with Oscar Cardozo scoring both second-half goals for the Portuguese team .

The Paraguay striker then missed a penalty , hitting the crossbar after Argentine defender Nicolas Pareja was sent off .

Barcelona traveled to Parkhead as the only team from Europe 's top leagues still unbeaten this season following weekend defeats for Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain , but went behind in the 21st minute when Kenyan midfielder Wanyama headed in Charlie Mulgrew 's corner .

The 18-year-old Watt , making his first appearance in Europe 's top club competition , made it 2-0 after veteran midfielder Xavi failed to cut out a long clearance by Celtic keeper Fraser Forster .

Messi netted at the start of injury time after an initial block by Forster but Barca could not repeat the last-gasp heroics of Celtic 's visit to the Nou Camp last month , when Vilanova 's team snatched a 2-1 victory .

It was one of the biggest results in Celtic 's history , behind winning the European Cup in 1967 and losing in the final three years later .

`` It 's right up there , one of the proudest nights in my career , '' Lennon told reporters . `` It was a monumental effort from all those players and on the anniversary of club , it 's a very special occasion .

`` I wanted them to do themselves justice and they 've even surpassed that , they 've beaten the best club in the world .

`` You try to weather the storm , you know it 's coming and there 's not a lot you can do . Then young Tony comes on , gives us new lease of life and scores a great second goal , and he 'll go down in history now . ''

Another unbeaten run came to an end as Barcelona 's conquerors in last season 's final , Chelsea , boosted hopes of reaching the last 16 after stealing a 3-2 win at home to Shakhtar Donetsk in the fourth minute of injury time .

Substitute Victor Moses headed in Juan Mata 's corner to avenge last month 's 2-1 defeat away to the Ukrainian league leaders , who paid for defensive lapses at Stamford Bridge .

The English team took the lead in the sixth minute when Spain striker Fernando Torres charged down an attempted clearance by goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov following a poor backpass by Yaroslav Rakitskiy .

Longtime Chelsea target Willian leveled in the ninth minute but fellow Brazilian midfielder Oscar gave the home team the halftime advantage with a superb long-range volley after Pyatov - racing out of his area -- headed a clearance straight into his path .

Willian equalized again straight after the break with an almost carbon copy of his first goal , this time with his left foot , but Chelsea hit back again as John Obi Mikel had a goal ruled out for offside and then 21-year-old Nigeria forward Moses followed up his goal in Saturday 's Premier League draw with Swansea .

It left Shakhtar on top of Group E on goal difference from Chelsea , with Juventus a point adrift in third following a 4-0 win at home to Nordsjaelland .

The Italian champions ended a run of nine successive draws in European competition as Claudio Marchisio , Arturo Vidal and Sebastian Giovinco scored in the first half , while second-half substitute Fabio Quagliarella headed the other against the Danish league winners .

Manchester United ensured there would be no repeat of last season 's embarrassment by booking a place in the last 16 with two matches to spare after a 3-1 win at Portuguese club Braga .

United failed to qualify from a group including Benfica , Basel and Otelul Galati as manager Alex Ferguson paid the price for resting his big names , but this time there has been no mistake with four wins from four in Group H.

Braga led through Alan 's early penalty , but substitute Robin van Persie leveled before Wayne Rooney scored a penalty and a third forward , Javier Hernandez , bundled in another as United matched the late comeback in the 3-2 win at Old Trafford two weeks ago .

Braga dropped to the bottom of the group after Galatasaray joined Cluj on four points with a 3-1 win in Romania .

Turkey striker Burak Yilmaz scored a hat-trick to earn his club 's first win of the European campaign .

Bayern Munich moved top of Group H with a 6-1 hammering of Lille that ended the French club 's hopes of qualification .

Peru striker Claudio Pizarro scored a 16-minute first-half hat-trick as the Germans went above Valencia on goal difference , with Bastian Schweinsteiger , Arjen Robben and substitute Toni Kroos adding the others .

Valencia moved up to second place with a 4-2 win at home to BATE Borisov , having led 3-0 after 51 minutes with goals from Jonas , Roberto Soldado -- who netted a penalty -- and Sofiane Feghouli .

Renan Bressan and Dmitri Mozolevski replied but Feghouli 's second in the 86th-minute condemned the Belorussian champions to a second successive defeat .
