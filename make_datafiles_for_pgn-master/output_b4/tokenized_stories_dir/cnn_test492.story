Media mogul Rupert Murdoch , the tweet fittingly declared , `` goes from tabloid boss to tabloid prey . ''

That 's because the head of the powerful News Corp empire has declared his intention to split from his younger wife Wendi Deng

After the news emerged , the news-ravenous Twitterverse , gossip-hungry tabloids and every other blog started soaking up the latest celebrity divorce .

Inquiring minds are dying to know why this power pair are getting unhitched . The rumor mill is grinding and the whiff of scandal and the hint of sleaze beckon . People who 've got the answers are n't tattling .

The New York Daily News said the reasons are `` allegedly shocking . '' Its headline shouted -- '' ` Jaw-dropping ' ! ''

For now , people are having fun poking fun . One blogger quipped , `` Wendi Deng to divorce Rupert Murdoch after he drops from # 98 to # 105 on rich list . ''

Another tweet observed that `` someone 's #estateplan will be changing ... ''

Murdoch is 82 and Deng is 44 , so the May-December age difference is duly noted : `` If Deng starts dating a 60-sumpn billionaire , he 'll still be 20 yrs younger than Rupert . ''

Deng made headlines two years ago for forcefully defending Murdoch from a pie-throwing intruder in Britain 's Parliament . That was Wendi Deng Murdoch 's `` greatest moment , '' one wit said .

She 's not just his wife ; she 's his `` pie-deflecting '' wife .

`` If a woman did karate chops for me , @rupertmurdoch , I 'd never let her go bro , '' one tweeter said . Another said , `` I bet rupert Murdoch wife wishes now she had let that custard pie smack him in the face . ''

The Chinese-born , Yale-educated Deng was very accomplished in her own right pre-Murdoch , even though critics jabbed her as a `` gold digger '' through her marriage to the media mogul .

Her husband runs one of the most powerful media conglomerates in the world -- one that includes 20th Century Fox , Fox television -LRB- including Fox News and FX -RRB- , Sky news service , HarperCollins publishing and many newspapers including the Wall Street Journal , Britain 's Times and several publications in his native Australia .

But Deng had stayed largely out of the public eye until July 2011 . She was sitting behind Murdoch in Parliament in London , while he testified about his company 's involvement in a phone-hacking scandal that rocked Britain .

Comedian Jonnie Marbles came at Murdoch with a shaving-foam pie . Deng leaped into action , lunging at Marbles and smashing his hand with her own .

`` Mr. Murdoch , '' said parliamentarian Tom Watson , who minutes earlier had been particularly critical of the media titan , `` your wife has a pretty good left hook . ''

Social media erupted in response to what soon became known as `` the slap heard round the world '' and earned her the sobriquet `` tiger wife . '' The reaction was particularly strong on Chinese microblogs , where many hailed Deng 's reaction as a moment of pride for Asian women .

Murdoch and Deng met at a Hong Kong cocktail party shortly after her graduation from Yale . Deng then went on to work at Star TV , a Hong Kong-based satellite television service that 's under Murdoch 's corporate umbrella .

In a 2011 interview with his wife on CCTV , Murdoch recalled her interpreting for him while he toured the Chinese mainland . A fervent pursuit followed , though Deng did n't necessarily return all his affection .

`` I fell in love with her , and I asked her . She said no , and it took a long time to persuade her , '' Murdoch said .

Their 1999 wedding occurred shortly after Murdoch filed for divorce from his second wife , Anna Torv Murdoch . -LRB- Anna Torv wed Murdoch in 1967 , the same year he divorced his first wife and one year before Deng was born , according to multiple reports . -RRB-

Shortly after the wedding , Murdoch announced his new wife would step down from her executive role at a News Corp. subsidiary in Hong Kong . He described her as `` busy working on decorating the new apartment . ''

A Wall Street Journal profile , published in 2000 , hinted she did n't entirely leave the business world . Deng frequently accompanied her husband and stepson to meetings with high-ranking Chinese officials , where she 'd sometimes intervene `` to smooth over potentially awkward situations , '' according to that report .

Over the past 12 years , she gave birth to and raised two girls , Grace and Chloe . -LRB- Murdoch has four other children from his two previous marriages , some of whom hold prominent posts at News Corp. -RRB-

Her Yale profile notes she 's a co-founder of Big Feet Productions , an independent studio in East London that makes applications and games for Apple operating systems according to its website . And in 2011 , she produced , `` Snow Flower and the Secret Fan , '' a film set in 19th century China centered on two girls who circumvent cultural restrictions on females .

A divorce would end her union to Rupert Murdoch , and perhaps set up a battle over how much of his fortune -- which Forbes recently estimated at $ 11.2 billion -- she and her children will receive . This potential showdown comes at a tenuous time for News Corp. , which recently approved a plan to split its operations into two publicly traded companies .

Murdoch , the existing company 's largest shareholder , is set to become chairman of the two new companies .

It was not immediately known if Deng and Murdoch signed a prenuptial agreement prior to their wedding , and if so where they filed it . Michael Stutman , president of the New York chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers , said he 'd expect they did so in New York -- a state with a tendency to enforce terms of such agreements .

`` New York will apply those terms so long as they are not grossly unfair or unconscionable , '' Stutman said . `` The same can not be said about every other country in the world . ''

One altruist actually tweeted : `` Should n't we respect Rupert Murdoch 's right to privacy during this difficult time ? ''

Good luck with that ! The `` tabloid boss '' is now `` tabloid prey . ''
