Philippa Gregory `` Dragonwyck , '' by Anya Seton `` A gothic novel set in 1844 America . At times it 's utterly ridiculous , but it is truly haunting . Think an American Jane Eyre at high speed . A great book to gulp down in a day . ''

• Books for a long weekend

• Books to savor all summer

Augusten Burroughs `` Tennessee Williams , Flannery O'Connor , and Tillie Olsen . Spend the entire summer with them . It does n't matter what you read or which order you read them in . The wisdom and heartbreak centers of your brain will be electrified . I do not have the words to tell you what a fine summer you will have and how much you will never regret it . ''

Jackie Collins `` The Godfather , '' by Mario Puzo `` You can re-reread it all summer and it will still seem fresh and so true . The characters jump off the page . ''

Elizabeth Gilbert `` The Treasury of Oz , '' by L. Frank Baum `` If by some miracle I had a summer to sit and read , I would treat myself to rereading the most delightful books of my childhood -- the Oz books . Baum sent plucky Dorothy back to Oz more than a dozen times after The Wizard of Oz , and her wondrous adventures just get better . If you can borrow a 10-year-old to share this experience with , all the better ! ''

Philippa Gregory `` History Play : The Lives and Afterlife of Christopher Marlowe , '' by Rodney Bolt `` This takes you into the fictional heart of Shakespeare 's England , suggests a wonderfully imaginative explanation of the genius of the Bard 's plays , makes your head spin with possibilities -- and makes you wonder who did write all those wonderful plays .

• Books to dip into and out of

Augusten Burroughs The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson `` We know Emily Dickinson lived in olden days and she was a poet and seldom left her home . But read one of her poems -- any one will do -- and you 'll see the evidence of a glittering genius . You will be amazed by what one brilliant woman can accomplish alone in her bedroom without e-mail , a telephone , or a best friend . ''

Jackie Collins `` Anything by Elmore Leonard . Short , smart , hilarious . ''

Nelson Demille `` The Atlantic Book of British and American Poetry , '' edited by Edith Sitwell `` Sitwell picked the best of the best in the English language . Excellent with a bottle of wine on the porch or the patio . ''

Janet Evanovich `` Disney Princess The Ultimate Sticker Book '' `` Stick Snow White and Cinderella on the pages and make up your own stories . ''

Elizabeth Gilbert `` Meditations , '' by Marcus Aurelius `` I keep a copy by my bed . And the fact that the ruminations of a second-century Roman emperor bring me comfort , delight , and inspiration is a clue to how timeless this is . Even those of us who are n't governing empires can benefit from these musings on courage and decency . ''

Philippa Gregory `` Sappho : A New Translation , '' translated by Mary Barnard `` It sounds fearfully heavy , but it is absolutely contemporary in feel . A friend who teaches a course in Sappho sent me one poem : ` Do n't ask me what to wear . ' This is a poet who lived thousands of years ago , yet her work will make a modern woman laugh with recognition . ''

Sophie Kinsella `` The Portable Dorothy Parker , '' edited by Marion Meade `` I adore her wit and dark humor . ''

James Patterson `` Nine Horses , '' by Billy Collins `` Collins makes writing accessible poetry seem easy . ''
