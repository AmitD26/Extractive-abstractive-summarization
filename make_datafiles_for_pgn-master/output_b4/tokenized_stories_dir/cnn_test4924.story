-LRB- AOL Autos -RRB- -- Have you ever wondered what your neighbors are carrying around in their car 's trunk or SUV 's cargo hold ? I decided to find out -- by asking 100 strangers in a department store parking lot .

Strollers , playpens , toys and diapers take up a lot of space , but a lot of parents still had organized trunks .

The mission

To uncover the secret contents of the average American trunk and cargo hold .

The stakeout

I spent two weekend afternoons at the Empire Center in Burbank , California , with my camera and notebook , approaching shoppers as they arrived or departed . I identified myself as a reporter for AOL Autos , and asked if I could see what they had in their trunk , and maybe take a picture . I hoped that I 'd be able to see a trend in trunks .

The raw data My decidedly unscientific study yielded some interesting results . First of all , I discovered that even in a big city -LRB- Burbank is a suburb of Los Angeles -RRB- , people are exceedingly nice if you are respectful and forthright .

About 80 % of the people I approached were kind , open and helpful , and gladly opened their trunks for a glance . The 20 % who refused were either in a rush , guarded or shy -- but they were still remarkably polite .

The second surprising thing was that the vast majority of trunks and cargo holds were clean and uncluttered . I really expected to discover overstuffed trunks , full of cast-off items and flea market finds . But even the most fully-used storage areas were tidy and organized .

Not surprisingly , people with small children tended to have the most crowded trunks and cargo holds . Strollers , playpens , toys and diapers take up a lot of space , but most families have discovered that clean , organized trunks make getting to your kids ' supplies much easier and more efficient .

Another trend I noticed was that athletic folks tend to use their car 's trunk as a portable gym locker . I saw a lot of gym bags , sports equipment and sneakers . On a hot day , this was a bit of a mixed blessing ; baked sneakers have a decidedly pungent odor . No one seemed to have a good solution to this problem . I would put a cabin air freshener , like the Little Tree , in my trunk if I regularly carried my tennis shoes . AOL Autos : Celebrity cars you can afford

For the non-athletic , the most common item I saw was the collapsible chair . One family had an entire beach setup in their trunk : four collapsible chairs , a beach blanket , a sun umbrella and an empty cooler , all neatly tucked against the back wall . They said that they always wanted to be ready for a beach day , should the opportunity arise .

Some people were extremely proud of their trunks . One woman bragged that her brother taught her how to organize her tools , and that she had taken the organization to the next level . She had multiple storage boxes in her neat , clean trunk , each with a different set of useful items . AOL Autos : Most fun cars for under $ 20,000

A few families were downright sheepish about the state of their cargo holds . They apologized in advance before opening the trunk , and said that they were in the middle of a project that had foiled their attempts at organization and cleanliness . I have to take them at their word ; I 'm not making a return trip to that hot parking lot to follow up .

The conclusion

After two days pounding the asphalt , I 'm pleased to report that I actually uncovered some useful information and some fun trivia .

There are good reasons for keeping your trunk as empty as possible :

1 . Less junk in the trunk equals less weight , and less weight can mean greater fuel efficiency . 2 . Under certain circumstances , shifting content in your trunk can adversely affect handling . 3 . An empty trunk provides space for that roadside find or warehouse store bargain . How else are you going to get that pallet of pickled asparagus spears back to your garage ?

Here are a few tips that I picked up from the best -LRB- and worst -RRB- of trunks :

1 . Use boxes or containers in your trunk to keep your emergency kit organized and all together .

2 . Purge non-essential items from your trunk on a regular basis .

3 . Vacuum your cargo space whenever you wash your car so that whatever you put in your trunk does n't get dirty and dusty .

4 . Keep a few reusable shopping bags in your trunk so that you always have them when you get to the store .

5 . Be sure to carry a few essential tools -- screwdrivers , wrench , tire-changing tools , a rubber mallet , etc. -- for emergency repair .

6 . A cargo net or bungee cords will help keep your boxes and other items from rolling around in the trunk during hard cornering .

Last , but not least , here 's a list of the oddest items that I saw in any trunk :

• . A machete , an axe and a hammer , wrapped in a colorful sheet -LRB- I did n't ask any questions -RRB- .

• A pair of old-school quad roller skates .

• An ice scraper -LRB- odd because the temperature was 97 degrees in the shade -RRB- -- and we never get frost in Southern California .

• A tube of Butt Paste -- a highly useful concoction that combats diaper rash .

• Nothing . I can guarantee that this is the one thing you 'll never find in my trunk .
