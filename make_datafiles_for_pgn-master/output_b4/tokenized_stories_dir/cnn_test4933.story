COMO , Mississippi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mary Dowden smiles when she thinks about this moment in history . At 80 years old , she 's the granddaughter of a slave who was born in a cotton field outside of Como , Mississippi .

Mary Dowden , 80 , is the granddaughter of a slave . Barack Obama is bringing white and blacks together , she says .

It 's difficult to put into words how she feels about Barack Obama , the issues so complex for a black country girl who lost both her parents by the age of 18 and then had to work a hard-scrabble life as a sharecropper .

`` I was really afraid for him , because I did n't want nobody to kill him , '' she says when asked about casting her ballot for Obama .

But she pauses and smiles . `` I 'm awfully proud of him , as a black person . '' Watch `` white and black is coming together '' ''

Did she ever think she would see this moment ?

`` No , I did n't , '' she says . `` I always thought that , you know , the white was over the black , that they was the leading folks , that one nation is gon na be over another one , and that would be the white over the black . I never thought it would be a black president . ''

With Obama 's election , CNN.com traveled to the town of Como to talk with African-Americans about their experience growing up black in Mississippi and what this moment in history means to them .

Como is a town of 1,400 people 45 miles south of Memphis , Tennessee , along Interstate 55 . It is a hard-hit rural community , home to a school with the dubious distinction of being among the worst-performing schools in the nation . In 2007 , the IRS froze the town 's bank accounts for not paying payroll taxes .

A railroad track cuts through the middle of town . Even to this day , blacks largely live on one side of the track ; whites on the other side . See the hard-scrabble life of a slave 's grandson ''

Dowden is a living testament to a life of struggle , sacrifice and ultimately success . When she was 10 years old , her mom cooked a dewberry pie after working the cotton fields all day . She then went to a friend 's house and died .

`` It was real devastating , '' Dowden says softly . `` I was 10 . My sister was 12 , and we did n't know how to do nothing . And we had to take care of our little brother . ''

She missed one year of schooling because her father , Moses Wilson , could n't afford schoolbooks . He died four days after she turned 18 .

She had two photos of her parents , but they were lost over the years . She knows even less about her grandparents .

`` All I know is , he said that his momma was sold . She was auctioned off , '' Dowden says . `` I do n't know where she was from . I do n't know anything about her . ''

Dowden is a mother of 12 . One son died when he was 3 ; another died when he was 47 . `` It was hard both ways . ''

Across town , a group of African-Americans have gathered at Cistern Hill Church to talk about the good times and the hard times -- and hope for a better future . They range in age from 74 to 18 . Watch `` I started working when I was 6 years old '' ''

Aubrey `` Bill '' Turner , 26 , perks up when talking about Obama .

`` He 's going to bring a sense of respect in Mississippi , that it 's not just a white man 's country . You can be young , you can be black , and you can do anything that you want to do , '' Turner says . `` You do have a chance . And he 's gon na put that all on the table for us . ''

Turner has a tattoo across his neck that reads `` Mr. Ssippi . '' His grandfather was well-known fife musician Otha Turner , whose music was featured in the movie `` Gangs of New York . ''

His grandfather , he said , always taught him `` to respect white people , because one day you 're gon na want that respect , too . ''

Others nod with excitement about the prospects of a black president . They point out that they 've supported white presidents over the years and always voted for them .

`` It just happened to be a black man -LSB- this time -RSB- that was qualified to be president and enough people wanted him in that position and voted for him , '' says William C. Wilbourn , 59 .

But Wilbourn acknowledges , as a black man , it 's an awesome moment in the nation 's history . `` It feels real good . ''

Elnora Jackson , 74 , says she was robbed of the privilege to vote for decades . So whenever there 's an election , she votes `` every time I get a chance . ''

Those gathered here chuckle when they talk about the town of Como . It was , they say , always a bit different than the rest of Mississippi . The downtown strip was built in such a way that there were n't really any back doors . Blacks could walk in the front doors of businesses in the old days .

That 's not to say it was a honeymoon , either . There was a white water fountain in town that was guarded ; blacks could cook at a burger stand , but they could n't buy food there . School buses with white kids would pass black children walking to and from school . They 'd hurl bricks and insults at them .

`` When I was growing up , it was painful , '' says Arilla Kerney , 63 . `` I prayed and asked the Lord to forgive them . ''

There 's one day that all the elders remember well . It was in June 1966 . The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. swung through Como on a march through Mississippi to motivate black people to register to vote . Black children had been told to stay away for fear of any reprisals .

But Lucy Thomas , a 4-foot , 8-inch woman with a `` small frame and big voice , '' gathered about 20 black children . They walked hand-in-hand , barefoot and dirty , down the road to the intersection of Highways 51 and 310 , where King and the Freedom Marchers were huddled .

One by one , the children shook King 's hand .

`` It was just amazing to see Dr. King come through Como , Mississippi ! '' says Dorothy Kerney-Wilbourn , who was among the children that day .

She says that about 20 miles down the road , there was a peach orchard where white men were up in trees with guns .

`` We were walking down the highway , marching and singing freedom songs , and they were up in trees with guns . That was a frightening moment , '' Kerney-Wilbourn says with a laugh . `` Their concept of the blacks was just so different . But we showed them that we were there for peace . ''

Mary Dowden remembers that day , too . She said a white man said to her , `` They should send all the black boys back to Africa . ''

Dowden got in the man 's face . `` I told him , ` You ca n't send me back to Africa , because I did n't come from Africa ! I was born and raised here . Where you gon na send me back to ? ' ''

She smiles . `` He did n't like that . ... He did n't say nothing . He shut his mouth up . ''

Obama has helped change the conversation in these parts like few others .

Dowden , the granddaughter of a slave , holds her chin high . Referring to Obama , she says , `` It 's his time . ''

He has n't taken office yet , but he 's already brought change .

`` Right now , I think the white and black is coming together . ''
