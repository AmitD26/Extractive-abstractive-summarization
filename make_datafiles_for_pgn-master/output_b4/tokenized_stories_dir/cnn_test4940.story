-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Sri Lankan army overran two Tamil Tiger rebel positions in the country 's north on Tuesday , the military reported on its Web site .

Recently captured rebel weapons stacked up in the former Tamil stronghold of Kilinochchi .

The rebels `` suffered double blows , losing two heavily fortified defense positions as ... troops made predawn incursions at identified terror strong points located south of Valayanmadam today , '' the Ministry of Defense said .

The claims of military victories came a day after Sri Lanka ordered an end to combat operations against the rebels by curtailing `` the use of heavy-caliber guns , combat aircraft and aerial weapons which could cause civilian causalities , '' a statement from the Presidential Secretariat said .

A rebel Web site , Tamilnet.com , reported an `` intense barrage of heavy weapons '' through Monday evening .

The rebel site accused the military of staging a ground offensive , `` firing artillery shells fitted with cluster munitions , multi-barrel rocket launcher -LRB- MBRL -RRB- fire and heavy mortar fire from many directions on the northern side of Mu ` l'li-vaaykkaal . ''

The Tiger leadership has asked the international community to `` pressure the Sri Lankan government to reciprocate '' on a cease-fire offer proposed last week . The United States , the United Nations , the European Union and India have called for a cease-fire .

Last week , India 's foreign secretary and national security adviser met with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to express their concerns about the situation in the north , including casualties among civilians . India has a large Tamil population that sympathizes with the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka .

The foreign ministers of two nations are due in Sri Lanka on Wednesday -- David Miliband of the United Kingdom and Bernard Kouchner of France .

Carl Bildt of Sweden was originally scheduled to make the trip with his counterparts , but was not granted a visa , so he was forced to cancel , the Swedish Foreign Ministry said Tuesday . In what amounts to a diplomatic protest , Sweden will recall its ambassador to Sri Lanka for consultations .

A government-imposed deadline for the Tigers to surrender passed a week ago . Tens of thousands of displaced civilians currently remain wedged in a dwindling swath of territory controlled by the Tigers along the country 's northeastern coast .

Government troops say they have rescued some 40,000 civilians trapped in the area , but a U.N. refugee agency said Friday that a wave of `` fresh displacement '' now exceeds 100,000 people .

The Sri Lankan military says up to 20,000 civilians continue to be held hostage by Tamil `` terrorists , '' adding that its forces will continue humanitarian operations to rescue them .

Fifty metric tons of relief supplies -- which landed in Colombo on Monday -- will be sent by UNICEF to the north to help displaced residents .

UNICEF , which called the situation in the north a `` catastrophe for children , '' said the displaced lack food , water and basic medical supplies .

The rebels estimate the number of civilians still in the territory at more than 160,000 .

The Tigers have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka 's northeast since 1983 . As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began , and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries , including the United States and the European Union .
