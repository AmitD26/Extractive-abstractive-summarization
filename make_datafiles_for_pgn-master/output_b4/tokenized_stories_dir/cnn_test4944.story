-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The photograph was shocking : a hooded detainee , in U.S. custody , standing on a box with electrical wires hooked up to his fingers .

Images of abuse at Abu Ghraib changed the discourse on the war , says Abdul Rahman al-Rashed of Al-Arabiya TV .

That photo , as well as the others depicting detainee abuse inside Abu Ghraib at the hands of U.S. troops , came to symbolize `` America in the eyes of the world at that time , '' said CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour .

`` Those pictures unfortunately became symbolic , emblematic of all the troubles that the U.S. faced in the last four years of the Bush administration , particularly given its war in Iraq , '' Amanpour said . `` Beyond that , it caused a great deal of outrage around the world . ''

It was against this backdrop that President Obama reversed course last week , telling government lawyers to object to a court-ordered release of additional images showing alleged abuse of detainees . Military commanders urged him to fight the release of the photos , fearing it would endanger the lives of U.S. soldiers .

The photographs first appeared in a report on `` 60 Minutes 2 '' in late April 2004 , followed by an extensive story on the abuse by award-winning journalist Seymour Hersh in The New Yorker .

`` It was a big shock , '' said Abdul Rahman al-Rashed , the head of the Dubai-based Al-Arabiya television station . `` It hurt mostly the ones who were for the fall of the Saddam -LSB- Hussein -RSB- regime . ... It was a heated debate in the Middle East at the time -- whether -LSB- the invasion -RSB- was the right decision and whether the Americans had bad intentions or not . '' iReport.com : Did Obama make the right call on photos last week ?

The fallout was immediate , both overseas and at home . A year into the Iraq war , the American public had grown increasingly uneasy about the direction of the war , and the Abu Ghraib photographs gave anti-war protesters the ammunition they needed to rally around their cause and question Bush administration policies .

A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll immediately after the photos were released showed that nearly three-quarters of Americans said the mistreatment of the detainees was unjustified under any circumstances . Bush 's overall performance rating sank to what was then the lowest of his presidency , 46 percent . The poll also showed support for the war at its lowest since before it began , with only 44 percent saying they believed it was worthwhile .

It was a blow from which the administration , especially then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , never fully recovered . Amanpour said Obama 's presidential victory and big wins by Democrats in the House and Senate were proof of that .

`` The American people said that they wanted their good name , the name of their country , the influence and credibility of their country 's standing , to be restored in the rest of the world , '' she said .

The photos did what a print report could not do . They showed front-and-center what human rights groups had been saying for months : that the Bush administration was abusing prisoners within U.S. custody . Some photos showed naked prisoners piled on top of each other like a pyramid . Another showed a smiling female U.S. soldier giving a thumbs-up next to a naked , hooded prisoner .

As a result of the furor unleashed by the pictures , 11 American soldiers were tried and convicted of Abu Ghraib offenses , and some officers were reprimanded .

Al-Rashed said he had expected violations in war , but nothing like `` humiliating individuals in those kinds of scenes . '' The Middle East has a `` bloody , long , bad record about torture of prisoners , '' he said , but what happened at Abu Ghraib was even more reprehensible because it undercut America 's democratic values .

`` You talk about democracy , you talk about the respect of individuality , the freedom . ... The prison pictures just really made us speechless . ''

`` It was something completely new -- something that we had not seen before in all the dictionary of prisoners and torture and mistreatment . It just weakened the argument completely about the wisdom of getting rid of a regime like Saddam . It made the argument for the other side stronger . ''

The photographs had a direct impact within the Iraq insurgency . Just days after the photos became public , American contractor Nicholas Berg was beheaded -- with his executioners saying they were retaliating for Abu Ghraib abuses . The insurgents posted video of the killing on the Internet for all to see .

`` The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals , '' Obama said . `` In fact , the most direct consequence of releasing them would be to further inflame anti-American opinion , and to put our troops in greater danger . '' Watch Obama explain reversing course ''

The court had ordered the release in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union . The ACLU said the Pentagon had agreed to release a `` substantial '' number of photographs by May 28 . Officials at the Pentagon said the photographs are from more than 60 criminal investigations between 2001 and 2006 and show military personnel allegedly abusing detainees .

Obama 's decision has sparked a heated debate on what is best for democracy .

Marc Thiessen served in the Bush administration from 2001 to 2009 , including time as Bush 's chief speechwriter . He has said that the `` enhanced interrogations '' of detainees worked and has opposed the release of the latest round of prisoner abuse photos . Watch more on the photo debate ''

`` If these photos had been released , within two seconds flat , they would have been up on jihadi Web sites , and al Qaeda would be using them to incite violence , '' he said .

ACLU attorney Amrit Singh disagrees , saying terrorists already have plenty of information `` at their disposal to conduct violence . ''

`` They can conduct all the violence they want without the release of these photographs , '' she said . `` So to pick on these photographs as the cause of violence , I think , is a grave mistake . There were people who suffered immensely , the victims of torture depicted in these photographs . It 's for their sake and for the sake of future victims of torture that these photographs must be aired . ''

She added , `` It is essential that these photographs be released so that the public can know the full scale and scope of prisoner abuse that took place in its name . ''

Republican strategist Kevin Madden said Obama sided with national security instead of `` the fury of propaganda that would be unleashed against U.S. forces overseas . '' He said the liberal left is trying to use the photos `` as a vendetta against the Bush administration . ''

`` And in that process , what they 're doing is essentially smearing the country as a country that condones detainee abuse and condones the torture , when in fact we do n't , '' he said .

To that , Singh shot back , `` But what is the limit of that argument ? If gross human rights violations have been committed , do you sweep them under the rug because they will cause outrage ? ''

Al-Rashed of Al-Arabiya said Obama 's decision did n't get much play in the Arab world last week , mostly because the alleged abuse is n't as `` shocking anymore . ''

`` It 's not as big news as it used to be , '' he said .

CNN senior political analyst David Gergen , a former adviser to several Republican presidents and one Democrat , said Obama made a wise political decision , even if he upset the left .

`` I think in these situations , you ca n't think about who is going to be pleased and who 's not . I think you have to think about what 's the right decision for the president and assume good policies ultimately make good politics . ''
