WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The federal judge whose husband and mother were slain in their family home in Chicago , Illinois , four years ago was honored Monday by U.S. marshals charged with combating a growing number of threats to the judiciary .

Judge Joan Lefkow has advocated improving judicial security since her husband and mother were killed .

Judge Joan Lefkow , who eventually returned to the bench , credited the marshals who protect federal judges at work and at home with major improvements in judicial security in the years since her family tragedy .

`` It 's now four years later , and I do see dawn has broken , '' Lefkow told a crowd of friends and federal officials gathered at the Marshals Service headquarters across the Potomac River from Washington .

The improved security -- including home intrusion security systems and coordinated intelligence and threat analysis -- was badly needed , according to both judges and the Marshals Service . The number of threats has increased each year , and is expected to exceed 1,500 this year , up from 1,278 last year .

`` We 've already had 600 inappropriate communications reported in the first months of this year , '' said Marshals Service spokesman Dave Turner .

Whether real threats or hoaxes , every e-mail , phone call , written note and letter -- including some with white powder -- is investigated .

The scope and seriousness of the protective effort increased sharply after the Lefkow tragedy .

On Tuesday , the Marshals Service dedicated the `` Joan Lefkow Conference Room '' in the new Threat Management Center to the memory of her slain husband , Michael Lefkow , and mother , Donna Humphrey . Judge Lefkow returned home on February 28 , 2005 , to find them shot to death .

The man authorities said was their killer committed suicide 10 days later when he was stopped by police in Wisconsin . The killer was angry that Judge Lefkow had dismissed his medical malpractice case and he sought revenge , police concluded .

U.S. Marshals Director John Clark credits Lefkow 's advocacy for better security as the catalyst for dramatic changes .

`` Because of her courage to speak out and her advocacy for reform in the protection of judges , things started to happen , '' Clark said . He cited congressional funding for home-intrusion alarms in every judge 's residence and a sharp increase in funding to hire more threat investigators , protections specialists , analysts and trainers .

The threat management center has been open for more than a year .

Deputy marshals in the judicial protection effort attribute a growing number of the threats to disgruntled members of what is known as the sovereign citizenship movement . The movement is a loosely organized network of individuals and groups claiming not to be accountable to the federal government . The movement includes tax protesters , white separatists , zealots of fringe religious groups and desperate individuals lashing out at bankruptcy courts or judges who had wronged them .

As a result , some judges have been given around-the-clock protective details by deputy marshals .

`` While steady progress has been made , we must be ever vigilant and progressive in order to ensure we are providing the best possible protection to our nation 's judiciary , '' Clark said .
