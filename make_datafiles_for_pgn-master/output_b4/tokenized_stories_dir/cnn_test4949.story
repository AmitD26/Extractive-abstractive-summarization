HONG KONG , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Like that other famous environmentalist , Thomas Friedman began his talk at the Asia Society in Hong Kong on December 16 with a simple PowerPoint slide . But that 's where the similarities between Al Gore and The New York Times columnist end .

Thomas L. Friedman has taken on a green hue with his latest book , `` Hot , Flat and Crowded '' .

Unlike Gore , Friedman is a distinctly different shade of green , a deeply pragmatic green that believes economic forces can usher in a revolution in environmental policy . He argues that systemic change simply requires showing the world that it needs green technology and letting pure economics do the rest .

As a journalist , Friedman makes no claims to having scientific expertise in climate change . He is approaching it from a philosophical standpoint .

Green capital

Friedman 's new book `` Hot , Flat and Crowded '' is not a major departure from his previous books . Whether he 's discussing globalization or green industry , he is writing from his deep-seated belief in the markets . He is an unabashed capitalist .

For Friedman , the system works but it 's not immune to bad decision-making . Green industry like globalization will come of age if given the right market environment . His faith in capitalism is equal to that in green technology -- for him , these are two things that are clearly reconcilable .

So how do we do this ? America as the bastion for innovation , Friedman argues , should play a big role . In fact , he confesses it really is n't a book about the environment and energy , its a book about America . For Friedman , America is slipping down the ranks of hegemonic power and climate change is its big chance to reposition itself as a global leader . The environment is merely an allegory for how the U.S. will achieve this revival .

As an extension of that argument , all countries need to do the same . Right now , no country has really taken the lead in environmental technology , so what we have at the moment is an all out race to the top . Indeed Friedman 's book was written before the financial meltdown but recent events have furthered his argument that environmental technology is the solution of all solutions . It 's a sentiment I also came across at the recent Clinton Global Initiative meeting .

Green Dream Team

Friedman seemed cautiously optimistic about Obama 's ability to lead the green revolution . Given the disarray of many of America 's financial institutions , it 's unclear whether this new green message will get through .

A glimmer of hope however is Obama 's newly appointed energy secretary Steven Chu . There 's been extensive chatter about him on environmental blogs in recent days with the media calling Chu the head of Obama 's `` Green Dream Team . ''

Friedman made a ringing endorsement of Chu as did many in the audience that day . Steven Chu , Nobel Laureate and the head of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory , is seen as a promising choice for many environmentalists , one perhaps that proves Obama 's intention to fulfill a key campaign promise on energy policy .

Chu himself underwent an interesting move from physics to environmental technology . He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 but left the world of Quantum Physics to study the science of global warming . As head of Berkeley National Lab , he led projects to the tune of $ 650 million channeling much of it towards green technology to develop advanced biofuels and solar power .

Changing light bulbs and leaders

The audience listening to Friedman that day was clearly appreciative of his no-nonsense approach to the green issue . As Friedman puts it , `` it 's not about changing light bulbs , it 's about changing leaders . ''

He confessed to having attended too many Earth Day concerts in the past and that no matter how many celebrities you get to show up or how you offset the event , it wo n't be enough to set off this green revolution .

So as I sat there wondering whether the fish the guests had been eating for lunch was sustainable , for Friedman , it did n't really matter . For his revolution , he had bigger fish to fry .
