-LRB- Entertainment Weekly -RRB- -- It was a glass half-full , glass half-empty kind of weekend at the box office for `` Funny People , '' writer-director Judd Apatow 's comedic meditation on fame , humor , life , and death .

Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen star in `` Funny People , '' which took the No. 1 slot at the box office this weekend .

According to figures from Hollywood.com Box Office , it opened at the top spot with an estimated $ 23.4 million , better than Apatow 's The 40 Year-Old Virgin -LRB- $ 21.4 million -RRB- -- hence , the glass is half full . But that figure is far lower than the debut for Apatow 's `` Knocked Up '' -LRB- $ 30.7 million -RRB- , and it 's the worst opening for a comedy for star Adam Sander since his 2000 turkey `` Little Nicky '' -- hence , the glass is half empty .

Of course , `` Funny People '' was billed more as a thoughtful dramedy than a balls-out Sandler laugh-fest , and when matched against the opening frames for Sandler 's serious efforts `` Reign Over Me , '' `` Spanglish , '' and `` Punch-Drunk Love , '' Funny People is far and away the winner -- and the glass is half full again .

But whether it 's a comedy , drama , or dramedy , `` Funny People 's '' $ 75 million budget is quite the handful of pretty pennies , and with a shaky `` B - '' Cinemascore , the film is going to have a hard time overcoming tepid word-of-mouth -- and we 're back to the half-empty glass . So let 's just move on , shall we ?

The cup of a certain adolescent wizard , meanwhile , definitely runneth over . Thanks to its debut on IMAX -LRB- and the premium ticket prices that come with it -RRB- , `` Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince '' came in second with $ 17.7 million , a soft 40 percent drop from last weekend for $ 255.5 million total .

At this rate , the film is well on its way to the upper ranks of the ` Potter ' franchise . The guinea pigs of `` G-Force '' were right on its heels at third place , nibbling up $ 17.1 million , a decent 46 percent drop for a two-week cume of $ 66.5 million .

And Katherine Heigl 's romcom `` The Ugly Truth '' took in an additional $ 13 million , a 53 percent drop for fourth place and $ 54.5 million total .

Of the two other wide releases this weekend , at least the sci-fi family comedy `` Aliens in the Attic '' -- which grossed a meager $ 7.8 million for fifth place -- broke into the top 10 . The torture porn flick `` The Collector '' collected a grisly $ 3.6 million and plopped dead at 11th place .

Box office on a whole was down a massive 22 percent from last year , when The `` Dark Knight '' and `` The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor '' both took in over $ 40 million , but the specialty market showed some vibrant signs of life . Bone fide indie hit '' -LRB- 500 -RRB- Days of Summer '' expanded to 266 theaters for $ 2.7 million , a $ 10,338 per theater average .

And three widely disparate films opened in four theaters each to healthy per theater averages : The quirky romantic comedy `` Adam '' -LRB- $ 16,566 per theater -RRB- , the stylish vampire film `` Thirst '' -LRB- $ 13,793 per theater -RRB- , and the eco-thriller-cum-documentary `` The Cove '' -LRB- $ 13,600 per theater -RRB- .

Finally , a true milestone was reached this weekend by `` The Hangover . '' With $ 5.1 million this weekend for a running total of $ 255.8 million , the summer 's biggest die hard blockbuster has passed `` Star Trek '' and -LRB- for a brief moment -RRB- `` Harry Potter 6 '' as the third highest grossing movie of the year .
