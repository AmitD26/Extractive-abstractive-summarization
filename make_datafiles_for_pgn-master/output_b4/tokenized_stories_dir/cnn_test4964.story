A large crowd of mourners attended a funeral for six of the victims Sunday afternoon in Hermosillo , about 200 miles -LRB- 320 kilometers -RRB- south of the U.S. border . The cause of Friday 's fire at ABC Day Care was n't known , but investigators concluded that the fire did n't start inside the building , said Eduardo Bours , the governor of Sonora state .

Neighbors described parents arriving at the day care center completely desperate on Friday , seeing it engulfed in flames and knowing there was no way to get the children out . The building had two doors , one of which was padlocked shut , and windows were too high for the children to reach , officials said .

Some parents rammed their vehicles into the building to try to free the trapped children , witnesses told CNN . Watch parents gather at site of fire ''

`` When we went out and ran towards the nursery , teachers already had many children outside , those who could walk properly , '' said one man at the scene , who did not give his name . `` A pickup truck broke down the walls . The dad of one of the kids broke down one of the walls with his car driving in reverse , and that helped us a bit . ''

Others said they waited for hours for news of their children . Watch a town in deep shock ''

`` They did n't tell us anything , nothing , until like 6 p.m. , '' said Ofelia Vasquez , whose 4-year-old son Herman was in the building . She said she eventually was told he was at Chavez Hospital .

`` We went there and we saw that he was badly burned , 75 percent of his body was burned , '' she said .

Herman Vasquez died after surgery , his mother said .

As of Sunday afternoon , 26 children remained hospitalized , 12 of them in critical condition , Sonoran authorities said . Another 10 children had been transported to other hospitals : eight to Guadalajara , one to Ciudad , Obregon , and two to Sacramento , California .

A team of 29 medical experts in Hermosillo was deciding if any more victims would be moved to the Shriners Hospital for Children in Sacramento , or elsewhere .

In addition , six adults were injured , Sonora spokesman Daniel Duran said .

`` Without a doubt this is the worst disaster we 've had , '' Bours told CNN .

President Felipe Calderon traveled to Hermosillo on Saturday . He arrived with Interior Secretary Fernando Gomez Mont and Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova to get firsthand updates from doctors and investigators , the state news agency Notimex reported .

Calderon ordered the nation 's attorney general to investigate the blaze .

Most of the victims died from smoke inhalation and not burns , Bours said . But the fire was serious enough for the roof to collapse , he added .

At the time of the blaze , 142 children were inside the ABC Day Care . The day care is for children ages 2 to 4 , but Bours confirmed that children even younger were among the victims .

All the children at the center had been accounted for by Saturday evening , Bours said .

A severely burned 3-year-old girl arrived Saturday at the Sacramento hospital -- where pediatric burn treatment is a specialty -- and was in critical condition , according to Dr. Tina Palmieri , assistant chief of the burn unit .

The child was burned over 80 percent of her body , the doctor told reporters . She said the hospital normally can save just over half of the children with burns that severe .

In Hermosillo , a large crowd gathered outside of the emergency entrance of the city 's general hospital and many people consoled each other , video from the scene showed .

`` They told me that this happened in a matter of five minutes , '' Hermosillo Mayor Ernesto Gandara told reporters after surveying the scene .
