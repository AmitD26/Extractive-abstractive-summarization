-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After hours of back and forth between members , the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America decided Friday evening to accept noncelibate clergy members and lay leaders who are in `` lifelong '' and `` monogamous '' same-sex relationships .

Previous Evangelical Lutheran Church policy allows gay and lesbian clergy , lay people to serve only if celibate .

One of the country 's largest Protestant denominations , the Lutheran church approved four recommendations to its ministry 's policies that underscore a new approach to homosexuality .

While the recommendations passed at the weeklong Churchwide Assembly in Minneapolis , Minnesota , do not address recognizing same-sex marriage or civil unions , they do allow congregations to support same-sex relationships among their members and allow individuals in same-sex relationships to hold clergy positions .

The previous policy of the 4.6-million member church allowed gay people to serve as members of professional rosters only if they were celibate .

Some members argued prior to the vote that the change would fly in the face of religious teachings .

`` Brothers and sisters , I ask you , before you dig yourselves deeper into this hole , if you are so absolutely certain that these behaviors are not sinful that you are willing to place yourselves and this church at the spiritual risk that comes from encouraging sin , '' said the Rev. Steven Frock of the Western Iowa Synod .

Among those on the other side was Alan Wold of the Northern Illinois Synod . `` If according to some I am going to be in err for supporting this ... Let me err on the side of mercy , grace , justice , and love of neighbor . Let me err on the side of gospel , which makes all things new . ''

Many feared the emotional debate could tear at the unity of the church . So the members voted to re-order their resolutions -- moving to the top a resolution that the church `` commit itself to bear one another 's burdens , love thy neighbor , and respect the bound consciences of all . '' It passed with overwhelming support .

Other religious denominations , including Episcopalians and Unitarians , have made moves to accept gay clergy , and Evangelical Lutherans would not be the first to accept those openly in same-sex relationships , said David Masci , a senior researcher at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life . But ELCA would be the largest to make such a move .

The church is the third largest Protestant denomination , representing 2 percent of the U.S. population , according to the Pew Forum .

The battle Friday was the latest in what Masci said many `` socially moderate '' denominations , including those in Judaism , are grappling with : balancing the growing acceptance of same-sex relationships with traditional teachings .

As some have moved toward accepting same-sex relationships , within those same denominations `` you see more conservative wings that are pushing back against it , '' said Masci .

On hand for Friday 's debate were hundreds of `` interested parties '' -- including some people who are not members of the church , said John Brooks , ELCA spokesman .

When asked whether there had been protests or rallies on either side outside the convention site , he responded , `` Interestingly , no . ''

In the convention hall , Brooks said , `` The debates have n't been rancorous or mean-spirited in any way . They 've been quite civil . But people have been passionate with their feelings . ''

The Rev. Terri Stagner-Collier of the Southeastern Synod said a vote in favor of the resolutions would cause members of her own family to leave the church . Her sister `` felt her church was being ripped away from her , '' Stagner-Collier said tearfully , adding , I urge you not to do this to all of those people in the pew and in my family . ''

Sara Gross of the Oregon Synod said some `` dear members '' of the church will be lost if the resolution passes . But , she said , `` A vote to reject this recommendation sends a message to the world saying ` not all are welcome . ' ''

In a `` changing world , '' Gross argued , the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America `` needs to be a voice that stands up and says ` yes . ' ''
