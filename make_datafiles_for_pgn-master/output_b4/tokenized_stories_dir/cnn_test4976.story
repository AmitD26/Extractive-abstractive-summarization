Turkey -- which shares its Incirlik air base with U.S. forces -- is a key member of NATO and acts as a vital conduit for U.S. military supplies .

Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell confirmed Wednesday that U.S. military and intelligence communities are sharing information with Turkey to help them fight members of the Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK , who have made cross-border attacks . See location of key U.S.-Turkish air base ''

`` We are assisting by supplying them , the Turks , with intelligence , lots of intelligence , '' said Morrell . `` There has been an increased level '' of intelligence sharing .

Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki has joined efforts to ease cross-border tensions . Mottaki met in Iraq Wednesday with his Iraqi counterpart , Hoshyar Zebari , and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki .

Mottaki 's involvement prompted him to delay a scheduled visit to Lebanon , according to Iran 's Islamic Republic News Agency , which quoted Iranian Ambassador to Lebanon Mohammad Reza Sheibani .

Iran 's foreign minister is offering his `` full support '' to the regional conference in Istanbul , said a statement from al-Maliki 's office . The statement also said Mottaki wants to help `` solve the border crisis between Turkey and the PKK . ''

Earlier this month , proposed legislation in the U.S. Congress prompted Turkey to threaten to restrict U.S. access to Turkish airspace or cut off access to the air base at Incirlik . Some lawmakers wanted a vote on legislation that would have officially declared that the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in World War I was `` genocide . ''

Turkey recalled its ambassador to the United States and warned of repercussions in the growing dispute .
