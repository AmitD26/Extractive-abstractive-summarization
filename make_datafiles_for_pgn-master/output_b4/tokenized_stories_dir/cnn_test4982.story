-LRB- Oprah.com -RRB- -- A businesswoman , a mother of four , an international fashion icon , a woman committed to making the world a better place for women and children -- Queen Rania of Jordan is truly changing the world .

Queen Rania says cultural dialogue , education and increased opportunities are ways to combat terrorism .

Rania Al-Yassin was born in Kuwait . Shortly after Saddam Hussein invaded that country in 1990 , her family fled and settled in Jordan . After graduating from business school , Rania began working her way up the corporate ladder .

When she was just 22 , she went to a dinner party where she met Jordan 's Prince Abdullah -- considered one of the world 's most eligible bachelors . He did n't remain one for long after that night . Six months later , Rania and Abdullah had a royal wedding and started a family . And , though they planned for a life as royals , Abdullah assumed he 'd remain a military officer for life .

In 1999 , while on his deathbed , King Hussein of Jordan stunned his country by announcing that his son Abdullah -- not his brother -- would succeed him as king . That made 29-year-old Rania the world 's youngest living queen .

Rania says that being queen is not the trait she defines herself by . `` I am not at all conscious of it , '' she says . `` I make a conscious effort not to be conscious of it . Because I 'm Rania , you know ? People call me ` Queen , ' but , you know , that 's not me ... I 'm Rania . ''

There are many perks to being queen , of course , but Rania stresses that there are also responsibilities .

`` One of the major misconceptions about this position is that people think that I might be far removed , that I might not be in touch with reality , '' she says . `` The honest truth is that my life is very much about dealing with issues on the ground , dealing with ... the problems that our country faces . That 's something I do on a daily basis . '' Watch how Queen Rania uses technology to reach young people ''

When most people think of queens , they probably think of what they know from fairy tales . `` For me , it 's just real life , '' Rania says . `` I am a mother . I care about my children . I worry about what they eat . I worry about the influences from their friends . ''

Rania is not only sitting royalty in Jordan , she 's raising the next generation of royals too . She is the mother of four children -- 14-year-old Hussein , 12-year-old Iman , 8-year-old Salma and 3-year-old Hashem .

Rania says her family tries very hard to remain down to earth . The family has relaxed much of the ceremonial pomp and circumstance of their position . Rania prefers that people not refer to her as `` Your Majesty '' ... and King Abdullah loves to barbecue !

The family never discusses the possibility that Hussein , their oldest child , could be the future king of Jordan , Rania says . Instead , she says the family strives to remain like any other family . For instance , to get the things they want , the children have to clean their rooms and do well in school .

`` The most important thing is to instill them with the right values , '' Rania says . `` I just feel that values are the shield that you carry with you throughout life . It protects you from whatever life throws at you . ''

Rania has become famous around the world for her efforts to improve educational opportunities for girls and the rights of women . `` In my mind , poverty is a ` she , ' '' Rania says .

Helping others is something Rania says she feels compelled to do . `` Once you feel that others are like you , then you want for others what you want for yourself , '' she says . `` And that way you start helping others . ''

Rania explains that there is a direct relationship between increasing education and eliminating poverty . `` You can change the course of a nation through education , '' she says . `` One of the most important things you can do for a girl is empower her with her education . Once she has the education , she can then have control over her income , she can change her life , she can have choices . ''

To understand what life is like for the women in Rania 's kingdom , `` The Oprah Show '' spent a day with a few women in Amman , the capital city of Jordan .

One woman named Muna worries about striking a balance between work and motherhood . Part of that means preparing lunch -- the most important meal in Jordanian culture -- for her family . Unlike in America , most children and husbands return home to eat with their families for lunch . Just like in America , Muna cooks a variety of meals , everything from traditional Arabic food to hamburgers and spaghetti .

In this largely Muslim country , one religious tradition is increasingly a matter of choice . Approximately 60 percent of Jordanian women wear a veil . Though Queen Rania says she has never worn a veil , she understands why a woman would want to .

`` We think it 's a personal choice , '' she says . `` Unfortunately , in the West , people look at the veil as a sign of oppression or weakness . This is not true as long as a woman is wearing it because of her belief . I always say we should judge a woman according to what 's going on in their heads rather than what 's going on top of their heads . ''

Rania says that when people focus on differences between cultures -- especially stereotypes and things like veils -- they fail to realize just how similar all people are . `` Once you go beyond the mannerisms , the language , the cultural idiosyncrasies , you realize that you 're basically the same , you know ? '' she says .

Rania also wants to break down the stereotypes the West holds about her culture . `` I would like to dispel the misconception that Arabs are all extremists , that Arab people are violent and that women in the Arab world are oppressed and suppressed , '' she says .

The struggle we feel today is not really Middle East against the West , Rania says , but rather it is between extremists and moderates of all religions . `` We need to speak up , '' she says . `` The biggest nightmare for the extremists is for us to get along , and that 's why we have to get along . We have to communicate more . ''

In the future , Rania says she hopes for a more open and secure world . `` We look at problems happening halfway across the world and we think , ` Well , that 's their problem . ' But it 's not , '' she says . `` When you solve somebody else 's problem , you 're solving a problem for yourself because our world today is so interconnected . ''

Rania says solving problems that stem from intolerance -- like terrorism -- require cultural dialogue , education and increased opportunities . `` We have to create opportunities for our youth so they have a chance in life , '' she says . `` Whenever you 're frustrated and you feel like you do n't have a future or you ca n't get a job , then you 're more susceptible to be influenced by terrorism and extremist ideology .
