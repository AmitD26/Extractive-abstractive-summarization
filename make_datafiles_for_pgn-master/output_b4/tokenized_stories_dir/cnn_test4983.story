-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the first anniversary of the historic 2008 election , retired Gen. Colin Powell , the first African-American secretary of state , talks one-on-one with CNN 's Don Lemon for Essence Magazine about the most pressing issues facing black men in the age of President Obama . Don Lemon : President Barack Obama issued a national call to service . Do you think African-Americans have answered that call ?

Colin Powell : I really do n't know that I know the answer to that question . I do know that in the work that I do and my wife does as the chair of America 's Promise , we are seeing more and more people step forward to try to deal with the problems that we have , to include African-Americans and Hispanics stepping forward .

But it 's not just a one-time thing . You ca n't just have , let 's have a day of service on Martin Luther King Jr. 's birthday or a day of service . We 've got to get deeply involved in working with our kids on a continuing basis and not just one day a year .

We need more African-American men , for example , to step forward and serve as mentors to young kids who do n't have a responsible , caring adult male in their lives . If I could snap my finger and do one thing , I would make sure that every young American boy or girl , but especially African-American -LSB- children -RSB- , have a responsible , caring adult in their lives .

Hopefully , it 's their parents , even if it 's a single parent . ... But without that kind of family support , then we need Boys and Girls Clubs . We need Big Brothers and Big Sisters . We need mentors . Otherwise , these kids will find bad adults to copy from , and we 're going to lose them .

Lemon : I recently reported on youth violence and gangs in Chicago , Illinois . Most of the young men did n't have role models at home . Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men ?

Powell : Of course it would . President Obama has spoken out rather clearly about this : Fathers have got to start doing their jobs .

Every child has a father , and some of those fathers do n't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father . Whether it 's a father in a marriage or a father in a good home , that father is a father and owes that child financial support , owes that child companionship , owes that child an example in life .

Those of us who have been blessed with some success ... you can look back and see family members who kept you in play . If it had n't been for my relatives and my parents and my cousins and my priest and all the other people in my neighborhood , I would n't have made it . But they had a level of expectation for me .

Lemon : How do you convince African-American men , especially , that service is a worthwhile effort ?

Powell : You tell them that without that effort , all of our achievements over the last 50 or 60 years are being put at risk . The statistics are frightening . Fifty percent of our African-American youngsters are not graduating from high school . And of that 50 percent , a higher percentage of boys are not graduating than girls .

And when they get out of high school , if we can get them into the college , you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college . And those six girls will graduate at a higher rate than the three or four boys .

This is a moral disaster for the African-American community . This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched . We did n't do it so that these kids could fail because they do n't have adults in their life , teaching them how to succeed .

We 've got to teach them that you 've got to behave . You 've got to learn what it means to `` mind '' somebody . You 've got to read to your kids . You 've got to act like responsible fathers .

Lemon : How did you become involved in President Obama 's Renew America Together initiative , and what is your role ?

Powell : The president-elect was aware of the work that Alma and I had done together on America 's Promise . As part of the transition effort , he intended to make this an important part of his administration , and he wanted to get started earlier .

The White House asked if I would work with transition officials to launch his first initiative , which was called Renew America Together .

I launched that for him on the 9th of January , 11 days before the inauguration . We also announced the Web site where people could sign up to get involved in service to their community . It 's called usaservice.org .

I 'm so pleased that he has made this a major part of his administration and his agenda , because it fits right into what my wife and I have been doing for many years .

LEMON : Did you have any African-American role models ? What did they teach you ?

POWELL : They were , first and foremost , my family . When I was a young kid , born in Harlem , raised in the Bronx , it was my family that taught me how to behave , taught me what they expected of me , gave me a sense of shame and told me to `` mind . '' It 's a word that 's not used enough anymore .

I tried to observe people who were successful in life . In the black community , we did n't have that many in those days . You had Joe Louis , Jackie Robinson , Ralph Bunche , Willie Mays , a lot of athletes . ... You had Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Sr. , the first black general in World War II . But it was still a country where people of color could not reach the heights . I was nevertheless inspired by these folks who did the best they could in the time in which they lived and showed that if you do your very , very best , you will be recognized and rewarded for it .

I entered the Army five years after the last segregated unit was closed down . I entered in 1958 , and at that time , the Army was fully integrated , the most integrated institution in American society .

And what my commander said to me : `` We do n't want to hear any sad stories about you were born in Harlem and raised in the Bronx . Do n't tell us anything about your immigrant family . We know you did n't go to West Point .

`` We do n't care where you went , and we do n't care if you 're black , white , blue . ... The only color we care about now is green . You 're in the Army . ''

The only thing that counts is performance . You ca n't perform if you do n't get your education . You ca n't perform if you do n't speak the English language well . You ca n't perform if you 're not respectful . You ca n't perform and you wo n't get the opportunity to perform if you walk around with your pants dragging around your ankles and you 're not behaving in a proper manner .

Lemon : Amen , General . Thank you . Read Don Lemon 's editorial on Essence.com about what Obama represents for all of us .
