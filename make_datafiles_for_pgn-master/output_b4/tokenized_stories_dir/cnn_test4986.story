-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hundreds of inmates using pipes and shanks as weapons trashed a California prison , burning a courtyard , ripping beds to shreds and tearing bathroom sinks from walls , a new video of the weekend riot 's aftermath shows .

A dormitory is trashed after a riot at the California Institution for men , in Chino .

Video shot by CNN affiliate KABC-TV gave the first glimpse of the damage to the California Institution for Men in Chino from a riot that authorities said was ignited by racial tensions .

`` This certainly is probably the worst that we 've seen , especially adding the extensive damage to the unit that has been burned , '' prison spokesman Lt. Mark Hargrove told reporters outside the prison Tuesday . `` That has never happened at this facility before . ''

The riot erupted Saturday night and raged until Sunday morning , injuring 250 inmates . Fifty-five inmates were taken to hospitals with serious injuries , including stab wounds and head trauma . Watch the aftermath of the violence ''

`` The prison is still under a state of emergency , '' George Kostyrko , a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation told CNN , which means no visitors were allowed and the prison could not take any new inmates .

Corrections officials said they transferred about 1,150 inmates to other facilities . `` The ones that are there are likely in a lockdown mode until an investigation can determine whether or not they were directly responsible for the riot , '' Kostyrko said .

The decision to lock down the Chino prison and nine others in southern California was still in effect Tuesday .

`` The lockdowns will remain in effect until all the staff that we deployed to Chino from other areas go back home , '' Kostyrko said .

The measure was taken to prevent copy-cat violence .

Though other races were involved , the altercations at Chino mostly involved Hispanics and African-Americans , Kostyrko said .

About 80 officers responded to the scene , but none of the staff was injured .

A housing unit was heavily damaged by fire . Prisoners broke windows and pulled down pipes to use as weapons , Kostyrko said .

The facility has seven units , each of which houses about 200 inmates .

In one of the torched dormitories , burned red prison uniforms were strewn everywhere , the floor was covered with ankle-high ashes , windows were shattered and there was a large hole in the roof .

In the mounds of trash that littered the floor of the dorm , a rusty foot-long pipe could be seen .

Most of the residential areas were badly damaged and some inmates were being temporarily housed in tents , the spokesman said .

Chino is about 35 miles east of Los Angeles .
