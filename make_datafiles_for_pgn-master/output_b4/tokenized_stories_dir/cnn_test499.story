OK , we can admit it . Even though Kate Upton spent six days in Antarctica posing in minimal clothing in below-freezing temperatures -- which she says led to hypothermia and frostbite -- we 're jealous .

Why ? Um , because we do n't look like that in a bikini .

Upton is the first model to be picked to do back-to-back covers for Sports Illustrated 's swimsuit edition since Tyra Banks appeared for the second time in 1997 . And you only have to look at the photos to figure out why .

Fitness trainer David Kirsch started working with Upton in August to prepare for the December photo shoot . We reached out to ask him about her exercise regimen , the biggest mistakes he sees clients make at the gym and why a strong mind is just as important as a strong body .

CNN : What was Upton 's training schedule like ?

David Kirsch : The idea was to step up the intensity and duration of the workouts , making it a strict cardio and sculpting boot camp that entailed body weights and resistance bands , sprinting and calisthenics , shadow - and kickboxing .

At the beginning , we worked out seven days a week , twice a day . Then we brought it down to five to six days a week for one hour a day .

CNN : Was there a specific area she needed or wanted to tone ?

Kirsch : Kate has beautiful , feminine curves , and I did n't want her to lose a crazy amount of weight . The goal was to lengthen and tone her thighs and inner thighs , and keep her butt perky .

It was n't about dramatically changing her body ; I did n't want to do that . Just tighten , tone , lengthen .

CNN : What was the most difficult thing for Upton ? What was the easiest ?

Kirsch : Most difficult for her was the sprinting -- getting up to a sprint was challenging . And the easiest was the boxing and kickboxing , mostly because she loved kicking my ass !

CNN : Do you have a training motto or No. 1 rule for your clients ?

Kirsch : My training philosophy is sound mind , sound body . That is my No. 1 rule . That and follow my ABCs : no alcohol , bread or processed carbs .

CNN : What is the biggest obstacle people face in getting to the gym ?

Kirsch : I think the biggest obstacle for most people is that they do n't think they have the time to work out . But if you follow my advice and do my express workouts , or break your exercise into 10 - to 15-minute increments throughout the day , you 'll find that you have plenty of time to exercise in small doses .

CNN : What is the most common mistake you see people make while working out ?

Kirsch : They do n't subscribe to my mind-body philosophy of training ; they 're not doing the correct exercise for their body type , or they 're distracted , socializing , using PDAs instead of focusing and visualizing .

CNN : Give our readers the ultimate piece of advice -- something you 've learned over the years that they might not know .

Kirsch : The mind is more powerful than any muscle in our body . With our mind focused , we can will ourselves to unbelievable greatness .

We do n't imagine we 'll be posing on the cover of Sports Illustrated anytime soon , but maybe with Kirsch 's tips we wo n't be as afraid to shed our cover-ups come summer . Share your favorite workout or nutrition advice on Twitter with the hashtag #getfit .
