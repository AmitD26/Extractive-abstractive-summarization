Atlanta , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The optimism once held by many Americans has been `` beaten out '' of them amid a lagging economy , threat of terrorism and two ongoing wars , according to a professor at Emory University .

`` All of those things ... have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be , '' says Patrick Allitt , a British citizen who teaches American history .

Allitt recently wrote about what he describes as `` America the miserable '' -- the mood swing he has seen in his 30 years in the U.S. -- for The Spectator , a British magazine .

Allitt spoke with CNN about his perspective . Below is a transcript of that conversation , which has been edited :

CNN : How would you describe the change in America since you first came to America ?

Allitt : The change is this : I do n't get the same sense of intense self confidence as I used to feel when I first came to America , even though that was a period that 's usually remembered as a pretty grim time -- the Jimmy Carter years when there was a lot of stagnation and inflation and a general feeling of malaise . Even so , to me , it seemed incredibly energetic here . People in America worked much , much harder than they did in Britain . They seemed more upbeat . They had faith in progress . And there was this feeling of being intensely wide awake for the first time . But now , I think some of that optimism has been beaten out .

Counter : Why there 's reason for optimism

It 's been a very tough 10 years since 2001 , has n't it ? The attack on the World Trade Center , the growing fear of terrorism , the difficulty of prevailing in the wars , obviously , more recently the recession . All of those things , collectively , have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be .

CNN : Do you attribute it to a change in American mentality or are we exposed to an array of different beliefs through the ever-expanding media landscape ?

Allitt : It 's certainly true there are far more media than there used to be ... that devote a lot of time to people who are dissatisfied . In other words , if somebody 's happy , that is n't news . It 's certainly news when they become dissatisfied in some way or they have some kind of problem to deal with . In that sense , I suppose there 's an inherent bias in favor of bad news .

But I think it 's more than that . I 've spent most of the last 30 years in the company of academics , who also tend to be pessimistic people . They tend to have very high ideals for America . When they see it does n't live up to its ideals , it makes them disappointed and sometimes embittered . So it may be that , if I spent more time with less educated people , I would n't have this sense quite so acutely .

I think that 's quite possible .

CNN : You write : `` The decline of American confidence is n't just a temporary blip on the screen brought on by the recession . '' Elaborate on that for me .

Allitt : Even before this recession began , I guess it was in October and November 2008 when things really started to go bad . Already by then , I was having a feeling that the general national optimism was less emphatic than it used to be .

In the first five or six years of the last decade , there was this feeling that things were going wrong , particularly that the wars were grinding on interminably and that it was very difficult to prevail . It was n't the same kind of decisive conflict as World War II where you 're fighting against a nation-state and you can clearly detect when you 're winning . The dispersal of the enemy and the very shadowy character of terrorism tends to be very depressing to confront . You have to maintain a high degree of vigilance and sometimes you have to take comfort in thinking what 's extraordinary is what did n't happen ; there was n't another major attack .

That does n't feel like a victory . ... That kind of thing is what I was attentive to when I was writing this story .

CNN : If we are in this funk as you describe , is there anything wrong with that ? And how do we emerge from it ?

Allitt : The one thing I 've always admired about Americans is their willingness to be self-critical . I do think you could take the view that the very fact that so many Americans are willing to scrutinize their own behavior and their nation 's behavior is a sign that they do have these high ideals and they want to live up to them .

So in that sense , you can take an optimistic view , even of pessimism -- that sooner or later , the sheer attention to it is going to cause people to recover .

But I do think there are generational trends in American life . People who were brought up in the 1930s during the Great Depression -- the image of it stayed with them for a lifetime . ... In the same way , I expect the kids who have grown up in the last few years are also going to carry the marks of this with them through life . They 'll come into conflict with their own children who have different generational experiences . It 's impossible at this stage to say what 's going to happen next . ...

But it certainly is true studying the American past , you can see how various traumatic events through the nation 's history leave a long-term impression on the people themselves .

CNN : You kind of hint about this in your piece : Maybe you 're just going through a midlife crisis and that 's why you might have this view .

Allitt : I think that 's possible , but I think I 'm describing something more real than that . My job is to study the American people in the past ; but also to some extent in the present . I really do feel this kind of change has come about . But you ca n't quantify it . You ca n't say 8 out of 10 people are optimistic -- or at least if you try to you 're really giving a false sense of definiteness . So what I 'm trying to do is capture a mood and compare it to a mood that I saw previously .

... I still feel there 's an enormous amount of hope and potential and capability here , so I do n't share the feeling of gloom , which I see in the people around me .

CNN : Describe the `` Avatar '' analogy for me ?

Allitt : The plot -LSB- of `` Avatar '' -RSB- is kind of incredibly depressing . The corporation is at the center of this planet . First of all , they have invaded the planet . And now they 're sort of stomping on the homeland of the blue people who live there . And really the picture it gives you of America is incredibly depressing .

It shows Americans to be greedy and incredibly violent and intolerant , and they have n't got time for this anthropological experiment that 's going on .

But obviously , the hero is one of the Americans . He 's clearly an outsider . ... The main part of the story is a condemnation of America and its values . I was surprised how few reviewers said this picture is a grotesque distortion of what we 're really like .

CNN : Have you started receiving hate mail yet : Hey , Brit , get the hell out of our country ?

Allitt : No , not at all .

... It certainly is n't meant to be an attack on America ; quite the opposite . As I say , I 'm very , very pro-American .

CNN : Any final thoughts ?

Allitt : To me , coming from Britain , one thing that is so inspiring about the United States is people really believe in human equality and they really take it seriously and they try to make it a reality .

When I was growing up in Britain , nobody talked about equality . It 's a very hierarchical society in Britain , and everyone has their own place within the hierarchy and others are below them -- and then , what you 've got to do is stay in your place .

So it felt very liberating for me to come to America . Although obviously , this is n't a society where everybody is equal in practice . But at least this is a place where everybody tries hard to make sure that every kid really does have the opportunities to make the most of their own abilities .

And that 's a great thing . There have n't been many societies in the entire history of the world that have been like that .
