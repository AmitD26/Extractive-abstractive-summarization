-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Spanish leaders Barcelona gave Real Madrid hope of snatching the Spanish title after being held 0-0 at city rivals Espanyol on Saturday in a tense match that saw Daniel Alves sent off with half an hour to play .

Real can now cut the champions ' league lead to just one point by winning at home to third-placed Valencia on Sunday night , after which there will be five rounds to play .

The stalemate was the first time Barcelona had failed to score in La Liga since October , and came ahead of Tuesday 's Champions League semifinal first leg away to Inter Milan .

Should that match in Italy go ahead if European air travel resumes following the volcanic ash fallout from Iceland , Inter boss Jose Mourinho will have eagerly noted Espanyol 's success in nullifying Barcelona 's star-studded line-up .

Mid-table Espanyol lost 1-0 at the Nou Camp in December , but could have led at halftime in the first match between the two teams at the new Cornella-El Prat stadium .

Barcelona had hit the crossbar when winger Pedro 's cross deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni , but the home side created the better chances and should have scored just before halftime but Victor Valdes pushed striker Osvaldo 's shot onto the near post .

Alves was dismissed for a second booking in the 62nd minute after body checking Jose Callejon , but Espanyol could not take advantage of having an extra man .

Earlier on Saturday , fourth-placed Sevilla bounced back from the midweek defeat at struggling Valladolid to crush Sporting Gijon 3-0 , who had two players sent off .

Mali striker Fredi Kanoute opened the scoring in the eight minute after his initial header was blocked , and 13th-placed Gijon lost Mate Bilic to a second yellow card on 32 .

Kanoute 's strike partner Luis Fabiano doubled the lead eight minutes after halftime with a header from Adriano 's cross as the Brazilian made up for having an earlier effort ruled out for offside .

Jose Angel Valdes was sent off for a second booking with 10 minutes left after Alvaro Negredo went down clutching his face , and the Sevilla forward set up defender Cala from the resulting free-kick .

Villarreal claimed sixth place from Athletic Bilbao after beating Atletico Madrid 2-1 in the late match .

Argentine defender Diego Godin diverted in a 21st-minute corner and Italian forward Giuseppe Rossi made Atletico pay for calamitous defending just before halftime .

Argentina forward Sergio Aguero ended his recent goal drought with his 19th of the season with a volley from Jose Antonio Reyes ' pass in the 64th minute , but 10th-placed Atletico went down to a 15th league loss this season ahead of Thursday 's Europa League semifinal first leg against English club Liverpool .

Bilbao can move back into the top six with victory at Zaragoza on Sunday , while fifth-placed Mallorca face mid-table Osasuna .
