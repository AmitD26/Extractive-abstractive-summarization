-LRB- CNET -RRB- -- The imagined inventions of Victorian-era French novelist Albert Robida may be coming closer to reality .

Who , you ask ? Robida was an illustrator and writer for popular science-fiction magazines , and is sometimes compared to Jules Verne . In his 1890 novel `` Le Vingtieme siecle . La vie electrique , '' he described something called a `` telephonoscope . ''

Since then , we 've seen telephonoscopes -- basically videophones -- in everything from `` The Jetsons '' to `` Blade Runner . '' What we have n't seen is the videophone in our living rooms .

That may finally be changing .

The common use of videophones could happen through three technologies that separately are n't exactly considered bleeding edge today : high-speed Internet , a television , and Skype . Samsung says it will put the VoIP calling service Skype as an application on its televisions , allowing phone calls to be made on camera right from a couch , just like Jane Jetson talking into her TV set . The Samsung Skype-enabled TV follows similar announcements from Panasonic and LG at the Consumer Electronics Show in January .

The models will range from to $ 1,200 to $ 2,000 for Panasonic 's set . Samsung and LG have not yet announced how much they will charge .

The Skype on TV application should work similarly on all three models , which in turn should closely mimic the version of the application that many people use to make free PC to PC calls , or for a fee , PC to landline .

Skype accounts are free to set up and can be activated using the TV 's remote control right on the screen . The video calls will also be free , as will voice calls between Skype users .

Using Skype to call traditional landline and mobile phones is a few cents per minute . Calls can be answered while watching a program , but it 's not yet possible to both talk and continue to watch uninterrupted .

By the time these models actually hit stores in late spring there should be three TV makers offering Skype on their TVs . And not just any three TV makers , but the world 's largest overall -LRB- Samsung sells practically one of every five TVs sold -RRB- , the leader in plasmas -LRB- Panasonic -RRB- , and LG , which is close behind Samsung , selling 15 percent of all TVs .

While Robida wrote about the idea , AT&T did the most to advance the idea from the pages of Victorian sci-fi to actuality . Unfortunately its 1960s videophone system , known as the Picturephone , was a bust . Few ever signed up for the service because you had to reserve call times and pay a whopping $ 16 per minute .

The idea , however , was at least on the right track : making videophones accessible to normal folk . Today teleconferencing is a common tool for companies to put employees in different locations virtually , if not physically , in the same conference room .

But the high cost of the fancy systems from companies like Cisco and Hewlett-Packard does n't make them consumer-friendly . Cisco also announced at CES it would be offering a home version of its telepresence software sometime this year , and did not yet mention a price .

Videophones for the home have never really caught on in the way they have at businesses . Even versions of the concept built into a corded telephone did n't really generate much excitement . Usually this was a small screen attached to a phone base station and conversations had to take place wherever the phone was plugged in , which tended to be places like a dresser or a kitchen counter .

Video calls today can be made online . They 're easy and cheap , and of course do n't require the purchase of an pricey new TV . A computer with a built-in Webcam and a voice-over-IP service like Skype or a chat application like Yahoo Messenger usually suffice , but it is still an activity that 's attached to a computer , and therefore going to be intimidating to people who either do n't like or have trouble with technology .

TVs are far more accessible though . Now with major companies like Samsung , Panasonic , and LG pushing the idea of the TV as videophone , the concept does at least have the chance to catch on .

Consumer surveys show that people are beginning to buy Internet-connected TVs , which allow not just Skype calls , but also other activities on the TV that are normally confined to the computer .

That includes accessing Internet radio and video streaming from services like Pandora and Netflix , and social sites like Twitter , Facebook , and Flickr .

A survey of 800 U.S. consumers who bought TVs in January found that 27.5 percent of them have connected their new sets to the Internet , either through the TV itself or via an external device such as a game console or digital video box , according to iSuppli . And of those , almost 42 percent recently purchased a Web-connected TV .

And Skype likely wo n't be a brand new concept to a lot of those new TV owners . Skype already has over 521 million registered accounts , so there 's a built-in audience who is already signed up and knows how to use it .

But the quality may not be what some people expect , says DisplaySearch analyst Paul Gagnon .

`` Teleconferencing is inherently kind of a low-quality experience , especially in a consumer home . On a computer it works OK , but blown up to the size of the TV , I was n't terribly impressed with some of the demos at CES , '' he said .

And quality aside , even in terms of logistics , there 's a lot to consider . Even with an Internet-connected TV , you still need a decent Internet connection , and for a two-way video call , you have to have people on the other end with the same set up . In other words , `` it 's really early , '' Gagnon said .

Time will tell if videophones are just a fad or about to become an integral part of the modern idea of the `` connected living room . '' The tools are there , but it 's entirely possible that people do n't want to use their TVs like that .

Either way , even if the latest incarnation of Robida 's telephonoscope does n't gain widespread acceptance , he still has a decent track record for his prognostications . Other things he predicted in the same 1890 novel ? The use of submarines , helicopters , and biological warfare .
