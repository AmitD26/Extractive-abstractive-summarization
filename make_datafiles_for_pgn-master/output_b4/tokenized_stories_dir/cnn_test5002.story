-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Passenger David Martin knew the situation on Virgin America Flight 404 was unraveling Saturday when members of the flight crew began snapping at passengers .

One incident stands out for him from Saturday 's flight , which spent more than four hours on the tarmac at New York 's Stewart Airport after being diverted from New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport . Martin said he was rationing a limited number of cookies from first-class to mothers and children in coach when a passenger prone to outbursts asked him for a cookie . He was about to give her one when a flight attendant ordered her to sit down and told her she would not get a cookie .

`` Everyone knew she was a very frantic woman , which is why no one said anything when she asked for the cookie . ... Everyone understood but the flight attendant , '' said Martin , CEO of the social networking site Kontain.com , who documented Saturday 's travails using visual updates via the iPhone app to his Kontain account .

`` I went to her and said , you need to understand that speaking to passengers like this is not going to do any good . You need to exercise leadership and responsibility . ''

Martin said the flight attendant dismissed his words , as did the pilot when he took his concerns to the cockpit .

Martin said the situation did not improve until the flight was finally canceled , 4 1/2 hours after it parked at Stewart and nearly 12 hours after it took off from Los Angeles International , during which time passengers say they endured shortages of food and water , crying babies , panic attacks and rising tensions .

Severe storms and heavy winds paralyzed traffic entering and leaving JFK airport Saturday night , causing most flights to be diverted .

`` Although we can not control the weather or the circumstances , we agreed that we needed to have done a better job with making our guests more comfortable in a difficult situation , '' Virgin America spokeswoman Abby Lunardini said in an e-mail .

But if the delay had occurred a few weeks later , Virgin America might have faced more than $ 3 million in fines for staying on the tarmac for more than three hours .

Under the rule , which takes effect April 29 , airlines could be fined up to $ 27,500 per passenger for tarmac delays lasting more than three hours .

Passengers were offered two opportunities to leave the plane after it parked on the tarmac at Stewart , and 20 of the 126 passengers chose to do so , Lunardini said . Internal policy dictates that Virgin America will never hold guests longer than three hours without the ability to leave the aircraft , she said .

`` Although guests were able to leave the aircraft during Flight 404 , if the ruling were in place we would have made the decision to cancel at the 2-hour mark instead of the 3 - to 4-hour mark , which is our current practice , '' Lunardini said . `` We are in full compliance with existing rules and are prepared to be in full compliance with the new ruling when it is issued . ''

The Department of Transportation is investigating the Virgin America incident , said spokesman Bill Mosley .

`` The whole thrust behind the rule is to prevent passengers from being subject to that , to the delays in the aircraft , '' Mosley said .

American Airlines has joined JetBlue and Delta in requesting an exemption at JFK airport to the tarmac delay rule set , according to the Department of Transportation .

The closure of a major runway at JFK prompted the exemption requests , which would only apply to that airport for the duration of construction on the runway .

Even in situations when the flight can not operate , the rule would ensure that passengers are allowed to get off the plane and return to the terminal , Mosley said .

American echoed the concerns of JetBlue and Delta in its JFK exemption request .

`` Carriers , faced with increased operational difficulties as a result of constrained runway capacity just at the time the new tarmac delay rule goes into effect , and with the prospect of incurring $ 27,500 per passenger in fines , will inevitably cancel flights during challenging operational situations , '' the airline 's DOT request said .

Martin said he supports the idea of fining airlines for delays as an incentive to ensure that other passengers do n't have to endure the same experience .

`` I would like on my left to be the CEO of Virgin America and on my right , the CEO of JetBlue to vouch with me for this bill , '' he said . `` That 's the kind of leadership that 's required and demonstrates that these CEOs understand that passenger safety and customer service comes first . ''

Martin and his seatmate , `` Dancing with the Stars '' judge Carrie Ann Inaba , used Twitter and Kontain , respectively , to issue updates on their ordeal .

`` Was stuck on a plane for five hours on a Tarmac . They ran out of food , a woman was escorted off by police and I 'm grateful to new friends , '' Inaba tweeted at 11:14 p.m. , after the flight was officially canceled and remaining passengers were led off the plane .

Martin posted intermittent updates to Kontain.com using his iPhone app while the flight was in progress .

`` Tensions rising big time as we are grounded and passengers are trying to get off , '' he said in one post accompanied by a photo of passengers lining up in front of the cockpit to deplane .

`` Virgin crew losing control of passengers . Police now onboard here , '' he said in a later post .

On Sunday night , Martin says he received a phone call from Virgin America CEO David Cush telling him that he 'd seen his posts and expressing apologies .

Martin attributed his use of social media to convey the severity of the situation as a factor in Virgin America 's decision to refund passengers the cost of the airfare plus a $ 100 credit .

`` You ca n't just write in a complaint or call customer service anymore ... social media , it 's the only weapon , '' he said . `` Airlines need to be more terrified of that than the actual bill , because they 're going to have to compensate passengers anyway each time they get held up on the tarmac , but they 're also going to lose passengers because their brand will be destroyed every time a passenger uses social media .
