New Orleans , Louisiana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The federal agency responsible for overseeing the oil industry has been renamed amid a massive reform effort following the BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , the Department of the Interior announced Monday .

The Minerals Management Service will be called the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , according to an order signed by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar requesting the name change .

The announcement coincided with the swearing-in of the bureau 's new head , former Justice Department Inspector-General Michael Bromwich , who is tasked with overhauling the troubled government agency . Critics , including President Barack Obama , have said the MMS has too often catered to the interests of the industry it is responsible for policing .

A 2008 report from the Interior Department 's inspector-general found MMS employees received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them .

The agency has been thrust into the spotlight since the April 20 explosion of the drill rig Deepwater Horizon that triggered the worst oil spill in U.S. history .

As much as 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons -RRB- of oil may be gushing into the Gulf every day , government estimates found last week . Approximately 23,290 barrels of oil -- slightly more than 978,000 gallons -- were collected from the ruptured well in the 24-hour period ending at midnight Sunday , Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Monday .

`` The BP oil spill has underscored the need for stronger oversight of offshore oil and gas operations , more tools and resources for aggressive enforcement , and a more effective structure for the agency that holds companies accountable , '' Bromwich said in a statement Monday . `` We will move quickly and responsibly on our reforms . ''

Also Monday , a federal judge in New Orleans said he is set to rule within the next two days on whether to lift the Interior Department-ordered moratorium on deepwater drilling .

U.S. District Court Judge Martin Feldman said he will issue his decision between early Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon on whether to issue a preliminary injunction against the temporary ban .

The six-month moratorium , instituted by the government last month , halts all drilling in more than 500 feet of water and prevents new permits from being issued . Backers say it is necessary while a safety review is conducted after the Deepwater Horizon explosion . Opponents dispute its necessity and call it economically devastating in a region that is already reeling .

Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC , a company that provides boats and equipment to the offshore drilling industry , says in the lawsuit that the government has no evidence that existing operations pose a threat to the Gulf of Mexico .

Hornbeck and other oil service companies named as plaintiffs in the case say they want a court to declare the moratorium invalid and unenforceable . The office of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has filed a friend of the court brief in support of the plaintiffs .

Carl Rosenblum , an attorney for the plaintiffs , said Monday that the moratorium is `` an unprecedented industry-wide shutdown with the stroke of a pen . ''

`` This is about industry survival for deepwater drilling in the Gulf , '' he said .

Rosenblum said the airline industry was grounded for only three days after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .

Henry Dart , an attorney for the state of Louisiana , complained that Louisiana officials had not been consulted before the moratorium was enacted .

`` This is environmental disaster . Let 's not make an economic disaster , '' he said .

Brian Collins , an attorney for the Justice Department , insisted the suspension was necessary because it `` assures the public time to evaluate safety measures . ''

BP has agreed to set aside $ 100 million to compensate oil workers idled by the moratorium , company chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said last week .

A senior administration official told CNN on Monday the White House pushed for that compensation fund .

`` We believed we had legal means to push them on funds for workers affected by the moratorium , and they ultimately agreed to set $ 100 million aside , '' the official said .

BP said in a statement Monday that costs from the disaster now total about $ 2 billion , including the cost of the response , containment , relief well drilling , grants to Gulf states , claims paid and federal costs . To date , more than 65,000 claims have been submitted and more than 32,000 payments totaling more than $ 105 million have been made , the company said .

However , the man overseeing a $ 20 billion claims fund told CNN on Monday that he wants the claims payment process accelerated and its transparency increased .

`` We 've got to get the claims out quicker , we 've got to get them out with more transparency so claimants understand the status of their claim , and we 've got to ease the burden on these folks in the Gulf , '' Kenneth Feinberg said during an interview with John Roberts on CNN 's `` American Morning . ''

Emergency payments , he said , need to go out `` with less corroboration than you would if you 're giving a lump-sum payment that is the total compensation . For the emergency payments , we 've got to err on the side of the plaintiff . ''

Critics of the Obama administration have questioned Feinberg 's independence , saying he is on the White House payroll as executive compensation czar . That is wrong , Feinberg said : `` I 'm not on the payroll . I 'm doing the White House pay czar role pro bono , without compensation . ... I do n't think anybody will ultimately question the independence of this program . ''

BP , meanwhile , continues to struggle with its public relations efforts after the Gulf spill . Company CEO Tony Hayward , who was grilled during an appearance before Congress last week and then strongly criticized for attending a yacht race over the weekend , will not attend Tuesday 's World National Oil Companies Congress in London , according to a BP spokesman .

The spokesman cited Hayward 's `` commitment to the Gulf of Mexico relief effort '' as the reason for his decision not to attend the meeting .
