-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistan-born Usman Khawaja has become the first Muslim to be selected in an Australian cricket squad -- and could now play against his country of birth in Britain next month .

Khawaja , who was born in Islamabad but moved to Australia at the age of four , said he was `` shocked '' at being selected for the two-Test series , which was moved to England due to safety concerns in Pakistan due to last year 's extremist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team bus .

`` I was a bit shocked , I had a feeling I was close but that could mean absolutely nothing , '' he told Cricket Australia 's official website .

`` The feeling did n't really sink in straight away but I 've told my family and they 're really excited . ''

Khawaja , who is also a fully-qualified pilot , was named in a strong 14-man Australian side for the series which begins on July 13 .

The 23-year-old made headlines in 2008 when he became the first cricketer of Pakistani-Australian background to play first-class cricket in Australia , making his debut for New South Wales in an inter-state match against Victoria .

He is , however , not the first player from the sub-continent to represent Australia -- Sri Lanka-born Dav Whatmore played seven Tests in 1979-80 .

National selection panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said Khawaja 's inclusion in the squad was down to the player 's strong performances at state competition level , which saw him score 698 runs and three centuries last season .

`` Usman Khawaja has been selected on the back of some very strong Sheffield Shield performances , '' Hilditch said in a statement on Cricket Australia 's official website .

`` He is seen by the panel as being capable of batting anywhere in the order in Test cricket , but importantly for this particular series as a top-order batsman who could bat in the top four should the opportunity arise . ''

Fast bowler Ben Hilfenhaus also returned to the squad after missing out on the tour of New Zealand in March with knee tendonitis .

His inclusion is timely , as he is considered vital to Australia 's bid to regain the Ashes when England tour Down Under in November .

`` Ben Hilfenhaus has successfully returned from injury during the current Australia A series in Queensland , '' Hilditch said .

`` Ben was a critical member of our 2009 Ashes bowling group and it is very pleasing to see him back in the Test squad with the next Ashes series just around the corner . ''

Left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Johnson and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin have also been included after both recovered from elbow injuries .

The two Tests between Australia and Pakistan will take place at Lord 's in London on July 13-17 and Headingley in Leeds from July 21-25 .
