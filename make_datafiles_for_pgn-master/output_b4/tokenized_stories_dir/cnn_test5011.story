-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A world record was set recently in Houston , Texas . It was n't the world 's fastest quarter-mile run , the world 's largest pumpkin or even the world 's heaviest man . It was , however , as stunning to witness : the world 's largest senior citizen Wii bowling tournament , as confirmed by Guinness World Records .

The largest senior citizen Wii bowling tournament also included a health fair and immunization clinic .

The event , put on by TexanPlus -- the Houston area 's largest Medicare HMO -- drew more than 1,500 supporters and 600 senior bowlers to break a record but also to have fun and dish out a little bit of Texas-style competition and a side helping of health information .

`` I 'm in it to win it , '' one man said as he rolled his walker up to the foul line .

One booty-shakin ' grandma even showed off her victory dance after she Wii-bowled a strike .

Aside from a seniors-gone-wild moment , this event served a very important purpose : to encourage seniors to get stronger and fitter , possibly saving them from life-altering injuries .

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , falls are the leading cause of injury-related death in seniors .

A fall -- or , worse , a broken bone that limits a senior 's mobility -- can be the start of a downward spiral that ends up taking a life , says Dr. Sheldon Zinberg , founder of a senior fitness center called Nifty After Fifty .

`` Those , for example , who have hip fractures are likely not to be alive two years from now , '' Zinberg said . `` Fifty percent of them never get out of a nursing home . ''

Falls are among many concerns for seniors . To help address other life-threatening conditions , such as influenza , high blood pressure , high cholesterol and senior abuse , the event also included a health fair , an immunization clinic and demonstrations on `` cane-fu fighting , '' a method of self-defense that makes use of seniors ' canes to ward off attackers .

If you 're a senior and Wii bowling is n't up your alley , there are plenty of other steps you can take to prevent falls .

According to the American Association of Family Physicians , seniors can reduce their likelihood of falling by making changes in three key areas .

Make sure your home is safe

Remove objects that may get in your way as you walk , install night lights and handrails in bathrooms , and call friends or family members to take care of small projects that require the use of step-stools or ladders .

Talk with your doctor

Have your eyes checked for vision changes that may impair your depth perception , ask your doctor about medications that may make you dizzy or disoriented , and use a walking aid , such as a cane or a walker , if your physician recommends it .

Get your body in shape

Commit to regular exercise , even something as simple as a daily walk around the block . Exercise can help keep you mobile and flexible ; upper-body exercise in particular can help strengthen your breathing muscles . Also , limit your alcohol intake to less than two drinks a day , and if you smoke , quit .

As for the Wii bowlers , all the participants -- winners and runners-up -- reported that they were happy they came .

`` We were all good , '' participant Sarah Pilgreen said . `` I think its very important for us as we get older to stay in sports and whatever we can do . ''
