-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The NBA has fined the Cleveland Cavaliers owner $ 100,000 for remarks he made after LeBron James announced he was leaving the team .

NBA Commissioner David Stern said Monday that team owner Dan Gilbert 's words , `` though understandable , were ill-advised and imprudent . ''

In a letter posted on the team 's website Thursday , Gilbert called James ' decision to play for the Miami Heat a `` cowardly betrayal '' and a `` shocking act of disloyalty . ''

James , who joined the Cavaliers straight out of high school and played forward for the team for his entire career , announced his decision to leave the team during a much-ballyhooed ESPN special Thursday entitled `` The Decision . ''

In a press conference which was posted on the NBA 's website Monday , Stern said that James was `` certainly entitled '' to leave the team , but he would have advised the basketball star to handle his departure and announcement differently .

`` I think that the advice that he received on this was poor . But his performance was fine . His honesty and his integrity I think shine through , but this decision was ill-conceived , badly produced and poorly executed , '' Stern said .

Stern also criticized civil rights leader Jesse Jackson for comments he made saying Gilbert 's letter showed a `` property-owner 's mentality . ''

`` Equally imprudent I believe are the remarks by my good friend Jesse Jackson , which purport to make this into a racial matter ... he really is mistaken , '' Stern said .

Before deciding to join the Miami Heat , James , a reigning two-time NBA MVP , looked at several teams , including New York , Chicago and Cleveland .

He said it came down to one thing .

`` The major factor was the best opportunity to win now and to win in the future . '' James said .

He led the Cavaliers to the NBA finals in 2007 , where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs , but never reached the finals again , despite Cleveland management bringing in supporting stars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Antawn Jamison .
