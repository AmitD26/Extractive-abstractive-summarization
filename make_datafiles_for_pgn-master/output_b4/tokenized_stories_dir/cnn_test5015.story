-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The mother and father of missing Oregon boy Kyron Horman repeatedly urged stepmother Terri Horman to co-operate with police during a news conference Thursday .

`` I really want her to do the right thing , '' said Kyron 's mother , Desiree Young . `` Kyron is still out there and needs to be home . ''

Court records released Thursday revealed that Kaine Horman , the boy 's father , believes the stepmother is involved in Kyron 's disappearance .

The revelation was made public after a restraining order against Terri Horman was unsealed by Multnomah County court authorities in Portland .

The father alleges his wife knows what happened to Kyron , who was last seen at school more than one month ago .

`` I believe respondent is involved in the disappearance of my son Kyron who has been missing since June 4 , '' Horman wrote in his request for the restraining order . `` I also recently learned that respondent attempted to hire someone to murder me . The police have provided me with probable cause to believe the above two statements to be true . ''

The restraining order bars Terri Horman from having any contact with Kaine Horman or the couple 's 20-month-old daughter .

When asked by reporters at the Thursday news conference in Beaverton , Oregon , how he processed the information discovered in the restraining order he said , `` I did n't process it . It 's not important right now . Kyron is still missing . He 's still missing . ''

This is the second time in a week that the boy 's biological parents pleaded with the stepmother to work with investigators . But there have not been any changes since the earlier request , said Young . `` She is still not co-operating . ''

`` I 'm so angry , I do n't have the words , '' said Young . `` She is not taking an active role in trying to find Kyron . She is not telling the truth . ''

`` I 've known her for a long time , said Young , `` I know she 's lying . ''

All three adults have taken polygraph tests as the investigation into Kyron 's disappearance continues , said Kaine . Terri Horman was subjected to two , but did not pass either , he said .

Young and Kaine Horman said they have been totally blindsided by the disappearance of their son and by the events that followed .

Terri Horman 's lawyer could not be reached for comment later Thursday .

Lt. Mary Lindstrand said the Multnomah County Sheriff 's Office had no comment on the allegations made by Kaine Horman .

Authorities have not named any suspect or person of interest in connection with Kyron 's disappearance .

Asked if the department believes Kyron is alive , Lindstrand said , `` We are going with the premise , that , yes , Kyron is alive and we are going to bring him home . ''

Relatives of Kyron have said they are trying to keep the focus on finding the boy and not suspicions about the boy 's stepmother .

Kyron went missing after Terri Horman dropped him off at school on June 4 . The stepmother said she last saw Kyron walking down a hallway toward his second-grade classroom at Skyline Elementary School in Portland , according to police .

Sources told CNN affiliates that investigators believe that Terri Horman has lied to them , and cell phone records could show she was n't where she claimed to be .

Kyron 's family members said they hope people will focus more on the missing boy .

`` Our main goal is to keep Kyron in the front of everyone 's mind because we have a better chance of finding him . So we are constantly working to keep him the focus of the story and not Terri , '' the family members said in an e-mail .

Terri Horman was in the headlines Monday when CNN affiliates KGW and KATU reported that she had attempted to hire a landscaper to kill her husband several months ago .

KGW reported that sources believe Terri Horman approached the landscaper , who had been working on the family 's property in northwest Portland , and offered the man `` a large sum of money '' to kill Kaine Horman .

Repeated efforts by CNN to reach Terri Horman have been unsuccessful .
