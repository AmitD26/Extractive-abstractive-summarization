-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Power outages in Connecticut , rail service disruptions in Washington and warnings to conserve electricity in New York City mark the second day of the Northeast heat wave .

As many as 9,000 customers of Connecticut Light and Power in Stamford were without electrical service Tuesday , according to the power company 's website . A heat-related transformer failure at a substation in Stamford caused the outage , according to a spokeswoman for the utility company .

Temperatures reached 100 Tuesday in Stamford , according to the National Weather Service .

In Washington , at least one rail line was delayed when Metrorail officials found a `` heat kink '' on the Red Line . A kink occurs in extremely hot weather when overheated tracks expand but ca n't be constrained by cross ties or ballast , and when a kink is found , train speed is reduced to ensure passenger safety , Metro said . Track inspectors will continue to monitor all conditions should other tracks become affected .

New York residents -- advised by Con Ed Power to conserve electricity during the heat wave -- did just that , company spokeswoman Joy Faber said .

`` No usage records were broken in the city or the state , '' she said Tuesday .

Earlier in the day at a media briefing with reporters , a Con Ed official had feared that Tuesday 's usage rate would surpass the record of 13,141 megawatts set in August of 2006 . Faber said later that usage peaked Tuesday -- as New York temperatures hit 103 degrees in some places , according to the National Weather Service -- at 12 , 963 megawatts .

Even without a record-setting day , residents were still being encouraged to cut back on electricity consumption , officials said .

`` Postpone using large appliances , turn out lights , use fans instead of air conditioners , or if you have to use an air conditioner , set it at 78 -LRB- degrees -RRB- , '' said Con Ed spokesman John Miksad .

`` This is a team effort , '' he said . `` We will get through this . ''

As many as 400 cooling stations have opened in New York 's five boroughs , according to the Office of Emergency Management . OEM Commissioner Joe Bruno urged people to utilize the center , and advised neighbors to check on neighbors to make sure they are well .

`` This is a significant health emergency as well as a heat emergency , '' Bruno said .

The heat wave has claimed one life . A 92-year-old woman was found dead in her home in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , according to the medical examiner 's office . The woman , who was found by a neighbor , had opened a few windows in her home but did not have air conditioning , said a medical examiner 's spokesman .

Heat advisories remain in effect through Wednesday evening for much of the Northeast , according to the National Weather Service , which also issued an additional `` excessive heat warning '' to be in effect until 8 p.m. Wednesday for Philadelphia ; Trenton , New Jersey ; and parts of Delaware .

Weather service officials are advising people to stay indoors as the prolonged heat and humidity creates a `` dangerous situation . ''

`` Be sure to check on your elderly relatives and neighbors . Coaches , trainers , camp counselors should remain alert for signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke , '' the weather service warned .
