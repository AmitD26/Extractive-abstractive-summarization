New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An EMT worker who was involved in a controversial incident in which a pregnant woman died last year was shot and killed Sunday , New York police said .

Authorities said they had no immediate link between the EMT 's shooting and the widely publicized case last year but that would be an aspect of their investigation .

`` That part of the case will be investigated by NYPD . We will be in touch with Manhattan detectives who will be investigating the murder -LRB- of the EMT -RRB- , '' Brooklyn District Attorney spokesman Jerry Schmetterer .

The case involving the EMT -- Jason Green -- and a pregnant woman occurred in Brooklyn last December 9 .

The woman , Eutisha Rennix , was working as a waitress at a cafe when she collapsed . Rennix 's coworkers said Green and a fellow EMT were in the cafe when Rennix collapsed but the two EMTs reportedly told the co-workers to call 911 and left the cafe without aiding the stricken woman .

Rennix later died at a hospital .

A spokesman for the EMT and paramedics union said after the incident that Green and his colleague were medical dispatchers and that they did not work with patients . The spokesman added that Green 's colleague made a 911 emergency call herself in an effort to get help for the stricken woman .

Following the incident , the fire department suspended the two EMTs without pay for but were reinstated shortly thereafter , EMT spokesman Robert Ungar said Sunday .

`` He -LRB- Green -RRB- was an EMT with the emergency medical services bureau of the fire department for seven years . He was working as a dispatcher and was back on duty at the time of his death -LRB- Sunday -RRB- . At the time of the previous investigation , the law only provides for suspension of workers up to 30 days . '' Ungar said .

Green , 31 , was shot outside a downtown Manhattan nightclub at about 5 a.m. Sunday . Police said that Green was shot once in the face and was pronounced dead at a hospital .

No arrests had been made as of Sunday afternoon , and NYPD homicide Detective Richard Tireli said that `` the investigation is ongoing . ''

Meanwhile Brooklyn authorities said Sunday their investigation into Rennix 's death was continuing .

`` Our involvement is with the incident at the cafe and it 's currently still open . The investigation was if there was any criminality involved and if they have violated any criminal laws ... The case is nearing completion and every angle will be investigated . '' Schmetterer of the Brooklyn district attorney 's office said .
