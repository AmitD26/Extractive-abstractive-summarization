WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A member of Congress Friday called on the State Department to stop doing business with Xe , the North Carolina-based security company formerly known as Blackwater Worldwide .

Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D-Illinois , on Friday urged the State Department `` not to enter into further contracts '' with Xe .

Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D-Illinois , asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton whether the State Department had just signed a new $ 20 million dollar contract with Xe for Iraq , saying she is `` very concerned '' that the State Department may be signing new security contracts with Xe , both in Iraq and Afghanistan .

`` I urge you not to enter into further contracts with Xe and to immediately review any existing contracts , '' the letter said , according to a copy provided to CNN . `` The behavior and actions of both the company 's leadership and a number of individuals employed by the company have harmed our mission in Iraq and Afghanistan and endangered the lives and welfare of our troops and diplomatic personnel serving overseas . ''

The State Department decided in January not to renew a personnel protection contract with Blackwater , as the company was then known , when it expired in May . That decision came amidst an investigation by both U.S. and Iraqi authorities of a 2007 shooting involving Blackwater guards in Baghdad in which 17 Iraqis were killed . The company has repeatedly denied any wrong-doing .

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request Friday for reaction to Schakowsky 's questions and criticism . The State Department had said that it would continue a Blackwater air-support contract after the much-larger personnel protection contract ended .

Xe spokeswoman Stacy DeLuke told CNN that , `` Right now we have no contracts with the State Department in Iraq . ''

DeLuke said the company would review calls for bids to provide security for U.S. officials in Afghanistan .

`` The thing is we are totally open to bidding on some of the contracts that may come up in Afghanistan just like anyone else , '' DeLuke said in a telephone interview .

The Nation magazine released an article Friday that said the State Department had signed a new contract for Iraq with Xe for $ 20 million to extend an earlier aviation contract .

`` The State Department contract is scheduled to run through September 3 . In May , the State Department announced it was not renewing Blackwater 's Iraq contract , and the Iraqi government has refused to issue the company an operating license , '' the article said .

The controversy over the role of Blackwater in Iraq was revived earlier this week by a lawsuit filed in Virginia by two former employees accusing Blackwater guards of smuggling weapons and using excessive force in Iraq . And the lawsuit claims Blackwater founder Erik Prince `` views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe . ''

Xe said in a statement that it would respond `` to the anonymous unsubstantiated and offensive assertions put forward by the plaintiffs , '' in a brief to be filed August 17 .

Blackwater changed its name to Xe in February .
