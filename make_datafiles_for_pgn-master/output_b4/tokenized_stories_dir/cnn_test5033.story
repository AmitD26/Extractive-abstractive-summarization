-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With her weight-loss challenge , Shape Up Vicksburg , Linda Fondren is helping her Mississippi hometown banish the bulge .

Through the group 's free fitness activities and nutrition classes , Vicksburg residents have lost nearly 15,000 pounds to date .

Below are Fondren 's thoughts on being chosen as a Top 10 CNN Hero for 2010 .

Q : Where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero ?

Linda Fondren : I had gathered my assistant together in my office -LSB- at my gym -RSB- to discuss the details of Shape Up Vicksburg -- Get Healthy Walk . ... When I answered the phone and heard , `` This is CNN , '' I thought , `` Oh ! A follow-up of how things are going . '' It did not cross my overloaded mind about being a CNN Top 10 Hero . ... But there was something different in the caller 's voice .

My attention -LSB- was focused on -RSB- the present moment . I wanted to do so much more and had been looking into grants , donations , anything to keep me going . My eyes watered first as I clutched the phone a little tighter . She explained something about the Blue Ribbon Panel and said `` selected as one of the Top 10 . '' I had to contain my emotions , as my office has a glass door , so members of the gym can see me .

Containing my excitement , I turned my chair away from the glass door and looked at the blue sky . I was overjoyed , my heart sang with moments of `` Thank you , thank you , thank you ! '' It was going pitter-pat , pitter-pat , but I know it 's OK because I work out !

Q : What does it mean for the Blue Ribbon Panel to select you as a Top 10 Hero ?

Fondren : I feel like a gift has been given and I can really use it to help others who are struggling . ... I feel like someone is paying attention , and I feel extremely honored . The Blue Ribbon Panel consists of heroes picking another hero . I feel like -LSB- they -RSB- are celebrating and helping another person make a difference in the lives of many .

Q : What do you want people to know most about your work ?

Fondren : Shape Up Vicksburg brought something magical to the community . We learned others ' life stories . We planted something new in the state of Mississippi that people would n't expect . And , most importantly , we are healthier .

I hope that Shape Up Vicksburg can show that we are all heroes when we are responsible . We are heroes when we serve as examples ... and help each other .
