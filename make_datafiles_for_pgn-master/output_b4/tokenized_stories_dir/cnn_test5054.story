Kiev , Ukraine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The final results from Ukraine 's presidential election on Wednesday showed former Prime Minister Victor Yanukovich winning a close race , but an official declaration of a victor was still to come .

Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has refused to concede defeat and plans to demand a recount in some districts , officials from her party , Bloc Tymoshenko , said Tuesday .

The tally from the Central Election Commission from Sunday 's runoff showed Yanukovich holding 48.95 percent of the vote , and Tymoshenko claiming 45.47 percent . Nearly seven in 10 registered voters showed up at the polls .

Yanukovich 's supporters rallied outside the commission Tuesday and vowed not to leave until their candidate was named the winner , Ukrainian news agencies and state media reported .

In an exclusive interview with CNN on Tuesday , Yanukovich called on Tymoshenko to accept defeat and remember the pro-Western Orange Revolution that swept her to power .

`` This country has been democratic for five years , and that 's been proven again by this election , '' he said . `` Yulia Tymoshenko is betraying the principles of her Orange Revolution '' by failing to acknowledge defeat .

A Yanukovich win would put the finishing touches on a remarkable comeback for the former prime minister five years after he was ousted in a populist uprising .

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich by telephone Tuesday , the Kremlin said .

`` Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich on the completion of the election campaign , which was highly rated by international observers , and the success achieved at the presidential election , '' a Kremlin statement news statement said .

Appearing on television after the polls closed Sunday night , Yanukovich said his opponent should begin preparations to step down .

But officials from Tymoshenko 's party said Tuesday that she has evidence of election fraud and intends to demand a recount in some districts .

The two politicians have fought a bitter battle .

Yanukovich has strong links to Russia , and a checkered election history . In 2004 , he was declared the winner of the presidential election before the ballot 's legitimacy was questioned and he was accused of stealing the race .

`` The country remembers times when there were presidents announced , they received congratulations , and then things changed , '' Tymoshenko said Sunday , referring to the 2004 race .

A pro-Western uprising , known as the Orange Revolution , followed . Yanukovich 's win was annulled , and current President Victor Yushchenko won the re-vote .

Yushchenko ran for a second term this year , but , blamed for Ukraine 's faltering economy , he did not make the runoff .

This year 's elections , by contrast to those in 2004 , got a clean bill of health from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which sent observers .

The OSCE hailed the process as `` professional , transparent and honest , '' saying it should `` serve as a solid foundation for a peaceful transition of power . ''
