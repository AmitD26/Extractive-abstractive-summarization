The new entity would be the biggest in the US , combining AT&T 's 95 million customers with T-Mobile 's 34 million users for a total of 130 million subscribers .

AT&T said the transaction would quickly provide `` the spectrum and network efficiencies necessary ... to address impending spectrum exhaust in key markets '' due to the exponential growth of traffic on its network .

The telecom giant added that it expects to gain enough cell towers through the deal to increase its network density by 30 % .

As part of the merger , AT&T committed to expand its 4G network 1.2 million square miles , making it accessible to an additional 46.5 million Americans , mostly in rural and smaller communities , the statement said .

The AT&T release notes that its 4G expansion would help achieve the Federal Communications Commission and President Obama 's goals to connect `` every part of America to the digital age . ''

The $ 39 billion purchase will include a $ 25 billion cash payment ; the remainder will be paid using AT&T stock . AT&T can increase the cash portion of the payment by up to $ 4.2 billion while cutting the stock portion .

AT&T did n't directly address how the merger would affect the new company 's pricing . But on the website it built to announce the deal , www.mobilizeeverything.com , it notes : `` Historically , during periods when carriers combined to achieve efficiencies , U.S. wireless prices fell . ''

The company also cites a 2010 report from the U.S. General Accounting Office which found that the average cost of wireless services -LRB- adjusted for inflation -RRB- `` declined 50 percent from 1999 to 2009 , during a period which saw five major wireless mergers . '' The agreement has been approved by the boards of directors at both AT&T and Deutsche Telekom , but will be subject to regulatory approval .

Charles Golvin from Forrester Research said : `` AT&T 's acquisition of T-Mobile , if approved , brings good news and bad news . The good news : high-speed mobile broadband service will improve in quality and coverage , including ? in the long run ? those in rural communities outside the reach of terrestrial broadband today .

`` The bad news : the cost of that service wo n't come down nearly as fast as customers would like , since AT&T and Verizon Wireless combined would own nearly three out of every four wireless subscriptions in the US . While clearly troublesome for Sprint and other mobile smaller mobile competitors , It 's also bad news for cable operators , whose incipient mobility products will suffer in comparison to what AT&T and Verizon can offer .
