THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Hi ! We 're launching a special edition of CNN Student News this week . As the space shuttle program wraps up , we 're taking a look back - and a look forward - at NASA 's space program .

First Up - Last Shuttle Launch

AZUZ : The U.S. has been launching shuttles for 30 years . They are the world 's first re-usable spacecraft . They launch like a rocket and land like a plane .

Atlantis , Challenger , Columbia , Discovery and Endeavour : These five orbiters have launched more than 600 astronauts into space . This video you 're seeing right here highlights some of their achievements .

Over the course of 134 shuttle flights , these crews have logged millions of miles in space and carried thousands of tons of cargo . The space shuttle has served as America 's main transport for crews and supplies to the international space station . Shuttle crews have also repaired space equipment , like the Hubble Telescope . They 've launched new satellites , and they 've done experiments that ca n't be done on Earth .

When the shuttle was first announced , the idea was that shuttle launches would be cheap enough to happen every week . But it actually costs about half a billion dollars to launch a shuttle , and NASA only ever planned a few missions each year .

So , what 's NASA 's plans for the shuttles ' retirement ? Each one of them will become an exhibit in museums across America . So maybe one day , you might even get to go inside one .

Now , we 're going to hear from someone who not only gets to go inside a shuttle , he gets to fly in one too : the commander of Atlantis 's latest mission , speaking a few weeks before the last scheduled mission .

CHRISTOPHER J. FERGUSON , ATLANTIS COMMANDER : I do n't think that the full magnitude of the moment will really hit us until the wheels have stopped on the runway . I 'm not sure words will really be able to capture -- for the crew and for the entire shuttle work force -- just how much the shuttle program has meant to us for the last 30 years .

Shoutout

CHERYL CASTRO , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Time for the Shoutout ! Which constellation is named for a hunter in Greek mythology ? If you think you know it , shout it out ! Is it : A -RRB- Capricorn , B -RRB- Orion , C -RRB- Ursa Major or D -RRB- Scorpio ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Orion is the mythological hunter who can also be found in the stars . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout !

NASA 's Next Steps

AZUZ : Orion is also the name of a new program at NASA . It 's expected to be the replacement for the space shuttle program . Americans could be headed back to the moon or into deep space toward Mars . Now , those missions are a long way off . Part of the Orion program did go on the road recently though , and WTXL reporter Greg Angel got a chance to check it out .

DMARCUS MCDONALD , STUDENT : It flies into space and looks at stars or moons or other planets .

GREG ANGEL , WTXL REPORTER : Dmarcus McDonald is talking about Orion . This capsule , touted as the future of NASA , expected to one day carry man into deep space .

CHARLES OHBAUGH , NASA ASTRONAUT : What this vehicle will allow us to do is hopefully go beyond lower Earth orbit , on to the moon and hopefully to Mars , ultimately , is our goal .

ANGEL : But 34 million miles from Mars , here on Earth , Orion is getting a lot of attention during this special stop in Tallahassee . Dee Arnold drove in from Valdosta , Georgia to check it out before Orion is taken to its final destination at Kennedy Space Center .

DEE ARNOLD , VALDOSTA , GEORGIA : I just like things that go on with the space program , and I just think it 's awesome . I just wanted to see the next thing that NASA was going to do , the next part of space explorations .

NASA ANNOUNCER : Three ... two ... one ... launch !

ANGEL : The Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle , as it 's called , will likely be in line to replace the shuttle program .

LINDA SINGLETON , NASA : We 're excited and very passionate about the work we do on this program , and we hope to launch our first orbital test flight as early as 2013 , so we 're ready to get on with the next program .

ANGEL : While there 's still a lot of work to be done , according to NASA , this spacecraft should eventually be capable of sustaining a crew of up to six astronauts on deep space missions that could last anywhere from six days for a lunar fly-by , to up to 900 days for a Mars exploration mission .

Blog Promo

AZUZ : There 's debate among scientists on this issue and we know you 've got some opinions on it , too . Where should America go next ? To the moon ? Trips to Mars ? Somewhere else ? Or should we just stay home ? Send us your thoughts about the end of the shuttle program and the start of the next space program on our blog . You 'll find that at CNNStudentNews.com .

Goodbye

AZUZ : Before we go , the shuttle program may be on its last Endeavour . And NASA 's not likely to find the lost continent of Atlantis . But that does n't mean the agency is n't going to be looking for its next Discovery . So , while NASA moves forward , we 'll leave you with a look back . We hope you 're enjoying your summer so far . For CNN Student News , I 'm Carl Azuz .
