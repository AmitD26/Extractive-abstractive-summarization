Back in January , the television icon officially announced that he would be stepping down from `` Live ! '' after co-hosting for nearly 28 years .

Philbin said of his retirement from the show at the time , `` There is a time that everything must come to an end for certain people on camera , especially certain old people . '' The Emmy-winner joked on Tuesday , `` Last January I made the announcement that I 'll be moving on . But I never gave you an exact date . So I 'm pushing it back five years . Just kidding . ''
