-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- William Beach was one of those people who fixated on certain foods . He would eat the same thing voraciously for a few days , and then , when he tired of the same tastes , he moved onto something else .

In August , when summer 's heat seemed unending in Mustang , Oklahoma , Beach took to savoring fried chicken -- and soft , sweet cantaloupe .

Beach was elderly -- 87 -- but after eating the fruit , his health declined rather suddenly and before anyone in his family knew what was wrong , he was dead .

He is among 15 people who died from Listeria monocytogenes in what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998 .

The bacteria was traced to Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms ' fields in Granada , Colorado . As of Monday , the outbreak had affected people in 19 states .

The CDC first reported it publicly on September 12 , six days after William Beach 's family buried him .

Listeria ? What 's that ?

Beach and his wife Monette bought the tainted cantaloupe at a Homeland grocery , where the store motto says : `` the best is fresh . ''

A week after he ate the fruit , Beach felt malaise , perhaps not unusual for a man of 87 years . But then his face turned the shade of a tomato . Soon he had trouble breathing and collapsed on the living room floor , according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms .

Monette heard him struggling to pull himself up off the floor .

She hobbled into the room with her cane and saw her husband of 67 years unable to speak , unable to get up .

She dialed 911 and an ambulance whisked Beach to Baptist Hospital in nearby Oklahoma City . He was discharged the next day but when he got worse at home , he returned to the hospital .

One of Beach 's six daughters , Brenda Hathaway met her father at the emergency room . Beach told her he did n't want Monette to see him this way .

Listeriosis causes fever , muscle aches , diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms . It is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults , according to the CDC , but it is particularly dangerous for pregnant women and the elderly or people with weakened immune systems .

On the evening of September 1 , medical staff tried to intubate Beach but he began hemorrhaging from the mouth and nose , the court documents said . Soon after , he died .

Monette never saw her husband alive again . Two days after his funeral , an official from the Oklahoma State Department of Health called Hathaway .

She was told then that her father had tested positive for Listeria .

Hathaway 's sister Debbie Frederick said the family wondered why it took the hospital two days to release her father 's body . They had assumed he died of natural causes .

`` We knew it was some sort of infection , but we did not know what it was , '' she said .

But Listeria ? She had never even heard that word before .

What you need to know about Listeria

Health officials began questioning Beach 's daughters . What had he eaten in the weeks prior ? They specifically asked if he had consumed cantaloupes .

Frederick , meanwhile , glued herself to her computer , determined to learn more about the illness that killed her father .

`` Doing all that reading , it became patently clear that the health departments knew there was an issue , '' she said . `` They knew there was a Listeria problem . ''

The Beach family 's angst led to a lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms . Frederick said she hopes the lawsuit will help strengthen food safety laws .

`` It 's a terrible thing to lose someone you love to something that could be prevented , '' she said . `` I pray that it 's over . I hope nobody else has to lose a loved one . ''

Battling the bacteria

In Littleton , Colorado , Jeni Exley 's parents , Herbert and Elaine Stevens , were getting ready to celebrate 60 years of marriage on September 8 .

They still had a good life together . Despite his age -- 84 -- he felt spry enough to take the dogs out for a walk in their Littleton neighborhood . He let Elaine do most of the grocery shopping and cooking but he could make his own sandwiches for lunch .

How to keep your food safe

In early August , Elaine came home from the nearby King Soopers market with half a Jensen Farms cantaloupe . She did n't buy the whole thing -- it was only the two of them . Besides , she liked to able to see through the cellophane and decide if it was ripe enough .

She and Herbert both ate the lush fruit . Herbert started to feel sick , just like William Beach .

Four days before Beach was rushed to hospital in Oklahama , Stevens could n't get up from the toilet in Colorado . He had a fever of 103 degrees and felt nauseous .

Elaine called an ambulance which ferried her husband to Littleton Adventist Hospital . Unlike the Beach family , Stevens ' daughters learned after a few days that their father was infected with Listeria .

Exley , 55 , like Frederick , went online to learn more about the bacteria that had sickened her father . Health officials , after questioning Elaine about what the couple had eaten in the last few weeks , determined that Herbert Stevens was a part of the latest outbreak .

After antibiotic therapy , Stevens was transferred to a nursing home . Exley arrived on her parents anniversary with chocolate milkshakes in hand . But her father was n't feeling well . He was sent back to the hospital when his condition worsened .

Stevens eventually regained some of his strength . He was sent to a skilled nursing facility to recuperate on September 19 , the same day that the Food and Drug Administration announced it had found Listeria monocytogenes in samples of Jensen Farms ' Rocky Ford cantaloupes .

Stevens ' Listeria is gone but at that age , he will probably never return to the man he was , Exley said . A little bit of him went with his bout with the bacteria .

He uses a walker now to move around ; all his body functions seem affected , Exley said .

`` I think it is amazing that he even survived , '' she said . `` I am surprised he is not one of those people who died . ''

The Stevens are also suing Jensen Farms in hopes of recouping some of their medical costs .

Exley , who loves cantaloupe , feels extremely lucky her family escaped tragedy . She , too , had bought some of the tainted fruit and received an automated phone call at home warning her about the recall .

She , like Frederick , thought she could trust what she was buying at the neighborhood grocery store . From now on , she will think twice . And fill her shopping cart with apples and oranges instead .
