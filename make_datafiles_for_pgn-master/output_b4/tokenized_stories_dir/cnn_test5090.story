-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mohammed Bin Hammam has promised to reform FIFA 's corruption-tainted top echelons if he is successful in ending the 13-year reign of its president Sepp Blatter in the June 1 elections .

The head of the Asian Football Confederation threw his name into the hat on Friday to end the prospect of the 75-year-old Blatter being re-elected unopposed .

`` I will always put in mind and consider among other things ... the demands from the public to keep FIFA and football organizations above accusations and suspicion of negative practice , '' Bin Hammam told reporters on Friday .

`` I will always put into consideration the need of economically-underprivileged member associations to have more technical and financial support to enable them to close the gap between their nations and those of the advanced football nations . ''

Vote for Blatter -- or ` None of the Above ' ?

The last time Blatter faced a battle was in 2002 , when he defeated Africa 's Issa Hayatou by 139 votes to 56 despite his campaign being run amid claims of corruption and financial mismanagement .

FIFA 's 24-man executive committee has again been mired in controversy , with two of its members suspended last November ahead of the decision on which countries would host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups , following an investigation into alleged bribery for votes .

Bin Hammam , in his third term as AFC president , said he will replace that committee with an expanded 41-member FIFA Board if he is elected , giving more representation to the world 's regional confederations .

`` I propose UEFA gets four more seats , CAF four more seats , Asia four more seats , CONCACAF three more seats , CONMEBOL one more seat and OFC one more seat , '' the 61-year-old Qatari said , adding that he had the support of the AFC executive committee .

`` A new executive committee will be coming , 40 members plus the president is 41 , and it will avoid as much as possible for the privilege of the casting vote going to the president . ''

Bin Hammam said he would also create a new `` executive office '' headed by the FIFA president and the six confederation leaders to implement the board 's decisions .

`` I will decentralize the activities of the FIFA administration . The legal matters , like the statutes and international transfers , and statutory issues can be handled directly by the confederations under the supervision of their executive bodies , '' he said .

He also vowed to make football 's governing body more transparent , with a new proactive body to replace the existing Ethical Committee , which presently rules only after acts have happened .

Bin Hammam will face a difficult task to convince FIFA 's 208 member nations that he should replace Blatter , who has presided over a $ 1.28 billion profit following the success of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa .

Blatter 's committee awarded Qatar the 2022 tournament despite serious concerns over the emirate 's infrastructure and intensely-hot weather , while Russia was a surprise winner of the right to host in 2018 .
