HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Zimbabwe 's prime minister believes the driver of the truck that struck his car , killing his wife , deliberately drove toward them , his party told CNN .

Morgan Tsvangirai leaves the hospital Saturday after being treated for injuries from a car crash .

Members of his political party , the Movement for Democratic Change , and former U.S. diplomat also say the crash raises suspicions of foul play .

The prime minister left a hospital Saturday , a day after his wife , Susan , was killed in the collision , officials said .

A ball cap covered Tsvangirai 's bandaged head .

Tsvangirai was taken to a hospital in Gaborone , Botswana , on Saturday for medical treatment , a Botswanan government source and a source with the prime minister 's party .

`` He 's badly bruised and is receiving treatment , '' the Botswanan government source said .

The source with the prime minister 's party said Tsvangirai will return to Zimbabwe on Wednesday to attend the funeral of his wife .

The couple , who were married in 1978 , have six children .

The crash happened on a two-lane highway between Tsvangirai 's hometown , Buhera , and the capital , Harare .

It comes only weeks after the start of a power-sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival , President Robert Mugabe .

Tsvangirai 's political party said Friday that it was too early to tell whether the crash was anything other than an accident .

But on Saturday , MDC members told CNN that Tsvangirai thought the crash was deliberate .

Tendai Biti , the MDC secretary-general , speaking during a tearful press conference , said Tsvangirai should have had better security . Watch how the accident threatens to derail the unity government ''

`` If there had been a police escort maybe what happened yesterday could have not have happened , '' Biti said .

'' -LRB- A -RRB- police escort would have warned oncoming vehicles of a VIP arriving . I think authorities must understand the omission .

`` We hope that this omission will be rectified , that the prime minister must be given the protection that ought to be accorded to a prime minister . ''

Biti said the MDC would launch its own investigation .

Analysts say the crash raises suspicions of foul play . One former U.S. diplomat called for an outside investigation , saying it was not the first time one of Mugabe 's political foes had been killed or injured in a car crash .

Tsvangirai , Zimbabwe 's main opposition leader , took office last month under a power-sharing deal with Mugabe following a contentious election .

The MDC reached the agreement with Mugabe in September after months of angry dispute that included violence . More than 200 deaths , mainly opposition supporters , were reported leading up to and after the election .

`` I 'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure , '' said Tom McDonald , the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001 . `` President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it 's sort of his M.O. , of how they get rid of people they do n't like . '' Watch more on the fatal crash ''

McDonald cited the car crash deaths of Defense Minister Moven Mahachi in 2001 , Employment Minister Border Gezi in 1999 and Elliot Manyika , a government minister and former regional governor , last year .

`` So when I hear that Tsvangirai was in an accident , it gives me pause , '' McDonald said .

Now an attorney with the Washington law firm Baker Hostetler , he urged a full independent investigation .

However , he added that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe . The highway Tsvangirai was traveling on was only two lanes and tractor-trailers were common , McDonald said . Vehicles in the country were often in bad shape and drivers inexperienced .

`` It 's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things , '' he said .
