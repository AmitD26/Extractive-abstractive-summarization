-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- John Terry shrugged off his off-field problems to save Chelsea from a damaging defeat by English Premier League rivals Tottenham on Thursday .

The England captain was named to lead his club a day after being charged by police for alleged racial abuse , and made a crucial goal-line clearance in time added on to secure a 1-1 draw .

Defeat would have left Chelsea five points behind their third-placed London rivals , but the result kept the battle for European Champions League places finely poised as the season nears the halfway stage .

The build-up to the match was dominated by confirmation of Terry 's February 1 court case for remarks he allegedly made to Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand .

`` Since the situation he has improved , '' said Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas , who called the result a `` moral win . ''

`` He has grown in terms of performance . He 's a reference point for this team . It shows his character and strength and personality . His effort for the collective is extraordinary . ''

Racism rows damage brand of the ` beautiful game '

Aware of a potential powder-keg atmosphere , home team Tottenham warned fans that ground stewards would be wearing head cams to record any inappropriate behavior .

Spurs made the perfect start when Emmanuel Adebayor scored his ninth league goal this season in the eighth minute , forcing home Gareth Bale 's low cross after teammate Sandro stole the ball from Daniel Sturridge near halfway .

Sturridge wasted a golden chance to level soon after , but the 22-year-old striker made amends in the 23rd minute when he buried Ashley Cole 's cross -- a goal that left Spurs furious as the England leftback appeared to control the ball with his hand .

Sturridge 's veteran forward partner Didier Drogba nearly made it 2-1 on the half hour but hit the post after chesting down a cross and firing in a fierce left-foot shot .

Footballers are TV stars , and should act like it

On-loan Manchester City striker Adebayor had the ball in the net again just before the hour , but it was ruled out for offside .

Villas-Boas brought on $ 80 million striker Fernando Torres with 13 minutes to play , but it was former Chelsea defender William Gallas -- who scored a winner against Tottenham in 2006 -- who next went closest to scoring as he volleyed a good chance wide .

Midfielder Ramires wasted a free header at the other end , and it looked like Chelsea would pay for the Brazilian 's miss when Bale put Adebayor clear on goal -- but Terry came to the rescue to clear the Togo international 's low shot after goalkeeper Petr Cech was beaten .

The draw lifted Chelsea onto 33 points , 11 behind leaders Manchester City and one above fifth-placed Arsenal .

Spurs go into the December 26 Boxing Day fixtures in the club 's best position this century , but still nine points behind City .

In Spain , Barcelona and Valencia cruised into the last 16 of the Copa del Rey , joining holders Real Madrid in the next round .

Club World Cup champions Barca thrashed fourth division L'Hospitalet 9-0 , as a trio of 20-year-olds -- midfielder Thiago Alcantara and strikers Isaac Cuenca and Cristian Tello -- all scored twice .

First-team regulars Pedro Rodriguez , Andre Iniesta and Xavi also netted in a win that gave the Catalan side a 10-0 aggregate scoreline .

Valencia surprisingly drew the first leg at lower league Cadiz 0-0 , but scored four unanswered goals on Thursday to go through as defender Victor Ruiz , strikers Jonas and Roberto Soldado were on target before midfielder Ever Banega wrapped it up .
