Chicago -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jury selection in the trial of a man accused of killing relatives of actress and singer Jennifer Hudson wrapped up Tuesday .

Eighteen people were selected , including six alternates . The group includes 10 women and eight men .

The murder trial comes more than three years after Hudson 's mother , brother and nephew were killed .

William Balfour , the estranged husband of Hudson 's sister Julia , is accused of fatally shooting Hudson 's mother and brother inside their Chicago home in October 2008 . The body of Hudson 's 7-year-old nephew , Julian King , was found three days later inside an abandoned vehicle .

Balfour , who was Julian 's stepfather , has also been charged with one count of home invasion .

About 150 people were candidates to be among the jurors or alternates in the case . The process of whittling down the pool began Monday morning .

The jury will be sequestered during the trial , Judge Charles Burns has said .

Opening statements in the case were set for April 23 . The judge has said he expects the trial to last three to four weeks .

Balfour was detained for questioning the day after the victims were found at the Chicago home . Authorities at the time said that they were holding Balfour for an unspecified parole violation , but he ended up being indicted for murder two months later .

He has pleaded not guilty to the charges , and his lawyer has said in court there is no forensic evidence linking him to the killings .

Prosecutors have portrayed Balfour as a jealous man who murdered three people in rage at the thought that his wife had a boyfriend .

The deaths took place a year after Hudson , who rose to fame as a contestant on `` American Idol , '' won an Oscar for her role in the movie `` Dreamgirls . ''

In a recent interview with CNN 's Piers Morgan , Hudson reflected on the life of her mother , Darnell Donerson .

`` My mother was a very wise and strong person . I feel like she raised us well , and she prepared me well , and so that 's what I live by , '' she said .

Hudson , who is on the witness list , is expected to attend the upcoming trial .

Her career has continued to blossom and remain varied since her relatives ' deaths . Her recent milestones include penning a memoir detailing her struggles with her weight , being cast to play Nelson Mandela 's ex-wife Winnie in an upcoming movie , releasing a new album and singing a well-received tribute to Whitney Houston at the most recent Grammy Awards show in February .

CNN 's Ted Rowlands and Katherine Wojtecki in Chicago and Alan Duke in Los Angeles contributed to this report .
