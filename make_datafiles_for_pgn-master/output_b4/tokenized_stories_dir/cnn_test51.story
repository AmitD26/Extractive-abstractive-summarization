Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The `` heaviest rain in six decades '' in the Chinese capital of Beijing has left at least 37 people dead , the state news agency Xinhua reported Sunday .

The torrential downpour lasted 10 hours , with gusty winds in some areas and a tornado in one suburb , according to local media .

During the storm , traffic was paralyzed for hours , with drivers and pedestrians stranded throughout the city . Many streets were flooded with water levels sometimes as deep as 13 feet -LRB- 4 meters -RRB- .

Thousands of emergency responders were deployed and divers had to be brought in to search for anyone trapped .

Officials said almost 2 million people were affected by the rainstorm and the economic losses have exceeded $ 1.5 billion .

Drowning is the leading cause of death , taking 25 lives , Xinhua reported . But six people were killed by collapsing houses , five were electrocuted , and one was hit by lightning , the agency reported , citing the municipal government .

The average rainfall Saturday was 6.7 inches , but one suburban district recorded 18 inches , Xinhua said .

At the Beijing International Airport , more than 500 flights were canceled Saturday . At one point , some 80,000 passengers were stranded in the airport terminals .

Even as operations slowly returned to normal , there were reports of passengers still stranded late Sunday .

Local television broadcast heroic stories of search and rescue efforts and people helping each other , but online , people were critical .

Many complained that authorities seemed ill-prepared despite heavy rain having been forecast days in advance . Critics said there was no emergency broadcast system deployed , no government shelters and no special hotlines .

They also complained of a fragile , ill-prepared infrastructure , pointing out the sewer system was overwhelmed by the rains .

Xinhua reported the flooding submerged some power supply facilities and led to blackouts in parts of the city .
