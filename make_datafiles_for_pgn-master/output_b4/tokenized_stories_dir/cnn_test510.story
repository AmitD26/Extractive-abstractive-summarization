The uproar in India over the arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York is growing . Indians are protesting outside the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi , the Indian government has revoked privileges for American diplomats , and Indian politicians have called for a review of their nation 's ties with the United States .

E-mail and Facebook appeals are even calling on Indians to refuse to meet with any U.S. citizen .

But the outcry over Devyani Khobragade 's treatment is drowning out the serious allegations of exploiting her employee , also an Indian national , and the pervasive violations against millions of other domestic workers around the world and in the homes of diplomats in America .

Khobragade , India 's deputy consul general in New York , was arrested last week over allegations of falsifying visa application documents for a woman who worked as her housekeeper and nanny in New York . Khobragade reported she paid the woman $ 4,500 a month . In reality , federal prosecutors say , the domestic worker received less than $ 600 a month and was forced to work far more than 40 hours a week . Her effective hourly wage -- $ 3.13 -- was less than half of New York 's minimum wage of $ 7.25 .

Many Indians are outraged over allegations that Khobragade , after leaving her daughter at school , was handcuffed on the street -- although this has been disputed -- later strip-searched and kept in a holding cell before being released on $ 250,000 bail .

U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara , in a written statement , said Khobragade was arrested discreetly , was not handcuffed and was given time to arrange personal matters including child care -- but she was searched in custody as is `` standard practice for every defendant , rich or poor , American or not , in order to make sure that no prisoner keeps anything on his person that could harm anyone , including himself . ''

There 's no doubt that strip searches , a routine part of U.S. felony arrests , are humiliating . Indians are understandably disturbed by a practice that is rare in India and seems particularly degrading .

But the treatment of domestic workers , who number more than 50 million worldwide and are one of every 13 female wage earners , is often even more degrading . They are typically grossly underpaid and often mistreated . In our investigations in the United States and elsewhere , Human Rights Watch has found that women who work as nannies and housekeepers , and often both , make far below the minimum wage and are often expected to work 14 to 18 hours a day .

Millions of women and girls travel across borders to earn money as domestic workers to send back to their families . They take care of elderly people in the homes where they work , cook , clean and take care of their employers ' children . They generate billions of dollars in remittances for their countries of origin but are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse .

Many are forced to pay huge sums to unscrupulous recruiters , or work without pay for several months to cover their debt . Cut off from their family and other sources of support , many feel they have little choice but to work under slavelike conditions . In some cases , they are locked in their workplaces . They are sometimes beaten . Unpaid wages , excessive working hours and physical , sexual and psychological abuse are the most common problems .

Domestic workers have even fewer options when their employers have diplomatic immunity and can not be criminally prosecuted , regardless of how severe their crimes . The employers have control over their visas , which also leaves them with little recourse . The U.S. State Department has received dozens of allegations of abuse by foreign diplomats and by officials at the World Bank and other international financial institutions .

In one case that became public , a former domestic worker accused her employer , a Kuwaiti diplomat , of raping her repeatedly . In another , a domestic worker for a former Philippine ambassador said she was forced to work 126 hours a week without pay .

A 2008 Government Accountability Office report identified 42 cases of abuse by diplomats with immunity over an eight-year period , and said that the actual number was probably higher . Many cases are never reported because the victims are too frightened to complain or feel they ca n't afford to lose the job .

As a consular official , Khobragade has limited immunity , which the State Department says does not cover visa fraud , a felony . Too many diplomats have used their immunity to exploit their employees . By taking action in this case , the State Department is sending an important message -- no employer is above the law . It is not just singling out foreign diplomats .

The Khobragade case has raised good questions about the treatment of criminal suspects in the United States , including the use of routine strip searches . But that debate should not be at the expense of women exploited as domestic workers . Their treatment is just as important .
