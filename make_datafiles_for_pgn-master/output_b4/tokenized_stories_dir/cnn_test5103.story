Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- China says it has had `` a frank , in-depth talk '' with North Korea about the situation on the Korean Peninsula after Pyongyang 's announcement of a planned satellite launch provoked an international outcry .

Wu Dawei , China 's special representative for the Korean Peninsula , met with Ri Yong Ho , a senior North Korean nuclear negotiator , in Beijing on Monday .

Wu told the Chinese broadcaster CCTV that he and Ri had exchanged `` opinions on the topic of preserving the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula , '' as well as on Pyongyang 's planned satellite launch .

China appears to be putting pressure on North Korea over the plan to fire off a long-range rocket that the North says will carry the satellite into orbit .

South Korea has called the announcement a `` grave provocation '' that contravenes U.N. Security Council resolutions .

And the Japanese defense minister , Naoki Tanaka , said Monday that he would consider ordering the destruction of the projectile if it presented a risk to Japan .

Chinese Executive Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun expressed `` concern '' when he met North Korean ambassador Ji Jae Ryong on Friday , the official Xinhua News Agency reported over the weekend .

`` We sincerely hope parties concerned stay calm and exercise restraint and avoid escalation of tension that may lead to a more complicated situation , '' Xinhua quoted Zhang as saying .

China rarely puts public pressure on its northern neighbor , which relies on Beijing 's political , economic and diplomatic support .

North Korea announced Friday that it plans to launch a satellite into space next month to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of its founder , Kim Il Sung , grandfather of Pyongyang 's new leader Kim Jong-un .

The United States says the rocket launch would be a `` deal-breaker '' for a recent aid agreement between the United States and North Korea .

In closed-door meetings partly brokered by China , North Korea last month agreed to stop nuclear tests , uranium enrichment and long-range missile launches in exchange for resumption of U.S. food aid .

The announced missile launch also could derail recent efforts to reconvene the multilateral talks , known as six-party talks , on denuclearizing North Korea .

The launch is expected to take place April 12 to 16 . North Korea says it plans to invite experts and the media to observe the launch .

Pyongyang has also invited the International Atomic Energy Agency to return , nearly three years after it kicked U.N. nuclear inspectors out of the country , the IAEA said Monday .
