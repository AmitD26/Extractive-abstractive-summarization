-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Awww . No offense to high school volleyball player Shannon Magrane -LRB- I totally just teared up watching her famous baseball dad 's proud-papa reaction to her highlight reel -RRB- , but I 'm glad someone went home last night . After Top 12 contestant Jermaine Jones was disqualified on Wednesday , I thought the whole week might be a wash .

Elise Testone and Erika Van Pelt joined Shannon in the bottom three , so they all sat glowering like three icky girls that the stupid , stupid little boys refused to pick for their kickball teams at recess . Do n't they know how well those girls can wail ? That was a really poor analogy , though , because 1 -RRB- kickball and recess are pointless , unlike `` American Idol '' which is EVERYTHING , and 2 -RRB- it 's likely the female vote that landed three ladies on the stools of doom in the first place . Please start voting for your sisters , sisters ! I know we all have a lot of texting to do , but you can find time to dial in for DeAndre 's hair and Elise Testone within the same hour , I promise . Try it !

Randy dismissed Shannon immediately following her `` sing for your life '' rehash of `` One Sweet Day '' by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men , but earlier in the episode Ryan Seacrest confirmed that the judges will get to use a `` save '' in this season 's horse race . Any time from now until the Top 5 , our steamy `` Neighwatch '' lifeguards Randy , J. Lo , and Steven can rescue a contestant from the big bad sea of possible elimination .

Remember last year , when the judges used their season 10 save on Casey Abrams two weeks before presumed frontrunner Pia Toscano was eliminated ? I can see them holding out on this year 's get-out-of-jail-free card unless Jessica Sanchez is in danger .

I can also see Seacrest instituting a `` Ryan 's Save '' out of nowhere so that he could keep his favorite pretty pony Colton Dixon around . God forbid .

Oh , how Ryan teases his pretty pony ! His attempts to fool Colton into thinking he 's in the bottom three have been hilariously bad for three weeks running . This time , Ryan tried to blame Colton 's obscure song choice from Wednesday 's performance show . `` Unfortunately , my man , that has cost you ... . being away from your family this summer , 'cause you 're going on the tour ! '' Do n't ever stop , Ryan . Keep on letting those crawfishy creative juices fly .

Hmm , what else ? Pretty uneventful show , to be honest . I did appreciate that this week 's ridiculous Ford Music Video , which took place in a `` haunted house '' -LRB- Ryan could barely get that out without guffawing -RRB- , could easily have doubled as an ad for Hi-C 's Ecto-Cooler . -LRB- Products from a Year Well Before Most of the Idols Were Born . -RRB- Way to keep the theme of the week going , anyway .

Daughtry , who used to have a first name but nope not anymore , showed up all high on life from Tuesday night 's hookup with Colton Dixon at the Belmont . He and his band played `` Out of My Head '' from their new album `` Break the Spell . '' Right away I felt that Daughtry 's keyboardist had a decidedly Uncle Jesse vibe , and then as I unfocused my eyes a little -LRB- it 's a good way to relax and hear the music better -RRB- I started pretending that the lanky guitarist on the left was Adrien Brody . And maybe Daughtry was present-day Joey Lawrence ? So all in all it was a fun few minutes for me . For you ?

Oh , I was also pleasantly surprised by Demi Lovato on her single `` Give Your Heart a Break . '' She was just stomping all over that stage , grooving with her guitarists who were very excited to be rocking out on a Demi Lovato song , and pausing at just the right times to bask in the spotlight and dramatically toss around her miles of weave . I thought she sounded great . My vague impressions of Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez had merged over the years into one tiny , sequined , gelatinous blob prior to this . So now that I 've confirmed they 're two different people , I 'm pretty sure I choose this one ! Demi truly won my heart with that silver fringed scarf . -LRB- `` DWTS '' premiere in three days , y' all . -RRB-

Okay , what are your thoughts on the Top 11 results ? Were you surprised that Percy Sledge uses email ? Would you award J. Lo 's dress a sparkly gold star ? It 's not like she needs another one !
