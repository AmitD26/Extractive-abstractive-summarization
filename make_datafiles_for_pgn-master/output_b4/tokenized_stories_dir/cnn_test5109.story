-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Indonesia 's response to a massive earthquake and a tsunami scare Wednesday highlights a critical reality : Warning systems and emergency responses have come a long way since the catastrophe of eight years ago .

But there 's still work to be done -- not just in Indonesia , but in some other countries throughout the region as well .

Fears that Wednesday 's 8.6-magnitude quake and resulting tsunami alert could bring a repeat of the 2004 disaster dissipated quickly as seismologists determined that Wednesday 's events were very different and much less dangerous .

In the intervening hours , Indonesia put in place many of the procedures it has worked on for years , including some practiced at a drill witnessed by CNN in 2009 .

`` The lesson of 2004 is something that we 're not going to repeat at this stage , '' vowed Teuku Faizasyah , a spokesman for the Indonesian president 's office .

Speaking to CNN while evacuations were under way in parts of his country , he said the government was working `` to bring confidence among the people that the government is with them . ''

Residents were being evacuated from some areas and encouraged to head to higher ground quickly , and authorities were trying to get information from remote areas , he said .

Later , the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center lifted a tsunami watch for the entire Indian Ocean , indicating the threat had passed .

`` The tsunami warning system worked well , '' said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho , spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency . `` People reacted quickly and evacuated to higher ground . Mosques , churches helped spread the information to the public . There was panic but that 's expected . ''

No serious casualties or major damage was reported Wednesday from the quake and the 8.2-magnitude aftershock off the coast of Sumatra . Four people were slightly injured on Simeulue Island , off the coast of Aceh , the disaster management agency spokesman said .

In 2004 , a 9.1-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that ultimately killed nearly 230,000 people in the region .

`` In 2004 , the quake was closer to the coast , stronger and was a different kind of earthquake , '' CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said . `` In 2004 , the sea floor moved vertically , and this thrust displaced a lot of water , which produced the large tsunami . In this case , the plates moved more horizontally , and therefore a large tsunami was not generated . ''

`` Even though the epicenters were only about 200 miles -LRB- about 320 kilometers -RRB- apart , they occurred on different tectonic plates , '' CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller added . `` There are several plates that come together in this area , which is why it is so tectonically active . Today 's quake occurred on the Indian plate , while the 2004 quake occurred on the Burma plate . ''

A 9.1-magnitude quake is 3.2 times larger , and more than 5 times stronger , than an 8.6-magnitude quake , CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said .

Tsunami warning sirens blared Wednesday in parts of Indonesia , and the other steps taken show that `` governments are more prepared , '' said CNN weather anchor Mari Ramos .

`` There are sirens in place along coastal communities . There are buoys in the ocean to measure water level changes . There is better communication among government agencies , countries and the media . The word gets out much more quickly , and that helps saves lives , '' Ramos said .

However , `` the number of measuring devices in the Indian Ocean is tiny compared to the Pacific . It 's a start , but more are needed . ''

In October 2009 , CNN 's Dan Rivers visited the devastated Aceh region . He watched a well-organized tsunami drill , complete with droning alarms and people covered in fake blood fleeing from an imaginary wave .

Authorities have built tsunami shelters that are raised high and can hold several hundred people , he said . Escape routes are marked .

While it was not immediately clear how many people headed to higher ground Wednesday , some videos from the region showed people apparently leaving low-lying areas .

That speaks to another important change from 2004 : People are more aware of the danger .

Back then , `` there was nothing , '' Rivers said . `` No one really knew what to do , no one even knew what a tsunami was . ''

Now , Ramos adds , `` Overall , the general population is much more aware . ''

The need for that awareness applies to citizens of other countries as well , said Walter Braunohler , a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Thailand .

`` Sadly , we did learn a lot of lessons from that -LRB- 2004 -RRB- natural disaster , '' he said Wednesday . `` And one of the biggest ones is that people should really keep in touch with their embassy . ''

Other countries in the region also reacted quickly to Wednesday 's tsunami threat .

Thailand issued an evacuation order for everyone along the Andaman coast Wednesday , according to state-run news agency MCOT .

In the Maldives , some resorts were evacuated as a precaution , according to CNN 's Erin Burnett , who was on vacation in the islands .

But , she said , `` what strikes me most is essentially the lack of a warning system '' in the Maldives . Officials rely primarily on information from the U.S. Geological Survey , she said .

That speaks to the problem the region still faces , Ramos said . `` The fact that the Maldives were included in the -LRB- warning center -RRB- bulletin is an improvement from 2004 . But there 's still a long way to go . ''
