-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fernando Alonso ended his 2011 Formula One commitments wearing a Santa Claus outfit and the robes of a Magi , and the Spanish driver hopes next year will bring a return of the old Ferrari spirit .

The legendary Italian marque has won 31 world titles overall , but none since clinching a 16th constructors ' crown in 2008 .

Alonso was fourth in the drivers ' standings this year , 135 points behind Red Bull 's all-conquering Sebastian Vettel after winning just one race , while teammate Felipe Massa was a massive 274 points off the pace in sixth .

After being Father Christmas for Ferrari employees at the team 's Maranello headquarters , and then one of the Three Wise Men at a sponsors ' party , Alonso turned his attentions towards his bid to add a third world title to his 2005 and 2006 successes at Renault .

`` This is the time when one is always optimistic , but then we must wait for the start of the season to see where we really are . It 's true that in the past few days , there was a good feeling at Maranello and there 's an air of confidence about it , '' the 30-year-old told Ferrari 's website .

`` We want to reacquaint ourselves with the taste of winning that has eluded us for a while . Last spring , we made important changes to the structure of the technical part of the team and now we have adopted a new approach , a less conservative one , in the design of the new car .

`` The philosophy behind the 2012 car is very different to that of 2011 , especially in some key areas like suspension and aerodynamics . ''

Alonso , who joined Ferrari in 2010 , is now looking forward to unwinding before testing begins again in Jerez in February ahead of the opening race in Australia on March 18 .

`` Now 's the time to take it easy for a few weeks , time to recharge the batteries and be 100 % ready for next season , which I expect will be much more of an equal fight than the one just gone , '' he said .

`` Red Bull will still be very strong , but I think they will have less room for improvement than us , as we were so far behind this year . ''
