-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police in suburban Dallas are recommending that ex-football star Deion Sanders face a charge that could land him in prison for a year , after a dispute last week that led to his estranged wife 's arrest , authorities said Thursday .

The fact that the Prosper , Texas , police sought charges against Sanders is not entirely unexpected , as he and a third person had been cited for misdemeanor assault in the incident in question , according to a statement from that town 's police released April 25 .

But the `` Class A Misdemeanor Criminal Mischief '' charge that police are now recommending is more serious than the `` Class C Simple Assault '' charge that Sanders was cited for shortly after the incident .

A conviction on a Class A misdemeanor carries a maximum prison sentence of one year and fine of $ 4,000 , according to Texas statutes . A Class C misdemeanor , by comparison , carries a fine of no more than $ 500 and no prison sentence .

The case is now in the hands of the Collin County district attorney 's office .

As of Thursday afternoon , Sanders -- a 2011 inductee into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and a former Major League Baseball standout who is now an NFL Network analyst -- had not been arrested , Prosper police said in the statement .

`` The investigation is continuing , and no other information is available at this time , '' police said .

Authorities responded to a domestic disturbance call the afternoon of Monday , April 23 , at a Prosper residence where Sanders , 44 , complained he was assaulted by Pilar Sanders , 38 , and another woman identified as Dianna Boswell , also 38 , according to an earlier police statement .

Pilar Sanders was detained on a charge of simple assault , a misdemeanor , that statement said .

After further investigation , police cited Boswell and Deion Sanders for `` Class C simple assault , '' but neither was taken into custody .

Pilar Sanders was released a day later and said she had n't been given a `` fair shake '' over allegations that she attacked Sanders in an incident he made public in a series of bizarre Twitter postings .

`` I understand that I have very little chance at beating a Hall of Fame , two-sport man that everyone seems to love and adore , '' Pilar Sanders said , proclaiming her innocence .

The Collin County Sheriff 's Office said Pilar Sanders , under an emergency protective order , is forbidden from returning to the couple 's home for 61 days and can not threaten or harass any member of the family .

In one of the messages posted last week on his verified Twitter account , Deion Sanders included a photo of what he said were his children filling out complaints to give to police in Texas .

`` Pray for me and my kids now ! They just witnessed their mother and a friend jump me in my room , '' said the first tweet , posted at 6:15 p.m. `` She 's going to jail n I 'm pressing charges ! ''

Two minutes later , Sanders tweeted again .

`` I 'm sad my boys witnessed this mess but I warned the police department here that she was gone try n harm me and my boys . This is on my mama ! '' it said .

Pilar Sanders was booked on suspicion of assault family violence , according to booking records at the Collin County Jail . Bail was set at $ 264 .

`` I can tell you that there are two sides to every story , and the truth will come out in court , '' Larry Friedman , an attorney for Pilar Sanders , said on the day of her release .

The Sanderses have three children together . Deion Sanders has two other children from an earlier relationship .

The couple married in 1999 and starred in a reality show , `` Deion & Pilar : Prime Time Love , '' that aired on the Oxygen network . The marriage soured , however , and the two are engaged in bitter divorce proceedings .

In February , Pilar Sanders filed a suit against her husband and his aunt , Laura Jones . She said the aunt attacked her in their 10-bedroom , 29,000-square-foot home in Prosper while Deion Sanders watched .

At the time , the athlete tweeted that his wife was the aggressor and the aunt was in the home merely to fix his phone .

Pilar Sanders also filed a separate suit against her husband and his daughter , Deiondra , after she called her stepmother a `` gold-digging -LRB- expletive -RRB- '' and `` the number one gold digger of the year '' in Twitter posts .

Deion Sanders played for several NFL teams , including the San Francisco 49ers , Dallas Cowboys and Atlanta Falcons . During much of his NFL career , he also was an outfielder with four Major League Baseball teams and played in a World Series with the Atlanta Braves .

The NFL Network and Sanders ' business manager , Constance Schwartz , have declined to comment about the incident . But a clearly emotional Sanders spoke to Dallas television station KXAS hours after his estranged wife 's arrest and appealed for help .

`` I got locks on my doors right now , '' he told the station . `` Is somebody going to have to die ? Is it going to be me before the court does something and get this woman out of my house ? It 's absurd . ''
