-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Branden Grace stepped up his bid for back-to-back tournament wins by taking a four-shot lead at the halfway stage of the Volvo Golf Champions tournament at The Links at Fancourt Friday .

The 23-year-old South African carded a seven-under-par 66 to set the pace on 12-under 134 after two rounds .

Compatriot Thomas Aiken , who shot 70 , and England 's Lee Slattery , who raced up the field with a best-of-the-day 65 , are his nearest challengers .

European Ryder Cup captain Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain showed he is still a force at 45 with an impressive 68 to be alone on fourth on 139 .

Grace only received an invitation to the 35-strong champions-only field by winning last week 's Joburg Open and has seized his opportunity in fine style .

He was paired with first round leader Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium , who crashed to a 76 to fall six shots off the pace .

Home favorite Ernie Els , fellow three-time major winner Padraig Harrington of Ireland and reigning British Open champion Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland are eight shots off the blistering pace being set by Grace .

Meanwhile , Colombia 's Camilo Villegas and David Toms of the United Stages led after the first round of the PGA Tour 's $ 5.6 million Humana Challenge in California .

Villegas carded his nine-under 63 on the Nicklaus Private Course and Toms matched him at La Quinta Country Club .

South Korean rooke Bae Sang-moon was in the chasing group on 64 with Ted Potter , Brandt Snedeker and Bob Estes .

Toms played with star attraction Phil Mickelson , who struggled to a two-over 74 after a triple-bogey seven at the par-four 14th , on the toughest of the three courses used for the tournament .

Former U.S. president Bill Clinton , who is set to play with Australian veteran Greg Norman Saturday in the revised pro-am format , was among the watching crowd Thursday .

Norman , making his first start on the regular tour since 2009 , carded a 72 .
