TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A well-known Iranian filmmaker has written an open letter calling for the release of journalist Roxana Saberi .

In a letter , Iranian filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi blames himself for urging Roxana Saberi to stay in Iran .

Bahman Ghobadi said he kept quiet about the arrest and conviction of the Iranian-American journalist at the request of her family . After Saberi was convicted last weekend and sentenced to an eight-year prison sentence , he said he felt he had to do something .

He told CNN that Saberi , whom he described as his fiancee , is caught in a `` game of politics . ''

In his letter , which has been posted by the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , Ghobadi blames himself for urging Saberi to stay in Iran despite her desire to leave . Also , he writes , `` My letter is a desperate call to all statesmen ... and to all those who can do something to help . ''

`` From the other side of the ocean , the Americans have protested against her imprisonment , because she is an American citizen , '' he writes . `` But I say no , she is Iranian , and she loves Iran . I beg you , let her go ! I beg you not to throw her in the midst of your political games ! She is too weak and too pure to take part in your games . Let me be present at her trial , sit next to her wise father and gentle mother , and testify she is without guilt or reproach . ''

The 40-year-old filmmaker said that Saberi was planning to leave the country , but he kept her from leaving until his latest film -- which will be shown at this year 's Cannes film festival -- was completed .

Ghobadi won the 2000 Golden Camera award at the Cannes festival for his feature film , `` A Time for Drunken Horses . ''

Saberi , 31 , was sentenced Saturday to eight years in prison after a one-day trial that was closed to the public . The decision prompted sharp denunciations from President Barack Obama , as well as other U.S. and international officials .

Iranian officials initially said Saberi was held for buying a bottle of wine . The Foreign Ministry later said she was detained for reporting without proper accreditation . On April 9 , word emerged that Saberi had been charged with espionage .

Saberi 's lawyer has said he will appeal the verdict . Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi has ordered the head of Tehran 's Justice Department to make sure the appeals process is quick and fair .

Ghobadi wrote that he is `` optimistic about her release , and I firmly hope the verdict will be canceled in the next stage of the trial . ''

`` My Iranian girl with Japanese eyes and an American ID , is in jail . Shame on me ! Shame on us ! ''
