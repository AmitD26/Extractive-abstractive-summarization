-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Roger Federer dropped his serve just once during a two-hour battle with Andy Roddick at the Miami Masters , but it was enough to end the former world No. 1 's 16-match winning streak .

Federer , who has already clinched three titles in 2012 , boasts a strong record against world No. 34 Roddick and has beaten the American in four major finals among his record 16 grand slam crowns .

But Roddick , the U.S. Open champion in 2003 , dug deep to record a 7-6 -LRB- 7-4 -RRB- 1-6 6-4 win -- only his third over the Swiss in 24 meetings and his second at the U.S. hard-court event .

`` For me , it was obviously a tough loss , '' Federer told the tournament 's official website . `` The one service game where I got broken , he really goes for it and it all works out .

`` I had my chances . I thought Andy did well to get the first , and then to put me in the situation I guess in the third . I could have been up a break early in the third , but he did well also to fight off those break points . He served really well . ''

Roddick , a two-time winner in Miami , set up a last-16 tie against Argentine 21st seed Juan Monaco .

`` It was kind of a game of chess , '' said Roddick , also a former world No. 1 . `` I stayed back on the returns , which is something I have not done with him often early on . I think he might have been a little bit surprised by it .

`` He started coming in a lot and putting the pressure on me , and it was 6-1 in the second and 0-40 early in the third . It was apparent that that was n't going to work much longer .

`` So I said , ` Well , all right . Let 's kinda go over the top aggressive . ' I was able to get out of that game and play that really good game to break , and then my serve held up from there . ''

Defending champion Novak Djokovic had no such problems , as the world No. 1 won 6-3 6-4 against fellow Serb and 27th seed Viktor Troicki to set up a clash with Frenchman Richard Gasquet .

`` Generally , I feel that I have been playing well in my first two matches , '' the 2012 Australian Open champion said .

`` I did have some ups and downs , especially in today 's match , but I 'm confident that I can raise the level of performance in every match . ''

Spanish fifth seed David Ferrer and 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin del Potro will face off on Tuesday after scoring wins against French No. 30 Julien Benneteau and 23rd-ranked Croat Marin Cilic respectively .

U.S. No. 1 Mardy Fish also advanced with a straight-sets defeat of South African No. 28 Kevin Anderson . Spanish 12 seed Nicolas Almagro awaits in the next round , having beaten compatriot Fernando Verdasco 6-3 6-4 .

`` Almagro has been playing great this year , even on hard courts , '' said Fish . `` He 'll be a tough player . ''
