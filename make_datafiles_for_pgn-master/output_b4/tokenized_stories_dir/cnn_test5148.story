Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama took a key step in cementing his judicial legacy Monday , nominating Solicitor General Elena Kagan to replace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court .

If confirmed , the 50-year-old Kagan will become the 112th Supreme Court justice . She would be the third woman on the nine-member bench and the fourth in the history of the court .

At its discretion , the court decides cases on the Constitution or federal law that may begin in federal or state courts .

Her confirmation also would mean that the Supreme Court would have no Protestant justices for the first time in its history . Kagan , who is Jewish , would join six Catholic and two Jewish justices ; Stevens is Protestant .

Kagan , a native New Yorker , was widely reported to be the front-runner for the nomination . She was a finalist for the high court vacancy last year , when Justice Sonia Sotomayor was selected to replace the retiring David Souter .

Kagan received her law degree from Harvard University , where she later served as dean of the law school . She served in the Clinton administration as associate White House counsel .

Fast Facts : Elena Kagan

Kagan is a `` trailblazing leader '' who is `` open to a broad array of viewpoints '' and is a proven `` consensus builder , '' Obama said at the White House .

`` While we ca n't presume to replace Justice Stevens ' wisdom or experience , I have selected a nominee who I believe embodies that same excellence , independence , integrity and passion for the law , and who can ultimately provide that same kind of leadership on the court . ''

Kagan , in turn , said she was `` honored '' and `` humbled '' by what she called `` the honor of a lifetime . ''

`` The court is an extraordinary institution in the work it does and the work it can do for the American people , '' she said . It enables `` all Americans , regardless of their background or their beliefs , to get a fair hearing and an equal chance at justice . ''

Obama did not have to look far when considering Kagan . As solicitor general , she is the administration 's top lawyer before the Supreme Court and has argued several high-profile cases before the justices since taking the job in spring 2009 . She also helps prepare legal briefs for cases the Justice Department argues before the Supreme Court .

That work wo n't stop immediately with her nomination to the high court .

`` She will continue to work on matters with which she has been dealing , but will not participate in any new matters , '' said a senior government official familiar with Kagan 's plans .

Kagan is expected to abstain from participation in cases on which she has worked that may come before the high court next term , the official said .

She was confirmed for her current job by a 61-31 vote . While most Republicans ultimately voted against her at the time , Sen. Orrin Hatch , a top Republican on the Judiciary Committee , called her `` a brilliant woman . ''

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , said Monday that Kagan is a `` superb nominee '' who is `` the best this country can offer . ''

`` She will be confirmed , '' he predicted .

He dismissed likely GOP criticism of the choice , saying Obama `` could nominate Moses the lawgiver '' and still face Republican opposition .

Hatch , in turn , promised in a statement Monday to examine Kagan 's `` entire record to understand her judicial philosophy . ''

`` My conclusion will be based on evidence , not blind faith , '' he said .

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , reacted to the nomination by citing a traditional GOP concern with `` activist '' judges appointed by Democratic presidents .

Another top Republican , however , indicated that the Senate GOP would probably not try to block a vote on Kagan 's nomination .

`` The only reason she would be filibustered is if members come to believe she could not put aside her own personal views on cases in which she wanted to see a particular outcome rather than decide the case on the basis of the facts and the law , '' Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl said .

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions , the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee , said Monday that Kagan 's confirmation hearings could wrap up by early August , but noted the timing depends on the White House 's willingness to work with the GOP .

Republicans may try to use Kagan 's own words against her in pushing for greater specificity on her views during her confirmation hearings . In 1995 , she dismissed the hearing process as a `` vapid and hollow charade . ''

Kagan 's position on gays in the military is virtually certain to generate controversy during her confirmation hearings . She has been strongly criticized by conservatives for her efforts to block military recruiters from Harvard because of the military 's `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy . The policy , enacted during the Clinton administration but opposed by Obama , prohibits homosexuals from serving openly in the armed forces .

While serving as dean at Harvard Law , Kagan said she `` abhorred '' the military 's `` discriminatory recruitment policy . '' She called it `` a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order . ''

Also in the spotlight will be Kagan 's views on the politically hot-button issue of campaign finance reform . She was the government 's lead attorney in arguing against a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in January that eased long-standing restrictions on campaign spending by corporations and unions in federal elections .

A number of conservatives praised the ruling as a victory for First Amendment free speech rights ; most Democrats blasted it , arguing that it will tilt the political landscape favor of Republicans and traditional GOP allies in the business community .

Some liberal organizations have expressed concern over Kagan 's views on executive power . As chief defender of the administration 's anti-terrorism strategy , Kagan has articulated a more robust defense of the White House than many civil rights and human rights groups would like .

Vincent Warren , head of the left-leaning Center for Constitutional Rights , said Kagan 's record `` indicates a troubling support for expanding presidential powers , something we must be vigilant about at this time . ''

`` President Obama would appear to be seeking to appoint a Supreme Court Judge who will endorse his policies and appease conservatives , '' he argued . `` This is not the way to make a decision that will affect our nation for decades to come . ''

Observers on both sides of the political aisle have noted that Kagan has a relatively short paper trail compared to other recent Supreme Court nominees .

Kagan grew up in a Jewish household on the Upper West Side of Manhattan . She went to Princeton University and Harvard Law School . She served as a law clerk for federal judge Abner Mikva and then for Justice Thurgood Marshall on the high court . Marshall affectionately called the diminutive Kagan `` Shorty . ''

Kagan later went into teaching , starting at the University of Chicago , where one of the part-time faculty was Obama .

President Clinton later named Kagan associate White House counsel and then appointed her to the influential Domestic Policy Council , where she earned a reputation for articulate and well-reasoned statements on tricky political issues .

Clinton picked her in 1999 for the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit . But no Senate confirmation hearings were held , and the nomination lapsed . The seat was later filled by John Roberts , who quickly used the appointment as a springboard to chief justice .

Named Harvard 's dean in 2003 , Kagan earned a reputation for soothing longstanding tensions over a perceived liberal tilt to the faculty and curriculum .

She began pushing for the appointment of conservative professors , including Jack Goldsmith , who had been a lawyer in President George W. Bush 's Justice Department . Such hires eased ideological unrest on the Harvard campus .
