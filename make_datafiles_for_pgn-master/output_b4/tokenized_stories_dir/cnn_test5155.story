-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When we think about asylum , the picture that most people draw in their heads is of some persecuted person crossing a border to a safe country and pleading his or her case .

Mexican journalists who have walked across international bridges into the United States , fearing drug cartel reprisals , come to mind . Or the Cuban athletes who during tournaments abroad decide to defect , and ask for asylum .

This is the traditional , and most common way , to request asylum .

But as the latest twist in the Julian Assange case shows , there are rare times when asylum is granted to someone who has yet to reach their safe haven .

Ecuador 's decision this week to grant asylum to Assange was celebrated as a victory by his supporters , but the WikiLeaks founder 's conundrum remains unchanged . For the foreseeable future , he is stuck inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London .

Ecuador may have granted asylum to the man inside their embassy , but the United Kingdom does n't recognize it . At issue are divergent views on the concept of diplomatic asylum -- a nation 's granting of asylum to someone not inside its territory .

The concept of diplomatic asylum is as old as the practice of having permanent embassies in foreign countries . It is tied closely with the practice of diplomatic immunity , which is more well known .

But controversies over countries using diplomatic asylum to protect people wanted for crimes led to the practice falling out of favor , according to a United Nations report devoted to the subject in 1975 .

From the 19th century onward , the practice of diplomatic asylum virtually disappeared in Europe , while it continued to grow in Latin America .

The result is that today , the view in most of world is that diplomatic asylum , in essence , does not exist .

The exception is Latin America , where some legal writers even grant diplomatic asylum the status of a human right , the U.N. report says .

One last tidbit of academic dryness before considering the Assange case : The prevailing view that diplomatic asylum is not part of accepted international law was settled in a case between Peru and Colombia before the International Court of Justice in 1950 .

Victor de la Haya , a Peruvian , led an unsuccessful rebellion in Peru and was wanted by authorities there . He hid in the Colombian embassy in Lima and asked for , and received asylum from Colombia . Peru , however , refused to grant safe passage . Sound familiar ?

The court ruled that diplomatic asylum is not recognized unless treaties or other agreements are in place between countries .

So today , `` in general international law there is n't actually a right to grant diplomatic asylum , or at least other states are n't required to respect it , '' said Matthew Happold , an international law expert at the University of Luxembourg .

What it means for Assange is that Ecuador 's declaration might not do anything to help him .

In fact , Happold said , under international law , if the U.K. officially requests Ecuador to hand over Assange , Ecuador would be legally obligated to do so .

Britain has made it clear that it will not provide safe passage and intends to extradite Assange to Sweden , but it is unclear if the government has sent a formal request for him . The U.K. 's position has been to negotiate a solution .

A negotiated solution staved off a similar diplomatic drama between the United States and China this year . The blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng had escaped house arrest and sought refuge inside the U.S. embassy . Unlike the Assange case , however , Chen did not ask for asylum and none was granted . Instead , New York University invited Chen to study there , and China agreed to let him go .

With negotiations apparently deadlocked between Ecuador and Britain , it is uncertain how long Assange will remain holed up inside the embassy while Sweden awaits to question him over claims of rape and sexual molestation .

`` These cases can go on for years if there is n't some settlement . It 's happened in the past , '' Happold said .

The Peruvian who sought asylum from the Colombian embassy in 1950 lived there for five years .

Meanwhile , some experts questioned the validity of the arguments that Ecuador used to grant asylum .

Ecuador 's decision was based on the belief that Sweden would eventually turn Assange over to the Americans , and that his life would be at risk once in U.S. custody , former Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Jose Alaya told CNN en EspaÃ ± ol .

`` That is making a hypothesis on top of a hypothesis , and to justify a decision on that is not very strong , '' he said .

The purpose of an embassy is to maintain ties with other countries , but as long as Assange remains in limbo , `` every day it will become a greater obstacle in their efforts toward good relations . ''
