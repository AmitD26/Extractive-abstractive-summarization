-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Organization of Islamic Cooperation suspended Syria Wednesday from membership .

`` There is a strong concern over the massacres and the inhumane acts that are being committed against the Syrian people , '' said Nizar bin Obaid Madani , Saudi Arabia 's state minister for foreign affairs .

`` Therefore , the leaders agreed on the importance of preserving the unity of Syria , the immediate end of all acts of violence and the suspension of Syrian membership within OIC , '' the minister said after a two-day summit of OIC heads of state .

Iran and Algeria were the sole opponents in the 57-nation body , which represents 1.5 billion Muslims .

The organization 's move sends a message to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that its members will not accept the regime killing its people , OIC Secretary-General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu told CNN .

He also called on the U.N. Security Council to approve tougher resolutions against the regime .

Asked if OIC members supported military intervention , Ihsanoglu said he heard few such calls .

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland commended the move . `` Today 's action underscores the Assad regime 's increasing international isolation and the widespread support for the Syrian people and their struggle for a democratic state that represents their aspirations and respects their human rights , '' she said in a statement .

The development came as would-be rescuers searched for survivors amid the rubble left after Syrian government forces shelled a town in Aleppo province near the border with Turkey , killing 40 people , a spokesman for the rebel Syrian National Council told CNN .

`` We have no special equipment to search or lift the wreckage , '' said the spokesman , Abu Omar , by Skype from the province . `` People are doing it using their bare hands and rudimentary tools . ''

Another 40 people in the town of Azzaz were missing after the shelling , which targeted a popular food market , Omar said .

Among the dead were four Lebanese hostages who had been taken by an armed group called `` the revolutionaries of Aleppo '' that is not affiliated with the Free Syrian Army , he said .

He described the victims as civilians , including women and children , and said the town was without electricity .

The attack came after government had warned members of the al-Tawheed Brigade , the main rebel group fighting in the city of Aleppo , to pull its fighters out of the city or face shelling from warplanes , Omar said .

Inside Aleppo , Syria 's largest city , the rebels `` continued clashes today with the regime forces in Salaheddine district '' and Bab el-Nasr neighborhood , killing a rebel commander , he added .

Meanwhile , a United Nations commission concluded Wednesday that both Syrian regime forces and anti-government rebels have committed war crimes in the Syrian conflict .

The U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry said government forces and their Shabiha militia allies committed crimes against humanity such as `` murder and torture , war crimes and gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law , including unlawful killing , indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations and acts of sexual violence . ''

In the town of Houla on May 25 , the commission said , al-Assad 's forces and militia allies were responsible for killing more than 100 civilians , nearly half of them children .

The anti-government armed groups that have emerged over the past year also have committed war crimes , including `` murder , extrajudicial killings and torture , '' the report says . But the commission says these actions `` were not of the same gravity , frequency and scale as the ones perpetrated by government forces and the militia . ''

Since February 15 , the report says , `` the situation in the country has deteriorated significantly with armed violence spreading to new areas and active hostilities raging between rebels and the government and the militias . ''

The violence continued Wednesday , with at least 205 people killed , the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said . Ninety of them were in Aleppo province , and most of them were in Azzaz , a town near the Turkish border that was shelled by regime warplanes .

Opposition activists have put the death toll in the 17-month crisis at more than 20,000 .
