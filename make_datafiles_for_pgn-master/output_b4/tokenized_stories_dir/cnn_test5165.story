Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Is this week 's anti-American chaos in the Arab world going to be President Barack Obama 's Jimmy Carter moment or Republican challenger Mitt Romney 's John McCain moment ?

The unrest so far in Libya , Egypt and Yemen -- embassies attacked , an American ambassador killed , spreading protests -- evokes memories of another U.S. crisis more than 30 years ago .

In 1979 , Iranians celebrating their revolution invaded the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 Americans hostage to launch a crisis that helped doom Carter 's re-election bid a year later .

Romney and some conservative backers seek to draw parallels between the Carter and Obama presidencies , hoping to weaken what has been a major advantage for Obama on foreign policy and cement in voters ' minds that he does n't deserve a second term .

Romney : ` A strong America is essential to shape events '

The question is whether the strategy at a vital moment in the November election campaign , following the two party conventions and heading into the debates , will end up raising or sinking Romney 's hopes .

Unable to catch up in the polls , the former Massachusetts governor launched immediate and initially inaccurate criticism of Obama 's foreign policy on Tuesday night -- the 11th anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- after first reports of protesters breaching the U.S. Embassy in Egypt and of an attack that had killed an American at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya .

`` It 's disgraceful that the Obama administration 's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks , '' the Romney statement said in reference to a Cairo embassy statement that was released before protesters stormed the compound .

When news emerged Wednesday that the Libya attack killed four people , including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens , Romney found himself criticized by Democrats and some Republicans and conservatives for what they depicted as a crass and non-presidential move .

`` Governor Romney seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later , '' Obama told CBS in an interview on Wednesday . `` And as president , one of the things I 've learned is you ca n't do that . It 's important for you to make sure that the statements that you make are backed up by the facts and that you 've thought through the ramifications before you make them . ''

Obama : Romney overstepped on Libya , Egypt attacks

Daniel Larison , a contributing editor at The American Conservative , wrote on the group 's website that Romney tried unsuccessfully to apply his campaign theme that Obama has been a weak leader to a situation that did n't fit .

He called the mistake akin to McCain 's unorthodox reaction to the unfolding financial crisis during the 2008 campaign , when the Arizona senator called for both candidates to suspend campaigning and insisted the fundamentals of the economy were sound in the face of collapse .

A more reasoned response by Romney `` would n't have fit his ready-made scheme of Obama-as-Carter , but it would have spared him of most of the ridicule he 's receiving now , '' Larison wrote , adding : `` Now instead of portraying Obama as Carter , he has presented himself as the bumbling McCain figure of 2012 . ''

Mark Salter , a former chief of staff and campaign adviser to McCain , also took issue with Romney 's move , writing on the website realclearpolitics.com that `` the rush by Republicans -- including Mitt Romney , Sarah Palin and scores of other conservative critics -- to condemn -LRB- Obama -RRB- for policies they claim helped precipitate the attacks is as tortured in its reasoning as it is unseemly in its timing . ''

`` I understand the Romney campaign is under pressure from some Republicans to toughen its attacks on the president , '' wrote Salter , comparing it to similar pressure on McCain four years earlier . '' ... But this is hardly the issue or the moment to demonstrate a greater resolve to take the fight to the president . ''

After his vigorous attacks on Obama on Tuesday night and Wednesday , Romney dropped some of the harshest rhetoric from remarks at a campaign event on Thursday in Virginia while continuing to label the president as a weak leader .

`` As we watch the world today , sometimes it seems we 're at the mercy of events rather than shaping events , '' he said , later adding that `` the world needs American leadership , the Middle East needs American leadership , and I intend to be a president that provides the leadership that America respects and will keep us admired throughout the world . ''

For his part , Obama emphasized U.S. muscle on Thursday in promising a Nevada campaign event that `` no act of terror will go unpunished . '' The president added that he instructed his administration to `` do whatever is necessary to protect all Americans who are serving abroad . ''

Opinion : Romney foreign policy attack was disgraceful

The back-and-forth on the issue reflects the competing efforts by the Obama and Romney campaigns to frame the election in terms favorable to their candidate .

Obama seeks to make it a question of competing visions for the future , while Romney pushes for a referendum on Obama 's presidency at a time of high unemployment , sluggish economic recovery and mounting federal deficits and debt .

Romney previously has sought to tie Obama to the troubled , one-term Carter presidency , focusing on the economy -- considered the most important issue of the campaign .

However , Romney trails Obama in the latest polling , particularly on foreign affairs . A recent CNN/ORC International poll showed Obama favored over Romney on foreign policy by 54 % -42 % .

With less than eight weeks to the election , Romney appeared to leap at the chance to challenge Obama on foreign policy when first reports of attacks on U.S. compounds in Egypt and Libya emerged . He continued to sharply criticize the administration on Wednesday , saying it sent `` mixed messages '' on American values and policy to the rest of the world .

`` I think it is a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values , '' Romney said of the statement issued by the embassy in Cairo that condemned the anti-Islam video that fomented protests outside the compound . `` When our grounds are being attacked and being breached ... the first response of the United States must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation . And apology for America 's values is never the right course . ''

Although Romney said the statement was released after the violence at the embassy , in fact it was released hours earlier .

Arab Spring turmoil evokes political response

Democrats quickly fired back , with former presidential candidate John Kerry saying Romney 's comments demonstrated `` an insensitivity and a lack of judgment about what is happening right now . ''

`` I do n't think he knows what he 's talking about , frankly , '' the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman from Massachusetts told CNN .

However , some Republicans including Romney 's running mate in November , conservative Rep. Paul Ryan , quickly came to Romney 's defense .

`` It 's never too early to be in strong support of the American values to stand up for what we believe in and to condemn those people who are damaging our property , '' Ryan said in an interview with WLWT in Cincinnati .

Conservative analyst Liz Cheney , the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a former State Department official in the Bush administration , accused Obama of a litany of missteps that she said weakened U.S. influence abroad .

`` Apologizing for America , appeasing our enemies , abandoning our allies and slashing our military are the hallmarks of Mr. Obama 's foreign policy , '' Cheney wrote in the Wall Street Journal , concluding that `` an America already weakened by four years of an Obama presidency will be unrecognizable after eight . ''

Republican strategist Alex Castellanos , a CNN contributor , agreed that Obama 's foreign policy was `` weak '' and `` vacillating , '' but he also acknowledged that Romney must win the foreign policy debate that the candidate himself launched to the forefront of the campaign .

To Larison , the Romney gambit appeared to be a desperate move by a campaign that `` knows it 's losing . ''

`` When senior Republican foreign policy professionals start referring to this as his ` Lehman moment , ' likening it to McCain 's mid-September meltdown in response to the financial crisis , we can see that Romney 's latest attempt to seize on an international event has done significant and possibly irreparable damage to his campaign , '' Larison wrote . `` Most Americans may not sympathize with Romney 's more aggressive foreign policy , but they might have been willing to believe him to be competent and have good judgment . This blunder undermines his claims to both of these . ''
