Editor 's note : Lois Pope and Arthur H. Wilson are co-founders of the Disabled Veterans ' LIFE Memorial Foundation , the nonprofit organization that has spearheaded the development of The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial . Award-winning actor Gary Sinise , star of `` CSI : NY , '' is the national spokesman for the memorial .

As we prepare to pay tribute this Veterans Day to the courageous men and women who have selflessly served our country , the image of American soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is in our minds . But we also must recognize that many thousands have returned from these wars with severe injuries and permanent disabilities .

The numbers of troops coming home with damaged bodies and , in many cases , minds , is increasing . Advances in medical and military technology are reducing the number of deaths from combat , but soldiers who survive attacks often end up with lost limbs , horrific burns , traumatic brain injuries and other life-altering wounds .

For example , in 2006 for every fatality in Iraq , there were 16 wounded . We need to do a better job of honoring and meeting our obligations to these unsung American heroes .

Beyond significantly increasing funding to meet the ever-growing costs of treatment , as well as other benefits , America has a responsibility to ensure that our disabled veterans are never neglected or erased from our collective memory . A permanent public tribute to recognize them is now underway .

Yesterday , in a ceremony attended by hundreds of disabled and able-bodied veterans whose service dates back to WWII . House speaker Nancy Pelosi , Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki and others joined us to break ground on The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial .

Sitting across from the U.S. Botanic Garden , in full view of the U.S. Capitol , this memorial will serve to educate generations about the true cost of war , and to celebrate the men and women who may be broken in body but never in spirit .

The groundbreaking , however , marks just the beginning of efforts -- our obligation -- to create this memorial .

Unfortunately , we often marginalize and forget the men and women who sacrificed for our freedom . In fact , Veterans Day itself has become for far too many of us an extra vacation day from work or school . For retailers , it has become yet another day to lure shoppers with special sales and promotions .

All of us should instead consider this sobering fact : Since 2001 , the number of disabled veterans has risen by 25 percent to over 3 million today . In contrast , the increase in the six years prior to September 11 , 2001 , was just 4 percent . Well over 180,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are already collecting disability benefits .

A Stanford University study last year estimated that as many as 35 percent of Iraq war veterans will suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome , a condition that has already led to high rates of depression , suicide , substance abuse , unemployment , relationship and family problems , and other issues .

We have been privileged to meet a number of these veterans and have witnessed their Herculean struggles to regain health , reshape lives shattered by disability , learn new trades or professions , and rejoin the civilian world .

While their disabilities remind us of the fragility of life , they also inspire us with their fortitude , strength of character , and unflagging commitment , not just to survive , but to flourish as devoted husbands and wives , fathers and mothers , sons and daughters , friends and colleagues , and hard-working and productive citizens .

We wish that every American could walk down the National Mall in Washington . It is a humbling and inspiring experience . The story of our country is told there in museums , monuments and memorials that commemorate the individuals and events that have shaped our history , molded our national character , and woven the very fabric of our nation .

But , while there are many fitting memorials to fallen soldiers , as well as monuments to our founding fathers , there is nothing for disabled veterans . They are the only historically significant group that has not been recognized in such a manner .

That is why the Memorial is so important . Much work still needs to be done , from fundraising and building an endowment to actual construction .

We have faith that the American people -- individuals , foundations , and corporations -- will continue to lend their support .

It is not possible to look into the eyes of any disabled veteran and not feel compelled to do something to recognize what he or she has given up for our sake , for the freedoms that we take them for granted .

John Quincy Adams said : `` You will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom . I hope you will make good use of it . ''

This Veterans Day , let us think on the words of America 's sixth president . Let us pay special honor and be inspired by the over 3 million who continue to bear the scars of war long after the guns have fallen silent and the memory of their sacrifice has faded from the public 's consciousness .
