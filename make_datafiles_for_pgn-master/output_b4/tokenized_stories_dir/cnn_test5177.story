Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether police can take DNA samples from criminal suspects following their arrest , a case based on Maryland law with potentially national implications for the use of a popular investigative tool .

Justices will weigh a challenge to the state 's law by Alonzo King , who was convicted of a 2003 rape on Maryland 's Eastern Shore with the assistance of genetic material obtained following his arrest three years ago on an unrelated assault charge .

King moved to suppress the use of the DNA on Fourth Amendment grounds , but was ultimately convicted of the rape offense .

Federal law in 1994 created a national database in which local , state , and federal law enforcement agencies could compare and share information on DNA matches from convicted felons . But courts have been at odds on just when such samples can be collected and the information distributed .

A divided Maryland Court of Appeals agreed with King , saying suspects under arrest enjoy a higher level of privacy than a convicted felon . This , the court said , outweighed the state 's law enforcement interests .

The appeals court also said that obtaining King 's DNA immediately after arrest was not necessary in identifying him and that the process was more personally invasive than standard fingerprinting .

State officials asked the Supreme Court to intervene , saying the state court ruling `` resulted in the loss of a valuable crime-fighting tool . '' They said that from a law enforcement and forensic perspective , there is no difference between fingerprinting and collecting `` biometric information . ''

The Supreme Court allowed the Maryland law to remain in effect in July while appeals from the state were filed , and Chief Justice John Roberts signaled at the time his tentative support for the measure .

`` Collecting DNA from individuals arrested for violent felonies provides a valuable tool for investigating unsolved crimes and thereby helping to remove violent offenders from the general population , '' Roberts wrote .

`` Crimes for which DNA evidence is implicated tend to be serious , and serious crimes cause serious injuries . That Maryland may not employ a duly enacted statute to help prevent these injuries constitutes irreparable harm . ''

Roberts said at the time there was a `` fair prospect '' the Supreme Court would ultimately find in favor of the state on the search and seizure questions .

Roberts said the state appeals decision would resonate beyond Maryland because DNA samples taken on the state level `` may otherwise be eligible '' for the FBI 's database . `` The decision , '' Roberts said `` renders the database less effective for other states and the federal government . ''

The Maryland law is set to expire at the end of 2013 . A Supreme Court ruling is expected by June .
