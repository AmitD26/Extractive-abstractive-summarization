-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Delta Air Lines has pre-emptively canceled approximately 500 Christmas Day flights , a company spokesman said Friday , as it and other U.S. airlines work to get ahead of a storm that 's threatening the East Coast .

Morgan Durrant , a Delta spokesman , said Friday that the airline has canceled roughly 300 flights in and out of Atlanta and 200 more elsewhere around the country .

Delta also has joined Continental , United , American and AirTran in waiving penalties for travelers who have to reschedule their trips over the weekend .

The mid-Atlantic and Northeast could see combinations of rain , sleet and snow , with the heaviest amounts of precipitation in highest elevations , CNN meteorologists said . Still , forecasters on Friday noted considerable uncertainty as to the shape , the direction and the strength of the system .

By Friday evening , National Weather Service forecasters were predicting that an intensifying low-pressure system should hit Saturday night off the Carolinas coast and barrel northward toward Cape Cod , Massachusetts .

In parts of West Virginia , light snow starting Friday night was expected to give way to a `` prolonged snow shower event '' on Saturday night into Monday , the weather service said . Two to five inches could fall every 12-hour period in mountainous areas .

A hazardous weather outlook was issued from Massachusetts south down the East Coast through New York , New Jersey , Delaware and into Maryland .

The New York metropolitan area has a 40 percent chance of precipitation , which was expected to start after noon and fall as snow . While the accumulation there was expected to be fairly minimal , the weather service noted that a shift in the storm 's track could mean `` significant wind-driven snowfall to the entire region . ''

In addition , winds could gust as strong as 50 mph for eastern Connecticut and New York 's Long Island .

Beginning Sunday afternoon and through Monday , southern New England could see six to eight inches of snow -- with 10 inches possibly falling in some locales . In addition , the National Weather Service cautioned about a coastal flood threat for eastern Massachusetts during high tides .

While the storm 's path remained uncertain , airlines worked to get ahead of it by cancelling flights and adjusting restrictions and fees for those who changed their travel schedules .

United Continental Holdings Inc. , parent company of United and Continental airlines , said that `` customers scheduled on flights to , from or through the impacted areas may reschedule their itinerary with a one-time date or time change , and the change fees will be waived . ''

For canceled flights , `` a refund in the original form of payment may be requested , '' it said .

Mike Trevino , a United Airlines representative , confirmed that United will issue a waiver for customers traveling Saturday through Monday to areas affected by weather .

`` Customers will not be charged a change of ticket fee . No flights have been canceled in advance of the storm , '' he said .

The offer applies to travelers with tickets purchased on or before Thursday and going to , from or through airports serving Newark , New Jersey ; New York City , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Boston , Washington , Baltimore and Atlanta .

Delta is offering customers whose flight plans may be affected by winter weather across the Southeast and East `` the ability to make one-time changes to their travels schedules without fees . Delta 's weather advisory encourages customers to consider postponing or rerouting their travel to avoid possible inconvenience from expected flight delays . ''

Customers `` booked on Delta-ticketed flights to , from or through '' several cities `` may immediately rebook for travel before or after their original travel dates as long as new flights are ticketed and rescheduled travel begins by Dec. 29 . ''

The cities are Atlanta , for travel booked for Saturday and Sunday ; and Baltimore , Boston , Newark , New York and Washington for travel booked for Sunday and Monday .

AirTran is also waiving penalties for passengers traveling to and from Atlanta from 2 p.m. Saturday to noon Sunday , and on Sunday and Monday for some cities `` as long as travel is completed within three days from the date of the original scheduled departure date or five days after the original scheduled departure date , based on space availability , without fees or fare adjustments . ''

The locations are Allentown , Pennsylvania ; Atlantic City , New Jersey ; Baltimore ; Boston ; Buffalo , New York ; Harrisburg , Pennsylvania ; New York City ; Philadelphia ; Pittsburgh ; Portland , Maine ; Richmond , Virginia ; Rochester , New York ; Washington ; and White Plains , New York .

American Airlines , too , will allow its customers set to fly December 26 and 27 in and out of certain destinations to change their tickets free of charge . The policy applies to airports in Boston , Washington , New York , Newark and Philadelphia .
