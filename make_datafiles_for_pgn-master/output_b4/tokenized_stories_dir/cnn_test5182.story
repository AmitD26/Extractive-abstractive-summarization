-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nine years ago he was an electrician . Six months ago , he was worth some A$ 1.18 billion -LRB- $ 1.22 billion -RRB- Australia 's mining boom having turned him into the country 's richest person under 40 years old .

Now , coal baron Nathan Tinkler , 36 , is facing a mountain of debt . His wealth has plummeted to A$ 400 million , thanks to slowing demand and falling coal prices , while his debts to a variety of creditors mount , reportedly hitting A$ 638 million . On Tuesday , his personal holding company was liquidated .

Tinkler has had the Midas touch on his way to the top of the rich list and -- until Tuesday -- on the way down , too , staving off the liquidation of several of his companies . He now faces credit debt surrounding his horse racing empire , troubled sports franchises and repossession of his personal jet .

While creditors have been circling for months , it was a Tuesday decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court to wind up Tinkler 's Mulsanne Resources over an unpaid A$ 28.4 million dollar debt that suggests the former electrician 's luck may have run dry .

On Wednesday , the Federal Court place his thoroughbred horse racing and breeding empire , Patinack Farm Administration , into liquidation with a debt of A$ 2 million . Patinack Farm 's cash flow problems were reported to be so severe , Tinkler was trying to stem the bleeding by downsizing operations in Victoria and South Australia and selling horses at bargain base prices to settle a state debt .

He recently settled a A$ 16.6 million dispute with Mirvac over a failed land purchase in Sydney and a A$ 2 million debt to the publicly listed contractor , Sedgman Ltd. .

Tinkler 's woes have impacted the Australian sporting world too . His Hunter Sports Group has reportedly fallen behind in meeting player salaries for his two prized clubs -- the A league Newcastle Jets football team and the Newcastle Knights league club . But Tinkler has come up with enough money to partially pay a significant , unpaid bill for the rent of stadiums used by the teams .

And he has avoided the reported repossession of his personal jet worth A$ 40 million . GE Capital is said to have issued Tinkler an instruction to leave the French made Dassault Falcon 900 , replete with Italian leather seats , a conference room and bar , at a regional Sydney airport .

Instead , he flew it to Singapore where he and his family now live in two adjacent homes , reportedly with a Maserati and Porcshe in the driveway .

And in August with coal prices flailing , Tinkler abandoned plans for a A$ 5.3 billion take over Whitehaven Coal , one of Australia 's largest coal producers with exploration assets in Queensland . Tinkler 's Aston Resources , however , remains the largest shareholder in Whitehaven Coal with a 19.4 % stake .

Navigating the downside of Australia 's commodities boom is proving to be a wild ride for Nathan Tinkler . As a result , the unlikely rich lister is in the business pages of Australian newspapers almost daily . And he does n't much like the attention .

`` There has definitely , absolutely , been a spirited media campaign to get me , '' Tinkler told Sydney 's Daily Telegraph earlier this month .

Seeking to sooth the doubters , he added , `` I would say the noisy few have made a lot of people nervous and there is no need to be . ''

The order to liquidate his personal investment vehicle would indicate the nervousness is not a fiction of a media campaign .

But Tinkler is accustomed to wild rides . The ride to the top for Australia 's fastest self-made billionaire was not only wild . It was a gamble .

As a teenager , he headed for the rich coalfields of the Hunter Valley , north of Sydney , according to a 2010 profile . There , he found work in the mines as an electrician , though a A$ 400 a week take home salary held little appeal .

By 26 , he 'd formed his own mine machinery maintenance business , servicing coalmines , which were burgeoning and booming as Australian commodities fueled the expansion of China 's infrastructure .

Then came his big break .

In 2006 , he raised a A$ 1 million loan against his home and business for a deposit on a coal tenement in central Queensland . All he needed to do was raise another A$ 29 million to finance the deal .

`` I knocked on every door in Australia and many overseas to raise the funds . Finally I succeeded after wearing out a lot of shoe leather , '' he told CNBC in 2010 .

Investors came on board when exploratory drilling turned in heaven sent results - high grade coal samples .

Sitting on a promising asset , Tinkler sold it not once but twice -- first to Macarthur Coal for A$ 275 million plus a 10 % stake in the company and a year later , in 2008 , with world coal prices soaring , he sold his stake in Macarthur to global steel giant ArcelorMittal .

His A$ 1 million gamble turned into a multimillion dollar pile of cash with which he went on a buying spree -- football and rugby league clubs , horse studs , as well as property . He also formed Aston Resources , a mining development vehicle , floated in 2010 .

The Aston Resources merger with Whitehaven Coal was his great hope and even diminished by weak coal prices , it remains his main asset .

If the former electrician ca n't pull another rabbit out of his hat , faith in the Midas touch may be all that remains to stave off bankruptcy .
