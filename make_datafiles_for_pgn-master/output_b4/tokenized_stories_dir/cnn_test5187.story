-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Machinery problems at a drug manufacturing plant prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to warn patients of a possible mix-up affecting various prescription pain medications and over-the-counter drugs .

The FDA is advising patients who use certain prescription medications produced by Endo Pharmaceuticals to visually inspect their pills . And consumers who have select bottles of Excedrin , Bufferin , NoDoz and Gas-X , produced by Novartis , are being told to discard or return the products in a voluntary recall that started Sunday .

The over-the-counter drugs involved in the recall were manufactured at a Lincoln , Nebraska , facility which also produced various prescription pain medicines for Endo Pharmaceuticals , according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . These pills include Percocet , Opana and Percodan .

`` Due to problems that occurred when these products were packaged and labeled at the site , it 's possible that tablets from one product may have been retained in the packaging machinery and then may have carried over into the packaging of another product , '' said Dr. Edward Cox , director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products , Office of New Drugs , Center for Drug Evaluation of Research for the FDA .

`` This could result in an incorrect pill ending up in the bottle of another product . The likelihood of this occurring in medication dispensed in patients is estimated to be low , '' he added .

The prescription opioids could have ended up in the bottle of another prescription drug or over-the-counter products , although `` the risk of pills ending up in the wrong bottle is a rare event , '' according to the FDA .

There have been no reports of adverse events due to this problem , Cox said .

Patients who take an affected Endo Pharmaceuticals products should visually inspect all the pills in their bottles , according to the company and FDA . Endo Pharmaceuticals posted pictures of the products on their web page for tablet identifications .

The products listed there : Opana ER -LRB- oxymorphone hydrochloride -RRB- extended-release tablets CII ; Opana -LRB- oxymorphone hydrochloride -RRB- tablets CII ; oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets CII ; Percocet -LRB- oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen USP -RRB- tablets CII ; Percodan -LRB- oxycodone hydrochloride and aspirin , USP -RRB- tablets CII ; Endocet -LRB- oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen USP -RRB- tablets CII ; Endodan -LRB- oxycodone hydrochloride and aspirin , USP -RRB- tablets CII ; Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets CII ; and Zydone -LRB- hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen tablets , USP -RRB- CIII .

`` We are asking patients to check their medicines , to look for any tablets of a different size , shape or color from their regular medicine , '' Cox said . `` If they find any tablets that are different , stop taking the pain medication and take the medicine to the pharmacy . We are telling patients to look carefully at all tablets in pain medication bottle . ''

Patients who have questions should contact Endo Pharmaceuticals or their doctors , he advised .

Pharmacists are also being asked to `` visually inspect and verify the identity of all tablets dispensed , '' Cox said .

`` The likelihood of finding a wrong pill in an opioid pain medication is low , '' he said . `` Patients should not be alarmed . These steps we 're recommending are additional steps we are recommending to further reduce an already low likelihood of medication mix-up . ''

The Nebraska plant has been temporarily shut down , which could cause drug shortages and disruptions in the supply chain for Endo Pharmaceuticals .

`` We anticipate that there may be a short-term disruption in the supply of these products to patients . This temporary supply disruption is not related to the efficacy or safety of these products , '' according to the company .

`` We are not aware of any patient having experienced a confirmed product mix-up and there have been no adverse events attributable to a product mix-up . We believe the likelihood of product mix-up reaching a patient is remote , '' according to the company .

The over-the-counter items involved in the Novartis recall include Excedrin and NoDoz products with expiration dates of December 20 , 2014 , or earlier , as well as Bufferin and Gas-X products with December 20 , 2013 , or earlier expiration dates .

Novartis had suspended operations at , and shipments from , the Lincoln , Nebraska , facility . The company said this was done `` to accelerate maintenance '' and make other improvements , adding that it currently `` is not possible '' to determine when the plant will reopen .

Consumers who have the affected products can contact Novartis Consumer Relationship Center or try to obtain a refund .
