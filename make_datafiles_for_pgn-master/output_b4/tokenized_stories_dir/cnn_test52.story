Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Torrential rain in Myanmar has forced thousands to flee their homes and flooded hundreds of thousands of acres of rice paddies , media reports and aid workers say .

Two weeks of heavy monsoon rain caused the flooding , which has primarily affected the Irrawaddy Delta region close to the capital Yangon .

Around the port city of Pathein , 236,000 people had been affected , with 35,000 moved to temporary relief camps in schools , monasteries and churches , said Denis De Poerck , director of program operations for Save the Children in Myanmar .

He said the families that had not fled were living on the upper floors of their homes and long boats were the main form of transport .

The government , private benefactors and the World Food Program had provided food rations to flood victims , he added .

`` What people need now is non-food items -- clothing , cooking pots and utensils , '' he told CNN by telephone from Yangon .

The state-run New Light of Myanmar reported that President Thein Sein on Sunday visited Bago , another flood-hit area east of the capital , to provide assistance to some of the victims .

De Poerck added that the United Nations estimated that 200,000 acres of rice paddies had been destroyed and 55,000 acres remained under water . One acre is around the size of an American football field .

Myanmar often suffers from flooding during the monsoon season but in the areas assessed by Save the Children locals said the floods were the worst since 1997 .

In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar 's southern delta region , killing 130,000 people .
