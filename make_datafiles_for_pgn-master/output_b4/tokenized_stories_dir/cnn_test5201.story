-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Washington was a sea of smartphones snapping photos on Monday throughout the pomp and circumstance of Inauguration Day . Between the glamorous gowns , the presidential oath , and the parade of marching bands , it was a day meant to be documented .

But we made a discovery during it all : Just as interesting as the photos themselves were the people taking them .

Back in 2009 , the inauguration was a huge deal -- an estimated 1.8 million people packed the National Mall to see America 's first African-American president make history . Not surprisingly , CNN iReport saw a record number of contributions that day : nearly 12,000 submissions of `` the moment , '' when President Obama took the oath of office .

This time , things were different . There were fewer attendees -- officials estimated between 800,000 to 900,000 people attended Monday 's inauguration . But , more importantly , the social media landscape has dramatically changed in the past four years . So this time around , we invited our audience to document the inauguration through Instagram , the mobile photo-sharing site that was launched in October 2010 and now boasts an impressive 90 million monthly active users .

The call to action was simple -- we invited attendees to take an Instagram shot of themselves during the inaugural festivities , tag the photo #cnn , and share why they made the trek to Washington -- and the end result was fantastic . Between Sunday and Monday , we received more than 10,300 photos and showcased some of the best submissions in a custom interactive . Others uploaded photos to iReport , CNN 's global participatory news community .

Together , the photos tell you a story about the people assembled for Obama 's second inauguration .

The crowd was diverse , made up of people old and young , black and white . There were families and groups of friends . For some , it was their first inauguration . Others were back to see Obama 's inaugural speech a second time . It was cold and sunny , as evidenced by the number of winter hats and sunglasses in the crowd . At least one attendee , though , used her shades to block more than just the sunshine . `` I was a total crybaby out there , '' she wrote .

American flags were the other accessory du jour . `` Do n't even think about going without a flag , '' advised iReporter Lisa Clemans-Cope , mother of two young girls . At least one attendee made a point to stand out among the rest -- in a clever homemade `` Obama Care Bear '' costume .

There were notable attendees in the crowd -- `` Glee 's '' Darren Criss , Rep. Grace Meng , D-New York , and comedian Hal Sparks all joined the Instagram + iReport project -- alongside average citizens . And most everyone was grinning ear to ear , except for one man who documented his frustration with the glitchy Mall television feed .

Finally , there were the stories behind the photos . Renee Chrisman shared a photo of her husband , Gunnery Sgt. Bradley Chrisman , who was chosen to escort inaugural VIPs onto the stage . Renee and their children were glued to the television set at home in North Carolina hoping to see Bradley in action . `` We caught a glimpse of him standing to the right of the president , '' she gushed .

Political science student John White took notes during the ceremony . `` I plan on pursuing a career in national politics , '' he said . `` Now that I am beginning to lay out the work for my future career , this inauguration is my first step . ''

And for Becky Primeaux , attending the inauguration meant she could cross off an item on her `` bucket list . ''

`` To be part of something that is so patriotic and historic is so exciting , '' she said . `` I think every American should -LRB- attend an inauguration -RRB- in their life . ''
