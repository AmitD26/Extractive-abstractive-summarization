Philadelphia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The highest-ranking Catholic church cleric charged and convicted in the landmark child sexual abuse trial will remain in jail for the time being , a Philadelphia judge ordered Tuesday .

Monsignor William Lynn was found guilty Friday of one count of child endangerment , the first time a U.S. church leader has been convicted of such a charge .

The trial marked the first time U.S. prosecutors have charged not just the priests who allegedly committed abuses but also church leaders for failing to stop them . Lynn is the highest-ranking cleric accused of imperiling children by helping cover up sexual abuse .

He was found not guilty on a second count of endangerment and on a charge of conspiring to protect a priest accused of abuse .

Lynn 's defense team argued during the trial that their client repeatedly told higher-ups about the alleged abuse and , under strict orders from the late Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua , had no authority to remove priests from the ministry .

On Monday , Lynn 's defense attorneys filed a motion requesting that their client be released on house arrest pending his scheduled August 13 sentencing . He could face three-and-a-half to seven years in prison for his conviction on the third-degree felony .

`` With every fiber in my body , -LRB- fleeing -RRB- is a non-issue , '' said Jeffrey Lindy , one of Lynn 's lawyers .

Following Friday 's verdict , Lindy criticized the decision not to let his client remain free on bond prior to sentencing , calling it `` an unspeakable miscarriage of justice -LRB- for -RRB- a 61-year-old man with no prior record and long-established ties to the community . ''

Assistant District Attorney Patrick Blessington vehemently opposed house arrest .

`` It 's absurd , '' Blessington said . `` It would truly be an injustice to indulge these people after what they 've done . ''

The hearing to discuss the motion for house arrest took place before a packed courtroom Tuesday . Lynn arrived dressed in all black and without his clerical collar . He wore full clerical garb during the 50 days of the trial and 13 days of jury deliberations .

In addition to his two lead counselors , several of Lynn 's family members filled the rows in the gallery . Also in attendance was Rita DeCarolis , the mother of Lynn 's deceased sister 's husband , who agreed to allow Lynn to stay in her home if he were granted house arrest , at which point one of Lynn 's sisters began to weep .

DeCarolis , who lives alone , was briefly called to the witness stand to confirm her understanding of house arrest and to prove her residency to the judge .

`` I 'm free , '' she told the court , regarding her availability to house the monsignor .

At the conclusion of Tuesday 's hearing , Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Judge Teresa Sarmina delayed her decision on whether Lynn should be placed under house arrest rather than jailed until his sentencing .

Sarmina allowed prosecutors a week to consult legal analysts and Rev. Thomas Doyle -- who was sworn in as an expert witness on Catholicism and its canon law during the trial -- to determine what , if any , steps are to be taken in the event Lynn fled to the Vatican , where there is no extradition .

She also instructed the defense to consult with their client to ensure he was aware of the consequences , should he flee .

`` Get the hell out of here , he 's not going to the Vatican , '' another one of Lynn 's attorneys , Thomas Bergstrom , told reporters outside of the courthouse , adding that his client is incredibly strong considering the circumstances . `` That 's ridiculous . ''

Although Sarmina did not grant the defense motion for release on house arrest pending sentencing , she did initiate the procedure for receiving an electronic monitoring device .

The average wait time for such a device is three to four weeks .

If granted and Lynn were to violate the conditions of house arrest , the judge could sentence him immediately as well as impose the maximum sentence of seven years in prison .

`` The risk of flight is going up because he now has something to lose , '' Assistant District Attorney Mark Cipolletti told reporters outside the courthouse . `` This case is unprecedented and on a lot of fronts , it 's a case of first impressions . ''

Lynn surrendered his passport and his bail was increased to $ 100,000 pending the house arrest judgment .

All parties are due back in court July 5 .
