-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bram Stoker 's private journal sat unnoticed on his great-grandson 's bookshelf in England for at least a year .

Full of notes that would inform his legendary novel `` Dracula '' and other stories , the thin , unmarked book had probably been lugged down from the attic at some point , along with other things the Stoker family had passed down for more than a century and placed inconspicuously in Noel Dobbs ' Isle of Wight home .

Then , one day not long ago , a researcher working on a project about Stoker got in touch with Dobbs to ask if he might know anything about a journal his famous relative kept . Dobbs looked around and finally popped open this tiny book . It was signed `` Abraham Stoker . ''

`` It 's kind of incredible , but Noel was rather blasÃ © about it , '' laughed Dacre Stoker , Dobbs ' cousin and a professor in South Carolina who has written a book about Bram Stoker . When news reached Dacre that the journal had been discovered , he cajoled his cousin into sending him photographs of a few pages .

`` When I saw it , I was amazed , '' Dacre Stoker said . `` I thought , ` The Holy Grail ! We 've found it ! ' There is so little written by Bram about Bram . Family , scholars and hard-core fans -- so many people have wanted to know what made the man who wrote ` Dracula ' tick . And here we had a major set of clues . ''

Those clues will be published next March in `` The Lost Journal , '' Dacre Stoker told CNN.com . The publication will mark 100 years since the author died in April 1912 .

Dacre Stoker has worked with Bram Stoker scholars to annotate `` The Lost Journal , '' which also offers quirky bits of folklore from Ireland , Stoker 's homeland , and insight into the inspiration for his other work .

There are 305 entries , some pages-long , others just a few sentences .

Bram Stoker was in his early 20s when the journal began in 1871 . He had graduated from Ireland 's Trinity College and was working at Dublin Castle .

It would be more than a decade before the author learned about the primary inspiration for his Count Dracula , `` Vlad the Impaler . '' The real-life prince of Wallachia who ruled during the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans , Vlad earned his nickname by impaling his enemies . His viciousness became notorious in Germany and other parts of Europe where tales spread of a man-monster who lived off blood .

Vlad 's father was a member of the Order of the Dragon , or Dracul . `` Dracula '' means son of the Dragon .

The last entry of Stoker 's journal in 1881 hints at a major character he would use in `` Dracula . '' In the novel , Renfield is an asylum inmate who has delusions that compel him to eat living beings , including flies , to gain their life force . The vampire Count Dracula seizes on Renfield 's weakness and offers him as many creatures as he can eat in exchange for his eternal devotion .

It does n't work out well for Renfield in the end .

In his journal , Stoker wrote : `` I once knew a boy who put so many flies into a bottle that they had not room to die . ''

In another passage , the author seems to be alluding to a vampire 's inability to see his own reflection . `` Story of man who reflects everybody 's self who meets him , '' he wrote .

Stoker 's interest in spookiness shows up in other journal entries .

`` A man builds up his shadow on a wall bit by bit by adding to substance , '' he wrote . `` Suddenly the shadow becomes alive . '' The passage is believed to be a kernel of the `` The Shadow Builder , '' one of Stoker 's first attempts at a horror mystery .

The journal offers some surprising insight about the author , too . There are funny `` memos '' that Stoker wrote to himself , which Dacre Stoker believes were witticisms that the author may have wanted to use at a party or a pub to seem interesting .

The journal also contains romantic poems . `` People do n't think of Bram Stoker as being romantic , but there are some very romantic , sweet moments here , '' Dacre Stoker said .

The author apparently drew from his journal for material that would make up `` Under the Sunset , '' a lesser-known collection of short stories for children that Stoker published in 1881 .

One note in the journal alludes to the writer 's fascination with children : `` Palace of Fairy Queen . Child goes to sleep & palace grows -- sky changes into blue silk curtains etc. '' Dreaming kids would appear in several stories in `` Under the Sunset , '' all darkly told tales that meditate on the blurry line between reality and imagination , science and folklore .

`` Bram had a troubled childhood , '' Dacre Stoker said . `` He was very lonely and thought about death a lot during seven years that he was just a boy and struggling through an undiagnosed illness . ''

The journal 's first entry , titled `` Night Fishing , '' is a kind of ode to the sea and the people who encounter it . The writing seems experimental and flowery .

`` It 's as if Bram were practicing , '' Stoker said . `` He might have thought , ` Well , this is how a writer is supposed to write -- in very long sentences . ' ''

The author was fascinated with the theater and the act of observing , and he traveled a lot , a rare thing for his time . Journaling and touring are central in `` Dracula . '' The novel 's narrator , Jonathan Harker , writes in his journal as he travels across Europe , witnessing and questioning the day 's superstitions and trying to make sense of his own bad dreams and bizarre , supernatural encounters . The novel centers on Dracula 's attempt to move from Transylvania to England , and his battle with professor Abraham van Helsing .

`` Bram traveled an unusual amount for the time that he lived , '' Dacre Stoker said . `` He was curious . He loved to ask those questions : What is real and what is myth , and where do they meet ? What is stronger , science or myth ? ''

Though Stoker died before his Count Dracula became internationally famous when Bela Lugosi played him as a suave nobleman in the 1930s film , Dacre Stoker thinks the author would be flattered by how his character has stayed relevant over the years . From Lugosi to Anne Rice 's Lestat and `` Buffy the Vampire Slayer '' to `` Twilight '' and `` True Blood , '' Stoker 's main question : `` What does it mean to live forever ? '' has proved eternal .

And in true Bram Stoker style , he left one more mystery .

In one of his books , the author alludes to another diary . He writes about an upcoming trip to London where one can get work as a writer . The journal of writing and notes that was recently found in the Isle of Wight home is not that diary .

`` There 's something else out there -- that missing piece , this mystery diary , '' Stoker said . `` I 'm dying to know where it is . ''
