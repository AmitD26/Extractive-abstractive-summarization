-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We tend to think of the 2008 financial crisis as the atom bomb that smashed the American economy , and from which we have yet to recover .

But what if our economic woes started far earlier than that ? The recession officially began in December 2007 , and some scholars , including Jeremy Nalewaik of the Federal Reserve , argue that if we measure gross domestic product by looking at incomes rather than expenditures , it actually started in the last three months of 2006 .

That is , we started digging the hole even earlier than is commonly understood . And now a number of scholars are suggesting that our troubles really began in the early 2000s , yet they were masked by an unsustainable housing boom .

The recovery has been extremely uneven , with college-educated workers faring better than non-college-educated workers . This has led a number of economic thinkers to suggest that the persistence of high unemployment flows in no small part from a structural dynamic .

Just as the transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy created tremendous dislocation in the Depression era , and the transition from an industrial to a service-oriented economy devastated America 's Rust Belt in the sharp recession of the early 1980s , one possibility is that we are living through another painful transition , only we do n't have a good sense of what the United States will look like on the other side .

This is the view embraced by thinkers on the left , like Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University , and in the center , like Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago 's Booth School of Business , as well as many conservatives and libertarians who advocate structural reform . Though these thinkers acknowledge that weak consumer demand plays a role , they vary considerably in what they consider the appropriate formula for jump-starting growth and they are convinced that fixing the demand problem alone is n't enough .

Others maintain that our current economic stagnation is almost entirely about weak consumer demand that flows from the damage the housing bust did to household balance sheets , and that some combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus should be our highest priority . This view is most commonly associated with liberals such as New York Times columnist and Princeton economist Paul Krugman .

A related view , which attributes dismal growth to a monetary policy that is far too tight , has been championed by the libertarian Bentley University economist Scott Sumner and a growing number of right-leaning thinkers . These thinkers tend to maintain that the `` structuralists '' are missing the point . Even if there is a big economic transition is going on , its importance is swamped by the more straightforward shortfall in consumer demand .

A number of economists , many of them based at the University of Chicago , have been devising new ways to test these theories to determine what has really happened to cause high unemployment . Last year , Atif Mian of the University of California , Berkeley ; and Amir Sufi of the University of Chicago 's Booth School of Business released a paper arguing that the central driver of the decline in employment levels between 2007 and 2009 -- the massive economic blow from which we have yet to recover -- was a drop in demand caused by shocks to household balance sheets .

Mian and Sufi tested this proposition by comparing employment declines in high-leverage counties , in which households had higher ratios of debt to disposable income , and in low leverage counties , in which households had lower ratios . They found that high leverage counties saw a steeper drop in `` non-tradable employment '' than low leverage counties , which led them to conclude that consumer demand shocks were indeed key .

The non-tradable part matters because employment in tradable industries such as manufacturing depends on the health of the national and global marketplace while non-tradable employment -LRB- think restaurant waiters or physical therapists -RRB- depends on the health of the local marketplace . Of the 6.2 million jobs lost between 2007 and 2009 , Mian and Sufi attributed 4 million to this hit to consumer demand .

Though Mian and Sufi do n't make explicit policy recommendations , one implication of their findings is that the best way to restore economic growth might be to address household balance sheet weakness directly , whether through debt forgiveness or an increase in inflation . Debt forgiveness would allow households to reduce mortgage payments , thus giving them more to spend , and inflation would erode the value of accumulated debt , thus making it more manageable .

Just this month , Kerwin Kofi Charles of the University of Chicago 's Harris School of Public Policy and Erik Hurst and Matthew Notowidigo , both of the Booth School , offered a somewhat different take . Rather than focus exclusively on the period since 2007 , Charles , Hurst , and Notowidigo analyze shifts in the composition of employment from 2000 to 2007 . Specifically , they focus on how declines in manufacturing employment interacted with housing booms in different cities across the United States .

Essentially , the authors find that while a negative shock to manufacturing employment had a big negative impact on employment for non-college-educated men , a positive shock to housing prices more than made up for it . Until , that is , the housing bust wiped out these gains . And so Charles , Hurst , and Notowidigo conclude that in the absence of the housing boom , the unemployment crisis facing non-college-educated men would have arrived much sooner .

In other words , the 37 % rise in housing prices between 2000 and 2007 functioned as a kind of invisible stimulus that shielded non-college-educated men from most of the fallout from the collapse in manufacturing jobs , 3.5 million of which evaporated over that same period . By way of comparison , there are 12 million manufacturing jobs in the United States today .

One irony of the housing boom is that it convinced millions of American men that there was no need to retrain for a new economic landscape , a decision that many might now regret .

The views of Mian and Sufi and Charles , Hurst , and Notowidigo are not necessarily at odds . Charles , Hurst , and Notowidigo are very open to the possibility that household balance sheet weakness has played a significant role in the persistence of high unemployment . Yet there are interesting tensions between these views .

By offering a compelling structural explanation for the steep employment decline among non-college-educated men in the wake of the housing bust , Charles , Hurst , and Notowidigo reinforce the view advanced by , among others , Booth 's Raghuram Rajan . In his well-regarded book `` Fault Lines , '' Rajan argued that one of the reasons the federal government subsidized mortgages and pushed for low interest rates is that politicians saw it as a cheap and easy way to boost the economic prospects of low - and middle-income households in a deindustrializing economy .

If Charles , Hurst , and Notowidigo are correct , tackling household balance sheet weakness might not be enough to address the economic challenges facing these men . Rather , men who were well-suited for either manufacturing or residential construction work will have to be retrained for jobs in very different fields . A darker possibility is that many of these men will drop out of the formal labor force entirely , and will find themselves living on the margins of society .

This is the kernel of truth in the debate over outsourcing . Though the offshoring of production has greatly benefited the American economy in many important respects -- by lowering the cost of goods and services , by increasing the demand for skilled labor , and by facilitating innovation , among other things -- it has contributed to the deterioration of the labor market position of non-college-educated men .

Automation has played a far larger role in declining manufacturing employment than offshoring , and indeed offshoring can be seen as nothing more than a transitional step as increasingly sophisticated machines start displacing less-skilled foreign labor . But it is offshoring that sparks the most anxiety in American workers . By documenting the scale of U.S. manufacturing 's decline , Charles , Hurst , and Notowidigo have done a great deal to shed light on why .
