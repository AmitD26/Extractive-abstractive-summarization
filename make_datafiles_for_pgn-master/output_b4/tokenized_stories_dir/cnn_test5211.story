Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The French government is in talks with Libyan rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition , a Libyan opposition military spokesman in Misrata said late Thursday .

The French government has not confirmed the claim , which follows an acknowledgement earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere .

Ibrahim Baitalmal , the spokesman for Misrata 's Military Council , said that if the French agreed to help in Misrata , anti-Gadhafi forces there would receive much needed supplies to fight against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces .

Misrata is surrounded on three sides by Gadhafi 's forces , which are much better armed . The city 's only outlet is by sea .

Gadhafi has been under enormous international pressure to step down following a months-long uprising by rebels , emboldened by popular movements across the Middle East , trying to bring an end to his 42-year rule .

The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians . NATO began bombing military targets a short time later .

Libyan state TV reported Friday that NATO had attacked targets in the city of Gharyan , south of the capital , Tripoli .

It also reported that pro-Gadhafi forces had bombed an opposition building in Tobruk , in the far east of the country .

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded an explanation from Paris Thursday over its parachuting-in of arms to Libyan rebels -- which was first revealed in a French media report Wednesday -- Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported .

Lavrov said that if confirmed , France 's action was in violation of the U.N.resolution .

But speaking in Moscow Friday , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said his country 's NATO partners and the U.N. Security Council had been told about France 's decision to drop weapons for the Libyan opposition .

`` We are exactly within the framework of resolutions 1970 and 1973 ... all means can be used to help civilian populations to protect themselves , '' he said .

`` It 's within that framework that we reacted . We informed our NATO partners and the Security Council . ''

French Ministry of Defense spokesman Colonel Thierry Burkhard confirmed Wednesday that its military had dropped food , medical products and light weaponry by parachute to Libyans in Djebel Nefoussa .

`` It became clear that people there were defenseless and very much threatened by Gadhafi 's forces , '' he said . `` The weapons were given for self defense because of the security situation . ''

Speaking at a news conference Thursday , Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi said rebel forces were receiving arms from France but were not trained in their use .

He said it was reckless of France to take such action , saying it went `` against all of the proclaimed aims of NATO 's intervention in Libya . ''
