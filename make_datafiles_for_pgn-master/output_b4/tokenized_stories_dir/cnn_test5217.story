Chardon , Ohio -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prosecutor David Joyce said Tuesday that 17-year-old T.J. Lane has admitted taking a .22-caliber gun and a knife into Chardon High School on Monday morning and firing 10 rounds , choosing his victims randomly .

Asked by Judge Timothy J. Grendell during a preliminary hearing if he understood his rights , Lane said softly , `` Yes , sir , yes , I do . ''

Lane will continue to be held in detention , and charges must be filed by 4:45 p.m. March 1 , the judge ordered .

Joyce predicted Lane will be tried as an adult . `` Absolutely , '' he said . `` It 's a matter of law in the state of Ohio . At 17 years old , committing an act like this . '' He predicted the high school sophomore will be charged with three counts of aggravated murder `` as well as other counts . ''

`` I guarantee that this was an aberration , this does not represent our community , '' Joyce told reporters . `` He chose his victims at random . This is not about bullying . This is not about drugs . This is someone who is not well and I 'm sure , in our court case , we will prove that to all of your desires and we will make sure that justice is done in our county . ''

Grendell said the court had tentatively scheduled a hearing for March 19 `` should there be a filing of a motion for transfer to the adult court . ''

Earlier Tuesday , a third student died of wounds suffered in the shooting , hospital officials said .

Demetrius Hewlin died Tuesday morning , MetroHealth Medical Center said in a statement .

Russell King Jr. , 17 , was declared brain dead early Tuesday , according to the Cuyahoga County medical examiner 's office .

Student Daniel Parmertor died Monday .

`` We are very saddened by the loss of our son and others in our Chardon community , '' Hewlin 's family said in a statement released by the hospital . `` Demetrius was a happy young man who loved life and his family and friends . We will miss him very much , but we are proud that he will be able to help others through organ donation . ''

Police Chief Tim McKenna said the motive remained unclear . Students have described Lane as a withdrawn boy .

Lane told authorities that he stole the gun used in the shootings from his uncle , a source told CNN on Tuesday .

A law enforcement source said the weapon had been purchased legally .

Police found the gun inside the school , apparently dropped by the suspect as he fled , the source said .

One other student wounded in the shooting remained hospitalized Tuesday . A fifth victim was released , officials said .

Geauga County Sheriff Daniel McClelland said the community has a long way to go before it can put the shooting behind it .

`` Now we move to another important phase , '' he said . `` And while the investigation continues and we still look for the why and what and who , we now deal with a community looking to heal . ''

A prayer service at the Church of St. Mary in Chardon sought to speed that healing . Hundreds of people spilled outside the front of the church . Inside , those assembled applauded as school and police officials were introduced .

`` These are great people and out of a very , very , very terrible tragedy , they 'll rise again and they 'll make this an even greater town , '' Gov. John Kasich told reporters outside the church .

Heather Weinrich , a 2004 graduate of the school , said she drove an hour with her elementary school-age son to attend the event because she wanted him to know what happened and she wanted to support her school .

Zack Barry , an 18-year-old senior at the school , said he was overwhelmed by the turnout of support . `` It made me feel very good , '' he said .

Classes in the tightly knit community of 5,100 , about 30 miles east of Cleveland near Lake Erie , are to resume Friday . But staff , students and parents will be encouraged to return to district schools for visits and counseling on Wednesday and Thursday , Superintendent Joe Bergant said .

iReport : Shooting at Chardon High School

Some of the victims were students who were in the cafeteria waiting for a bus to take them to Auburn Career Center , a nearby vocational school that they attended , said Maggie Lynch , the school 's superintendent .

Lane is a student at Lake Academy Alternative School , a school for at-risk children , said the school 's interim director , Don Ehas .

In a statement Monday , Parmertor 's family said they were `` torn by the loss . ''

`` Danny was a bright young boy who had a bright future ahead of him , '' the family said .

Lawyer Bob Farinacci , speaking for Lane 's family , said Monday night that the suspect was `` extremely remorseful . ''

`` Very , very scared and extremely remorseful , '' he told CNN affiliate WKYC .

`` He is a very confused young man right now , '' Farinacci said . `` He 's very confused . He is very upset . He 's very distraught . ''

Like others in Chardon , Lane 's family also has been left groping for an explanation .

`` This is something that could never have been predicted , '' Farinacci said . `` T.J. 's family has asked for some privacy while they try to understand how such a tragedy could have occurred and while they mourn this terrible loss for their community . ''

With little to go on to help make sense of the violence , many turned to cryptic Facebook postings by the alleged shooter for a glimpse into Lane 's mindset -- especially a long , dark poetic rant from December 30 .

The post refers to `` a quaint lonely town , -LRB- where there -RRB- sits a man with a frown -LRB- who -RRB- longed for only one thing , the world to bow at his feet . ''

`` He was better than the rest , all those ones he detests , within their castles , so vain , '' he wrote .

Lane then wrote about going through `` the castle ... like an ominous breeze through the trees , '' past guards -- all leading up to the post 's dramatic conclusion .

`` Feel death , not just mocking you . Not just stalking you but inside of you , '' it says . `` Wriggle and writhe . Feel smaller beneath my might . Seizure in the Pestilence that is my scythe . ''

The post concludes with : `` Die , all of you . ''

Farinacci said Lane was a `` fairly quiet and good kid '' with good grades who was doubling up on classes to graduate in May .

`` He pretty much sticks to himself but does have some friends and has never been in trouble over anything that we know about , '' he said .

But just before class started Monday , witnesses say , Lane silently walked up to a table of students , holding a gun . As he opened fire , the shooter was expressionless , a student recalled .

`` He was silent the entire time , '' said student Nate Mueller , who said his ear was grazed by a bullet . `` There was no warning or anything . He just opened fire . ''

Monday 's death toll might have been higher had it not been for the actions of assistant football coach and study hall teacher Frank Hall . Students said Hall chased the gunman out of the school , and police arrested the suspect nearby a short time later .

`` Coach Hall , he always talks about how much he cares about us students , his team and everyone , '' said student Neil Thomas . `` And I think today he really went out and he proved how much he cared about us . He would take a bullet for us . ''

Similar praise was given to math teacher Joseph Ricci , whom 10th-grader Kaylee O'Donnell said made sure his students were safe before donning a bulletproof vest and entering a hallway , where he pulled a wounded student inside . `` You 're pretty brave in risking your life for students , '' she said .

`` I actually was sitting with a girl , and she asked if we could pray and I 'm like ` Yes , please . ' So me and her quietly did that and a couple of my friends . ''

Asked how she would feel when she returns to school , she said , `` It 's not going to be the same , but I still feel safe . ''

The shooting has had national repercussions . `` Violence like this should not be tolerated in our society , '' said House Speaker John Boehner . `` But let 's be honest -- there are about 250 million guns in America . They are out there but people should use them responsibly . ''
