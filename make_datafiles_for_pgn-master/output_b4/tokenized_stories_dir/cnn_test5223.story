Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dr. Conrad Murray , found guilty Monday of causing Michael Jackson 's death , begins his new life as an inmate in a section of the Los Angeles County jail where high-profile prisoners are kept , a jail official said .

While it is the `` medical area '' that houses inmates on suicide watch , Murray is only there because it has a higher ratio of guards , Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Sgt. Harry Drucker said .

Murray 's defense team has vowed to appeal his involuntary manslaughter conviction , but first they must deal with his sentencing set for November 29 .

While Murray was `` devastated '' by the guilty verdict , he is `` confident '' he will win an appeal , defense lawyer Nareg Gourjian said .

`` What matters most right now is trying to keep Dr. Murray from taking up a prison cell in this community , '' lead defense lawyer Ed Chernoff said . `` That 's what we 're focusing on right now and we 'll deal with an appeal after that . ''

Murray served as Jackson 's personal physician as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts , with Murray giving him the surgical anesthetic propofol to help him sleep nearly every night for the last two months of his life , according to testimony .

Jackson 's death on June 25 , 2009 , was caused by `` acute propofol intoxication '' in combination with two sedatives , the Los Angeles County coroner ruled .

The verdict followed about nine hours of jury deliberations , which began Friday morning in the downtown Los Angeles County courthouse .

Murray could be sentenced to as much as four years in a state prison , but his lawyers will ask for probation and `` maybe a little bit '' of time in the county jail , Gourjian said .

A new California law aimed at reducing state prison overcrowding and a federal court order addressing county jail overcrowding could combine to significantly reduce Murray 's time behind bars .

If Murray 's conviction is treated as a non-violent felony he could be kept in the county jail , where he could be eligible to serve some of his time at home under monitored house arrest .

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor , who will decide Murray 's sentence , made it clear when he denied bail Monday that he considered the doctor a threat to public safety .

`` This is not a crime involving a mistake of judgment , '' Pastor said . `` This was a crime where the end result was the death of a human being . ''

Both Chernoff and Gourjian said the defense was not surprised by the guilty verdict .

`` I think what went wrong was a lot of the pretrial rulings that were made by the court in reference to some of the evidence that we planned to offer for the jury to consider , '' Gourjian told CNN 's Piers Morgan . `` I think that 's essentially what denied Dr. Murray a fair trial in this case . ''

The outcome may have been different had the defense been able to introduce additional evidence -- like on Jackson 's past drug use and `` financial condition , '' Gourjian said .

Pastor 's rulings to limit the defense case could be the basis for an appeal , he said .

Murray appeared to show no emotion as the verdict was read by court clerk Sammi Benson Monday afternoon or even as deputies handcuffed him and led him away .

A loud celebration erupted among Jackson fans outside of the courthouse , where emotions ran so high at least one woman fainted . Passing cars honked their horns , as people nearby hugged , cried and yelled out in joy .

Jackson 's family , including by his parents and several of his brothers and sisters , smiled as they left the courthouse .

An emotional La Toya Jackson on Monday thanked all those involved in the trial , calling the decision a `` victory . ''

`` Everybody was wonderful , '' La Toya Jackson told HLN 's Jane Velez-Mitchell as she left the Los Angeles courthouse .

A statement released by Jackson 's estate Monday said that `` justice has been served . ''

Deputy District Attorney David Walgren personally expressed his sympathies to the Jackson family who he said lost `` not a pop icon , but a son and brother . ''

Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley thanked jurors `` for their hard work and thoughtful deliberation , '' and expressed gratitude that they recognized the `` overwhelming '' evidence against Murray in finding him guilty .

The seven men and five women on the jury heard 49 witnesses over 23 days , including Murray 's girlfriends and patients , Jackson 's former employees , investigators and medical experts for each side .

Defense lawyers contended the matter was a negligence case that should instead be heard by the state medical board .

`` If it were anybody else but Michael Jackson , would this doctor be here today ? '' Chernoff asked in his closing .

Jurors were left to decide if the propofol overdose was infused into Jackson 's blood by a steady intravenous drip , as the prosecution contended , or if Jackson injected himself using a syringe left nearby by Murray , as the defense argued .

`` He was just a little fish in a big , dirty pond , '' Chernoff said , pointing the finger at other doctors who treated Jackson , and Jackson himself .

Prosecutor Walgren attacked the defense for trying to blame `` everybody but Conrad Murray , poor Conrad Murray . ''

Walgren painted Murray as a selfish doctor who agreed to take $ 150,000 a month to give Jackson nightly infusions of propofol in his home , something prosecutors argued an ethical doctor would never do because of the dangers .

`` It was a very strong and powerful message that this sort of conduct does rise to the level of criminal negligence , and to the extent someone dies as a result of them playing the role of Dr. Feel Good , they will be held accountable , '' Cooley said after the verdict .

Murray 's license to practice medicine is now suspended , according to the Medical Board of California , which decides if a doctor can legally work in the state .

In the light of the conviction , the board now will open an investigation to determine whether or not to fully revoke Murray 's right to practice medicine in the state , spokeswoman Jennifer Simoes said .

The main criteria in deciding whether to revoke , suspend or take other action against any doctor is assessing how substantial a crime is related to the practice of medicine . There is no timeline as to when the board might act regarding Murray , said Simoes .
