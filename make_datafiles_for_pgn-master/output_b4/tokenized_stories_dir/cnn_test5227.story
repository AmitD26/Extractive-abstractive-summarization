LAWRENCE , Kansas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It started with a sore throat . Then her chest was burning .

Arielle Spiridigliozzi is one of 350 students who have contracted H1N1 at the University of Kansas .

University of Kansas freshman Arielle Spiridigliozzi said she thought her symptoms were signs of allergies , or maybe even a sinus infection .

It could n't be H1N1 , she thought .

But it was .

`` I mean , I 'd never , ever guessed that coming into freshman year I would get the friggin ' swine flu , '' Spiridigliozzi said .

Now she accessorizes her royal blue T-shirt with a mask .

A stuffy nose , body aches , fever and coughing make up the litany of symptoms , Spiridigliozzi , 18 , and her roommate , Kaitlyn Perry , 18 , said they have suffered .

For more than a day , the girls have been stuck in their suite , on what they call `` lockdown . '' Watch more about life on `` lockdown '' ''

University officials have asked the girls to stay in their dorm suite to limit exposure to other students . The school provides door-to-door delivery from the campus dining hall , giving the girls one less reason to have to leave their immediate four walls .

Spiridigliozzi has abided by the the university 's request , worried that she could infect another . But she does n't understand how she ended up in this situation in the first place .

`` We took all the necessary precautions . Like , we really did . It was n't like I was licking the handlebars of the bus or anything , '' she said . `` I was hand sanitizing . I was being very careful . I do n't know how this happened . ''

But she only has to look to her roommates for an answer , as illness has rapidly made its way through her suite .

When Perry became ill it struck her suddenly . While shopping , she came down with a fever and started feeling like she did n't have the strength to stand , she said .

Perry 's flu has n't been confirmed as an H1N1 strain , but a third roommate , the first to get sick , they said , was diagnosed with H1N1 . Then a fourth roommate got sick , illustrative of a spreading flu pattern the girls said is obvious from the empty seats in classes .

The university estimates about 340 students , or 1 percent of the student body , have flu they suspect is H1N1 , said Patricia Denning , medical chief of staff at Watkins Health Center . The number of cases could be higher if students were not seeking care from campus doctors and nurses , she added . She said she has not heard of any students being hospitalized because of the flu .

Vaccines are unlikely to help much this year , because supplies are not expected until late October and require about five weeks from the first inoculation -- two are required -- before they become effective .

So , to make life easier for the sick , the school 's medical center has distributed what it calls a `` flu kit , '' which includes a mask and a home-care instruction sheet , Denning said .

The tip sheet borrows from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's information on H1N1 . It says to drink lots of fluids , eat three small meals a day and get plenty of rest , Denning said .

`` And so it just goes through simple common-sense things that we all know we need to do that sometimes , when mothers and dads are n't around to remind them , this will help remind them , '' she said .

Spiridigliozzi and Perry will get to wander outdoors again once their fevers have dissipated for at least 24 hours without the aid of fever-reducing medications , they said . They are eager to get back to their normal lives .

Spiridigliozzi is tired of the soup and Jell-O , and Perry looks forward to playing Frisbee again .

`` So boring '' is how Spiridigliozzi described their isolation .

With all this free time , at least the freshmen -- on campus for only two weeks -- are n't falling too far behind in their school work .

`` I got all my homework done , '' Perry said .

`` Yeah , I 've gotten all my homework done for the next two weeks , probably , '' added Spiridigliozzi .
