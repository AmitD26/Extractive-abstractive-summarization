Steubenville , Ohio -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three teens testified Friday they saw two star Steubenville , Ohio , high school football players accused of rape engage in sexual contact with an allegedly drunk 16-year-old girl .

The testimony came during the third day of a trial that has gained national attention over its focus on text messages and cell-phone pictures and videos surrounding the alleged sexual abuse of the girl .

Trent Mays , 17 , and Ma ` lik Richmond , 16 , are accused of raping the girl during a series of end-of-summer parties in August 2012 .

One of the witnesses , a 17-year-old , told Judge Thomas Lipps that he used his cell phone to record Mays putting his fingers inside the girl 's vagina during a drive from one party to another . The boy said he deleted the video the next morning when he realized it was wrong .

Defense lawyers tried to dismantle what prosecutors said was the central argument in the case -- whether the girl was too drunk to understand what was happening to her . The defense challenged whether all three witnesses were reconstructing events from memory or from the text messages and cell phone images .

According to prosecutors , Richmond and Mays each penetrated the victim 's vagina with their fingers , an act that constitutes rape under Ohio law .

Trial focuses on text messages

Mays also is accused of illegal use of a minor in nudity oriented material .

Lawyers for the accused teens say the two are innocent .

The teen witness , whom CNN is not identifying because of his age , was identified as a friend of Mays and Richmond as well as a Steubenville High School football player and wrestler .

The teen also told the court Mays later attempted to have the girl perform a sex act on him in the basement of a home , where they ended up after the initial alleged incident in the car .

`` She did n't really respond to it , '' he said .

CNN is not naming the girl in line with its policy of not identifying the alleged victims of sexual assault . CNN also is not naming the minors who are testifying but is identifying Mays and Richmond , whose names have been used by court officials and their attorneys and in multiple media accounts .

A second witness , 18-year-old Evan Westlake , told the judge he saw Richmond digitally penetrate the girl in the basement of the home where they ended up after the parties .

On cross-examination , Richmond 's attorney , Walter Madison , challenged whether Westlake 's was trying to right a wrong through his testimony .

`` I felt a lot of regret , difficult to face my family knowing they knew what I had done , '' Westlake testified .

A third witness , 18-year-old Anthony Craig , testified he saw Richmond digitally penetrate the girl in the basement .

`` She was n't moving . She was n't talking . She was n't participating , '' he told the court . Craig was identified in as a Steubenville High School wrestler and friend of Mays and Richmond .

The teen , who testified the alleged victim was also a friend , admitted to taking a cell phone picture of the girl when she was naked in the basement and then showing it later to friends . Asked why , he responded : `` It was stupid . ''

The teens testified only after Lipps , who is presiding over the trial without a jury , granted them immunity from prosecution . All three initially attempted to invoke the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination .

Teen rape trial shines unwelcome spotlight on Ohio town

The testimony came a day after prosecutors presented text messages they said were between Mays and various people , and the alleged victim .

Prosecutors contend the texts between Mays and his friends and classmates on August 12 detail a night of heavy drinking and the sexual abuse of the girl .

Some of the messages were between Mays and the alleged victim .

In one message she asks what happened `` last night . ''

`` And do n't lie about anything . I need to know the truth . People keep asking . Idk -LRB- I do n't know -RRB- what to say , '' the message said , according to Joann Gibb , a computer forensic investigator with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation , who read the messages to the court on Thursday .

Mays responded that `` nothing happened last night , '' but he told her in the message she performed a sex act on him , Gibb testified .

In some of the messages from Mays , according to Gibb , he writes that he had sex with the girl . In others , he says the girl performed a sex act on him .

One message asked Mays : '' Did u do it ? ''

He responded , according to Gibb : `` No , lol . She could barely move . ''

Still another graphic message from Mays to a friend appeared to detail his anger over being accused of rape .

`` I 'm pissed all I got was a hand job , though . I should have raped since everyone thinks I did , '' the message said , according to Gibb .

The defense questioned the validity of the messages , with Mays ' attorney asking computer forensic expert Gibb whether she could be absolutely sure the messages were from his client .

`` I ca n't put a person behind a cell phone , '' she said .

Teens treated girl ` like a toy , ' prosecutor says

In earlier testimony , teens who attended some of the booze-soaked parties testified the girl appeared to be drunk , stumbling and slurring words .

But on cross-examination some said she seemed to be able to walk and answer questions .

The trial , which is likely to stretch into the weekend , is moving quickly to accommodate the schedule of the judge . A verdict is expected by Sunday .

CNN 's Poppy Harlow and Brian Vitagliano reported from Steubenville , Ohio , and Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta . CNN 's Yon Pomrenze and Michael Pearson contributed to this report .
