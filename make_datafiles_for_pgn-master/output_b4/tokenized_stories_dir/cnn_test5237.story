-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Real Madrid sealed a record-extending 32nd La Liga title after Wednesday 's 3-0 win at Athletic Bilbao maintained an unassailable seven-point lead over arch rivals and defending Spanish champions Barcelona with two matches to play .

Goals from Gonzalo Higuain , Mesut Ozil and Cristiano Ronaldo wrapped up the clinching victory for Jose Mourinho 's men at San Mames .

Mourinho has now won league titles in Portugal with Porto , England with Chelsea , Italy with Inter and Spain with Real , who broke Barcelona 's three-year La Liga reign .

`` This one has been the toughest . I 've won seven league titles overall and I know what it feels like , '' Mourinho told the club 's website .

`` Barcelona won all their games , as befits the great team that they are . They 've been winning to the very last day . They are a club with great tradition that knows we deserved to win this title . ''

Earlier on Wednesday , Barca thrashed fourth-placed Malaga 4-1 to keep up the pressure on Real as Lionel Messi scored his eighth hat-trick this season and broke Gerd Muller 's record for a European season .

Argentina 's three-time world player of the year now has 68 goals in 2011-12 , going past the mark Germany legend Muller set in 1972-73 for Bayern Munich .

It took Messi 's tally in La Liga to 46 , two more than Ronaldo , but his efforts have proved in vain .

Real 's trip to the Europa League finalists looked a tough one , and when Ronaldo saw an early penalty saved by Gorka Iraizoz , their small band of supporters might have been worried .

But Argentina striker Higuain settled nerves with a fine strike before Ronaldo played in Ozil for a second to make it 2-0 at halftime .

Early in the second half the Portugal star netted his 44th in the league this season with a close-range header , and Bilbao 's last hopes of salvaging something from the game ended when Javi Martinez was sent off for a second yellow card .

At the finish Mourinho was hoisted high by his players as they celebrated the club 's first championship since 2008 .

`` We have to celebrate this championship . We have to continue working after tomorrow because next season will also be tough and we have games to play still in this campaign , '' the 49-year-old said .

`` This team deserves even more emotion and affection , and I expect the Bernabeu to give it to them in our match against Mallorca . ''

The Dutch title was also decided on Wednesday as Ajax Amsterdam beat VVV Venlo 2-0 with goals in each half from Siem De Jong .

It is Ajax 's second straight title under Frank de Boer and came after a late-season charge with 13 straight wins .

Ajax were eight points behind joint leaders PSV Eindhoven and AZ Alkmaar in mid-February before their unstoppable run .

In Serie A , Juventus ' lead was cut to a single point after being held to a 1-1 draw by 10-man Lecce .

Second-placed AC Milan beat Atalanta 2-0 to revive their hopes on a night Juve could have clinched the title if results had gone in their favor .

Sulley Muntari put Milan ahead in the San Siro and Robinho sealed a vital victory in injury time .

In Turin , Juventus appeared to be cruising to a routine home win when Claudio Marchisio scored in the first half .

Lecce 's hopes appeared over when Juan Cuadrado was sent off for a second booking early in the second half , but the leaders wasted a string of chances before Andrea Bertolacci took advantage of a horrible error by home keeper Gianluigi Buffon to level .

In other action , Inter Milan 's Champions League chances receded with a 3-1 loss at Parma which left the 2010 European titleholders three points behind Napoli and Udinese in the race for third place .
