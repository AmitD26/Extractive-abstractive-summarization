-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- By now the story has become familiar , though it 's no less gut-wrenching : A grown man is accused of hurling a racial insult at a crying toddler on an Atlanta-bound flight and then slapping the child when he wo n't quiet down .

Joe Rickey Hundley of Idaho has been charged with assaulting 19-month-old Jonah Bennett and has lost his job . Hundley turned himself in to authorities on Tuesday and was released on bail . His first court appearance has not been set .

Hundley 's attorney , Marcia Shein , said her client is being unfairly portrayed .

A good deal of the conversation surrounding the incident involves the fear that the youngster may be `` traumatized forever . '' How likely is it that little Jonah will remember this incident or be affected by it long-term ?

Not very likely , according to experts .

`` He may remember it for a while , and he may be fearful , but a one-time experience wo n't have a long-term effect , '' said Atlanta pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Shu .

According to Shu , who has not treated the toddler , Jonah is too young to understand what is going on .

The incident was shocking in the moment , says Shu . The toddler understands the slap and knows that someone hit him and that it hurt . But he does n't know or comprehend the significance of what happened . Nor would he understand the meaning if ugly words were directed at him .

Dr. Theodore Gaensbauer , clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and author of the study `` Emotional Expression in Infancy , '' agrees .

`` I would not say it will cause lifelong trauma , depending on how it 's handled , '' observed Gaensbauer , who is a national expert on preschool trauma . The experience may , however , create a vulnerability for a period of time , perhaps months or up to a year or so . If something else happens that is reminiscent -- such as being subject to racially charged slurs and violence similar to the alleged incident -- he may be more vulnerable .

Early childhood trauma is certainly a cause for concern . Dr. Rajita Sinha , director of the Yale Stress Center , told me last year that stressful experiences can effectively rewire the brain to respond to hardship by becoming more sensitized to stress . That is , the child becomes hard-wired to react much more strongly than someone who did not experience a lot of turmoil . As a result , the child may go on to have a permanently elevated level of stress , with its adverse implications for physical and psychological health .

But challenging situations , even one as dramatic as the one little Jonah Bennett experienced , do not necessarily lead to lifelong issues . Sinha observed that it 's stress that is sustained , uncontrollable and overwhelming that is damaging .

`` It is hard to be resilient that often , '' said Gaensbauer , who also has not examined Jonah Bennett .

But even then , protective factors like social and family support , education and optimism and emotional self-regulation can provide a safety net for children .

Both Shu and Gaensbauer observe that most children can work through and overcome a single traumatic episode without any obvious long-term effects , given supportive parenting and caretaking .

`` How secure is the child 's relationship with his caregivers ? '' Shu asked . If he 's had good relationships and solid attachments , that will make him more able to deal with traumatic situations like this . On the other hand , if he 's had a lot of stress in his life already , it may make it harder .

What 's really important is how Jonah 's family is dealing with the incident .

Shu says that if the family is calm and reassuring , the child will be comforted by that . If they are stressed out and expressing their anxieties , particularly within the toddler 's earshot , he is likely to respond by becoming stressed as well .

After traumatic incidents , Gaensbauer always recommends that caregivers look out for subtle signs that children may be adversely affected : `` Things like increased clinginess , bed-wetting or separation anxiety . He may need to be closer to his parents . He may have trouble sleeping , may be more hyper . Noises may make him fearful . ''

The child may even hit others , cautions Gaensbauer . And in such an instance , it 's important that parents do not react punitively or generalize in terms of their child being more aggressive . `` What he 's doing is imitating and reenacting what he experienced , in an attempt to understand it . ''

Gaensbauer suggest that play therapy may be useful . Caregivers can use dolls , play materials and toy airplanes to create a scene that helps the child to conceptualize and develop a narrative around what happened .

Over and above providing reassurance and empathy , caregivers need to help children understand that the experience was unique , `` so they 're not living with this undercurrent of anxiety that no matter where I am , suddenly , for reasons I do n't understand , something terrible can happen , and someone can come along and hurt me . ''

It 's important to make the unconscious conscious , within the bounds of children 's understanding , says Gaensbauer . At age 2 , a child does not understand what happened , but with the wisdom , care and support of his loved ones , over time , he will .
