Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Almost two-thirds of Iowa 's Republican political pros predict that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney will win the state 's caucuses on Tuesday , but his campaign 's margin for error over Texas Rep. Ron Paul is slim .

As the candidates dashed around the state making their closing arguments to a volatile caucus electorate , CNN surveyed 64 Iowa GOP insiders -- including state legislators , local elected and party officials , senior advisers to Republican Gov. Terry Branstad , business and conservative interest group leaders , veterans of previous caucus campaigns , and a variety of other party activists -- to assess the shape of the GOP race .

In the CNN Iowa GOP insiders survey , a solid majority of the 64 Republican political pros thought Romney would finish first over Paul .

Who will finish first ?
• Mitt Romney : ... 40 -LRB- 63 % -RRB-
• Ron Paul : ... 17 -LRB- 27 % -RRB-
• Michele Bachmann : ... 1 -LRB- 1 % -RRB-
• Newt Gingrich : ... 1 -LRB- 1 % -RRB-
• Rick Perry : ... 1 -LRB- 1 % -RRB-
• Rick Santorum : ... 0 -LRB- 0 % -RRB-
• Too close to call/dead heat : ... 4 -LRB- 6 % -RRB-

Three other Iowa GOP insiders thought the race was just too close to call between Romney and Paul , and they picked those two to finish in a dead heat . And another predicted a four-way traffic jam for first between Romney , Paul , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum . While Santorum has been surging in the polls in the final week of campaigning , not a single Iowa GOP insider picked him to be the outright winner on caucus night .

As one Iowa Republican explained , Romney has run a shrewder campaign than he did in his 2008 caucus effort , when he bet huge amounts of time and resources in the state expecting a victory , only to see former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee rally born-again and evangelical voters for the win .

`` He has run a smart campaign ; not the campaign that Iowa politicos would necessarily like to see , but the operation has done the right thing in Iowa from -LRB- managing -RRB- expectations to ads to finally deciding to play here , '' one GOP insider , who asked that his name not be used , said of Romney . `` What is n't written about enough is the value of the time he put in Iowa four years ago and how he still has staff and an extensive array of ` super volunteers ' around the state . He has had the money and now you are starting to see some enthusiasm at his events . He wins a close caucus . ''

Indeed , when those same 64 Iowa GOP insiders were asked to predict the percentage of the caucus vote that each of the Republican White House hopefuls would capture , the race between Romney and Paul looked much tighter .

Percentage of caucus vote expected
• Mitt Romney : ... 24 %
• Ron Paul : ... 22 %
• Rick Santorum : ... 17 %
• Newt Gingrich : ... 15 %
• Rick Perry : ... 11 %
• Michele Bachmann : ... 7 %
• Other : ... 2 %
• Jon Huntsman : ... 1 %

Romney is not without his challenges in the state . Some wonder whether his Mormon faith remains a barrier for him in a contest where 60 % of participants in the 2008 GOP caucuses were born-again or evangelical Christians . But Romney 's biggest challenge may be the feeling that he is too politically expedient .

Asked what Romney 's biggest hurdle in the state was , nearly two-thirds of the Iowa GOP insiders said that it was the perception that he tailored his positions depending on the politics of the moment -- far surpassing concerns over the health care reform measure he signed into law in Massachusetts or skepticism from born-again and evangelical voters .

What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Romney in Iowa ?
• Perception that he has changed views for political gain : ... 64 %
• Massachusetts health care law : ... 22 %
• Doubts about him among born-again/evangelical voters : ... 14 %

`` As a supporter -LRB- of another campaign -RRB- in 2008 , I remember the attacks we tossed his way four years ago , '' said one GOP Iowa insider . `` The flip-flopper image remains . ''

But that liability may pale compared to handicaps Newt Gingrich has faced in the state . Once the front-runner in Iowa , Gingrich has had to endure a barrage of negative attacks , particularly from super-PACs supporting Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry . And while Gingrich burst to the top of the pack in Iowa after the collapse of Herman Cain 's campaign last fall , Iowa GOP insiders do n't think he built the kind of political apparatus in the state that could buttress him as he 's come under unrelenting fire .

What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Gingrich in Iowa ?
• The negative ads run against him : ... 61 %
• His lack of organization in the state : ... 33 %
• Doubts about him among born-again/evangelical voters : ... 5 %
• Personal baggage -LRB- volunteered -RRB- : ... 2 %

`` While his lack of organization is a major issue , he could have conceivably overcome it if his face had n't been ripped off by negative ads , which are running almost every other commercial , '' observed one GOP Iowa insider . But another averred , `` They have shown his record , which has been all over the map . ''

Romney 's main rival in the caucuses , Paul , also has problems making more headway in the state . While the 76-year-old congressman has been able to cultivate a devoted following with a blend of libertarian and isolationist appeals , there 's a sense among many Iowa GOP insiders that that kind of exotic brew ultimately makes him unacceptable to most Republicans in a primary and most general election voters in the fall .

What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Paul in Iowa ?
• His stance on foreign policy : ... 56 %
• Perception that he ca n't win in the general election : ... 46 %
• Doubts about him among born-again/evangelical voters : ... 0 %

`` His ideas are too extreme and he does n't try to mainstream them , '' said another Iowa GOP insider . `` Paul 's supporters do n't care that he ca n't win , '' cracked another . `` His foreign policy stances ensure that he wo n't . ''

Whoever wins on Tuesday , Iowa Republicans believe the party rank and file , along with larger-than-normal numbers of independents attracted by Paul 's candidacy , will flock to the caucuses . Half of the Iowa GOP insiders expect their turnout will be above the 119,000 mark set in the 2008 caucuses . While some of that may be wishful partisan thinking , only 11 % think that turnout will drop , while 39 % predict it will be about the same as four years ago .

The CNN Iowa GOP insiders were surveyed from the evening of December 27 through the morning of December 30 . Most of the survey was conducted over the Internet ; some interviews were conducted by phone . The Iowa insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers in order to encourage candid responses . And while some insiders were aligned with one or another of the presidential campaigns , more than two-thirds said they had not endorsed and were not working for any candidate in the race . Here are the names of the participants in the survey : Chad Airhart , Tim Albrecht , Bill Anderson , Lon Anderson , Becky Beach , Carmine Boal , Jeff Boeyink , Michael Bousselot , Danny Carroll , James Centers , Tim Coonan , Peter Cownie , Mikel Derby , Paula Dierenfeld , Brian Dumas , Ed Failor Jr. , Susan Fenton , Brenna Findley , Christian Fong , Dave Funk , Tracie Gilbert , John Gilliland , Gary Grant , Pat Grassley , Adam Gregg , Sandy Greiner , Steve Grubbs , Chris Hagenow , Robert Haus , Erik Helland , Matt Hinch , Mark Hudson , Caleb Hunter , Stew Iverson , David Jamison , Eric Johansen , Jake Ketzner , Gary Kirke , Jeff Lamberti , Jill Latham , Don McDowell , Christopher McGowan , Bill Northey , Chad Olsen , Noreen Otto , Christopher Rants , Steve Roberts , Craig Robinson , Dave Roederer , Brett Rogers , Richard Rogers , Stacey Rogers , Nick Ryan , Renne Schulte , Rich Schwarm , Mike St. Clair , Suzan Stewart , Ted Stopulos , Cameron Sutton , Ed Wallace , Andy Warren , Nicole Woodroffe , Eric Woolson , Grant Young .
