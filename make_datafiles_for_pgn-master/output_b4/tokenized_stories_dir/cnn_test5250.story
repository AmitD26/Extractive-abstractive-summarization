-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Days after a senator and a police official raised security concerns , the Interior Department has reversed a National Parks Service plan to screen visitors only after they arrived by ferry at two of New York 's landmarks -- Ellis and Liberty islands .

In a letter written to Mayor Michael Bloomberg , Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewel announced the change and requested that a security screening facility be built in Manhattan 's Battery Park so visitors will be screened before embarking for the historic islands .

Jewell requested that the city immediately begin getting the permits to build a temporary security screening facility in Manhattan before the July 4th opening weekend for Liberty Island , which is home to the Statue of Liberty .

Both islands were hard hit by Superstorm Sandy in October and have been closed since then . Ellis Island will remain closed as it undergoes extensive repairs .

A National Parks Service spokesman said in a statement that the agency remains committed to implementing a plan that does not compromise the safety of their visitors .

`` Safety will continue to be our number one priority as we re-establish a temporary screening facility at Battery Park , '' said park service spokesman John Warren . `` We are prepared to begin work immediately and appreciate the partnership with the City of New York that we will need to allow for a reopening of the Statue on July 4 . ''

Recent park service changes -- with visitors to be allowed on ferries and on the islands before security scrutiny -- were challenged by Sen. Chuck Schumer , D-New York , and New York City Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly .

Criticizing the proposed security changes , Kelly told reporters last week , `` The NYPD and the National Park Service have differences when it comes to ideas on how to protect visitors from a terrorist attack . ''

`` It 's sort of ridiculous . It 's sort of saying we are going to screen people at airports after they get on the plane , '' Schumer told reporters last week . `` They 've made a serious mistake here , and we are asking them to rethink it , to change it and simply go back to the old procedure . ''

In response to Jewell 's letter announcing the change , Schumer thanked the Interior Department for its quick decision in time for the July holiday weekend .

`` This solution wisely avoids any trade-off between speed-of-opening and optimum security procedures , '' said Schumer . `` The Statue of Liberty is vital to maintaining our pre-eminence as the tourist capital of America , and with these procedures in place , it can continue to safely draw people from around the world . ''

Since 9/11 , visitors have been screened at a lower Manhattan security checkpoint before boarding the daily ferries to the islands .
