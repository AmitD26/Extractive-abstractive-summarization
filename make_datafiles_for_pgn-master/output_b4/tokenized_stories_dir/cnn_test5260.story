La Paz , Bolivia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A top Bolivian official has a stern warning for those who criticize President Evo Morales on social networks : He 's watching what they say , and taking names .

`` I am always going online , and I am writing down the first and last names of the people who insult him on Facebook and Twitter , '' Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera said in remarks widely reported in Bolivian media this week .

The vice president 's comments have drawn sharp criticism from some free speech advocates . But lawmakers from Morales ' Movement for Socialism party say they hope to push a proposed law regulating social media through the country 's Congress .

Constructive criticism is fine , said Franklin Garvizu , a congressman from the president 's party . But officials have seen something more nefarious , he said .

`` We are very worried because this is a case of systematically using communications mechanisms to plant hatred against the government , to harm the image of our president , '' Garvizu said .

Bolivian opposition leaders have a different take . They say such comments show the government 's authoritarian aim to censor social networks .

`` Obviously on social networks one can not expect everyone to be praised . The opposition also receives insults from public officials , criticisms with no meaning , attacks , and it would never occur to us to block social networks , '' said Samuel Doria Medina , who heads the opposition National Unity party . `` That 's why we 've recommended to the vice president that he gets an account , that he interacts -LRB- with people -RRB- . He will learn a lot more about young people , and surely not everyone will applaud him , but some will agree with him . ''

Word that the government is monitoring information on digital news websites and social networks , and weighing regulating them , sparked sharp criticism among some on the streets of the capital city of La Paz .

`` It goes against all the rights , human rights , above all , '' said Maica Guzman . `` Where is freedom of expression ? ''

Others , like Cristina Perez , noted that the tone of discourse had gotten out of hand .

`` No insult is good in any media , '' she said . `` I think people should respect each other , but also these people should respect us . ''

Of Bolivia 's roughly 10 million residents , there are more than 8.7 million cell phone users iwith the ability to access Facebook and Twitter or download YouTube videos , said Eduardo Rojas , president of Bolivia 's Redes Foundation . There are about 1.7 million Facebook users nationwide , he said .

That means government officials , he said , should see social media as an opportunity government can join , rather than a threat .

Online , he said , `` you can defend , promote and spread human rights , and on the other hand complaints . ''

`` It is a device that can be used to deepen democracy , '' he said .
