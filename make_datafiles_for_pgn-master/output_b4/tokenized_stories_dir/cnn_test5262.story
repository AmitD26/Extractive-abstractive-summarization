Nairobi , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- No one at the Railway Golf Club in the heart of Nairobi quite remembers if Barack Obama , Sr. , the father of the 44th U.S. president , ever played here when he was a high-flying civil servant in the 1960s . Perhaps he played up the road at the Royal Nairobi Golf Club , the oldest of the city 's six golf establishments , someone suggests .

The club scene was certainly the natural ecosystem for the pipe-smoking Harvard-educated economist , and the hordes of other young Africans just returned from the world 's top universities to take over their newly independent country .

Memories of Dr. Obama are fading , but his son is a popular man in Kenya . From the clubs to the teeming barrios for which Nairobi is notorious , President Obama is spoken of with enthusiasm and pride .

Dr. Simeon Onyango , is in the pharmaceuticals business and a widely travelled man . He thinks the world of President Obama .

`` I believe he deserves a second term . War is very expensive and with the Iraq and Afghan war , he has done a great job in managing this and even eliminating Osama -LSB- bin Laden -RSB- , '' said Onyango at the Railways Golf Club , whose course is part of a longer green belt that girdles Nairobi 's fat midriff from south to north .

The Kenyan capital is a land of dramatic contrasts . From a rooftop bar on Mombasa Road , the main highway to the airport and on to the coast , you can sometimes see in the distance herds of buffalo , giraffe and the odd lion . Once in a while , when the big cats wander into the villages and kill their cattle , Maasai warriors take out their spears and hunt them down . It is a city that likes to keep in touch with its wild side .

Kibera , Kenya 's biggest slum , is Obamaland . Here , the people are less guarded , more passionate about politics . Their living conditions are terrible . They have given rise to a peculiar activity , slum tourism , where wealthy people journey from all over the world to come and see squalor .

The ring of slums to the south co-exist cheek-to-jowl with Lavington , one of the city 's wealthiest neighborhoods . Every morning crowds of workers stream through Lavington for their 15-kilometer walk to the city 's industrial zone .

In Kibera , Obama 's story resonates strongly maybe because when you are scrapping the bottom of the barrel , the only thing keeping you going is a dream : the slum is home to amazing innovation and creativity in film , comedy , music and -- believe it not -- IT .

James Mwanzia , 25 , sells charcoal , used by thousands of poor household for fuel . `` The highlight of his term was killing Osama bin Laden , which is something other presidents have not been successful in doing , '' he says .

Al Qaeda and its fanatical Somali affiliate , Al-Shabaab , which has been carrying out a campaign of terror in Nairobi and on one occasion lobbed a grenade into a Sunday school , is solidly hated .

Unlike many Kenyans , Mwanzia did n't wake up at 4:00 a.m. to watch the second U.S. presidential debate on TV . Kenya will hold its own general election next March , and for the first time a series of presidential debates has been planned ahead of election day .

He says he will watch the local ones .

For Kenya 's Muslims , however , the attitude towards America is more complex . Munir Mohammed Abbas , 35 , another Kibera resident , is full of praise for Obama , whom he describes as `` a very eloquent speaker with a very good grasp of national matters , especially on managing the economy '' -- before adding , `` I will not comment on terrorism . ''

Among Muslims , there is suspicion that the fight against al Qaeda targets their religion -- and U.S. campaign talk of an invasion of Iran and the enthusiastic support for Israel are not popular ideas in the mosques .

The thrill here over Obama 's 2008 election has dwindled over time . `` Enthusiasm for President Obama is probably 40 percent what it was in 2008 , '' said Henry Owuor , Foreign Editor of the Daily Nation , Kenya 's biggest newspaper . `` People used to call and demand that I publish Obama 's pictures and stories . Not any more . '' In 2008 , the Daily Nation sent a team to cover the U.S. election ; this year it is relying on its correspondents and the wire services .

While Obama is admired because he is smart , calm and dignified , a brave black man doing his duty for his country , he has been in office for four years and the novelty has worn off .

Kenyan perception of America has also changed over the years . The U.S. is recognized as a powerful actor not just in regional affairs , but in national affairs . There is a growing belief in Kenya that America exercises its immense power only in its own interest -- sort of like a wealthy friend who comes to a party with lots of food , but does not share .

Last October , Kenyan forces crossed the border into Somalia in pursuit of Al-Shabaab . The region 's first contact with jihadist terrorism was in August 1998 when al Qaeda bombed the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam . There was an outpouring of sympathy for America . But when Kenyan forces entered Somalia , the U.S. stayed out of it .

James Thumi , who sells software , feels Obama has not been sufficiently engaged with Africa . While his predecessors had big initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids , Tuberculosis and Malaria , and the African Growth and Opportunity Act , which offers African companies preferential access to the U.S. textiles market , Obama has been pre-occupied with domestic issues .

America also uses travel advisories to chide the Kenyan government for policies with which it disagrees , according to Thumi .

`` Placing travel advisories on countries like Kenya because of a few security threats is not the way to go , because we do not do the same when America has had its share of scares , '' said Thumi , echoing the common perception that the U.S. government uses travel advisories , which discourage travel to countries at risk , as a big stick to get the Kenya government to do its bidding .

In K'ogelo , a village about 400 kilometers west of Nairobi and the home of the Obamas , a victory party is being planned . At the Railway Club , golfers pay no heed to the scorching sun and are out on the green . In the club house , members speak quietly into their cell phones . A few are on their iPads , most likely keeping a worried eye on RealClearPolitics.com to see which ones are leaning and which ones are toss-ups .
