-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has reiterated his support for giving women the right to drive in Saudi Arabia , announcing via Twitter that it would help the economy and reduce the number of foreign workers there .

`` The question of women driving will result in being able to dispense with at least 500,000 -LRB- foreign -RRB- drivers , in addition to the social and economic benefits , '' he tweeted Sunday .

In the deeply conservative kingdom , women are prohibited from driving , and many must rely on foreign drivers for transportation .

Women 's rights activist Wajeha Al-Huwaider said Monday that she was glad to hear bin Talal 's comments , but she did n't think it would amount to much .

`` We got used to him saying the right things but nothing happens , '' she said . `` I think he only makes headlines , but then nothing happens . ''

Al-Huwaider said that while she found it interesting that bin Talal put the issue in terms of how much it was costing the country , she has `` stopped following any news reports about women driving '' until she hears it addressed by Abdullah .

Saudi Arabia is home to around 9 million foreign workers . In recent weeks , thousands of them have been deported in a crackdown by authorities against illegal immigrants .

Last week , Saudi King Abdullah granted foreigners working there illegally a three-month grace period in order to legalize their status .

Bin Talal , one of the richest men in the world , is the nephew of Abdullah and is considered by some to be a champion of women 's rights and empowerment .

Last year , his wife , Princess Ameerah al-Taweel , made headlines on the same issue when she spoke out , saying driving laws there should be reformed .

`` I think it 's a very easy decision , '' she told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour last September . `` And it is for the government . A lot of people are saying this is a social issue . ... Education was a social issue . And a lot of people in Saudi Arabia were against women getting educated . Yet the decision was made . ''

There are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in Saudi Arabia . However , religious edicts are often interpreted as prohibiting female drivers . Such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts , obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian .

In 2011 , a group called Women2Drive began a campaign demanding that women be given the right to drive in Saudi Arabia .

The movement was sparked by the arrest that year of Manal al-Sharif , a Saudi technology consultant and mother who was detained for nine days for driving her own car . Many of her supporters posted videos and pictures of themselves online driving in various Saudi cities .
