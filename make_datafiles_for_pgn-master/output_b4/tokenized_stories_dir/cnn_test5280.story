-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's been underway for barely over a week , but Australia 's election campaign is already drawing attention worldwide following a string of embarrassing gaffes from candidates .

Tony Abbott -- the opposition leader who hopes to unseat Kevin Rudd as prime minister on September 7 -- has been the worst offender , with a series of missteps that have threatened to derail his center-right Liberal Party 's momentum . Opinion polls have Abbott 's coalition marginally ahead of Rudd 's center-left Labor Party by 52 points to 48 .

The most serious blunder came on Tuesday when Abbott praised a female candidate 's `` sex appeal '' while campaigning in the Western Sydney seat of Lindsay .

`` They 're young , feisty , I think I can probably say have a bit of sex appeal , and they 're just very connected with the local area , '' he told reporters , when asked what qualities local candidate , Fiona Scott , had in common with a previous MP .

The remarks were seized upon by feminists and other critics as evidence that Abbott holds outdated attitudes towards women , an allegation previously made by former Prime Minster Julia Gillard , who once told the Australian parliament : `` If -LRB- Abbott -RRB- wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia , he does n't need a motion in the House of Representatives , he needs a mirror . ''

Abbott 's comments triggered a torrent of criticism and ridicule on social media .

`` My first reaction to this statement was utter disbelief , '' wrote one Facebook user . `` I am still astonished that this language is considered acceptable . ''

`` These comments speak volumes of his true character , and this is not the type of personality that makes a good leader of any kind , let alone a national leader , '' wrote another .

Rudd waded into the debate Wednesday , describing Abbott 's comments as `` pretty odd , '' and saying any employer who made similar remarks could expect to find themselves `` in serious strife . ''

`` My policy is pretty simple : in modern Australia , neither sexism , nor racism , nor homophobia has any place whatsoever , '' he told reporters . `` I believe people look to their national leaders to set that sort of example . ''

Abbott said later he had been `` a bit exuberant '' in his comments , and described the remarks as a consequence of him having `` a daggy dad moment '' -- using an Australian term for something slightly embarrassing or uncool .

But he did nothing to quiet accusations of sexism when he taunted Rudd with a question of whether he was `` man enough '' to rule out a pre-election deal with another party .

Abbott has previously come in for ridicule for projecting a Putin-esque , `` macho man '' image , including being photographed at ocean swim events in revealing swimming trunks . Images of Abbott in his `` budgie smugglers , '' as the style is known colloquially in Australia , were circulated online following his latest remarks , with a caption asking : `` Just how much sex appeal does it take to win an election , Tony ? ''

Abbott had earlier made headlines for a piquant slip of the tongue , when he told a crowd in Melbourne Monday that `` no one -- however smart , however well-educated , however experienced -- is the suppository of all wisdom . '' A mistimed attempt at baby kissing that saw him plant his lips on the hair of the child 's mother was also singled out for ridicule .

An aspiring candidate for Abbott 's Liberal Party also found himself the target of social media jibes Tuesday following an embarrassing on-camera freeze when questioned about his party 's immigration policy . Jaymes Diaz , a candidate in the New South Wales seat of Greenway , told a television reporter his party had a six-point plan to `` stop the boats '' of illegal migrants , but was unable to articulate what any of those points might be .

His embarrassment followed the humiliation of Stephanie Banister , a 27-year-old candidate for Australia 's fringe anti-immigration One Nation party , who blundered through a television interview claiming that Islam was a country and that Jews followed Jesus Christ . The performance , which saw her labeled the `` Australian Sarah Palin , '' led to her withdrawing her candidacy just 48 hours into the race .

The slew of political gaffes inspired comedian John Oliver , of the popular U.S. satirical program The Daily Show , to urge the United States to emulate Australia and condense its campaigning into one month , promising they would not miss out on any of the entertaining blunders of a typical election season .

`` You might think , ` Hold on John , if our elections were just four weeks , we would n't get to have all the fun of watching the human gaffe-alanches on the campaign trail , ' '' he said . `` But here 's the thing -- you 're wrong . You name a great campaign moment and Australia will get to it this month . ''

In April , U.S. President Barack Obama apologized after describing California 's Attorney General Kamala Harris to an audience of Democratic donors as `` by far the best-looking attorney general in the country , '' a remark that was criticized by some as sexist .
