-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Deciding when to upgrade is a funny , sometimes expensive thing . Carrier contracts that subsidize the cost of a new iPhone are usually for two years , so it 's traditional to upgrade every other model or less . You also want to time it just right , during the iPhone development cycle , so you do n't buy a phone months before it 's outdated .

If you are an iPhone owner who is pondering an upgrade to the new iPhone 5 , here are some things to consider :

Do you long for more screen space/watch a lot of movies ?

Perhaps you 've heard that the iPhone 5 is taller . This is true . After testing its tallness we 've found that there is more space on the screen , which is no longer as short as the previous iPhone screens .

The phone retains its width but is now 9 millimeters taller -- that 's one extra row of icons . The dimensions are perfect for watching widescreen movies , which were previously smaller and letter-boxed . The space also gives all other apps a bit more breathing room . Third-party applications must now redesign their apps to fix the new aspect ratio -- which requires time and resources -- so until then , older apps will be shown at normal size , the bar of unused screen space cloaked in mourning-black .

There is a market for much larger smartphone screens , and companies like Samsung have delivered with spacious , high-resolution smartphones . This is largely a matter of preference , but if you find that the iPhone 5 's screen is still just too small for you , you may need to defect to something like the Samsung Galaxy S3 which has a 4.8-inch screen .

Does your current phone feel slow ?

Each iPhone is typically faster than its predecessor , and phones tend to slow down over time . Apple has added a speedier processor to the iPhone 5 in the form of an A6 chip . The company claims it is up to twice as fast , and after testing , the difference is definitely noticeable .

Holding on to a slightly slower iPhone might not be much of an issue if you primarily use it for common tasks -- calls and texts , e-mailing , Twitter and Facebook , reading , even watching movies . If you do n't find yourself grumbling at how slow your phone is , and you 're still reeling from the speed improvements over the last iPhone you bought , you can probably carry on blissfully unaware of the difference .

However , if you use your iPhone for bigger tasks like playing graphic games , the speed is a very welcome bump indeed . Another place it 's a noticeable improvement is the camera -LRB- more on that in a moment -RRB- .

There are also free steps you can take to try and speed up your current phone . Free up some hard drive space by uninstalling apps you never use , emptying Safari 's cache and clearing out photos , videos and music -LRB- see exactly what 's taking up space in Settings - > General - > Usage -RRB- . Make sure you regularly close any apps running in the background .

Is your iPhone your primary camera ?

Thanks to decent image quality and the ability to share photos and videos instantly , the iPhone is probably more popular as a camera than a telephoning device . The iPhone 5 has the same 8-megapixel camera sensor as the iPhone 4S , but Apple did make a few hardware tweaks to make it fit into the thinner body and to improve image quality .

The best camera improvement is actually just plain old speed . You can take rapid-fire shots as fast as your finger can tap on the shutter button . Tapping to focus is instant . For anyone who has ever missed a moment because of the iPhone 's lagging trigger , this is just awesome .

Apple added a new panorama feature to the Photos app , and while there are numerous third-party panorama apps available , such as Microsoft 's Photosynth , the Apple feature manages to beat them at their own game . The stitching is both faster and higher quality than competitors , and the final image is higher resolution .

Other adjustments to the camera include improved low-light images and reduced noise .

Do you use your phone for navigation ?

If so , there is a slight caveat .

Every iPhone release comes with its own bit of drama . Sometimes it 's overblown , like Antennaga2te , when holding your case-less phone in a very specific position could cause it to drop calls . iPhone 4S users reported battery issues . For the iPhone 5 , the issue de jour is its new maps app .

Every iPhone 5 comes with iOS 6 pre-installed . That means the old maps app is automatically out , replaced with Apple 's first go at a map application . It adds turn-by-turn directions and nice 3D graphics , but drops transit directions and decreases accuracy .

Apple has always excelled at design and smart user interfaces , but it is not a data company . While it continues to work to make this app what it should be , the best solution is to wait for Google to release its own third-party maps app for iOS . -LRB- The company is mum on when exactly that will be , but it will probably happen soon . -RRB- In the meantime , there are many other map apps in the Apple App Store , and you can still access Google 's service through Safari , though the experience is slower and less intuitive .

Do you like beautiful things ?

The most impressive part of the new iPhone is its design . Apple is comparing the level of construction to a `` finely crafted watch . '' Like a luxury item , its design is impeccable , the attention to detail visible on every seam and surface . It also tells time .

Not everyone integrates their iPhone 5 into an outfit like a Rolex . If you are one of the many people who protect their iPhone with an opaque case , the details wo n't be visible to people around you . In that situation , you still get the satisfaction of a well-made device , but previous iPhones were also finely crafted and are still in perfectly good shape .

The most dramatic physical difference of the new phone is that it is thinner and lighter . But while a great overall improvement , that 's not enough of a reason to warrant upgrading unless you find yourself constantly bemoaning how heavy and fat your existing phone is . If you wear skinny jeans , this might be the one upgrade you were waiting for .

Do you have anything older than an iPhone 4S ?

If you have an iPhone 3GS or earlier , upgrade . Do it for the screen . The retina display introduced on the iPhone 4 has been further refined for the iPhone 5 and in side-by-side comparisons with all screens at full brightness , the colors do look more vivid on the iPhone 5 .

If you have an iPhone 4 , the decision is harder . Consider what new features you really need . If you would get a lot of use out of the Siri voice-assistant , for example , this is a good time to upgrade . If you are a hardcore mobile gamer or serious iPhone photographer , the speed is worth it . But if you find that your two-year-old , well-crafted iPhone is holding up nicely , perhaps stick it out for another year .

IPhone 4S owners should just relax and enjoy their current phones . Wait a year for the next iteration , when your carrier will offer you the upgrade at the subsidized price and all the iPhone 5 owners will suddenly be stuck with old technology .
