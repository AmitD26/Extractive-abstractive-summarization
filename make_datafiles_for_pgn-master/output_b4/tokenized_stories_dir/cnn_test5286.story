-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Whenever the U.S. Transportation Security Administration changes the way it screens passengers , it 's bound to cause a stir .

This time is no different .

The TSA 's move this week to allow small pocket knives on airplanes has generated a storm of criticism and concern among aviation professionals and passengers alike . Critics are outraged by a new rule that will allow knives with very short blades onto aircraft . The agency says it believes knives can not be used to hijack planes because of strengthened cockpit doors and more passenger awareness .

`` This policy reversal is against the best interest of the security of crew and passengers in the aircraft cabin and we will stop at nothing to fight it , '' said the Flight Attendants Union Coalition , in a press statement issued Thursday announcing its campaign to reverse the TSA 's decision .

The coalition represents nearly 90,000 unionized flight attendants at carriers across the country .

Former flight attendant Tiffany Hawk is `` stupefied '' by the TSA 's decision to allow knives `` especially since the process that turns checkpoints into maddening logjams -- removing shoes , liquids and computers -- remains unchanged , '' she wrote in an opinion column for CNN .

Under the new rules , knives with blades that are 2.36 inches -LRB- 6 centimeters -RRB- or shorter and less than a 1/2 inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins as long as the blade is not fixed or does not lock into place . Razor blades and box cutters are still prohibited .

The rules also allow passengers to carry two golf clubs , toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles , hockey sticks , lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry-on luggage .

TSA chief John Pistole said the changes , which will take effect April 25 and will bring the United States into alignment with international rules , are in keeping with his `` risk-based security '' approach .

Putting less focus on these items will permit airport screeners to focus on looking for bomb components , which present a greater threat to aircraft .

New rule does n't go far enough , former chief says

Sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft , former TSA chief Kip Hawley told CNN , and the search for knives interferes with the search for objects that can threaten aircraft .

`` They ought to let everything on that is sharp and pointy . Battle axes , machetes ... bring anything you want that is pointy and sharp because while you may be able to commit an act of violence , you will not be able to take over the plane . It is as simple as that , '' said Hawley , who oversaw the TSA from mid-2005 through early 2009 .

Focusing on the wrong threat

Security expert Rafi Ron says the TSA should focus on risky people rather than risky objects .

`` When you have someone like you or me who does n't intend to attack a flight , whether we have a Swiss Army knife in our pocket or not does n't make any difference , '' said Ron , president of Virginia-based New Age Security Solutions and former head of security of Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv , Israel .

`` If you have somebody like one of the terrorists -LRB- who was involved in the 9/11 attacks -RRB- or a terrorist who is still out there , I 'm not sure we 'd want him to have even a Swiss Army knife , '' Ron said .

`` Risk is not measured by the item , whether it is a knife or gun . It is measured by the person holding it . A bad guy with a Swiss Army knife can still cause a lot of damage to the crew and passengers in the cabin before the aircraft can land . ''

What 's critical is to be able to apply a heightened level of search to potentially dangerous people beyond who 's on the `` No Fly '' list , he said .

The shoe bomber and underwear bomber `` are people who could have been identified as high risk passengers if we had bothered to screen them , '' he said , referring to Richard Reid 's attempted airline attack in 2001 and an attempted attack in 2009 by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab .

Some clues : `` Both of them bought one-way tickets , paid in cash , both of them did n't check any baggage for a trans-Atlantic flight . They should have been subjected to a different level of search , '' Ron said .

Terrorism 's ultimate goal

While he sympathizes with the concerns of flight attendants that knives and other objects could be used to hurt people , there are already objects in the cabin that mentally or emotionally disturbed people could use to inflict injury , said Richard Bloom , Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University 's chief academic officer and director of terrorism , intelligence and security studies .

`` That has nothing to do with terrorism , '' said Bloom . `` Given that any organization , including the TSA , has only so many people and so much money , what they 're trying to do is get less relevant things out of their attention and pay more attention to things that are more catastrophic . ''

An ever changing list of banned objects

The TSA 's evolving list of banned objects has drawn mixed reaction from travelers .

`` Let 's allow knives on board , but you are not allowed a bottle of water , or a bottle of baby food , '' wrote one CNN.com reader .

Another seemed to take a more positive view : `` I almost had my kids ' safety scissors confiscated from their little activity kit . Yay for this sensible decision . ''

Commenter Jose L. Reynoso was more skeptical .

`` Yeah sure one man against a bunch of others is no match but , what if ten men carrying knives and bats plot to take over ? Would n't a massacre be obvious ? '' Reynoso wrote .

A more flexible aviation security system ?

A country 's security services need to be collecting intelligence on potential terrorists way before passengers board an aircraft , said Bloom . And any airport 's security team needs to have flexible and layered screening in place to be able to adjust its processes for high-risk individuals .

`` The threat is ever-changing . ''
