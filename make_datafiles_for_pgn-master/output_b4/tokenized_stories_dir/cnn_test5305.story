-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Work hard , play hard . In Seoul , it 's easy to do both .

The city 's metro area is home to roughly 20 million residents , whose penchant for working long hours has helped transform the country into an economic power in the last half-century .

When the capital city 's residents need a break , there 's a host of options open to them . Seoul is bursting with cultural events , a buzzing nightlife and lively eating spots .

The once-grim industrial megacity is looking towards the future -- an ambitious urban regeneration drive has helped it earn the designation of World Design Capital this year -- but the rich cultural heritage of its past is also at your fingertips .

Frequent CNNGo contributor Gregory Curley has lived in Seoul since 2002 . He did n't intend to stay for more than a year , but eight years on , he 's still transfixed . He revealed what life is like in the city .

CNN : What 's the vibe like ?

Gregory Curley : It 's very cosmopolitan . It 's very large and very fast paced . It 's hectic but exciting at the same time , and extremely dynamic . It actually never sleeps . I really mean that . It 's not that things never seem to shut down , there 's always something happening .

CNN : What are your favorite districts ?

GC : Bukchon -- for the area 's numerous traditional hanok homes . Insadong -- for its cozy tea houses and abundant traditional knick-knack shops . Namdaemun and Noryangjin Market -- the former boasting a huge outdoor sprawl of every imaginable good and the latter being one of Korea 's largest fish markets . Garosugil -- great tree-lined street replete with shops and Euro-style cafes and restaurants .

CNN : What are some other highlights ?

GC : The five grand palaces are a must-see . They give you an idea of the historical side of Korea and what life was like thousands of years ago .

Namsan Mountain is very scenic . It 's a great place to grab great views of the city . There 's a cable car that runs right to the top of the mountain . It 's especially beautiful during fall . At the base of the mountain there 's also a nice traditional folk village called Namsangol .

CNN : Where and what do you like to eat ?

GC : Because I love markets I would have to say Gwangjang Market , which is a huge , outdoor market . You can literally get anything there .

My favorite dish is a spicy chicken dish called dak tori tang . It 's fantastic . But also a huge favorite of mine is Korean barbeque .

Food has a very important place in Korean culture -- not only in the manner in which it is prepared , but also in the way it is consumed . Restaurants are social playgrounds . I have many memories of being huddled around a table cooking marinated meats and drinking soju amongst friends .

CNN : Seoul is undergoing some major design changes . Do you have a favorite public space ?

GC : With regard to design , there 's definitely a lot happening now . The Digital City is going to be opening up soon . Songdo near Incheon Airport is quite amazing , too .

CNN : Do you have any favorite or lasting memories ?

GC : My friend was one of the organizers of the Pentaport Rock Festival . Amazing time . And quite possibly one of my fondest memories in Korea .

CNN : Where do you like to go to get away ?

GC : Exploring the country outside of Seoul is a great way to get to the heart of Korean culture . If you drive straight east from Seoul you reach Donghae , which is quite picturesque . The area 's great for seafood and swimming .

My favorite beach along the east coast is Naksan Beach -LRB- in the north , just south of Donghae -RRB- and Chilpo Beach -LRB- in the south , just north of Pohang -RRB- . Donghae is great because it has that coastal charm -- a very laid back atmosphere with friendly folk and fantastic seafood .
