Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Politics is full of second chances .

Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford -- now U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford -- is living proof . Former Rep. Anthony Weiner is trying to travel the same road to political redemption . And now add former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer to the list , as he embarks on a similar journey .

In this age of lighting fast news cycles and fleeting memories , are disgraced politicians sitting in the penalty box for a shorter time before launching a comeback ?

A Republican political strategist thinks it reflects a lower opinion of politicians .

`` The required waiting time has been greatly condensed in recent years , indicating present voters are holding elected officials to a much lower standard then previous generations , '' said John Brabender , a longtime top political adviser to 2012 Republican presidential candidate and former Sen. Rick Santorum .

Spitzer , who resigned in 2008 after revelations he spent thousands of dollars on prostitutes , launched a petition campaign Monday to become New York City comptroller .

`` I made significant errors . I stood up , accepted responsibility , resigned . It 's now been five years , I hope the public will extend its forgiveness to me , '' the Democrat said Monday morning on radio 's `` The Bill Press Show . ''

`` I think it is a land of forgiveness , of people in their natural goodness -LRB- who -RRB- understand the fact that ... we sin , we pay a price and hopefully continue , '' added Spitzer , who served two terms as New York State attorney general before winning election as governor in 2006 .

Spitzer , who needs to gather the 3,750 signatures by Thursday to get into the September primary ballot , would be on the same Democratic ballot as Weiner , who is running for mayor and would have the quickest redemption .

Weiner would have the shortest time in time-out should he be elected . He was in his seventh term in Congress , representing parts of the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn , when he resigned from the House in 2011 amid scandal over lewd photos sent via Twitter .

He talked about getting another chance in the video announcing his candidacy , saying , `` I made some big mistakes , and I know I let a lot of people down . But I 've also learned some tough lessons . I 'm running for mayor because I 've been fighting for the middle class and those struggling my entire life . And I hope I get a second chance to work for you . ''

Spitzer , who since stepping down has been a commentator for various news outlets including CNN , disagrees with the Weiner comparison , and said he 's not on a quest for redemption , but instead stressed that he 's motivated by what he said are personal pleas from New Yorkers urging him to get back into public service .

`` If that 's what I want , then I do n't think this is the path to it . What I am seeking is service , '' he said on CBS `` This Morning . ''

Republican Sanford 's political career appeared dead after he finished out his term amid repercussions of admitting to an extramarital affair in 2009 . But he won redemption in a special election in May to fill a vacant congressional seat in the state 's 1st Congressional District , which he represented before serving as governor .

The media loves a comeback story , if only because it allows them it an opportunity to revisit what brought down that politician in the first place . And redemption stories resonate with the public .

`` Voters love a good comeback story -- we identify with the underdog and cheer for him as we would for ourselves , '' said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos . `` But voters also love justice . We want people to pay for their mistakes . ''

Brabender said votes have increasingly shown they are willing to forgive indiscretions .

`` It all comes down to how well the scandal is handled , voters assessment of relevance to doing the job , and choosing the right time for re-entry into the political arena , '' he said .

Spitzer to run against madam

Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala says faster news cycles and fleeting memories may be behind this year 's trio of comeback bids , `` but it may also be a result of a very healthy American aversion to being too judgmental . ''

`` It used to be an iron law of politics that no divorced person could be president . Then Ronald Reagan proved that wrong , '' said Begala , who was a top political adviser to President Bill Clinton and a senior adviser last year to a super PAC that worked for President Barack Obama 's re-election .

`` Ultimately politics is about voters ' lives , not politicians -- if voters think someone can make a difference in their life , they will overlook personal shortcomings , '' he added . `` But the key is not to make the campaign about the politician 's need for redemption , but about voters ' need for jobs .
