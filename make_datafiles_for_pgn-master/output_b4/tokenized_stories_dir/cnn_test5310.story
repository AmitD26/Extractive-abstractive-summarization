Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The 2014 elections will continue what has become a staple in American politics : the survival of powerful political families .

Bush . Carter . Nunn . Udall . Cheney . These are familiar names from a previous generation -- but also for a new one .

When Liz Cheney announced her intention to become the next senator from Wyoming this year , she likely evoked voters ' memories of her father , Dick Cheney , the former vice president .

The same is true for two politicians in Georgia . Both the daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn and a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter will be on the 2014 ballot in the Peach State . Michelle Nunn is running for U.S. Senate , while state Sen. Jason Carter has launched a bid for governor -- jobs her father and his grandfather , respectively , once held .

`` For their constituents and the American public , those names are a proven quantity , and as time goes on , you see that Americans look back at the history of our political system , and things seem better in hindsight , '' said Dan Mahaffee of the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress . `` It harkens back to a more collegial political era . ''

Candidates and family heritage

All over the country , candidates with such familiar names are either running for re-election or jumping into races and using their families ' vast networks to anchor nascent campaigns .

Take a look at the heritage of some of these candidates on the ballot in 2014 :

• Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia is running for her state 's open U.S. Senate seat . Her father , Arch A. Moore Jr. , was governor of West Virginia for 12 years .

• Sen. Mary Landrieu is running for re-election in Louisiana . Her father , `` Moon '' Landrieu , was once mayor of New Orleans and a brother , Mitch Landrieu , is now the city 's mayor .

• George P. Bush is running for Texas land commissioner . A member of one of America 's great political dynasties , he 's the grandson of former President George H.W. Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush .

• Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey is running for re-election . A member of one of the most dominant political families in the United States , Frelinghuysen can trace his roots back to four U.S. senators and Frederick Frelinghuysen , one of New Jersey 's delegates to the Continental Congress .

• Sen. Mark Pryor , who is running for re-election in Arkansas , is the son of former Sen. David Pryor .

• Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado , the son of a former congressman , is running for re-election . And so is a cousin , Tom Udall of New Mexico , also a U.S. senator .

A ` ready-made Rolodex '

`` You grow up around a business , you learn the ropes early , '' CNN contributor Paul Begala said . `` It is the same reason restaurants or hardware stores -- or junkyards -- have names like ` Sanford and Son . ' ''

Begala cites many benefits to running as the next in line in a political family , but two stand out : a thick skin and fund-raising .

`` A politician 's kid grows up hearing all kinds of awful things about Mom or Dad , and they learn that 's not the end of the world , '' he said . `` Toughness matters in politics . ''

Begala said that relying on relatives ' fund-raising networks also is unbelievably helpful for these candidates . Being a Cheney in Wyoming , a Bush in Texas or a Landrieu in Louisiana will open many doors -- and wallets .

It is `` hard to estimate how much good President Bush 41 's network did for Bush 43 , '' Begala said .

Mahaffee added , `` You are almost born with a ready-made Rolodex . ''

American dynasties from the early years on

The number of political families on the ballot in 2014 is nothing new . Since the outset of the United States , political families have dominated certain states , and many have risen to national prominence .

The Adamses , with the nation 's second president , John Adams , and sixth president , John Quincy Adams , were among the first political families . But certainly not the last .

The Republican Tafts have long dominated Ohio politics , boasting three U.S. senators , a president , a governor and countless local positions . The Democratic Kennedy family has dominated politics in New England -- with a president , three presidential candidates , three senators , multiple congressmen and dozens of local elected positions .

A 2012 study of the Kennedys ' political dominance by the University of Minnesota found the family has logged more than 92 years in congressional service , a number that does n't even count Joseph P. Kennedy III 's recent term as a representative from Massachusetts .

Then there are the obvious political families : the Bushes and Clintons . Between 1980 and 2008 , a member of one of these families was either president or vice president .

Bush and Clinton `` fatigue '' has even become a common term as speculation grows about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both eyeing a run at the presidency in 2016 .

So why do Americans , the same people who revolted against a monarchy in 1776 , keep electing members of the same families ?

Some political watchers said the continuity these families bring can be comforting to voters , but the public also can sour on candidates who see themselves as anointed successors to their families ' political power .

Mahaffee , however , said the idea that voters are sick of political families is dispelled by the fact that so many of them exist . Do voters occasionally get sick of one family ? Yes , he said . But on the whole , such a history is a good thing for candidates , he said .

`` It is helpful that you continue to have generations that bring political experience with them , '' Mahaffee said . `` They have more of a knowledge -LRB- of -RRB- what it takes to be a political leader . ''
