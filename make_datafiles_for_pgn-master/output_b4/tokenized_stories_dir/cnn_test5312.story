-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- David Moyes ' first Manchester derby ended in crushing defeat Sunday as his United team suffered an embarrassing 4-1 loss away to English Premier League title rival City .

Moyes , facing the immense task in replacing Alex Ferguson -- the most successful manager in British football history -- could only watch as City netted four times in the first 50 minutes against the defending champion .

Sergio Aguero scored the first and third , Yaya Toure made it 2-0 in first-half injury time and Samir Nasri put the result beyond doubt .

It lifted City up to third in the table , with new manager Manuel Pellegrini vindicated in restoring Alvaro Negredo to the starting lineup as the Spain striker set up two of the goals .

Moyes was robbed of the services of last season 's top scorer Robin van Persie , who was ruled out with a groin injury , and Wayne Rooney was unable to continue the resurgent form he has shown up front this season until he curled in a stunning free-kick in the 87th minute .

`` Every manager has bad days and bad results . I am no different , '' Moyes said . `` I have been here with Everton many times and I do n't think I suffered a defeat like this with Everton .

`` I talked with the players the same as I would at any other club . They are good pros here and they know when they are bang at it and when they are not . ''

While the result echoed City 's 6-1 thumping of United at Old Trafford two years ago , which gave Roberto Mancini 's men a five-point cushion at the top on the way to a long-awaited league title , this time the victory has merely kept the Light Blues in touch with leading sides Arsenal and Tottenham .

The London clubs ended this weekend with a two-point advantage after Arsenal beat Stoke 3-1 , with record signing Mesut Ozil having a hand in all three goals , and Tottenham edged Cardiff 1-0 thanks to an injury-time winner from Paulinho .

United , meanwhile , dropped to eighth in the table with just seven points from five matches -- five behind the top two .

Moyes ' team also lost to Liverpool and drew with Chelsea in a difficult run of early fixtures .

`` The start to the season could be a lot better , '' the Scot said . `` We did say it could be a difficult start .

`` I was n't convinced when the balls came out of the Premier League bag -LRB- for the schedule -RRB- and I 'm still not convinced . ''

Pellegrini was understandably pleased with his best result since leaving Spanish club Malaga at the end of last season .

`` I 'm very happy . The way we played is the way I want this team to play , very similar to against Newcastle -LRB- a 4-0 win -RRB- . We played the way we work all week , '' the Chilean said .

`` We have been playing irregular in other games , but it is normal in this moment of the season . This was a high test today and the players had a great answer . ''

Aguero put City ahead in the 16th minute as the Argentina striker superbly hooked in a volley from Aleksandar Kolarov 's left-wing cross , with Nasri also involved in the move .

Toure pounced for the vital second just before the break , sticking out a knee to divert the ball into the net after Negredo rose highest to head down a corner .

Negredo , signed for $ 26 million from Sevilla in July , was again the provider just a minute after the restart as he turned and put in the perfect cross for Aguero to volley home a much simpler effort than his first .

Nasri was criticized for his performance in last season 's corresponding fixture , a tempestuous 3-2 defeat for City marred by pitch invasions and coin throwing , but he has been a different player this campaign .

The France midfielder calmly volleyed in the fourth goal at the far post from a cross by Jesus Navas -- another new addition to City 's squad -- after captain Vincent Kompany stopped a United attack and charged upfield .

Rooney is also in significantly better form this season , having flirted with a move to Chelsea but now seemingly committed to United .

The England striker 's late corner allowed Patrice Evra to head against the post , and soon after he gave City keeper Joe Hart no chance with his fourth goal in the last three matches .

Arsenal 's victory was the club 's seventh in a row since losing 3-1 at home to Aston Villa on the opening day of this season .

Manager Arsene Wenger hailed the contribution of Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil , who has settled in quickly since leaving Real Madrid on transfer deadline day .

`` Once he is completely integrated we will see even more of him , but he has shown today that he is a great player , '' said Wenger said .

`` Ozil is a player , when you look at his numbers , the assists are not a coincidence , it is just the reality of his game .

`` You could see today he has a good pace as well . At the moment he focuses a lot on his passing , but he can create individually as well . ''

Tottenham needed a moment of magic from Paulinho , one of several new signings , as the Brazil midfielder backheeled the winner at Cardiff from Erik Lamela 's pass .

`` There could only be one winner , '' said Spurs coach Andre Villas-Boas .

`` We played so much football it would have been unfair to leave here with only one point . ''

In Sunday 's other match , Swansea moved up to ninth with a 2-0 win at promoted Crystal Palace , which stayed second from bottom .

Bottom club Sunderland sacked coach Paolo Di Canio on Sunday , following a 3-0 defeat against West Brom 24 hours earlier .

The Italian was a controversial appointment on March 31 due to his past statements in support of fascism , but he kept the club in the top flight in 17th place .

However , Sunderland has just one point from five games this season .
