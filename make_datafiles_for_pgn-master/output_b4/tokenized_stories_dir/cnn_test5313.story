`` As part of my ongoing recovery , last week I traveled to Belgium to seek further medical advice from a leading cardiologist , '' the former Arsenal trainee , who represented England at under-21 level , said in a statement released by Bolton .

`` But the news I received was obviously not what I had hoped it would be and it means I am now announcing my retirement from professional football .
