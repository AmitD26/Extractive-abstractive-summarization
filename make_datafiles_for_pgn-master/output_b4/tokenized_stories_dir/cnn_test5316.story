-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just ten miles south of the Polish city of Krakow is a remarkable place carved from salt .

Hidden 1,000 feet -LRB- 305 meters -RRB- underground lies a dimly-lit labyrinth of subterranean chambers , with saline lakes , horses ' stables , a chapel and even a salt-sculpted hall .

Decorated with elaborate sculptures -- the most astounding perhaps being `` The Last Supper '' carved into a rock salt wall -- even the crystals of the chapel 's chandeliers are hewn from salt , dissolved and reconstituted to resemble glass .

It might sound like something out of a Jules Verne novel , but the Wieliczka salt mine is not science fiction but one of Poland 's 13 UNESCO Cultural World Heritage sites , many of which date back to the medieval period .

Warsaw 's Old Town -LRB- meticulously reconstructed after 85 % of the capital 's historic center was destroyed during the war -RRB- and Auschwitz Birkenau concentration camp are must-visit spots .

But beyond them , you can find hundreds of years ' worth of fairytale-like medieval history .

Deeper underground

Few places capture the imagination like the salt mine at Wieliczka , believed to have been completed in 1280 . Tourists can delve into its depths on guided tours .

`` You see a little more than 1 % of the mine on the tourist route , '' said Marek Strojny , a guide for more than 20 years .

Consider that the tourist route is three kilometers -LRB- 1.8 miles -RRB- long and takes three hours to explore .

`` It would take years to see all of the mine , '' said Strojny .

`` There are nine levels , with 300 kilometers -LRB- 186 miles -RRB- of tunnels and more than 3,000 chambers . ''

Tourists view the mine at just over 300 feet -LRB- 91 meters -RRB- below the surface , but its intricacies continue down for more than double that depth .

Mining here was dangerous work ; there were cave-ins , and occasional methane explosions . This accounts for why the miners built the chapel in the 14th century -- they prayed constantly for their safety , and carved religious figures in their spare time . -LRB- Strojny estimated `` The Last Supper '' alone would have taken a year to complete . -RRB-

However , the job came with its perks .

`` There was great respect for the miners among the community on the surface , '' he noted .

`` And they were given privileges by Polish kings . For example , each worker was allowed to carry three kilograms of salt to the surface with them each month and sell it . Salt was -LRB- a valuable -RRB- preservative and was almost as expensive as silver . ''

`` Vampires '' in Krakow

The salt would doubtless have been traded at Krakow 's Rynek Glowny , the largest medieval market square in Europe and the site of another intriguing underground voyage .

In 2005 , an archaeological dig in the square was intended to last six months , but stretched into five years , such was the volume of treasures exhumed . The result is Rynek Underground , a subterranean museum built under the square .

`` The square has risen about four meters since early medieval times , '' said Dominik Lulewicz , an archaeologist at the museum . `` Over the years , the debris from earlier phases -LRB- of the square 's history -RRB- was spread across its surface . ''

While the entire historical center of Krakow is a UNESCO site , the 40,000 square meters of Rynek Glowny is its beating heart . In the 14th and 15th centuries it was a major center of European trade , abuzz with merchants selling everything from luxury goods -LRB- such as silks and spices -RRB- to cloth and lead .

As well as seeing some of those treasures , visitors to the museum can also see reconstructions of burial sites that were discovered during the dig , including what Lulewicz called `` anti-vampiric burials '' .

`` There are a few with tied hands and legs , probably due to the remains of Pagan beliefs , '' he said .

Choosing their religion

Diversity of belief is a uniting facet of Poland 's UNESCO heritage sites . Among the prettiest listed monuments are the wooden churches of Malopolska .

Winding through the looming mountains and sprawling fields of this picturesque pocket of south east Poland , are 1,500 kilometers -LRB- 932 miles -RRB- of trails that take hikers past striking examples of timber churches in everything from Roman Catholic to Greek Orthodox styles .

`` The multicultural history of Poland is marked by the variety of houses of worship from different periods , '' said Ma√Ö ` gorzata Trelka , of the National Heritage Board of Poland . She pointed to the 18th and 19th century wooden mosques that can be found in north east Poland by way of example .

Indeed , Trelka revealed that a 14th UNESCO site has been approved -- wooden Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches , dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries , in the Carpathian mountain range .

And yet another enduring example of Poland 's long tradition of religious tolerance is the UNESCO-listed Churches of Peace in Jawor and Swidnica . These 17th century Protestant churches were permitted by a Catholic emperor following the Thirty Years war , which had sprung from those very religions ' rivalry .

But maybe what unites these sites most of all is that , whether deep underground or spread throughout the countryside , Poland is rich in a tangible cultural landscape .
