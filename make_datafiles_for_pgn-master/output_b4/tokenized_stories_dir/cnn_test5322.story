-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- When billionaire investor Warren Buffett revealed last week that he has been diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer , the reaction -- including from Buffett himself -- amounted to a collective shrug .

Buffett said his doctors told him the cancer is `` not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way , '' which led some observers to wonder why the 81-year-old had bothered to get screened for the disease in the first place .

Since 2008 , an independent panel of experts that advises the federal government on preventive care has discouraged the use of prostate-specific antigen -LRB- PSA -RRB- tests -- a type of blood test -- to screen for cancer in men ages 75 and up . Tumors in this population tend to be slow-growing and asymptomatic , so early detection may carry more risks than benefits , the panel concluded .

Buffett 's diagnosis is n't the only sign that this recommendation has n't sunk in . According to a research letter published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association , PSA testing rates in men over age 75 have remained steady since the panel released its guidelines in 2008 .

National survey data shows that 43 % of men in that age bracket underwent PSA screening in 2005 . In 2010 , the researchers found , 44 % reported having a PSA test done -- a statistically negligible difference .

`` Screening patterns could n't have been more similar before and after , '' says lead researcher Scott E. Eggener , M.D. , an assistant professor of surgery at the University of Chicago Medical Center .

PSA tests are n't harmful in and of themselves , but studies have shown that positive results can lead to psychological distress , unnecessary biopsies , and overtreatment .

In older men , most early-stage tumors do n't require treatment because the men are likely to succumb to something else before the tumor becomes dangerous . Treatments , including surgery and radiation , may be riskier than continuing to monitor a tumor , since they carry a risk of incontinence and sexual dysfunction . -LRB- Buffet , for his part , has elected to undergo radiation . -RRB-

So why have n't screening rates budged ? The researchers can only speculate , but it could be that doctors and patients simply are n't aware of the new guidelines . Another , more troubling possibility is that some prostate cancer specialists are recommending PSA tests to collect the reimbursement fee and generate business .

Eggener says neither of these scenarios is especially likely , however . The media coverage surrounding the 2008 guidelines has been hard to miss , he says , and although there may be a `` subset '' of specialists who are `` consciously or unconsciously '' overscreening and overtreating their patients , most PSA tests are ordered by primary care physicians with no financial stake in a diagnosis .

What 's more likely is that doctors and patients are accustomed to viewing screening as a good thing , and are unable or unwilling to let that belief go despite all the data to the contrary . `` Physicians and patients latch onto the concept of screening for cancer and catching cancers early , '' Eggener says .

The ongoing discussion surrounding the appropriate amount of cancer screening extends beyond prostate cancer . The panel that issued the 2008 guidelines , the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force -LRB- USPSTF -RRB- , has spurred controversy in recent years by relaxing its screening recommendations for breast and cervical cancer as well .

In 2011 , the task force released draft guidelines that extended its recommendation against PSA testing to men of all ages . The current trend suggests the new guidelines may go unheeded , especially since not everyone agrees that PSA tests should be universally discouraged .

Even among men in the 75-and-over bracket , Eggener says , screening might make sense for certain patients . Older men in relatively poor health probably wo n't benefit from early detection and treatment , he says , but that might not be true for a healthy and active 75-year-old who 's likely to live long enough for a tumor to spread .

`` It 's very reasonable to check PSA levels , because it might save that guy 's life , '' he says .
