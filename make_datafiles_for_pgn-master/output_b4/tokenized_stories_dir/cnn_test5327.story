-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Karley Marquet and Annie Kendzior said they enrolled at two of the nation 's most prestigious military academies to serve their country and become military officers . Instead , they claim , they were raped -- and their military careers are now over .

In a lawsuit filed in U.S. Federal Court on Friday , the women claim the U.S. Military Academy in West Point , New York , and the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , ignored `` rampant sexual harassment . ''

The suit claims former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , the former superintendents of the two academies and the current secretaries of the Army and Navy are `` personally responsible '' for failing to `` prevent rapes and sexual assaults at the Naval Academy and West Point . ''

Karley Marquet was a high school honor student , championship swimmer and all-star rugby player . She could have gone to college anywhere with her credentials , but Marquet chose West Point .

`` When I was accepted , it was kind of overwhelming , '' she says . `` You ca n't imagine having that structure and discipline but at the same time having people look at you like , ` Wow , you 're doing something great for our country . ' ''

But Marquet said her dream of becoming an officer was shattered in January 2011 , her second semester at West Point .

Marquet said she got sick over a holiday weekend and stayed behind on campus . Her roommate was out of town and she was alone in her room .

It was then , Marquet , said , that an upperclassman she knew showed up at her door late one night to talk `` girl troubles . ''

`` I kind of felt cool that an upperclassman wanted to be friends with me and was seeking my advice , '' Marquet recalls .

After a drink , Marquet said , he persuaded her to go to his room .

`` I just remember getting more and more intoxicated and my judgment really started to become impaired . ... I remember him turning off the lights and me asking , ` What are you doing ? ' And then he proceeded to rape me . ''

Marquet said she woke up disoriented , in physical pain , afraid to come forward .

`` I was scared it was going to ruin my career , '' she said , `` I was scared if I said anything , there would constantly be a target on my back . ''

According to the lawsuit , Marquet became depressed and suicidal `` as a result of the rape and hostile environment '' at West Point .

She filed a report and requested an investigation .

`` The reason I ended up telling someone is because I did n't want that to happen to anyone else , '' Marquet said tearfully .

Annie Kendzior described herself as a `` girly-girl '' who never imagined she would end up in the military .

Kendzior was also an all-star student and one of the best high school soccer players in the country . She was recruited by Ivy League schools to play soccer , but she said the Naval Academy was more convincing .

`` All of their graduates from the soccer team went on and became pilots and Marine officers , '' Kendzior said . `` It just sounds like those women are so powerful and so well-respected , and I wanted to be that woman . ''

So in the fall of 2008 , Kendzior headed off to Annapolis . She said her goal was to fly F-18s but it was n't long after arriving at the academy she realized that was n't going to happen .

`` I could tell that there was a bias towards women , '' Kendzior recalled . `` You 're a female entering into a fraternity . A giant frat . ''

During one of he first weekends at the academy , Kendzior was invited to a party off campus . `` I was like , ` OK , cool ! College , finally ! I can live the college life for one night . ''

But Kendzior said she had way too much to drink , so when a fellow midshipman offered her a place to crash , she accepted .

`` I was like , ` OK , you know , it will be fine . I trust you . You 're an upperclass , '' Kendzior remembers , `` Because that 's what they teach you , to trust your upperclass . ''

But Kendzior says that did n't happen . She was raped .

`` At one point in the middle of the night , I did come to and he was on top of me , '' Kendzior said . `` And I remember saying ` No , ' but I just passed out again .

Kendzior said , she too , was afraid to come forward .

`` I did n't want to be the girl that got the athlete kicked out , We had been told stories about how that happened in the past and I did n't want to be that next story . ''

For the next two years Kendzior said she battled depression and thoughts of suicide . It was a secret she could n't keep anymore . When she told her father what happened , he encouraged her to file a report and request an investigation .

Marquet and Kendzior said they believed their cases were being investigated .

Marquet remembered investigators meeting with her parents about her case . `` They promised my parents that if he was n't going to jail , they could at least get him kicked out of West Point with the evidence they had , '' she said .

But both women said their alleged perpetrators were never punished and are still in the military .

Marquet and Kendzior are not alone . Reports of sexual assault at West Point , the Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs , Colorado , are up nearly 60 percent , and according to the Department of Defense , of the 65 reports investigated , only one resulted in a court-martial .

And it 's that rise in reports of sexual assault that has the top man at the Pentagon , Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta , changing the rules .

`` We 've got to train commanders to understand that when these complaints are brought , they 've got to do their damnedest to see that these people are brought to justice , '' Panetta told CNN 's Kyra Phillips in an exclusive interview .

Panetta could not comment on Marquet 's and Kendzior 's cases specifically because of privacy issues , but he made clear that blaming of the victim needs to stop .

`` I think that 's part of the syndrome that we 're dealing with , which is that once a decision is made that somehow this prosecution is not going to move forward then you basically turn on the victim who brought that complaint , '' Panetta said . `` That syndrome is what we have to break out of . ''

Just last week , after the CNN interview , Panetta announced he has created a Special Victims Unit to investigate sexual assault allegations , and that sexual assault allegations will be dealt with at the level of colonel instead of slowly making their way up through the chain of command .

But the changes in policy have come too late for Karley Marquet and Annie Kendzior . Their military careers are over .

According to the lawsuit , `` as a result of the rape , '' Marquet became `` depressed and suicidal . '' She said she was unable to handle the stress of seeing the alleged perpetrator every day , so she resigned from West Point .

Kendzior said she also became suicidal . She was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and according to her lawsuit , was then `` forced to leave the academy . ''

The two women said they are telling their stories so that others at the academies will feel comfortable coming forward .

`` I know that with at least one person coming forward there will be others who want to come forward and say something , '' Marquet said .

Similarly , Kendzior said , `` I want to encourage other women to report as soon as possible because then they might get their perpetrators put behind bars , which is where they should be , which is where they deserve to be . ''

West Point and the Naval Academy told CNN they were unable to comment on the allegations due to privacy issues . Both women have requested copies of their case files to learn more about why their alleged perpetrators are still in the military .
