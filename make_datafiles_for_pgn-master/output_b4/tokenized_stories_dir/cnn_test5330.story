Colorado Springs , Colorado -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A black Cadillac , bullet casings and a pizza box appear to connect a parolee with ties to a white supremacist prison gang to the shooting death of Colorado 's prisons chief , according to a search warrant affidavit obtained Friday by CNN .

The affidavit , filed by the Texas Department of Public Safety 's Ranger Division , details what authorities believe links Evan Spencer Ebel , who died in a shootout with sheriff 's deputies in Texas , and the Colorado killing of state prisons chief Tom Clements .

Of key focus in the affidavit is a 1991 black Cadillac that authorities say Ebel was driving in a wild , high-speed chase Thursday that saw the 28-year-old open fire on sheriff 's deputies before slamming into an 18-wheeler , climbing out of the wreckage and opening fire again .

Hours later , Ebel died from a gunshot wound to head suffered during the shootout , leaving behind more questions than answers in a case that has spanned two states .

On Friday , the wreckage of the Cadillac was under intense scrutiny after witnesses reported a similar vehicle -- a black , boxy car with Colorado license plates -- near the Monument , Colorado , house of Clements on Tuesday , the day he was killed .

Among the links in the cases , according to the affidavit , are shell casings from a 9 mm handgun found at Clements house . They are the same brand and caliber used in the shooting of a Wise County , Texas , sheriff 's deputy , it said .

Video : Pizza deliveryman remembered

In the Cadillac 's trunk was a Domino 's Pizza box carrier and a Dominos uniform jacket , it said .

That pizza carrier and jacket are a key reason why Denver authorities are also in Texas to examine the Cadillac .

They are investigating the killing of 27-year-old Nathan Collin Leon , a Domino 's Pizza deliveryman in Denver .

Leon disappeared from work on Sunday and was found dead in the Denver suburb of Golden . Leon 's family said he delivered pizzas as a way to earn extra money for his wife and his three girls .

Denver investigators tell CNN there is a `` strong connection '' between the killings of Leon and Clements .

Even as the investigation appears to link Ebel to the shooting , authorities have said little about a possible motive .

Did Ebel kill a pizza deliveryman to get a hold of his uniform as part of an effort to disguise himself ? Did he target Clements because of the prison chief 's crackdown on white supremacist gangs in prison ? Was he part of a wider conspiracy to kill Clements ? Or was it something else ?

High-speed chase in Texas

This much is known : On Thursday , Ebel sped through Montague County , Texas , near the Oklahoma state line , about 700 miles from Monument .

Deputy James Boyd tried to pull the car over . It 's unclear exactly why , other than it would have a been a routine part of Boyd 's job .

Boyd did not know about the Clements case , authorities said .

Ebel shot the deputy three times , hitting him twice in the chest and grazing his head . Wearing a bulletproof vest , the deputy managed to call for help and to tell law enforcement which way Ebel was driving . Authorities say they have looked at the dashcam video of the shooting .

Boyd remains hospitalized at a Dallas-Fort Worth area hospital .

The information the deputy gave allowed law enforcement to catch up with Ebel .

A high-speed chase ensued , ending about 30 miles away in Decatur , Texas , with Ebel firing out of his window at police , law enforcement said .

`` I would say he was running about 100 mph , and he had his left arm out the window and he was just shooting , '' said Decatur Police Chief Rex Hoskins , whose patrol car was parked in the median as the Cadillac raced past .

The chase ended when the Cadillac screeched onto another road and slammed into an 18-wheel truck , authorities said . With the front of his car crushed , Ebel got out and started shooting again .

Ebel did n't hit any officers this time , they said . But they shot him .

He was taken to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead Thursday night , authorities said .

A prison conspiracy ?

Since Tuesday , investigators looking into Clements ' killing have told reporters they are considering numerous angles .

One is that Ebel , a former member of the 211s -- a white-supremacist prison gang -- might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements , Paula Presley of the El Paso County , Colorado , sheriff 's department said .

The Department of Corrections told investigators that Ebel was a prison gang member , she said on CNN on Friday .

Clements earned widespread recognition for not only prison reforms but for a crackdown on prison gangs , including the 211s .

Citing media coverage of the shooting and its possible connection with the the 211s , authorities locked down Colorado 's prisons on Friday , said state Department of Corrections spokeswoman Alison Morgan .

`` We are on full lockdown over the weekend , no visitation or volunteer programs , '' she said .

Suspect 's troubled past

As authorities look for possible links in the case , a troubling portrait began to emerge of Ebel .

By all accounts , Ebel came from a privileged upbringing . His father , Jack Ebel , an attorney and former oil executive , counts Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper among his friends .

`` When I first came out to Colorado 30 years ago , he and I worked in the same oil company , '' Hickenlooper told reporters Friday .

The governor described Jack Ebel as `` generous to a fault , '' but said the son `` had a bad streak . ''

`` We knew his son growing up that he just had a bad streak , '' Hickenlooper told CNN affiliate KUSA . `` I think Jack , his wife , they did everything they could . ''

Hickenlooper , who did not go into details about the behavior , said he first learned the younger Ebel was a suspect in the killing of Clements on Thursday .

His first reaction ? `` There ca n't be two Evan Ebels . ''

`` I did n't even know Evan was out , '' Hickenlooper said , adding that he called the Ebel family a short time later .

The Ebels , according to Hickenlooper , were devastated by the news .

The governor said he never intervened on behalf of the younger Ebel , and he said Jack Ebel never made such a request .

Lengthy prison record

In 2003 , at the age of 18 , Evan Ebel was charged with felony armed robbery after brandishing a gun and threatening to kill a man unless he handed over his wallet , court documents show .

`` I 'm not playing . ... This is not a joke , '' Ebel said as he pointed a gun at the victim 's head , according to witness statements at the time .

Ebel pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to three years in prison , serving just over a year .

Just months after his release , he was arrested again . This time for felony menacing , robbery and assault . He pleaded guilty to those charges in 2005 and was sentenced to another three years in prison .

In 2006 , while in prison , Ebel was charged with assaulting a detention officer , records show . He pleaded guilty and received an additional four years on his sentence .

Ebel spent five years of his sentence in solitary confinement , Hickenlooper said .

While the governor said he never discussed the younger Ebel by name , Hickenlooper did say he told Clements that he knew someone in solitary confinement .

That person , the governor told KUSA , was Ebel .

`` One of the things I told Tom Clements was that his family was concerned that it was doing more harm that good , '' he said .

That statement is supported by Ebel 's mother , Jody Mangue , who detailed a visit with her son in a post on memorial website she created for her 16-year-old daughter , who was killed in a car accident in 2004 .

`` Evan is in Canon City , Colorado in CSP , the state prison . He has over three more years left . He has pretty much been in solitary confinement for 5 years . How he has managed this ceases to amaze me , but he has used his time wisely and is quite disciplined , conditioned , '' she wrote .

`` When we visit , I sit across from him , he in a chair on the other side of the thick glass . He is brought in in shackles . He spends 23 hours in his cell . ''

Ebel served his entire sentence and was given mandatory parole on January 28 , 2013 , according to the state Department of Corrections .

Shift in investigation

The emerging details about the investigation appear to indicate authorities are shifting away from considering the possible involvement of Homaidan al-Turki , a Saudi national .

On Thursday , Presley of the El Paso County sheriff 's department said that investigators were considering the possible involvement of al-Turki after a local news outlet , citing an anonymous source , said they were looking at connections between the Saudi national and Clements .

Al-Turki was convicted of sexually assaulting his housemaid at his Aurora , Colorado , home seven years ago . This month , Clements denied al-Turki 's request to serve the remainder of his Colorado prison sentence in Saudi Arabia , records show .

Attorneys for al-Turki did not immediately return a CNN request for comment .
