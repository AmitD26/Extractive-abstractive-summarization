-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- His name has been passed down for eight generations . It 's steeped in tradition and family pride . Oh -- but he 's not the royal baby . He 's William John Kane VIII , a database specialist from Portland , Oregon .

Kane is used to laughs and incredulous looks when he mentions his name . But the random guy at a bar who sang his name to the tune of `` I 'm Henery the Eighth , I Am '' stands out among the bad jokes .

`` It was funny for the first half-hour , and then the more he drank the louder he got , '' said Kane , 38 .

Despite the hecklers , Kane says he is proud of his name and the tradition it bears .

`` I feel a modicum of responsibility , the pressure of carrying on this torch that has been passed to me , and passing it onto another generation , '' he said .

Tradition also played a large role in how Prince William and Catherine , Duchess of Cambridge , named their son , Prince George Alexander Louis . The royal baby shares a name with some impressive ancestors -- there have been six King Georges , the most recent the current queen 's father .

The British royal family tends to pick traditional names , usually referencing monarchs of the past . It 's expected of royalty , but what 's the point of passing down a name when you 're an average Joe ?

George or Alexander ?

Parents are often tempted to name their child after a family member or a childhood friend because of the positive connotations they have with a name , says UCLA psychology professor Albert Mehrabian .

But Mehrabian , who has studied how people perceive names , argues it 's too personal of an approach . He tells parents to consider how an average person would respond to a name . He has crafted a system for rating a name 's attractiveness based on whether people perceive someone with that name to be caring , loyal , humorous , adventurous , successful or to have other traits .

It 's all based on what impression a name makes before you meet a person , he says .

Take George , for example . It 's an `` established name , '' Mehrabian said , but `` there are names with a lot more positive connotations . ''

The name scores 36 on scale of one to 100 . Alexander , on the other hand , gets a 92 .

`` Maybe at some point he 'll be called Alexander , '' Mehrabian surmised of the young prince .

Prince George and other royalty are typically bestowed with a long string of names . Take his uncle , Prince Harry , whose real name is Prince Henry Charles Albert David . He does n't go by his given name .

Cases like these are exactly why Mehrabian reminds parents of the practical purpose of a name : It identifies a person .

`` It kind of defeats the most fundamental function of naming when you name the child after the father , grandfather and great-grandfather , '' he said .

When names cause confusion

William John Kane VIII goes by two names . He 's Will at work and John to family and friends . He switches seamlessly between `` personas , '' but admits it can cause confusion for others .

Kane 's double name almost cost him a diploma .

`` Because I had William on the books and I went by John , half of my high school credits were in each name . I almost could n't graduate because there were two records . ''

While that was a one-time mistake , Kane is frequently confused with his father , William John VII . It 's caused some issues over the years , like getting partly blended credit reports and receiving an AARP card when he was 31 . But there are some perks , he says , like the time he used his father 's boarding pass so he could take his place at a wedding . Bonus : No ticket cancellation fees !

Despite the modern-day inconveniences of sharing a name , the father-son duo say that seeing the name repeated in the family tree helps them stay connected with the past .

`` Every once in a while you might think about where you came from and we want to have a place to grab a glance at your past , '' said Kane 's dad , who goes by Bill .

`` I feel that I need keep the name unblemished in honor of those who have carried it before me , '' he said .

The younger Kane is proud of his name and says he would like to continue the tradition .

`` In an era of parents naming their children Magnus , Lion , Breeze , Marlowe , Clover , Blue and North , I have to say that should I have a son of my own , I will undoubtedly campaign my future wife to bestow on him the mantle of William John the 9th . ''
