-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tensions between India and Pakistan flared Sunday in the Kashmir region , with at least one Pakistani soldier killed in the violence , its military said .

But exactly what happened depends on the source .

According to the Pakistani military , Indian troops crossed the Line of Control -- the de facto border between India and Pakistan in the disputed Kashmir region -- and attacked a military post .

`` Pakistan Army troops effectively responded and repulsed the attack successfully , '' but one Pakistani soldier was killed and another critically injured , the military said .

The Indian Defense Ministry , however , said Pakistani troops opened fire unprovoked on Indian posts in the north Uri sector of Indian-administered Kashmir .

Indian troops retaliated and forced Pakistani troops to stop firing , the defense ministry said . The ministry did not immediately report the number of casualties , but said three civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling in the area last October .

The territory under dispute lies in India 's Kashmir Valley , separated from Pakistan by the 450-mile Line of Control .

The two south Asian nuclear neighbors have had a bilateral ceasefire along the de facto border since November 2003 .

But the ceasefire has been violated repeatedly , with both sides accusing each other of offenses . Bilateral talks were temporarily suspended in 2008 following an attack by Pakistani militants in Mumbai , India 's most populous city . The negotiations resumed last year .

The conflict dates back to 1947 after Britain relinquished control of the Indian subcontinent , giving birth to India and Pakistan .

Kashmir was free to accede to either nation . Maharaja Hari Singh , the ruler of the kingdom at the time , initially chose to remain independent but eventually opted to join India , thereby handing key powers to the central government in New Delhi . In exchange , India guaranteed him military protection and vowed to hold a popular vote on the issue .

The South Asian rivals have fought two of three wars over the territorial issue -- in 1947 and in 1965 . A third conflict between India and Pakistan erupted in 1999 after Pakistani-backed forces infiltrated Indian-controlled Kashmir in the Kargil area .

Islamabad has always maintained that majority-Muslim Kashmir should have been a part of Pakistan . A United Nations ' resolution adopted after the first war called for a referendum allowing the people of Kashmir to choose which country they wanted to join , but that vote for self-determination has never been held . Pakistan wants that referendum to take place .

India claims that Pakistan lends support to separatist groups fighting against government control and argues that a 1972 agreement mandates a resolution to the Kashmir dispute through bilateral talks .
