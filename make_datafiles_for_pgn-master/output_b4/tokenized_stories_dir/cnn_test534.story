He is skilled at the `` throw-down , '' a move that gets you on a skateboard at near full speed .

He 's also smooth at grinding the rail and can do a perfect a mini-ramp jump -- a leap off an incline that gets you and your wheels airborne .

M.J. Rahimi has mastered some of the world 's most popular skateboarding tricks .

But the one skill that 's fast making Rahimi a recognized name is crafting skateboards inside his basement in the Iranian capital of Tehran .

The country has been quietly but steadily putting itself on the map in the world of action skateboarding .

`` I 'm very happy I 'm making skateboards , '' Rahimi said . `` My biggest dream is to make a skateboard and have a professional skate on it . ''

Rahimi says his first homemade board shattered into pieces but he kept at it when the sport started picking up popularity several years ago . Demand for affordable equipment picked up too .

He starts by gluing together thin layers of maple wood , then presses them into sloped boards , and carves and sands them into shape .

`` When I first started , my dad said it will never work , but now he supports me , '' he says .

Rahimi reveals his plan is to create an affordable brand . He hopes to sell his boards at the growing number of skate shops in the Islamic Republic where trendy teenagers shop for the latest gear .

According to skate store owner Ali Reza Ansari , business is brisk . `` We are doing our best to improve skateboarding here , '' Ansari said . `` We have really good skaters here -LRB- in Tehran -RRB- . ''

Ever since the 1979 Islamic Revolution , the leadership here in Iran has been wary of the spread and influence of western culture .

Rock and roll music , for example , is banned . So is dancing in public . But when it comes to skateboarding not only does the government seem OK with it , in many ways they 're actually supporting it .

The government has authorized six skate parks in the capital Tehran alone as well as others in Ahvaz , Isfahan , Shiraz , Tabriz and even the holy city of Qom .

Perfect arenas for Iran 's growing skateboard community to gather and show off their gnarly kick-flips and 360 spins .

In the future some may even ride Rahimi 's boards -- a product that takes pride in being made in a basement in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
