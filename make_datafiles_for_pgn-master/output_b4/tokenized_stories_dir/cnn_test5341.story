Baltimore -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Geremen Teklehaimanot came into the Baltimore Medical System office Thursday hoping to renew the same sliding-scale health policy that he had last year , he got more than he bargained for .

The 34-year-old limo driver was met by not one health benefits expert but two .

`` I 'm going to sign you up for your sliding scale , and let me introduce you to someone else who will help , '' said Darlene Middleton-Lawson , the health benefits adviser at Baltimore Medical System . `` This is Jekisha Elliott . Jekisha is a navigator . She is going to talk to you about what else might be possible . ''

In August of this year , the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services gave out $ 67 million in Navigator Cooperative Agreements . The grants pay to train , support and certify advisers , also known as patient navigators , who work out in the field and on the phone . The navigators partner with local medical systems to help people figure out how the new Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces work .

Obama offers funding to help communities understand Obamacare

Most people who will become newly insured through Obamacare have no experience buying health insurance . Navigators ca n't tell people what plan to pick , but they can walk people through what might work best based on their family circumstances and health .

Based on his income , Teklehaimanot may qualify for a subsidized health plan through the new Obamacare marketplaces .

`` That 's wonderful , '' he said . `` Just wonderful . Let me show you something . ''

He took out his smartphone and showed Elliott his browser . It was stuck on the website for Maryland 's health insurance marketplace .

`` See , it says I 'm almost in , '' he said .

This week the sheer volume of interest overwhelmed the Maryland site . All across the country there were reports of long wait times at other state and federal sites .

Teklehaimanot was n't discouraged . He seemed excited about the possibility of buying his own policy , and Elliott is someone who can help .

Elliott is the official navigator team leader for the nonprofit HealthCare Access Maryland . Maryland will get about 300 certified navigators who will be essential during open enrollment .

A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in March found that 67 % of the uninsured under the age of 65 -- the people who could most benefit from Obamacare -- said they did n't understand how it could affect them .

Middleton-Lawson met Elliott for the first time Thursday . Dressed head to toe in bright pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month , Middleton-Lawson literally did a small dance of joy when she learned a navigator was in the building .

`` I 'm so glad you are here , '' Middleton-Lawson said . `` People ca n't sign up fast enough for this , and they do need help . ''

`` Answer ` yes ' to one of these , '' Elliott told Teklehaimanot as he filled out forms . Elliott 's calm demeanor and reassuring tone visibly seemed to put Teklehaimanot at ease .

Elliott used to be a teacher . She misses her special needs students , but finds this navigator work fulfilling .

`` It 's helping people who are willing to learn , and it 's helping people who are in dire need of health care , '' Elliott said . `` With this program it will definitely give them a peace of mind . ''

Obamacare 's coverage gap : The poor caught in between

Here in Maryland , the state has fully embraced Obamacare . It opened its own marketplace and expanded Medicaid . About 13 % of the population in Maryland does n't have any kind of insurance , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . That means nearly 750,000 people are probably not getting all the medical attention they need . About half that population is now eligible for Medicaid with the state 's expansion .

In addition to navigators like Elliott , HeathCare Access Maryland also set up a call center . It 's staffed seven days a week with people who can take calls in 200 different languages . Elliott says it 's gotten a ton of calls this week . Only a few were angry -LRB- some people call not for help , but to vent about Obamacare -RRB- .

`` Mostly , the angry callers just want to be heard , '' Elliott says . `` So , we listen to those too . ''

Most of the questions the navigators get involve the cost . With subsidies , the Department of Health and Human Services estimates the majority of people should be able to find coverage for $ 100 or less a month . Even a bare-bones policy covers preventive care like immunizations , mental health , rehab and other services .

Her navigator job , Elliott says , also has a side benefit . Her friends now call all the time .

`` Even though they have jobs , some of them still do n't have insurance , '' Elliott said . `` A lot of my friends are calling me and saying ` OK , where do I need to go ? What do I need to do ? Can I come to your house ? ' We are at a place in life where you have a job , but you ca n't afford to buy a health plan . I think this is going to be a really good thing because now it 's going to be really affordable to people . ''

Toward the end of his visit , Teklehaimanot 's smartphone still had n't connected with the Maryland marketplace . He has n't signed up for a new plan yet , but he does have more information . He has until December 14 to sign up if he wants his family to have coverage starting January 1 .

For many , signing up for a new policy may take several conversations or several website visits .

`` I know there 's some general frustration right now with the online part , '' Elliott said . `` I 'm confident though we 'll work the kinks out , and regardless , I know they will be happy once they get all the benefits . It can be life-changing . ''
