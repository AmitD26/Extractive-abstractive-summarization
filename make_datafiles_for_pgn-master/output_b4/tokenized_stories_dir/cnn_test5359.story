Johannesburg , South Africa -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It used to be an old factory churning out parts for the mining industry before slowly falling into neglect and turned into a garage for vehicle repairs .

But now , after a renovation process , the high-ceilinged warehouse has been reinvented as a modern art deco space intended to house Africa 's most cutting-edge design ideas and exhibit them to the world .

Welcome to the Museum of African Design , or MOAD , a 2,500 square meter space which claims to be the first of its kind on the continent .

Situated inside Johannesburg 's vibrant Maboneng precinct , a former crime hotspot that 's undergoing an urban rejuvenation , MOAD opened its doors late last month with the vision to become a pan-African platform for contemporary creativity and innovation .

`` The goal for it is really to become a cultural hub , '' explains Aaron Kohn , the young and enthusiastic director of MOAD . `` A place to showcase what 's going on the continent that 's innovative but also to encourage that kind of thinking , design and creativity to young South Africans and to people visiting Johannesburg at the same time . ''

True to its character

The spacious downtown building , which dates back to the 1920s , had been earmarked as a museum since its acquisition by the Maboneng developers in 2011 . But it only hosted a number of temporary exhibitions and events during the past year before work started in July to transform it into a permanent home for African design .

The developers went on to add an extra floor , bathrooms and a cocktail bar but kept the building 's integrity largely intact -- raw floors , metal bars and scaffolding ramps still dominate the three-level space , creating a rough-edged atmosphere that echoes the identity of the building and its urban surroundings .

`` We will continue ` refining ' the space , but the goal is to leave it as original and industrial as possible , '' explains Kohn .

` New ways to see the world '

The museum 's launch event took place on October 24 with the annual showcase of the Southern Guild collection , a 10-day exhibition presenting the creations of some of South Africa 's top designers and artists .

Renowned architect David Adjaye , who was born in Tanzania to Ghanaian parents , was the guest of honor at the event .

`` I believe in design as a very important edifying element for community , for culture , for civilization , '' he told CNN hours before the official opening . `` I think it 's one of the hallmarks of how we talk about creating awareness about who we are and what values we have in the world , '' added Adjaye .

`` Design is very good , it 's almost like a diver ; it seeks out new ways which you can see the world ; it goes down and discovers new things that bring it back up and it shows it to us . I think that 's really important . ''

` Native Nostalgia '

After the launch event , which had a South African focus , MOAD is now making its first foray into the continent 's creativity with `` Native Nostalgia , '' the museum 's inaugural full-length exhibition .

Starting today , the group show explores the idea of nostalgia and what it means for African artists to look at dark chapters in history , including apartheid and colonialism , in a fond manner .

It features a series of mixed media creations from a number of African artists , including Leonce Raphael Agbodjelou from Benin , Amina Menia from Algeria , The Nigeria Nostalgia Project and South African collective I See a Different You .

`` Native Nostalgia '' is curated by Kohn , but the MOAD director says that in the future the museum will be working with different people for every exhibition . He also outlines that MOAD is not interested in becoming a collective institution that stores art or wastes any budget on insurance and acquiring fees .

`` We want to focus on the most exciting and relevant exhibitions that we can put on with works from across the continent , '' says Kohn .

`` I think that 's a new model that a lot more institutions around the world are looking at in terms of not having necessarily conventional museum staff , not having a permanent collection -- it allows an institution that 's interested in the contemporary to stay contemporary , '' adds Kohn .

`` Native Nostalgia '' runs until February 9 . Upcoming exhibitions at MOAD include `` Fashioning Africa , '' running from March to May , and `` Design of an African City , '' from June to August .
