-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With plastic bottles melting on court and players vomiting during matches , the heat is on in at the Australian Open , though organizers have cut the women some slack .

As temperatures soared , China 's Peng Shuai blamed the conditions after she cramped up and was sick during her defeat to Kurumi Nara of Japan .

At one point temperatures at Melbourne Park rose to 42.2 Celsius -LRB- 108 Fahrenheit -RRB- , with world No. 2 Victoria Azarenka describing playing on the Rod Laver Arena court as like `` dancing in a frying pan . ''

It got so hot , organizers introduced the tournament 's `` extreme heat '' contingency plan which allows for an extended break between the second and third set for the women .

The decision on whether or not to suspend play lies with tournament director Wayne McKewen , who uses a scale which factors in temperature , humidity and wind .

`` We have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time , '' McKewen said in a statement .

`` That did n't happen . While conditions were hot and uncomfortable , the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue . ''

Despite searing heat , double defending champion Azarenka kept her cool , surviving a tough first set before going on to beat Swedish world No. 91 Johnanna Larsson 7-6 -LRB- 7-2 -RRB- 6-2 .

The Belorussian would have liked organizers to close the roof on Melbourne Park 's showpiece court to protect the players , with the blazing sun making conditions hot under foot .

`` When I went out on the court I was just curious what the temperature was , '' the 24-year-old , who will play Barbora Zahlavova Strycova in the second round , told reporters .

`` Because even though it was windy , the wind was hot . You normally expect some freshness ... but it just did n't come , from anywhere . ''

Also playing in marginally favorable conditions earlier in the day , former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki made light work of Lourdes Dominguez Lino .

Tenth seed Wozniacki , who recently announced her engagement to golfer Rory McIlroy , needed just 67 minutes to wrap up a 6-0 6-2 win over the Spaniard , although the searing heat did take its toll on her drinks bottle .

`` The first set I thought I managed to keep my head cool , '' said the Dane , who advanced to a meeting with American Christina McHale .

`` Every time in the changeovers , ice bags , ice towels , everything ; and then in the second set I could feel they were starting to heat up even more .

`` I put the bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit underneath , the plastic , so you knew it was warm .

`` But it was warm for both of us , and it was great that I managed to finish it off in two sets and it was n't too long . ''

Maria Sharapova took to the court for the final match of day two , the third seed 's 6-3 6-4 victory over American Bethanie Mattek-Sands secured in cooler temperatures once the sun had set .

But fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska was made to sweat for her place in the second round .

The Pole , a quarterfinalist at Melbourne Park in each of the last three years , cruised through the first set before overcoming a fight back from Kazakhstan 's Yulia Putintseva to win 6-0 5-7 6-2 .

There were no such problems for world No. 8 Jelena Jankovic , with the Serb cruising to a 6-1 6-2 victory against Japan 's Misaki Doi .
