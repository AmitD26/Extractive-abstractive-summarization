-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Community activist Tony Lewis Jr. is on a mission to right the wrongs of his father 's past .

Known as `` Little Tony , '' Lewis Jr. recalls having a `` quintessential '' childhood , often envied by his neighborhood friends . In his household , his parent 's love and money were free-flowing . He and his father planned lavish shopping trips and the family frequently vacationed in Las Vegas and Atlantic City .

They went to see Michael Jackson in concert , attended the Super Bowl and took in championship boxing matches . He describes this time in his life as an inner city version of the 1980s sitcom `` Silver Spoons . ''

`` My father would pick me up in a Porsche one day , a Mercedes the next day , a BMW the next . My mother would drive a Mercedes , a Jaguar , '' Lewis Jr. says , `` It was normal to me . ''

That all changed on December 6 , 1989 . That 's the day his father , Tony Lewis Sr. was convicted of helping to run one of the largest drug rings in the history of the nation 's capitol . In the same city where his cocaine operation wreaked havoc , his son now mentors young men who might be lured into a life of crime .

Although as a child he knew his father was different from the parents of his Catholic schoolmates , Tony says he was completely unaware of father 's illegal activity . `` I never saw my dad with drugs at all . That was something that was never done in our presence . ''

It was n't until 1988 , when Tony was 8 years old that he realized the truth behind his father 's extravagant lifestyle . While watching the local news , Tony saw a report that claimed officials had raided one of the city 's largest cocaine distribution networks . He gazed at the TV screen as his father was escorted into police custody , a suspect in the high profile case .

After Tony Sr. was arrested , he never came home .

`` When my father went to prison , my childhood pretty much ended , '' he says . `` My innocence was taken . ''

The court found that Tony Lewis Sr. was a partner in a cocaine distribution conspiracy that generated millions of dollars in sales . He is appealing his conviction on four counts including conspiracy to distribute narcotics and racketeering .

Tony 's father was eventually sentenced to life without parole . Lewis Sr. remembers seeing Little Tony after his guilty verdict . `` I cried . ... I told him that he had to be strong . '' Leaving his son was the hardest thing he ever had to do . `` No amount of money I made is worth this , '' he says .

Lewis Jr. says he did n't find out his father would never get out of jail until he was 14 years old , while researching on the Internet at school . `` To find out he was going to be locked up forever was very tough to deal with , '' Tony says . `` It crushed me . ''

In a recent interview with CNN from a federal prison in Maryland , Lewis Sr. told CNN that it was never his dream to be a drug dealer . As the son of a single mother raising six kids on welfare , Lewis Sr. says he started selling drugs at 14 as a way to make ends meet : `` We never had enough to eat . I actually started selling drugs to ... provide for my siblings . ''

After his dad 's downfall , Tony says he went from `` riches to rags . '' Along with his mother , Tony moved into his grandmother 's row home , located on a city block once known for violence and crime . `` I had to mature very quickly to be able to kind of survive the things that I went through , '' Tony says .

Growing up on Washington 's Hanover Place in the late '80s and '90s , where drugs and violence were commonplace , Tony recalls losing friends and family members to the streets . Shortly after his father 's incarceration , Tony says his mother suffered a mental breakdown , leaving him without the secure family structure he once knew . `` He was left pretty much parentless , '' his father says .

During his teen years , Tony admits he was tempted to follow in his father 's footsteps : `` The men in my family were bank robbers , and gamblers ... and drug dealers . There was no blueprint for me to succeed . '' But , he credits his mother and grandmother , and his father 's consistent support from behind bars for motivating him to succeed beyond his circumstances .

`` I did n't want to die at 16 , 18 , 21 , '' Tony Jr. says . `` I knew another way of life was possible . '' Tony graduated from the University of the District of Columbia in 2003 at the age of 23 .

Now 32 , Tony 's goal is to impact the lives of young men growing up without fathers .

In 2010 , Tony founded a mentoring initiative for children of incarcerated parents called Sons of Life . He was inspired to create the organization during a routine prison visit with his father .

Tony noticed a young boy waiting in the visiting area to see his dad . He looked to be about 8 years old , the same age as Tony when his father went away .

`` I completely saw myself in that kid , '' he says . `` I prayed he would n't have to endure what I endured without my father -- that was the premise for Sons of Life . ... I wanted to help some kids in my situation make it . ''

Tony , whose day job involves developing job skills for ex-offenders , mentors 10 young men ages 9 to 21 through his program . He organizes field trips to the White House , sporting events , and dinners . He aims to expose the young men to possibility and opportunity .

Tony also helps families buy Christmas and birthday gifts and school supplies , stepping in where their fathers ca n't . In collaboration with his father , who is still in prison in Maryland , Tony has also organized family prison trips for children in need of transportation to detention centers .

Tony is like a big brother to Sons of Life participants Xavier and Delfon . `` He goes to our football events , basketball games , '' says 14-year-old Delfon . `` It makes me feel like actually cares . ''

His brother Xavier , 13 , added : `` He can relate to me because he 's been through the same thing I 'm going through . '' According to the boys ' mother , who asked that her name not be published , Tony 's presence has made a big difference in her sons ' lives .

`` I see the way my kids ' faces light up just because he can relate , '' she explained . `` Most of their peers did n't understand . Just the average peer group did n't work well for them . ''

According to Joyce Arditti , professor of human development at Virginia Tech and author of `` Parental Incarceration and the Family , '' children of incarcerated parents are unique when compared with those who have endured other forms of parent separation such as divorce or death .

Research suggests that children of incarcerated parents are often disadvantaged in many areas of life and at a higher risk of school failure , poor self esteem , delinquent behavior and incarceration themselves , according to Arditti .

It 's difficult for the remaining parent to find coping resources for children living with the stress of having a parent behind bars , she says , adding that programs like Sons of Life can be effective . `` Insider status is very important , '' she says . `` Therapy that is typically successful for children of incarcerated parents are programs that closely model their day to day experience . ''

For Tony , leading by example is the best way to inspire others around him . Though he ca n't turn back the clock , he 's trying to restore his father 's name in the community . `` One of the biggest things I 'm proud of is that I 've been able to really change the perception of what my name means in my city . ''

Today , Tony still lives in the same row house with his grandmother , on the same street where he grew up . `` The kids in my community need to see me , '' Tony says . `` They need to be able to touch me and know that I am not a myth . I want to be an inspiration for them to say yes we can make it out too . ''
