Paris -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seventy-five additional bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of an Air France plane that crashed off the coast of Brazil two years ago , more than doubling the number of remains that have been found , the vice-president of the French victims ' association told CNN Tuesday .

The remains have not yet been identified , Robert Soulas said .

Air France 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1 , 2009 , killing all 228 people aboard . The bulk of the wreckage was found this year after a search by robot submarines of an underwater mountain range .

Many bodies were still in the fuselage , investigators said at the time . Only about 50 bodies were recovered in the days following the crash .

Soulas got the news from a French government liaison appointed to deal with families of victims , he said .

`` Personally , I would have preferred to leave the bodies of our loved ones on the seafloor , '' he added , repeating his long-held view .

The Brazilian national news agency Agencia Brasil reported Tuesday that Nelson Faria Marinho , head of the Brazilian victims organization , said that with the latest recovery , the number of bodies found since the accident now totals 127 .

Details of the doomed plane 's last minutes only began to emerge last week as French air accident investigators studied data recorders recovered from the wreck earlier this year .

The Airbus A330 plummeted 38,000 feet in just three minutes and 30 seconds amid conflicting information that may have led the pilots to make bad decisions , France 's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis -LRB- BEA -RRB- said Friday .

The pilots got conflicting air speed readings in the minutes leading up to the crash , according to an interim report . The aircraft climbed to 38,000 feet when `` the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled , '' the report says .

Aviation experts are asking why the pilots responded to the stall by pulling the nose up instead of pushing it down to recover .

Miles O'Brien , a pilot and aviation analyst , said : `` You push down on the wheel to gain air speed , perhaps they -LRB- pilots -RRB- were getting information that the air speed was too high . Pulling the nose up will exacerbate an aerodynamic stall . ''

The speeds displayed on the left primary flight display were `` inconsistent '' with those on the integrated standby instrument system -LRB- ISIS -RRB- , the report says .

The aircraft experienced some `` rolling '' before stalling and then descending rapidly at 10,912 feet -LRB- 3,300 meters -RRB- per minute .

At the time of the descent , the two co-pilots and captain were in the aircraft cockpit .

All 228 people aboard the Airbus A330 Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris were killed on June 1 , 2009 .

The pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the Atlantic Ocean known for constant bands of severe turbulence .

Air crash investigators at the Paris-based BEA have been working on the theory that the speed sensors , known as pitot tubes or probes , malfunctioned because of ice at high altitude .
