-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Boston Marathon bombing investigation made use of crowdsourcing to collect photos and video from cell phones and surveillance cameras at an unprecedented level . These pictures were made public a little more than 72 hours after the explosions and the second suspect was arrested 29 hours later .

Forensics is the use of scientific or technical information to answer questions in a court of law . Digital forensics is the branch that focuses on the identification , acquisition and analysis of information found on digital devices : computers , cell phones , digital cameras or any computer-based system .

The concept of law enforcement posting photos of wanted individuals in a public place and asking for assistance is hardly new ; walk into any post office and you will still see the FBI Most Wanted poster . Why the post office ? Because it used to be the social center of a town , a place where the government and the people regularly came together .

Fast forward to 2013 and we have thousands of people taking pictures and videos of what everyone expected to be an every day event . Law enforcement agencies were able to use these images to observe the comings and goings of hundreds of people at a certain site at a certain time in order to detect a pattern of behavior with which to identify the two suspects . And most of this imagery came from private citizens .

Personal computers have been around for nearly 30 years . The Internet has been commercially available for 20 years . Mobile phones have been pervasive for more than 10 years and smartphones , in particular , for more than five . Computers , networks and cell phones have increasingly become the record keeper , instrument or target of criminal activity over the last few decades .

Smartphones are everywhere and offer the equivalent of a portable Internet terminal . Not only do cell phones contain a phone book , call history and text messages , but also Web browser history , email , Global Positioning System and other location information . And surprisingly high-quality pictures and video .

All of this information will be of value to investigators . They will want to know who the suspects might have been communicating with in the immediate aftermath of the bombings and , again , in the aftermath of their pictures being posted in the media . The larger investigation will undoubtedly examine their text and email messages , social media postings , Web sites visited and calls made over the last few months and years . This digital forensic evidence will help piece together patterns of behavior that could provide insights into the suspects ' thoughts and deeds , and even provide new leads .

What does this mean for privacy rights ? Consider that when a municipality wants to put up a new camera at an intersection , or purchase a drone , there is often a public outcry . Is the camera an invasion of privacy ? Where will it be looking ? How will the government use the data ? How long will the data be kept ? Will it be used to track my movements ? At some level , these are good and important questions because this kind of discourse is necessary to frame our Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches .

Yet , in Boston , a lot of the images came not from public-sector cameras but from private-sector cameras : our fellow citizens . Fellow citizens who voluntarily shared their information so that law enforcement could do its job .

Were these people violating the rights of others by sharing their pictures ? Well , no , considering that the Bill of Rights was intended to protect us against a tyrannical government rather than from each other . Indeed , it is not clear that the government could have compelled these citizens to turn over their pictures just in case they might be useful ; imagine persuading a judge to sign a search warrant on such pure speculation .

Yet , citizens stepped forward to offer their help , a clear sign of a community willing to work together for a greater good and one that does not distrust the government .

Although some might claim that these people were surrendering their rights for an element of security , it was the same instinct that made some people run toward the carnage so that they could provide assistance and comfort to friends , family and strangers . They were not surrendering their rights when they helped law enforcement but were empowering themselves as a community .

The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly offer citizens a right of privacy , although many court decisions certainly support such an ideal . Indeed , U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis is well known for his observation , `` The right to be left alone -- the most comprehensive of rights , and the right most valued by a free people . ''

Your personal privacy has more to fear from the likes of Facebook and Google than from the government . Commercial entities such as social media sites offer free services and yet make money . How ?

We , our information , have become their commodity . They have more money , motivation and resources to use our collected information for their own purposes than the government does . We , as users of social media , self-exploit ; we post our information voluntarily . Yet , once posted , we usually lose exclusive ownership of the information and always lose control over it .

Although the use of the crowdsourcing metaphor may be new as it applies to a criminal investigation , it is almost certain we will see more of this in the future . And it is sure to renew questions about how we all are invading each other 's privacy and personal space .

It also points to the incredible resiliency of the U.S. Constitution and its ability to guide us in a modern era , yet why it needs constant interpretation . As technologies evolve that the Founders could not have possibly anticipated -- from fully automatic weapons and thermal imagers to satellites and digital technologies -- we have to figure out how to balance our rights as individuals and needs as a society .
