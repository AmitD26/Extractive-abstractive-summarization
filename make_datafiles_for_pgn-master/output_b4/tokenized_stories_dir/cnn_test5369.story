Atlanta , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In one chair sits a rural retiree , his financial security shot in the slump , a humble Southerner who 's never thought much about politics . In another seat is a born Northerner , an inner-city native , a relative of a civil rights giant . And nearby , circling a table , are an economist , an artist , a onetime John McCain supporter and a long-haired guy who 's rich in Woodstock memories .

Meet these members of the Coffee Party Movement , an organically grown , freshly brewed push that 's marking its official kickoff Saturday . Across the country , even around the globe , they and other Americans in at least several hundred communities are expected to gather in coffeehouses to raise their mugs of java to something new .

They 're professionals , musicians and housewives . They 're frustrated liberal activists , disheartened conservatives and political newborns . They 're young and old , rich and poor , black , white and all shades of other .

Born on Facebook just six weeks ago , the group boasts more than 110,000 fans , as of Friday morning . The Coffee Party is billed by many as an answer to the Tea Party -LRB- more than 1,000 fewer fans -RRB- , a year-old protest movement that 's steeped in fiscal conservatism and boiling-hot , anti-tax rhetoric .

This new group calls for civility , objects to obstructionism and demands that politicians be held accountable to the people who put them in office .

Are you at a Coffee Party gathering ? Share your images , story

`` The government has become so broken that the will of the people has been lost in the political game , '' said Stacey Hopkins , 46 , coordinator of the Atlanta , Georgia , chapter . `` And the only voices you 're hearing are the ones of those who are screaming the loudest . They have a right to their views , but they do n't have the right to speak for all Americans . ''

At a recent Coffee Party planning meeting at Manuel 's Tavern , an Atlanta political institution , about 40 people gathered to speak for themselves . They brought their own stories of why they were there .

The one who was `` never active in this stuff ''

Politics ? It never spoke to John Purser , who 's preferred the simple life . At 69 , he lives in a two-room house on a rural dirt road in Carroll County , drives a 26-year-old Ford pickup and takes odd jobs to get by . He cuts grass , chops wood and does handyman work . Earlier this week , he freed a bird from someone 's house and `` got paid with a bottle of whiskey , '' he said with a laugh .

He does n't need much . Never has . But Purser , who worked in maintenance for Delta Airlines for 30 years , has seen the little security he might have had -- his retirement money , for example , and his home 's value -- fall apart in recent years . And he just does n't understand why some fancy executive should earn millions . His own daddy made $ 12 a week building roads for the Work Projects Administration during the Great Depression .

`` Our country was a hell of a lot worse off then , and we came together , and we did something , '' he said . `` I 'm not that smart . I do n't know the dollars and cents . But I 'm just looking for something different . ''

The Atlanta coordinator

Hopkins was 5 when she stared at the two water fountains : one marked `` colored , '' the other `` white . '' The New Yorker was somewhere in Virginia at a train stop with her mother and grandmother , and , well , she 'd never drunk colored water before and figured white was what she wanted . But her grandmother yanked her away from that water , muttering something about her getting them all killed .

That moment , and her childlike understanding of what it meant , stuck with Hopkins and has driven her ever since . The stay-at-home mom used to work in the real-estate mortgage field but left when she became disheartened by the industry .

She feels hopeful about the people who are re-engaging in and taking ownership of the political process .

`` President Obama is stifled by a dysfunctional Congress . When he was on the campaign trail , he used the word ` we ' a lot . He can not do this alone . He needs our help , '' she said . `` Americans are waking up across the board . ... Not everyone is cut out to be an activist . But everyone can do something . ''

The young fiscal conservative

When other kids were watching cartoons , Alex Oxford tuned in to news programs . For as long as the Marietta , Georgia , high school senior can remember , he 's been drawn to politics . He 's 17 and ca n't vote , but he 's long volunteered for campaigns .

The self-described libertarian and fiscal conservative was , and in some ways still is , a supporter of the Tea Party . He initially backed Sen. John McCain for president in 2008 and is n't , himself , comfortable with the idea of a public option in the health-care system . But the direction Oxford has seen the Tea Party take recently has him concerned .

He ca n't help but think it 's being hijacked by social conservatives and the far right , he said , and as a gay man who 's committed to gay rights , it may not be his cup of political tea .

So he 's pulled up a chair at the Coffee Party to see what it can offer . Next to him is a college Democrat leader wearing a T-shirt that reads : `` I 'll hug your -LSB- picture of an elephant -RSB- if you kiss my -LSB- picture of a donkey -RSB- . ''

`` I never feel uncomfortable stating my opinions , '' but it was `` sort of ironic . They wanted free discussion of the issues but did n't want to talk about the conservative side of things , '' Oxford said after the planning meeting . `` I think it was great , but I 'd like to see more conservatives and libertarians . ''

The disillusioned Obama supporter

`` As a Southern woman , I was taught that discussing politics and religion is ill-mannered , '' said Darlene Jones-Owens , 53 , of Carrollton , Georgia . But she became an involved and vocal Democrat when she `` realized that America had been lied to about Iraq , that our military uses torture , and when I heard John McCain sing ` Bomb , bomb , bomb Iran . ' ''

She said she began registering voters for the Democratic Party , canvassed her neighborhood to talk about issues that had become dear to her and endured `` icy stares and insults . '' Unable to find Obama bumper stickers and other materials where she lives , the University of West Georgia lecturer and a friend ordered them in bulk and made sure others had access to them .

`` I am looking for a group of informed thinkers who might be able to impact the obstructionism we now have in D.C. , '' she said . `` I 've gotten really disillusioned with the lack of change that 's happened . ... There are a lot of people looking for something different . We have a lot more in common than we realize . ''

The man Aunt Rosa called `` baby ''

Tony Anderson likes to say he was born into an organization . He has a twin brother and learned early on what it meant to work with others . Through church involvement and his family , the Detroit , Michigan , native gleaned more .

His great-grandmother 's first cousin was the legendary civil rights activist Rosa Parks , whom he grew up calling `` Aunt Rosa . '' He remembers her telling him , '' ` You know , baby , you 're not special . You 're unique , ' '' and that 's a distinction he appreciates today . To be special means you deserve more , your own category ; everyone , on the other hand , is unique and has something to offer .

The 27-year-old social entrepreneur and nonprofit consultant works in sustainability . While a political philosophy major at Morehouse College in Atlanta , he started the Let 's Raise a Million Project , which set out to bring low-income black communities into the green movement one compact fluorescent light bulb at a time .

He calls himself a `` political realist '' who never expects change to happen in a flash . He did n't put that on Obama , and he looks at the Coffee Party with cautious optimism .

`` I think that space is definitely onto something , '' he said . It 's `` another way to start a conversation . That 's what I really like . ''
