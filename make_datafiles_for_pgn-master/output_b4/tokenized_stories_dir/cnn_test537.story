-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Radical anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr thanked followers who offered to launch attacks against the U.S. military in Iraq should he reinstate his notorious Mehdi Army militia , according to a posting on his website .

The exchange between a follower and al-Sadr on his website comes as Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is talking with members of his government about the possibility of requesting American troops to stay in Iraq beyond a year-end deadline to withdraw .

Al-Sadr vowed earlier this year to `` escalate armed resistance '' if the U.S. military does not pull its troops as scheduled , a move that could destabilize the country should the Mehdi Army repeat the bloody battles it waged against American and Iraqi forces during the height of violence .

`` We intended to be martyred , if you intend to lift the freeze of Imam al-Mehdi Army to defend Islam , doctrine and Iraq . Our martyrdom will be restricted only on activities against the infidel occupier without harming the civilians or any public proprieties , '' an unidentified follower posted on the website on Friday .

Al-Sadr responded : `` Thank you dears ... May God preserve you and watch over you . ''

A U.S. military spokesman on Sunday told CNN that , `` Muqtada al-Sadr 's statement speaks sufficiently for itself about his attitude toward the use of violence as an alternative to democratic processes . ''

`` It 's the same attitude that has caused so much violence for the Iraqi people in the past , '' Col. Barry Johnson said . `` We are not inclined to characterize it further at this point . ''

Since 2003 , al-Sadr has had the support of tens of thousands of Shiites , especially the young and impoverished in Baghdad 's slums and the Shiite south .

His Mehdi Army has been considered one of Iraq 's most formidable private armies following the fall of Saddam Hussein . It was blamed for some of the worst sectarian violence in Iraq before al-Sadr suspended most of its activities in 2007 and 2008 , which dramatically reduced violence in Iraq .

In 2008 , al-Sadr announced that most of the militia members would be transitioned into a socio-cultural organization to oppose secularism and Western thought .

A small group of hand-picked fighters called the Promised Day Brigade would continue to target the coalition , the U.S. military has said .

Al-Sadr has ratcheted his anti-American rhetoric up in recent months , raising concerns about an increase in violence as Iraq weighs whether to request that some of the 47,000 troops in Iraq stay beyond a January 1 , 2012 , deadline agreed upon between the two countries .

An increase in attacks in recent months against American troops has been blamed on Shiite militias , including the Promised Day Brigade . The U.S. military says the militia is using the bombings to try to take credit for driving forces out of the country .

The U.S. military maintains that the Promised Day Brigade and other Shiite militias are backed by Iran , a charge Tehran has long denied .

The cleric , who recently returned to Iraq from three years of self-imposed exile , has transformed himself from the leader of the Mehdi Army to a political player . His political bloc has now joined forces with a former rival , al-Maliki .

The al-Sadr movement emerged as one of the kingmakers in Iraqi politics last year when it won 39 parliamentary seats . The bloc 's support played a major role in al-Maliki getting his second term in office .
