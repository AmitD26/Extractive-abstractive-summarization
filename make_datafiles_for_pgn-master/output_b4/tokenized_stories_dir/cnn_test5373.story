-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Campaign 2014 is in full swing with primary voting , and incumbents and challengers busy raising money .

Now the first task for every federal candidate in this midterm election year will be to read the Supreme Court 's ruling on campaign finance for a reality check .

The 40-page decision handed down on Wednesday promises to continue a transformation over how donations and spending on elections are conducted .

The court 's 5-4 ruling threw out congressionally mandated limits on the total one can give to all federal candidates in an election cycle .

The practical effect : it would allow well-heeled donors to spread the wealth to give to more candidates and political groups .

But current limits on giving to an individual candidate -- $ 5,200 -- remain in place and were never at issue before the justices .

There is disagreement on how much of an impact this narrow decision will have in money terms as billions of dollars fuel today 's campaign process overall .

But the larger implications could be huge , played out for years to come in a variety of continuing challenges to current restrictions .

`` Every time this current Supreme Court has confronted a campaign finance restriction , it 's struck it down , '' said Thomas Goldstein , publisher of SCOTUSblog.com . `` It has been on a slow but steady march towards deregulation , towards saying that restrictions on your spending money -- say , in expenditures or in contributions to candidates -- that is a free speech right . ''

Breyer 's lament

Justice Stephen Breyer sounded forlorn Wednesday , lamenting in sad tones the effect of the Supreme Court ruling .

Speaking from the bench , Breyer -- supported by his three more liberal colleagues -- criticized the conservative majority for ignoring a century of efforts to blunt political corruption -- or its appearance .

`` The threat to that integrity posed by the risk of special access and influence remains real , '' he said .

The ruling `` eviscerates our nation 's campaign finance laws , leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intend to resolve , '' he added .

But Chief Justice John Roberts , in his majority opinion , acknowledged what many a smart election lawyer knows :

`` Because individuals ' direct contributions are limited , would-be donors may turn to other avenues for political speech '' than direct contributions to office-seekers , said Roberts . `` Individuals can , for example , contribute unlimited amounts to 501 -LRB- c -RRB- organizations , which are not required to publicly disclose their donors . Such organizations spent some $ 300 million on independent expenditures in the 2012 election cycle . ''

Roberts emphasized the free-speech rights of donors and downplayed the concerns the ruling would further erode public confidence in the political system .

`` The government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse , '' he said .

The man behind the ruling

Shaun McCutcheon is an electrical engineer by trade , but grassroots politics may be his true passion .

The Alabama native has worked for years with his local Republican Party in Birmingham , and is chairman of Conservative Action Fund , a so-called `` super PAC '' that `` promotes conservative Republicans ' time-proven messages and effective solutions . ''

His success in business and a willingness to put his money into GOP coffers set him at the center of the politically tricky Supreme Court fight . He equates his donations to `` core political speech . ''

McCutcheon says he has a constitutional right to donate more than that amount to as many office seekers as he wants , so long as no one candidate gets more than the $ 2,600 per election limit .

He supports those individual controls , but `` what does n't make any sense is that you can only give that amount of money to a few candidates , because somehow my giving money to -LRB- U.S. Rep. -RRB- Martha Roby of Alabama could corrupt -LRB- former Rep. -RRB- Allen West of Florida , '' he told CNN .

`` That 's just nutty , but that 's what the powers-that-be want : to prevent folks who want to get involved from having the same ability to get involved and support candidates that big union PACs have , '' he said .

But backers of continued congressional regulation do not see it that way .

`` The reason we have limitations on the dollars an individual can give is to create some sense of fairness , so that if we do have a campaign finance system driven by donations , we have as many opportunities for as many people as possible to participate , '' said Robert Zimmerman , a prominent Democratic fundraiser .

`` That 's why there are limitations , so that everyone has an equal or fair voice in the process . Not only are our elections being put up for auction , these donors are making an investment in the democratic system for their own agenda and we taxpayers have to foot the bill , '' he said .

Fundamental debate

The competing arguments are stark : supporters of campaign finance reform say current federal regulations are designed to prevent corruption in politics . Opponents said it would criminalize free speech and association .

The current case deals with direct political contributions . But it continues a trend that culminated in the separate `` Citizens United '' high court ruling from 2010 , easing long-standing restrictions on `` independent spending '' by corporations , labor unions , and certain non-profit advocacy groups in political campaigns .

Its impact put corporations on the same free-speech footing as wealthy individuals , who have long enjoyed the ability to spend freely and independently on behalf of federal candidates .

That and a subsequent decision from a federal appeals court in Washington have led to a proliferation of so-called `` super PACs '' -- separate political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of cash from businesses , unions , and advocacy groups .

These super PACs are independent political organizations operating as `` 527s , '' named after the tax code governing their operation . They can not contribute directly to a federal candidate or political party .

Limits on direct contributions to candidates by corporations and individuals remain in place , the focus in part of the current McCutcheon appeal .

Some political experts say a ruling in favor of increased , or even unlimited , aggregate individual donor contributions could put party committees and political action committees on a greater competitive track with the `` super PACs . ''

All PACs are organizations that campaign either for or against candidates , legislation , or ballot measures . The difference is in how they are organized for regulatory and tax purposes , and by the amounts of money they are allowed to spend .

Regular PACs may also give limited donations to federal candidates and political parties , while super PACs can not .

With a resounding win at the high court , wealthy donors like McCutcheon -- whether Democrat , Republican , or Independent -- could in theory contribute a maximum $ 3.6 million to the national and state parties , and the 450 or so Senate and House candidates expected to run in 2014 .

Key for the conservative majority court was rejecting claims by the law 's supporters that it had a permissible goal of preventing political corruption or the appearance of it .

Another point of contention is whether the aggregate spending limits are really having a pervasive effect , or only involve a relative few well-heeled givers .

Figures from the Center for Responsive Politics for the 2012 race showed about 600 donors leveraged their money to each give the maximum of about $ 48,000 total -- benefitting no more than 17 presidential or congressional candidates .

Almost 1,700 contributors forked over the maximum limit to party committees , which added up to more than $ 100 million . Loosening those limits , say opponents of the law , would benefit wealthy liberals and conservatives equally .

Lax enforcement

But the Supreme Court has never in its history overturned a federal contribution limit .

And critics accuse regulators of having a generally lax enforcement stance , particularly for independent advocacy groups .

The FEC will now be tasked with taking this high court opinion and crafting new rules to ease limits on aggregate spending .

Unlike in `` Citizens United , '' the big winners may be harder to discern . Certainly individual donors seeking to expand their election portfolio have more choices . But as Roberts noted , other big-move avenues exist to funnel money to outside groups willing to spend freely .

And political parties certainly will have more money to spend . That worries many supporters of more regulation .

`` The court opens another loophole by allowing our political parties to be further corrupted by big-money contributions from special interests , '' said Elisabeth MacNamara , president of the League of Women Voters of the U.S. `` The party and PAC systems now become a huge funnel for corrupting elected officials across the country . ''

But McCutcheon argues that characterizing the legal fight as between `` good '' and `` bad '' simply blurs the truth .

`` Getting rid of the aggregate limits is not about corrupting democracy -- it is about practicing democracy , '' he said . `` This case is about freedom -- your freedom and my freedom -- to express ourselves openly and fully within our political system . And if there is one thing that we Americans believe with all our hearts , it is that freedom never corrupts . ''

The case is McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission -LRB- 12-536 -RRB- .
