-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a pod-like structure a bit larger than a photo booth , and a Vermont company is hoping it will make life a little easier for nursing mothers who are away from home .

The modular lactation station allows a mother to breast-feed her baby or use a breast pump in a private spot designed with her in mind , with Corian surfaces , soft lighting , a fold-down table and even a power supply for a pumping machine .

The first one was unveiled Thursday at Burlington International Airport in Vermont and the company behind it , Burlington-based Mamava , is hoping many more will follow .

`` We definitely see it for any public space where a mom might need some privacy or might want to use a breast pump , '' company co-founder Sascha Mayer said .

Nursing mothers know well the challenges of trying to feed their babies while away from home . Discreet nursing covers or shawls allow a degree of privacy when breast-feeding in public , though some mothers who are still shy about it may do it in a corner or even in a bathroom stall .

Mothers who must pump their milk have an even tougher time finding a place to do it in public . A bathroom stall is often the only option , but it 's less than desirable -- imagine sitting on a public toilet while balancing a pump -LRB- or baby -RRB- , listening to the sound of flushing toilets all around and knowing other women can hear the kshhh-kshhh of the pump every few seconds .

Those realities became clear to Mayer after the birth of her daughter seven years ago , when she had to travel for work . She had to find ways of pumping while at trade shows , airports , corporate retreats , baseball games and rafting trips , so she began thinking of a product that would make things easier for other mothers facing the same challenges .

`` We wanted it to be comfortable , '' she said , but at the same time , `` we 're not about hiding moms away . We 're about giving them an alternative to pumping in public , and an alternative to using a bathroom . ''

They started working with designers and developed the first prototype earlier this year . The director of Burlington 's airport , Gene Richards , liked the idea and the free-standing pod is now installed in the second floor of the terminal , airside , after the security checkpoints .

`` Breast-feeding is welcome anywhere at the airport , but the Mamava unit will provide a comfortable place for nursing mothers who might want more privacy -LRB- or for babies who might need fewer distractions -RRB- , '' the company said .

There is no fee to use the lactation station . A lock on the door turns red when it 's occupied .

Mamava hopes to put pods in other airports or public places like conference centers and malls , Mayer says . They 're also working on a foldable design that could be used in small workplaces and then put away when not in use .

`` What 's been really , really fun for us is the cultural challenge , '' Mayer said .

As the public becomes more aware of the benefits of breast-feeding , she said she hopes they also become aware of the logistics of it .

Mayer said she does n't want women to choose against breast-feeding just because it 's too difficult .

`` We really just want to make it a legitimate choice for women , because really in a lot of cases it just is n't , '' Mayer said . `` There are so many challenges , so why not make it as positive and optimistic and comforting as possible ? ''
