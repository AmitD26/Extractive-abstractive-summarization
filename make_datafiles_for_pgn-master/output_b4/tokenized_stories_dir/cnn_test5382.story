-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If you 've packed your warmest hat and coziest jacket for the Winter Olympics , it would be a bit disconcerting to look out your hotel window and see a palm tree , swaying in a gentle spring-like breeze .

That , however , is exactly what many patrons of the Sochi Winter Games are experiencing .

Most people think of Russia in winter and picture the snow-covered cathedrals of Moscow , where average temperatures in February range between minus 10 Celsius -LRB- 14 Fahrenheit -RRB- and minus 4 C -LRB- 24.8 F -RRB- and all but require the wearing of those iconic fur hats .

Sochi , however , is one of the southernmost cities in Russia .

It 's located over 1,000 km south of Moscow and has a completely different climate . Indeed , on most winter days , Sochi -LRB- and the nearby town of Adler , where many of the events are being held -RRB- are the warmest locations in the country .

This was the case on Monday , when Sochi reached a balmy 15.9 C -LRB- 61 F -RRB- -- warmer than any other Russian city by more than 1 C.

Compare that to the coldest location in Russia -- Siberia 's Jikimda , which hit -50 C -LRB- -58 F -RRB- .

The International Olympic Committee can not say Sochi 's temperatures this month come as a surprise , as the city has the warmest climate of any Winter Games host city .

In February , temperatures range between 3 C -LRB- 37 F -RRB- and 10 C -LRB- 50 F -RRB- on average , but as we are seeing they can climb even higher .

These numbers mean that it edges out the previous warmest location . Vancouver , Canada , host of the Games in 2010 , averages highs of about 8 C -LRB- 46 F -RRB- and lows around 1 C -LRB- 34 F -RRB- .

Like Vancouver , Sochi is a coastal town and has a much warmer climate than the surrounding areas , including the `` Mountain Cluster '' venues where the skiing , snowboarding , and sliding events -- bobsled , skeleton and luge -- are taking place .

These mountain peaks rise over 2,300 meters , and since air temperatures generally cool with height , it means these venues stay 5 - 10 C -LRB- 41 F - 50 F -RRB- degrees cooler .

Even with this mitigating factor , the full sun and above-average temperatures this week have led to less than ideal conditions for skiing .

Ultimately , however , between the snow-making machines and the millions of pounds -LRB- kilos -RRB- of snow that were saved from last winter , Sochi will avoid snowless ski and snowboard events .

And since the events held in Sochi and Adler -- the `` Coastal Cluster '' -- are all indoors , they could be theoretically be held in Dubai in July and it would n't make much of a difference -- but let 's not give the IOC any ideas !

But those who prefer their Winter Olympics to be held in places that actually feel like winter , and require the wearing of hats and jackets , can look forward to the 2018 games in Pyeongchang , South Korea , where daytime highs rarely go above 0 C -LRB- 32 F -RRB- and night-time lows average -11 C -LRB- 12 F -RRB- .

Sochi is the warmest Winter Games location

February average temperatures range between 3 ˚C -LRB- 37 ˚F -RRB- and 10 ˚C -LRB- 50 ˚F -RRB-

However , `` mountain cluster '' venues significantly colder due to altitude

Snow-making machines and last year 's snow means slopes will remain covered
