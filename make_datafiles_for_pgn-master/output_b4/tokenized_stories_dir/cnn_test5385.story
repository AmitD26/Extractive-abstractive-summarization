-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Scientists examining the 7,000-year-old remains of a hunter-gatherer found in Spain have discovered that African versions of pigmentation genes determined his skin color , but that he had blue eyes now associated with northern Europeans .

Baptized `` La Brana 1 '' by scientists -- after the La Brana-Arintero site where his remains were found -- the man lived during the Mesolithic period , which lasted from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago .

The Mesolithic hunter-gather period was followed by the Neolithic period and the advent of farming . As a result , La Brana 1 's diet differed from Neolithic man , and researchers said he had been lactose intolerant .

`` The biggest surprise was to discover that this individual possessed African versions in the genes that determine the light pigmentation of the current Europeans , which indicates that he had dark skin , although we can not know the exact shade , '' researcher Carles Lalueza-Fox from the Spanish National Research Council -LRB- CSIC -RRB- said .

`` Even more surprising was to find that he possessed the genetic variations that produce blue eyes in current Europeans , resulting in a unique phenotype in a genome that is otherwise clearly northern European . ''

A genome is the full map of an individual 's DNA .

La Brana 1 's closest modern descendants , in genetic terms , live in northern Europe in places like Sweden and Finland .

The research -- carried out by the CSIC in partnership with Denmark 's Centre for GeoGenetics -- has been published in the scientific journal `` Nature . ''

Manuel Vidal Encinas , archaeologist of the Council of Castilla y Leon , found and excavated the La Brana-Arintero site , near Leon , in 2006 .

Scientists said the cave is located in a cold mountainous area with a steady temperature -- conditions that contributed to the `` exceptional '' preservation of the DNA of La Brana 1 and the remains of another individual found there .

Researchers say they will now try to recover the genome of the second set of remains , which were not as well preserved .
