Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Another month , another weak jobs report . And do n't expect Congress to do much about it anytime soon .

With unemployment stuck above 8 % , congressional Democrats and Republicans blasted each other Friday for blocking legislation that would help create new jobs and spark stronger economic growth . Both parties have a number of proposals on the table , but with the campaign now in full swing neither side expects anything to pass before Election Day .

`` The president needs to stop betting on his failed policies and start working with Republicans to remove government obstacles to job creation , '' said House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio . `` We 've passed more than 30 jobs bills -- he should call on Senate Democrats to stop stalling them . ''

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , ripped the Republicans for deciding `` they would rather focus their energy on political grandstanding and empty , partisan exercises that will not create a single job . ''

Who 's right ? It depends on your point of view .

Congress is not completely incapable of action . In April , for example , legislators passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups -- or JOBS -- Act , which provides small businesses in need of capital with a range of options that were previously out of reach . The provisions are aimed primarily at helping fast-growing operations like biotech and tech companies .

Last week , Congress cleared a $ 105 billion bill funding transportation projects for two years and preventing a doubling of the student loan rate . But most analysts believe growing campaign pressure and Capitol Hill 's cavernous ideological divide will combine to make further legislative progress nearly impossible .

Next week , the GOP-controlled House will likely pass -- for a second time -- a bill repealing Obamacare , the president 's controversial health care overhaul . Republicans know the measure is dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate , but they 're trying to score political points by keeping the issue front and center in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling upholding the law .

Boehner has also promised votes later this month on a Republican tax reform measure and a bill to , in the speaker 's words , `` curtail excessive government regulations . ''

Reid , meanwhile , is promising a vote next week on small business tax cut measure `` designed to reward hiring and provide incentives for payroll growth . '' The bill , sponsored by Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey , would offer substantial writeoffs for new equipment purchases while also extending new tax credits for payroll expansions .

For their part , Obama and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney both have a number of proposals on the table . Obama rolled out a $ 447 billion job growth plan last September , but the blueprint was never approved by either chamber . Democrats then broke the measure up into a number smaller parts -- including the JOBS Act . The strategy met with mixed results and now appears to have stalled .

Romney 's plan includes a 20 % cut in marginal tax rates , a repeal of both the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax , and a cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 % to 25 % , among other things . He 'd also repeal the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform bill and give a green light to complete construction of the Keystone XL pipeline , a project that splits Democratic labor and environmental groups , and has been put on hold by Obama .

The bottom line as far as Congress is concerned , however , is that Obama embraces traditional Democratic stimulus ideas like expanding the public sector workforce , spending more on infrastructure , and pushing targeted tax cuts aimed primarily at middle and lower income families . Romney and his congressional allies hew to a more traditional Republican agenda of sweeping tax reduction and slashing federal red tape for domestic energy producers and others .

Do n't expect a divided Congress to give either side a win -- especially before voters go to the polls on November 6 .
