Kano , Nigeria -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least 15 people were killed Tuesday in a suicide blast in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri , the capital of Borno state , which has been bedeviled by the deadly Boko Haram insurgency , a witness and a paramedic said .

The explosion occurred when a homemade bomb , concealed in a van loaded with charcoal , went off at an ever-busy traffic circle outside the city 's main market , according to a Twitter account by the Nigerian Defense Ministry .

Witnesses said the blast happened at about 8:00 a.m. , when traffic was beginning to build at the roundabout , causing a major fire that engulfed vehicles and shops lining the streets .

Local vigilantes called Civilian JTF , after the special military unit battling Boko Haram , evacuated the victims of the morning blast to the State Specialist Hospital in the city .

`` We have so far taken 15 dead bodies to the hospital from the blast scene , most of them women and boys , '' said a local vigilante Adam Kolo .

A journalist who was at the hospital confirmed seeing 15 bodies brought in by the rescue team .

A `` rescue operation is still ongoing , which means the toll may change . We have also evacuated several people with injuries from the explosion , '' Kolo said .

`` I saw several people lying lifeless on the street with six cars and three motorized rickshaws burning , '' said resident Ibrahim Mustapha .

Most of the victims were elderly women selling peanuts and kola nuts by the roadside and poor boys , Kolo said .

It is a custom in Maiduguri for residents to buy peanuts every morning and give them out as alms to poor boys begging on the streets .

The women vendors come out early in the morning and line the streets with their wares , waiting for residents leaving for work , while the child beggars mill around waiting for a generous buyer , Mustapha said .

Restive mobs besieged the area around the blast scene , barring reporters from taking photos of the carnage , and manhandled a photographer who wanted to take shots .

The mobs attacked and slightly injured four firefighters trying to quench the inferno at the scene , accusing them of not deploying fast enough to battle the fire .

`` The youth were quite agitated and prevented us from taking photos of the scene and even descended on the firemen working to douse the fire , '' one of the reporters at the scene said .

Maiduguri has witnessed relative calm since last year , when local vigilantes sprang up and chased out Boko Haram insurgents into the bush , ending near-daily deadly bombing and shooting attacks .

The city has however witnessed isolated bombings and deadly attacks blamed on Boko Haram .
