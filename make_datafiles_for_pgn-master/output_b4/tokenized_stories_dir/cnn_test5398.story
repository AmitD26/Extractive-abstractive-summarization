-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There 's nothing broken about being the fourth-most valuable company in the world , which is exactly what Microsoft is today . That same company , however , is valued at half what it was 10 years ago . It 's not exactly thriving , either .

Regardless if the glass is actually half empty or half full , consumer confidence in Microsoft is at a low . It is ignored or considered uncool by younger generations . Older generations are often required to use the company 's software at work , but turn to Apple or Google devices in their free time .

A month from now Microsoft will release Windows 8 , a bold new operating system that seeks to bring touchscreen interfaces to desktop computing . It 's the company 's biggest product since Windows XP and yet the only thing the tech world has seemingly talked about over the last 12 months is what the iPhone 5 might look like .

In that sense , Microsoft is broken .

Sure , the company that Bill Gates built has had a few bona fide hits over the last decade , most notably from its gaming division : Xbox Live , which is sort of the nighttime Facebook for gamers , and Kinect , a hands-free game controller that caught fire for a year before fizzling somewhat . Bing , Microsoft 's search engine , also is gaining traction in the market .

But when it comes to mobile devices -- the biggest area of growth in consumer tech -- Microsoft still lags behind its rivals .

How Apple 's story is like ` Breaking Bad '

So how can the company right the ship ? According to some of its biggest critics , here are eight ways Microsoft can reinvent itself , return to relevancy and dominate the tech world once more instead of just following it .

1 . Make fewer things extremely well . Microsoft has been accused of many things . Being too focused is n't one of them . `` They spread themselves too thin across too many product lines , '' says blogger Mary Jo Foley , a longtime observer of the company . `` They let broken products hang on for far too long , '' resulting in mediocre stuff that few people care about , she says . The good news : `` They 're getting better at this , '' Foley says .

2 . Move all their software to the Web . Microsoft is in a bit of a pickle . Consumers want to manage , view and manipulate their files from any device connected to the Internet -LRB- aka cloud computing -RRB- . But Microsoft still makes most of its money from locally installed software , so it has been very reluctant to offer its wares online at a discount -LRB- if not for free like Google -RRB- .

Keep it up , though , and Microsoft will be a goner , says Joe Wilcox , editor of Beta News . `` On phones and tablets , Microsoft 's presence is insignificant or too low to quantify . If the so-called post-PC era is about cloud-connected devices , Microsoft operating systems have no meaningful presence . ''

3 . De-emphasize the desktop . Microsoft has made a fortune selling desktop operating systems . While the desktop will certainly remain an important computing tool for the foreseeable future , it 's no longer the primary tool . It 's really just one of many available portals now .

`` Who cares about a desktop ? '' says my twenty-something brother-in-law . So long as a device is portable and lets him access the Internet , he does n't care who makes it or what it looks like . So , in addition to moving all its products online , Microsoft should make those products available on any device , independent of the operating system , like Google does across Macintosh , Android , iPhones , Windows and even their new Google Chrome OS . In other words , it 's all about the apps , regardless of how you access them .

4 . Lead instead of follow . Whether fair or not , the perception exists that Microsoft largely follows what Apple and Google do rather than making its own waves -LRB- think delayed Zunes , Bings , Windows Phones , Surface tablets and retail stores -RRB- . Heck , even Kinect was a reaction to Nintendo 's Wii . To really excite consumers , it would do well to try zigging while others zag .

`` Even if Microsoft fails to be as successful during the cloud-connected device era as the PC , its efforts -LRB- good or bad -RRB- should pressure Apple , Amazon , Google and others do to better , '' says Wilcox .

5 . Serve only one master . The last thing Microsoft needs right now is to further reduce its already dwindling market share . Yet that 's what the upcoming Windows 8 might do as it tries to serve both touch users and traditional keyboard and mouse ones .

`` I fear Windows 8 is too focused on touch-friendly computing , '' says Tim Stevens , editor of Engadget . Foley agrees : `` I think Microsoft may be too far ahead of its users in its decision to de-emphasize the old and familiar Windows for a touch-centric one . ''

It 's OK to offer both touch and traditional software , as Apple does . But it works best when you keep 'em separated -LRB- as Apple has done with Mac and iOS -RRB- .

6 . Be `` cool '' in its own way . As dominant as Microsoft was in the '90s , its products were never a status symbol like Apple 's are today . That 's a fact . At the same time , there are varying degrees of coolness ; you do n't have to be hip so long as you 're confident and unapologetic about who you are . The sooner Microsoft realizes this , the better it will embrace its potential as a respected and reliable maker of computing again , rather than just something the establishment makes you use .

What 's more , Microsoft is now in the ironic position to brand itself as David to Apple 's Goliath , the counterculture to Apple 's mainstream . You know , turn the tables on the very upstart company that used to `` think different , '' but that now suffers from groupthink because its products are so widely used .

7 . Do n't do what IBM did . IBM used to be a household name in computing . After it stopped selling to consumers , it found success in targeting big business . But it is less relevant and smaller than it used to be . This will also remain true of Microsoft if it fails to embrace the cloud-connected devices that are replacing PCs . `` If Microsoft retreats to the enterprise and cedes the consumer market , like IBM , they 'll lose their relevance , '' says Wilcox .

8 . Be the developer 's favorite again . Microsoft Windows did n't become a juggernaut by being a better experience than Macintosh . It became a juggernaut because it offered third-party developers more money , which in turn resulted in more programs , which in turn brought in more users . Not any more .

`` The roles are reversed , '' says Wilcox . `` Where are the most exciting apps today ? Not Windows . They are on Android and iOS . '' If Microsoft wants to dominate once more , it will need to entice more developer support to ensnare more consumers .

As for the company 's chances , insider opinion ranges from OK to great . `` I think it has enough cash reserves to swing and miss a few times and still come out looking good , '' says Stevens . `` But I do n't know if it will ever regain the top spot . ''

Foley shares his skepticism . `` I 'm not sure they can ever be a consumer powerhouse , '' she says . `` Do three rights undo 10 years of wrongs ? I do n't know . ''

Wilcox , on the other hand , says he 's seen other decimated companies regain their luster -- most notably Microsoft 's longtime rival from Cupertino . `` If Apple can rise from near ruin in 15 years to become the world 's largest company , surely Microsoft can . ''
