Slovyansk , Ukraine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We were on a rough track surrounded by fields of wheat and barley when the little blue Lada came into sight . The car lurched towards us , kicking up a trail of white dust . Both vehicles stopped . Within 20 miles of Slovyansk , drivers routinely quiz each other for information on the road ahead -- the risks and roadblocks .

And then the car , barely the size of a Mini and at least 20 years old , disgorged its occupants : no fewer than eight people , three generations of the Goma family .

They had fled the shelling in Slovyansk , a city in eastern Ukraine held for two months by pro-Russian separatists and now under persistent shelling and mortar fire from Ukrainian forces . But after a week sleeping in tents in a forest , battered by thunderstorms , they just wanted to go home -- to a city without electricity , gas or running water .

We followed them along rutted tracks and lanes on a twisting route into the city , probably the only way in or out . The Ukrainian army has blocked the main roads around Slovyansk , although President Petro Poroshenko has promised to create ` green corridors ' to help civilians escape the fighting . Waved through a couple of separatist checkpoints , they finally made it .

Compared to a month ago , Slovyansk seemed half-empty , the city 's remaining residents looking drawn and frightened .

The thud of artillery and chatter of gunfire echoed around apartment blocks . Jagged shards of glass lay everywhere , the remnants of windows blown out by mortar fire or shells . The roof of a gas station hung precariously , twisted by what appeared to have been a direct hit . There were a few charred vehicles , some small craters .

` No electricity , no water '

When the Gomas arrived at a rundown apartment block , the neighbors were surprised to see them back . Who would return to this ? They asked . But Tatiana Goma was just relieved her home was still there .

`` Of course I 'm worried to be here but home is home . There is no electricity and no water but at least it 's better than living in tents in the woods , '' she told us after unpacking her few belongings .

`` We had nowhere to stay , '' Tatiana said -- and people elsewhere were reluctant or unable to provide shelter . She knew of only four friends who had left . They had gone to Kharkiv , a city to the north , but had not been welcome .

Katya Goma said she was giving tranquilizers to her children -- age ten and two -- to calm them down . But they were already beginning to recognize the difference between various weapons .

An old man wandered past . Was there any water here ? He asked . There was n't . Try the fountains , someone suggested . Others said they were using buckets to collect water from lakes on the outskirts of town .

Pro-Russian separatists , in various uniforms but all armed , wandered the deserted squares or careered through the streets on scooters , assault weapons slung over their shoulders , weaving past downed power cables . But there were fewer of them than before . Most , it seemed , were on the outskirts of town in defensive positions .

The office of the self-declared mayor , Vyacheslav Ponomarev , had lost its revolutionary brio . In fact Ponomarev was nowhere to be found .

A statement attributed to the military commander of the separatists in the Donetsk People 's republic , Igor Strelkov , and carried by the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS said : `` The so-called people 's mayor Ponomarev was removed from office for activities which are incompatible with the objectives of the civil administration . ''

Call for negotiations

Following the killing of an aide to Denis Pushilin , the self-declared mayor of Donetsk , in the city at the weekend , there is growing speculation here of dissent among the separatists ' ranks -- though its leadership accused Kiev of being behind the murder .

Alexei , a man in his fifties got off his bicycle to talk to us . This had gone on too long , he said . `` They need to negotiate , they should somehow settle this . Or the Ukrainian government should say : ` That 's it . We 're bombing . Run away . ' ''

The support among some townspeople for the separatist groups that seized the town 's administrative and security buildings early in April seemed to have given way to a weariness , a yearning for an end to the uncertainty and the constant threat of bombardment .

No-one could be sure who had fired the mortar that had wrecked an apartment building and sprayed the wall of a school with shrapnel . Maybe it was poor targeting by separatists who had been using the cover of a church to fire at Ukrainian positions -- or equally poor targeting by the army .

Those who have basements spend much of the evening sheltering ; they said the worst of the fire comes after 8 pm .

Others have no basement to flee into . One man said that when the bombing started he and his family would hide in the corridor of their house , away from the windows , for hours on end . They could n't go into the kitchen or bathroom .

Thunder , rocket fire

As we reached the bus station , a furious summer thunderstorm erupted . The potholes quickly filled with brown water , the thunder cracked -- or was that another round of rocket fire from somewhere ?

Galina Sergeyeva , a middle-aged woman with a look of resignation on her face was taking shelter , hoping against hope that she would be able to get home . She had nothing good to say about Poroshenko .

`` We call him bloody Petro , '' she said . `` A lot of people have died but no-one is talking about it . They should pull the army back , '' she said .

Katya , an elderly woman in a flowing blue dress and clutching two shopping bags sat on a bench nearby . She had braved the journey from a nearby village to Slovyansk to collect her pension . But the bank , she told us , had been destroyed . Now she had to get home . Suddenly , a puppy emerged from one of her shopping bags . She had found it and was taking it home .

As the downpour continued , the patter of rain occasionally interrupted by bursts of machine gun fire in the distance , she gave the puppy some milk -- before traipsing away across the puddles in search of a ride home .

We found her at a roadblock an hour later , standing among bronzed separatists whose position was overlooked by Ukrainian heavy armor . The puppy was at her feet .

We made room for the pair of them and dropped them off at her home in a village just a few miles from Slovyansk -- a picture of rural tranquility compared to the beleaguered city .
