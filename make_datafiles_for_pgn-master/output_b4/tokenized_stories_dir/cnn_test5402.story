-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It would take you almost five solid months -- without sleeping or bathroom breaks -- to watch every sporting event at this year 's Summer Olympics . More than 3,500 hours of competition from London will be crammed into just 17 days .

In the past , people had to settle for watching the delayed , edited bits broadcast on TV or websites , but technology and viewing habits have changed . This year , 40 % of people plan to follow the games on more than one device , with 35 % checking in on their tablets and 27 % using their smartphone , according to a new study by Harris Interactive .

Fans asked to tweet from Olympics only if it 's ` urgent '

So what are the best ways for today 's mobile , multiple-screen owning , Twitter-loving generation to follow the Olympics Ã la carte ? We offer these five :

Live streaming , with a catch

First , the good news : It 's finally possible to stream any Olympic event live online , on a tablet or from your smartphone . After years of tape-delayed broadcasts and online video , NBC has caught on that viewers want to follow the Olympics on multiple devices in real time , and is offering the live options in addition to its regular television programming .

The bad news is that anyone in the U.S. who wants to enjoy live streaming of the games needs to have a current cable , satellite or telco TV subscription that includes MSNBC and CNBC -LRB- for some areas this may mean be more than just basic cable -RRB- . You will be prompted on the NBC site and in NBC apps to choose your provider from a list and log in with your official username and password in order to access any live streams .

Cord cutters -- those who have canceled their cable and primarily watch TV online through services like Hulu and Netflix -- are out of luck , however . They can sign up for cable and cancel after the games are over , but there 's no one-time payment option just to access live streaming . NBC wants mobile and online options to complement the TV coverage , not replace it .

NBC , which is owned by the largest cable provider in the United States , Comcast , paid $ 1.18 billion for the rights to this year 's Olympics . The network makes a good portion of that amount back on television advertising , which still generates more revenue than online ads .

Online

The Internet portal for all video in the U.S. is NBCOlympics.com . On the main video page , anyone can view the select clips that NBC posts after watching a short ad . These clips are a combination of highlights from events , interviews , profiles , and peeks behind the scenes . Sort by your sport of choice or type of video .

How to avoid Olympics spoilers

The site is also providing live streams of any sport to cable , satellite or telco TV subscribers . Called LiveExtra , the service will live stream some Olympic trials and every single Olympic sport . You can watch online or through the complimentary app . It 's the only option for live streaming in the U.S.

Though hosted through YouTube , all of the videos on the NBCOlympics are in Flash . To view them on iPhones , iPads or other mobile devices , go to the mobile version of the site , m.nbcolympics.com . You can also download one of the official apps to watch official NBC Olympic video on your iOS or Android device .

For the first time , the International Olympic Committee -LRB- IOC -RRB- will live stream 11 high-definition channels simultaneously over YouTube for 64 territories in Asia and Africa that do n't have broadcast deals , but those streams will not be accessible outside of those countries . Foreign news websites such as the BBC will also have videos , but again , most will be blocked for U.S. viewers .

Mobile apps

NBC created two official apps for Android and Apple mobile devices , NBC Olympics and NBC Olympics Live Extra , and both are free to download . NBC Olympics has no live video , but tons of content that can be enjoyed by anyone for free , including news , results , video highlights , and the intriguing-sounding Twitter heat map .

NBC Olympics Live Extra app is a mobile version of its LiveExtra online service and requires a cable , satellite or telco subscription . View any event live , watch replays of the ones you missed , and check out medal ceremonies and alternative camera views . Look over the in-app schedule and set up notifications for the events you do n't want to miss . -LRB- Avid streamers should be careful not to go over their monthly data limits . -RRB-

There are two official apps for the London 2012 Olympics , and they 're available for a mix of platforms including iOS , Android , BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7 . Official London 2012 : Results App has live updates of results , as well as schedules , news , background on sports and athlete profiles . You can follow specific countries and set up custom alerts . The second app , Official London 2012 : Join In App , is more for people attending the games , and has schedules and locations for the various Olympic-related festivities going on in London .

The free BBC Olympic iOS and Android app will have a steady stream of quality Olympics news , including a running tally of medals won and live reporting from the BBC journalists attending events .

Social media and news

Perhaps you have no interest in seeing your favorite diver 's perfectly executed reverse 3 1/2 somersault tuck . You just want to know who got the gold as soon as it happens . Individual sports have official , automated Twitter feeds that will tweet out the results as they happen . You can narrow it down to just the events you 're interested in and follow those feeds -LRB- say @L2012Trampoline or @L2012Judo -RRB- , or keep an eye on all of them at once by following the London 2012 official Twitter list of automated feeds . The official London 2012 feed is @London2012 .

Twitter takes the Olympic gold for speed

This year a lot of the fun will be following the athletes themselves . You can look up your favorites or follow this list of verified Olympic athlete Twitter accounts , the London 2012 list of Olympians or find a list just for your preferred sport of team , like Team USA .

If you want more color , find a hashtag for the event you 're interested in to get live tweets of the excitement as it happens from attendees and journalists . There 's also an official London 2012 Facebook page you can like to get updates .

And of course , there are old-fashioned news sites and blogs filled with words and pictures . There are 21,000 journalists in London covering the Olympics -LRB- outnumbering the 10,500 athletes competing -RRB- .

With all the content online , on TV and on social media , keeping up with the Olympics wo n't be nearly as much of a challenge as avoiding spoilers .

Television

Oh right , there 's TV , too . If you have cable , you can catch NBC 's coverage scattered across a number of its channels : NBC , NBC Sports Network , MSNBC , CNBC , Bravo and Telemundo . Check the schedule for your location , sorted by time or sport , at the NBC Olympics site .

If you do n't have cable , you can still tune into NBC over the air for nearly round-the-clock coverage , including the four-hour prime-time broadcast that will show the most popular events mixed in with the usual profiles and athlete interviews . The channel will broadcast a total of 217 hours of Olympic coverage .
