Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Vice President Joe Biden and Republican vice presidential contender Paul Ryan plowed fertile ground in terms of policy and politics during their debate -- now the question is whether the presidential candidates can reap what was sown .

Biden aggressively pressed Ryan on Thursday to defend his ticket 's positions on everything from Medicare to trimming the nation 's debt to the way forward in dealing with Iran .

Biden tried to frame the election as a choice between different directions for the country by contending policies of the Mitt Romney-Ryan ticket would hurt the middle class and move the nation backward on social issues , like gay rights and abortion .

In doing so , Biden helped set up President Barack Obama to further those arguments during the second presidential debate on Tuesday in New York , political experts say .

For his part , Ryan was equally hard-charging and vigorously put forth the ticket 's domestic and foreign policy proposals in exchanges that were at times sharp and pointed .

Ryan repeatedly sought to focus the debate on the Obama-Biden record of the last four years , arguing the administration 's policies hindered economic recovery and weakened the nation 's standing and influence in the world .

Romney is now well-primed to drive that message home .

A CNN-ORC International poll released after the debate suggested voters who watched narrowly favored Ryan over Biden by 48 % -44 % , a statistically even result . That followed an overwhelming Romney victory in their first of three debates .

`` I think they both accomplished the kinds of things they wanted to accomplish , '' said John Geer , chairman of Vanderbilt University 's political science department .

Political analysts say Biden also helped re-energize Democrats , whose spirits might have flagged after Obama 's lackluster performance in last week 's debate .

`` The most important job Biden did for Obama is reawakening the depressed Democratic base , '' said Larry Sabato , director of the University of Virginia 's Center for Politics . `` Biden has primed them for a better performance from Obama . ''

What Biden failed to do , some political analysts say , is make the case that Obama deserves another four years . That 's up to the president when he takes the stage next week .

Ron Brownstein , a CNN senior political analyst and editorial director of the National Journal , said `` as strong as Biden was , '' there was almost nothing on what a second Obama term would mean for America , especially on the economy .

`` That is still the big missing piece in their argument , '' Brownstein said .

Ryan was able to capitalize on Romney 's momentum from his well-received debate performance . The Wisconsin congressman 's performance further smooths Romney 's path to charge ahead , political experts say .

`` Ryan was a steady , unflappable presence onstage who made an articulate set of arguments in favor of conservative principles while also seeming sensitive and reasonable to many moderates , '' David Gergen , a senior political analyst for CNN , wrote Friday . `` Ryan was also surprisingly strong on foreign policy , holding his own against a man far more schooled in the subject . ''

However , some political watchers said Ryan 's response on women 's health issues could prove problematic for Romney during the next two debates .

`` It 's kind of the untalked about thing this morning -- raised a bunch of issues for the campaigns to be talking about over the next couple of weeks , '' Hilary Rosen , a Democratic pundit and CNN contributor , said . `` Yes , the economy is important , but when women have to worry about their health care and the economy , that 's just an extra burden . ''

But CNN contributor and RedState blogger Erick Erickson , appearing on `` CNN Newsroom '' with Rosen , said most women agree with the Romney-Ryan position .

`` I 'm sorry , Hilary , but you 're just wrong on this , '' he said . `` In the Gallup poll , the Pew poll , Mason Dixon poll , you name it , they show that the majority of women in this country , they are pro-life . They consider themselves for pro-life , with the exceptions Paul Ryan named -LRB- in the debate -RRB- . ''
