-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If the pre-vote predictions had been accurate , football heavyweights Italy would be preparing to host the 2012 European Championship .

It was n't a shock on the scale of Qatar 's swoop for the 2022 World Cup , but the joint bid from Poland and Ukraine was at one stage considered third favorite to host Euro 2012 -- out of three candidates .

But taking advantage of the hooliganism and match-fixing allegations making ugly headlines in Italy back in 2007 , Poland and Ukraine stole up on the outside to pip both the 1968 champions and another joint bid from Hungary and Croatia to the honor .

Racism , rather than Ronaldo and Ribery , dominates Euro 2012 storylines

Fulfilling UEFA chief Michel Platini 's ambition of balancing the power in European football , this will be the first major football tournament in the former Iron Curtain .

But as early as 2008 , Platini was telling Ukraine to `` get going '' as the building of new stadiums and improvements in the transport network slipped behind schedule . At one stage , there was even talk of Scotland stepping in as emergency host .

By the end of 2011 , Platini was diplomatically describing the buildup as a `` complicated adventure . ''

`` Difficult births often lead to beautiful babies , '' the French football great concluded in March as Poland and Ukraine finally declared they would be ready for the June 8 kickoff when an estimated worldwide audience of at least 150 million is expected to be watching .

Only time will tell whether Platini will return to UEFA 's headquarters in Switzerland a proud father .

Most major sporting tournaments experience a rocky buildup , Poland and Ukraine 's has been at the turbulent end of the scale -- understandably so , given the countries ' lack of major event experience coupled with ambitious improvement plans that are reported to have cost $ 38 billion combined .

The stadia are breathtaking . Five of the eight on show during the tournament are brand new , and the existing venues in Kiev , Donetsk and Kharkiv have undergone major developments .

The 50,000-capacity , newly-constructed National Stadium in Warsaw will host the opening game between Poland and Greece .

Kiev 's 60,000-capacity Olympic Stadium , which began life in 1923 as the Red Stadium of Lev Trotsky and hosted games during the 1980 Moscow Olympics , has been completely renovated with a new transparent roof and will host the final on July 1 .

While the venues have been tested , the transport network will come under scrutiny for the first time when an estimated one million fans descend on the two countries .

Ukraine faces a race against time to complete the planned 1,750 kilometers of new roads in time for the start of the tournament . It has also shipped in high-speed trains from South Korea to ease travel between the two host countries .

Poland has already accepted that some of its transport improvements -- including the construction of 750 km of new motorways -- may not be ready .

`` We know not everything will be completed in time for Euro 2012 , '' Poland 2012 communications director Mikolaj Piotrowski told CNN late last year .

`` But today we can say that a lot of important investment projects will be completed three to five years sooner than without the Euros scenario , so I think it was worth it to see Michel Platini opening the envelope in Cardiff in 2007 . ''

If getting around should be manageable for fans , finding somewhere affordable to stay once they get to their destination is an altogether trickier task .

England -- traditionally one of the best-supported European teams -- failed to sell out its original allocation of tickets for its group games in Kiev and Donetsk , with many fans opting to stay at home as Ukrainian hotel owners seek to make hay from the tournament by ramping up prices . In April the Football Supporters ' Federation said fans were being quoted as much as $ 1,000 a night for a three-star room .

The England team avoided that problem by choosing a base in Krakow , Poland -- even though it will mean thousands of miles of travel between the two countries .

If it is n't financial concerns putting off fans , it is the fear of the kind of reception they 'll get . The English Foreign Office warns that there has been a recent `` increase in hostility '' toward gay people in Ukraine and that `` travelers of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent and individuals belonging to religious minorities should take extra care . ''

The families of black England players Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have already decided against traveling to Ukraine -- and that was before a BBC documentary highlighting racism and violence in the host countries was screened

`` It 's a major concern , '' said Oxlade-Chamberlain 's father Mark , himself a former England player . `` I think your safety is more important than a game of football . ''

Poland , too , has suffered serious problems with racism .

`` Monkey chanting , banana throwing , that has happened in Polish matches unfortunately , '' Rafal Pankowski from the campaign group Never Again told CNN .

`` We want to use the Championships to highlight some of the issues and make a difference in a positive way in terms of anti-racism education . ''

A series of bomb blasts in Dnipropetrovsk , Ukraine 's fourth largest city , in late April only added to the pervading nervousness over traveling to the country , while several EU leaders will boycott the tournament over Ukraine 's treatment of imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko .

Amnesty International , meanwhile , has warned of `` widespread police criminality '' in Ukraine , leading to concerns that any crowd trouble could be met with a particularly brutal response .

UEFA has always accepted that giving Euro 2012 to Poland and Ukraine was a risk .

`` From the beginning , it was a big challenge to go to Poland and Ukraine , '' Platini told CNN last month . `` Four years ago when all the signs were red , red , red -- stadium , roads , accommodation -- it was not easy .

`` But I say it was a good risk . ''

And Kiev could witness a historic moment if Spain can follow up 2008 's victory and become the first team to successfully defend the title since the tournament began 52 years ago .

On a lighter note , we await the predictions of Ukraine 's `` Psychic Pig '' and Poland 's `` Citta '' the elephant with interest . They follow in the footsteps of 2010 World Cup soothsayer Paul the Octopus in what seems to be becoming a curious tradition at major football tournaments .

For most pundits , the Spanish are favorites for the title , but they have their problems . Record scorer David Villa and veteran defender Carles Puyol have been ruled out of the tournament , while striker Fernando Torres -- who netted the only goal of the 2008 final -- has endured another torrid season for Chelsea .

Their competition looks set to come from Joachim Low 's youthful Germany side , 2010 World Cup finalists Netherlands , and perhaps a France team that appears to be back on an even keel under the calming influence of Laurent Blanc .

Italy , six years on from the scandal that so seriously damaged the country 's chances of hosting the tournament , is embroiled in another match-fixing crisis that led defender Domenico Criscito to be cut from the squad .

The English are even less fancied , particularly so among their own pessimistic supporters . Roy Hodgson took up his coaching job just 29 days before the first game against France and has to get the best out of a squad that must survive the first two games without the suspended Wayne Rooney , one of the team 's few world-class players .

As for the hosts , Poland looks to have the easier group with Czech Republic , Greece and Russia .

Ukraine must contend with France , England and Sweden . For 35-year-old national icon Andriy Shevchenko , the tournament is a chance to put the perfect full stop on a 17-year international career .

`` Ukrainians , our time has come ! '' declares the team 's slogan .

UEFA might be hoping it also applies to the country as a whole .
