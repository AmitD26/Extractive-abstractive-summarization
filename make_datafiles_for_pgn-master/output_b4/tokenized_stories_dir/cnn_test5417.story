-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A court in Mumbai on Thursday found four men guilty of gang-raping a photojournalist in the Indian city last year .

The woman , who was 22 at the time , and a male colleague were on assignment in the area for a print publication in August when some men approached them , according to police .

The two had walked from a train station to a nearby mill , the woman said in a statement released by police . One of the men claimed to be a railway employee and said , `` Our boss has seen you taking photos ; you will have to come with us . ''

According to the woman , he refused to let her talk to his boss , instead leading them away . Then , somewhere near the exit , one of the accused pointed at the photojournalist 's colleague , saying he was responsible for a killing a few days ago .

`` I pleaded with them to let us go , but they shouted at me and threatened me , '' the woman said . She and her colleague were taken further inside the mill complex .

There , they offered their camera and phone , begging to be let go . Instead , `` they tied my friend 's hands with -LRB- a -RRB- belt '' as two others joined the group , the woman said .

`` Three people stayed with my friend , and the two took me behind a wall , '' she added .

That 's where the attack allegedly occurred . The victim said her mother called her phone multiple times , before one of the men switched it off . The woman said she was threatened with , among other things , sharp pieces of a broken beer bottle .

A fifth suspect who was arrested in connection with the case -- believed to be a teenager -- will be tried separately in a juvenile court .

The four men will be sentenced on Friday .
