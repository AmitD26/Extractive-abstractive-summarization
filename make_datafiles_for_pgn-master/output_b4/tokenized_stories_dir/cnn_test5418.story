-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A decade ago , tiny `` travel-size '' shampoos were fun stocking stuffers and a more expensive , more convenient means of packing toiletries for a trip . Now they 're a reminder of the layered security landscape that has evolved at airports since the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .

As the 10-year anniversary of that day approaches , CNN asked security experts to weigh in on changes in aviation security in the United States since 9/11 and to offer a glimpse of what 's likely to happen next .

The good news for the widely criticized Transportation Security Administration ? Some security analysts like where the agency is headed .

`` The TSA is exhibiting much more open-mindedness and has already accepted the concept that there is a need to look at people as well as what they carry , '' said Rafi Ron , president of Virginia-based New Age Security Solutions and former head of security of Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv , Israel .

But despite all the hassles travelers now endure to get on an airplane , two experts ' picks for the decade 's most significant safety improvements had nothing to do with checkpoint screening . They were reinforced cockpit doors and the screening of checked luggage for explosives . So how do all the other measures -- the ones that aggravate the shoeless , jacket-less masses -- hold up in security analysts ' eyes ?

`` The past 10 years were mostly wasted by consistently holding to the idea that we can solve the problem by technological screening only , '' Ron said .

Body scanners , metal detectors and pat-downs have limitations and responding to recent threats by having passengers remove shoes or carry only small amounts of liquid does n't make sense , analysts say .

`` Try to anticipate the future , rather than reacting to the past , '' said Richard Bloom , director of terrorism , espionage and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University .

`` Just to do things based on something that already happened in and of itself is frankly illogical and is not supportive of good security , '' he said .

TSA Administrator John Pistole , who took the helm in 2010 , gets credit from security experts for a shift in strategy .

Pistole , a former deputy director for the Federal Bureau of Investigation , has said intelligence is the best tool for preventing terrorism , and the agency is testing measures at airports that it hopes will make things easier for most travelers .

`` We are working on a risk-based security initiative that recognizes that the vast majority of travelers are not terrorists , '' Pistole said .

Pistole recently announced a pilot trusted traveler program to reduce screening hassles for travelers who provide additional personal information to the government and free more resources to focus on high-risk passengers . The program is expected to launch in October .

`` The P word ''

The path to a more effective and efficient , intelligence-driven system is not easy .

Profiling , or `` the P word '' as Ron referred to it , should be part of that path , according to many security analysts . But that concept , and some of the physical means of screening , have opponents who invoke that other `` P word '' -- privacy .

Everyone profiles , consciously or unconsciously , Bloom said . And there 's nothing `` unusual or unnatural '' about it .

`` The question is does it work , the scientific part , and is it consistent with our values or not ? And there 's always a tradeoff between the two . ''

They 're not calling for illegal racial or ethnic profiling , Bloom , Ron and security analyst Douglas Laird said .

'' -LRB- That 's -RRB- the lazy and the easy way to go about it and the nonprofessional way , '' Ron said . The profiling he supports uses legitimate information to identify what does n't make sense -- flying one-way with no luggage , for example .

Laird , president of Laird & Associates and a former security director at Northwest Airlines , helped develop a profiling system called CAPPS -LRB- Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System -RRB- used by the airlines before 9/11 .

`` It did n't look for the bad guy , it looked for the knowns . So , taken to the extreme , if you were a Platinum Elite at Northwest , you were given a good score . If you had never flown on us before you were given a not very good score , '' he said .

The system referenced commercial data available through airline computer systems and credit card companies , Laird said , comparing information like street addresses with phone numbers with where the passenger purchased the ticket . The system took names out of the equation , Laird said , because a `` professional '' terrorist would probably travel under a different identity with genuine documents .

Each passenger 's score determined how much screening and which methods should be used . A proposal after 9/11 for an expanded CAPPS system was abandoned in 2004 amid criticism from privacy and civil liberties groups . Instead a system called Secure Flight was introduced .

The system compares information provided to airlines by passengers against watch lists , but does not use commercial data and protects travelers ' privacy , according to the TSA . The watch-list matching program was fully implemented in November 2010 .

`` Secure Flight is not really a profiling program , '' Ron said . `` It is basically a program that is mostly focused on identifying wanted people or people that we already have their names in various databases . ''

Laird said he believes a more sophisticated automated system will be used within the next 10 years .

Bad things and bad people

TSA behavioral detection officers are testing a `` casual conversation '' screening technique at Boston 's Logan airport . While officers talk with passengers they are looking for suspicious behavior and facial expressions .

Some passengers may be engaged in longer conversations , receive additional screening or be referred to law enforcement if suspicious behaviors persist , according to TSA spokesman Greg Soule .

The incorporation of the `` human factor '' in U.S. airport security is overdue , Ron said . `` In other terms , instead of just looking for bad items , we need to look for bad people . ''

Laird is skeptical of behavioral analysis and would like to see more evidence of its effectiveness . Ron acknowledges that the efficacy of the TSA 's program will depend on the quality of the program , the training and the personnel .

Ron said his professional experience with Israeli airport security , widely considered to be the best in the world and heavily reliant on behavioral analysis and profiling , does n't mean he would suggest the United States go to the same lengths . But the American system should understand the roots of Israel 's success , he said , and incorporate them in a way that fits within our legal framework .

How the TSA will tailor and add to layered passenger screening remains to be seen . But , while there are no guarantees , these experts expect some of today 's little annoyances to be phased out for most passengers .

`` And I 'm glad , '' Bloom said . `` Because I like to wear wingtip shoes to go with my suit and having to unlace and take them off and put them back on is getting to be a real hassle . ''
