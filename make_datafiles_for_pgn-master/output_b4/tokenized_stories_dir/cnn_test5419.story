-LRB- The Frisky -RRB- -- When `` Dazed and Confused '' came out in 1993 , my sophomore year of high school , my friends and I saw it at the dollar movie theater no less than 16 times . We memorized lines like , `` Check ya later , '' `` Fry like bacon you little freshman piggies ! '' We took trips to the Salvation Army to scavenge for Levi cutoffs like Darla 's -LRB- Parker Posey -RRB- , fringed vests like Michelle 's -LRB- Milla Jovovitch -RRB- , or bell bottoms like Jodi 's -LRB- Michelle Burke -RRB- .

We scoped for dudes to crush on like Mitch -LRB- Wiley Wiggins -RRB- or Pickford -LRB- Shawn Andrews -RRB- . The movie struck a nerve with us-we were caught in the jaded whirlwind of 90s grunge , à la Nirvana . The kids of Lee High elicited a magical nostalgia of what it must have been like to be a teen in the 70s , when times were simpler and we could have made bongs in shop class and gone to KISS concerts . I thought my love for the film may have been a `` high school thing , '' but when I caught it on TV this past weekend , it was just as magical as ever . In fact , it was even better .

So where are they now , the cool kids of Lee High ? What did they grow up to be ?

Matthew McConaughey as `` David Wooderson '' Then : David Wooderson was that slimy older dude who was working for the city by day and partying at the Moon Tower by night . Even with the creepy ` stache and the skin-tight pants , he still managed to exude sex appeal . Now : Matthew is still exuding sex appeal as a rom-com king in movies such as `` How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days , '' `` Fool 's Gold , '' and `` Failure to Launch . '' Yup , he does his best work with his shirt off .

Ben Affleck as `` Fred O'Bannion '' Then : `` Fafffleck '' -LRB- `` fat Affleck '' -RRB- played haze-happy , fifth-year senior Fred O'Bannion . Now : Ben is much thinner , much hotter , much richer , and much more famous now . He 's an A-List movie star married to another A-List movie star , Jennifer Garner . If you have n't heard of him or do n't know what he 's been up to lately , then you 've been living in an isolated cave since 1993 .

Marissa Ribisi as `` Cynthia Dunn '' Then : Cynthia Dunn was the apple of Wooderson 's eye as the smart chick with a red afro that she combed with a pick . Now : Marissa , twin sister of actor Giovanni Ribisi , has had reasonable success in her career since the film came out . She guest starred on `` Friends '' and `` Felicity , '' and co-wrote her own film in 1998 called `` Some Girl . '' However , for the last few years she 's stepped away from the spotlight and has focused on her marriage to musician Beck . Coincidentally , Marisa was delivered as a baby by Beck 's mother ; the two were both raised Scientologists and are raising their own children , son Cosimo and daughter Tuesday , as Xenuphiles as well . Ribisi also has a clothing line , Whitley Kros , which launched in 2007 .

The Frisky : Bristol Palin 's friend may be pregnant with Levi Johnston 's child

Adam Goldberg as `` Mike Newhouse '' Then : Every high school has a token misanthrope who just wants to dance but ends up getting in a fight by calling someone a `` male dominant monkey -LSB- expletive -RSB- ... '' Mike Newhouse did the honors at Lee High . Now : Adam is certainly no misanthrope in the entertainment industry . He made a name for himself with his neurotic charm appearing in a bajillion things , including `` Saving Private Ryan , '' `` A Beautiful Mind , '' `` Entourage , '' or `` 2 Days In Paris '' with Julie Delphy whom he also dated .

Parker Posey as `` Darla Marks '' Then : Darla Marks was the senior with an attitude you did not want to piss off before first period for fear of being tarred and feathered . Now : Parker went on to become an indie film queen appearing in lots of films you saw at your local art house theater . I loved her the most in the Christopher Guest films `` Waiting for Guffman '' and `` Best In Show . '' You may have seen her on the small screen recently in `` The Return of Jezebel James '' and `` Bored to Death '' as Jason Schwartzman 's love interest .

Jason London as `` Randall ` Pink ' Floyd '' Then : Randall `` Pink '' Floyd was the hot football player with a rebellious streak . Yum . Now : Do n't get Jason confused with his twin brother Jeremy , the one with the drug problem . Jason is on the straight and narrow and has continued to act since the film . You may have seen him on `` 7th Heaven , '' `` Grey 's Anatomy '' or , most recently , `` NCIS . ''

Joey Lauren Adams as `` Simone Kerr '' Then : Pink 's girlfriend , actress Simone Kerr , did not go around inhaling helium balloons . That was just Joey Lauren Adam 's natural voice . Now : We remember Joey best as lesbian Alyssa Jones in `` Chasing Amy , '' which Ben Affleck co-starred in . Most recently you may have seen her in `` The Breakup '' or as Pammy in the `` United States of Tara '' starring Toni Collette .

The Frisky : 6 roles written for men , but cast as women

Wiley Wiggins as `` Mitch Kramer '' Then : Oh , Mitch Kramer . Mitchy , Mitchy , Mitchy . What a crush we had on that little nose-grabbin ' freshman just trying to avoid his hazing and make it with the ladies . Now : Wiley 's all grown up now . You can find him acting in films , writing , making art , or doing web design in Austin , Texas . You can follow him on Twitter but he 'll punch your face if you ask him to touch his nose ... according to his bio . Darn .

Christin Hinojosa as `` Sabrina Davis '' Then : Sabrina Davis was the lucky freshman chick that the older kids took a shine to . Now : Christin left behind her acting career after a brief appearance in `` Clueless '' the television show and became an anti-war activist . She 's married and lives in Oakland .

Shawn Andrews as `` Kevin Pickford '' Then : Who can forget Kevin Pickford ? You know , the guy with the amazing abs who was throwing a keg party at his house before his parents caught on ? Fun fact : during the filming of `` Dazed and Confused , '' Shawn eloped with co-star Milla Jovovich , who also played his girlfriend , Michelle Burroughs , the hot girl who did n't really talk . She was only 16 at the time , so her mom had the marriage annulled after two months . Oh , young love . Now : Since then , Shawn has appeared in a handful of other movies , most recently `` Fix '' opposite Olivia Wilde , but apparently , he never really bounced back from wedding a teenager . At least he still looks amazing .

Catherine Avril Morris as `` Julie Simms '' Then : Julie Simms was the lucky sophomore who got to make out on a blanket with Mitch Kramer . I was super jealous . Fun fact : Catherine scored the part because she was actually the film 's casting assistant . Now : Now Catherine is a middle school Language Arts teacher and writer in Austin , Texas . She has her own blog , `` Of Course I Write Romance Novels , '' and is a member of the Romance Writers of America . She 's also learning to play Whitesnake on her accordion and has a great working knowledge of Astrology .

Rory Cochrane as `` Ron Slater '' Then : Lovable Ron Slater was the long-haired hippie always ready with a silly catchphrase at the ready like , `` Hey man ... are you cool ? '' or `` Check ya later . '' Now : Since the movie , Rory has done relatively well for himself , appearing in `` Empire Records '' alongside his `` Dazed and Confused '' costars Ben Affleck , Jason London , and Renee Zellweger-who made a cameo in the film and was his live-in girlfriend for four years-as well as the Richard Linklater film `` A Scanner Darkly . '' Most recently he was in the movie `` Public Enemies '' with Johnny Depp and a series regular on `` 24 '' and `` CSI : Miami . '' He 's reuniting with another one of his `` Dazed '' costars , Milla Jovovich , in the 2011 film `` Bringing Up Bobby '' written by actress Famke Janssen .

The Frisky : Mel Gibson 's set pranks humiliated his female co-stars

Anthony Rapp as `` Tony Olson '' Then : Why would n't Sabrina fall for the sweet , sensitive intellectual Tony Olson ? He was dreamy . Now : While Anthony continues to do some film and television , he has achieved major success in the theater world . You may have seen him as struggling musician Mark Cohen in `` Rent , '' both the original Broadway production and the film .

The Frisky : 7 celeb ladies who are missing their belly buttons

Michelle Burke as `` Jodi Kramer '' Then : Jodi Kramer was Mitch 's sexy , two-timing , meddling older sis . Now : Currently , Michelle is working on a movie with Miley Cyrus , Demi Moore , Ashley Greene , and Thomas Jane called `` LOL : Laughing Out Loud . '' Gee , I really hope the film lives up to its title . If Michelle is as funny as she was as Connie Conehead on film , everything should be fine .
