Boulder City , Nevada -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Driving across the stark Nevada desert at 75 miles an hour , you do n't expect to find much .

Craggy mountains tower above scrubby brown plains with only hints of scattered green . Sometimes , a tumbleweed , like a lost extra from an old Western movie , skips across the road .

Then , off in the distance , I see something shiny . More than shiny ; it is positively gleaming .

This is my first glimpse of what is billed as the largest solar cell field in the country . It is hard to say if the claim is true , since these things are being built so quickly in so many places now . But it is impressive : row after row after row of black glass panels tilted toward the sun , quietly soaking energy from the sky .

`` Right now , we have about a million panels , '' says Scott Crider with Sempra Energy , a California-based energy resources company . `` This facility will power about 14,000 average homes on an annual basis . ''

And that 's just the start . Sempra has big designs on being a major player in the green energy game . But as the wind whips through my hair and I study the immense emptiness all around , I ca n't help but ask , `` Why is this such a good location for such a thing ? ''

`` First , there is a lot of available , flat land , '' Crider says . `` Second , it is incredibly sunny . This region gets about 330 days of sunshine per year . And third , there 's existing transmission lines which provide access to major markets throughout the western United States . ''

Which , as is so often the case , raises another question : Why are those lines way out here ?

To find that answer , you have to drive 20 minutes to struggling Boulder City , population about 16,000 . The town is uniquely poised to cash in on the new energy boom precisely because it was built on old energy technology ; during another time when the economy and energy collided ; when thousands of jobless men came here during the Great Depression to undertake an unprecedented power-generating project .

`` This town is here because it was a federal reservation to build Hoover Dam . ''

That 's Duncan McCoy . He 's a member of the city council and has a background in history . He has watched his town get hammered by the recession . Tourists are n't coming to the dam just east of town like they once did . The value of local houses has plunged .

`` Our local sales tax revenue is down , '' he says , shaking his head . `` That 's a major portion of our budget . Our property tax revenues are down . ''

But bring up the solar facility and he brightens , because it has opened a gateway from his town 's past into the future . The solar plant provided several hundred temporary construction jobs when it was built , and it has created a handful of permanent positions , since .

More importantly , it is bringing desperately needed money to city coffers . Fifteen years ago , the town bought up vast amounts of land to protect itself from the sprawling reach of neighboring Las Vegas . As luck would have it , the purchase included all the land around the big transmission lines leading to the dam , and now , they are leasing that property to Sempra and others who want to tap into them .

`` This year , we 'll get about two-and-a-half million dollars . That 's about 11 percent of our city 's general fund budget , '' McCoy says . `` That 's pretty important money , and we can count on it . ''

They can probably count on more as well . Back at the solar field , Crider makes it clear that this is only the start . `` There is strong demand for cleaner sources of energy , and we 're going to help fill that niche . ''

Sempra is not alone . Nevada is aggressively courting more solar firms , convinced that if they can get enough into place , the whole state can benefit from being a major green energy source for neighboring super state California .

Of course , other states such as Arizona and New Mexico are thinking the same thing . For the folks in Boulder City , however , that 's a worry for another day . They know their dark days are far from past . But right now , the sun is shining , and just as it was when they built the dam so long ago , that 's a start .
