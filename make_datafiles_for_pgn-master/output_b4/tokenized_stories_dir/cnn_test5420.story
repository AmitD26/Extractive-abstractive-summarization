-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What do you get when you cross thousands of plastic water bottles with an adventure-loving entrepreneur ? A boat , of course , designed to carry a team of scientists , adventurers and artists halfway around the world .

Sounds like an interesting proposition ? It clearly did to David de Rothschild , one of the youngest members of the famous banking dynasty , who has taken it upon himself to show the world how pervasive the global plastic waste problem has become .

De Rothschild wants the public to start viewing waste as a resource , particularly plastic . To underscore his message , he and collaborators designed a boat made almost entirely of plastic bottles and recycled plastic . Later this month de Rothschild and the crew will begin a planned 11,000-mile -LRB- 17,700-kilometer -RRB- voyage from the U.S. city of San Francisco to Sydney , Australia . The crew hopes to accomplish the voyage in 100 days .

Almost four years in the making , the result of de Rothschild 's environmental vision is a 60-foot catamaran-style boat named The Plastiki . Builders of the boat say it weighs in at 12 tons , with only 10 percent of the vessel made from new materials .

Constructed mainly from 12,500 reclaimed plastic water bottles designed to keep Plastiki afloat , the main frame is made from self-reinforcing polyethylene terephthalate -LRB- srPET -RRB- , a recyclable plastic material , and the sail has been hand-made using recycled PET cloth .

Leaders of the voyage say the boat will be powered by renewable energy such as solar panels , wind turbines and bicycle generators . And crew members even plan to grow their own food aboard the boat with the help of a vertical garden attached to the mast .

Put all this together , de Rothschild told CNN , and you get a boat which , its builders claim , is `` infinitely recyclable . ''

`` The idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere or into our oceans for that matter , so everything on the boat will be composted . Everything will be recycled . Even the vessel is going to end up being recycled when we finish , '' de Rothschild told CNN in a recent interview .

The Plastiki 's name is wordplay off the `` Kon-Tiki , '' a balsa raft made famous by Norwegian Thor Heyerdahl , who in 1947 sailed the vessel from Peru to the Polynesian islands .

Two of Heyerdahl 's grandchildren , Olav Heyerdahl and Josian Heyerdahl , will be aboard during various legs of the Plastiki voyage . The former is familiar with some of the terrain , having previously replicated his grandfather 's expedition using the original log books and diary used by Heyerdahl , and taking the opportunity to track changes in the Pacific 's environmental conditions .

Meet the Plastiki crew

The Plastiki 's journey will spotlight current environmental issues . En route to Australia , Plastiki will sail through the infamous North Pacific Gyre , now home to `` The Great Garbage Patch , '' named due to the high levels of waste that have been drawn there by ocean currents . Estimated to be around the size of Texas , this contaminated area of ocean has by some estimates more plastic than food for marine life .

`` I was astounded to hear that that there are places in our oceans where the ratio between plastic and plankton is 6-to-1 , '' de Rothschild told CNN , referring to the area .

Opinion : The reason for the Plastiki voyage

Expedition organizers say the boat will sail past the Midway Atoll en route to Australia . Its scheduled stops -- in places such as the Marshall Islands , Tuvalu and Kiribati -- will be symbolic too , allowing the team to raise awareness of places that are particularly vulnerable to changing environmental conditions , such as rising sea levels .

The journey is expected to take the crew through the `` Doldrums '' -- equatorial regions in the Atlantic , Pacific and Indian oceans known for unpredictable weather patterns that include listless winds that can trap sailing vessels .

Other questions remain . The New York Times recently pointed out that if the vessel breaks apart in the ocean it could send thousands of plastic bottles into the ocean .

But Plastiki 's skipper , British sailor Jo Royle says she is confident the team will be able to navigate their way to their final destination .

`` We can not look at other boats for reference , but we would n't leave unless we 're completely confident we 'll make it , '' she told CNN .

Whether the boat completes its journey remains to be seen , but de Rothschild is resolved about the importance of his mission , regardless of the outcome .

`` Even if Plastiki gets damaged or does not make it , the message will still be there , '' de Rothschild told CNN . `` The idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere , or into our oceans . ''
