-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Canadian woman on trial for allegedly stalking Alec Baldwin described a romantic date with the actor that she says ended with sex and a promise of lifelong omelets .

Genevieve Sabourin , 41 , finally had her chance to testify Wednesday in her trial after hearing Baldwin deny under oath Tuesday that he was ever romantic or sexual with her .

Sabourin 's impatience earned her a contempt of court citation and 30-day jail term Wednesday morning as she repeatedly interrupted another witness , saying at times `` I want to testify . ''

Sabourin was warned by the judge repeatedly during the first day of testimony Tuesday about her outbursts as she listened to a teary Baldwin deny having had a romance with his alleged stalker .

Sabourin , an aspiring actress , heckled , `` You 're lying ! ''

Her outbursts in the New York City courtroom continued Tuesday as the doorman from Baldwin 's apartment building testified about Sabourin 's April 8 , 2012 , attempt to visit the actor there .

The actor 's wife , Hilaria Baldwin , who was then engaged to him , told the doorman that Sabourin was a stalker and that she would call police , he testified . Sabourin called Hilaria a prostitute and another derogatory term before leaving the building , the doorman said .

She says she 's not a stalker , but an ex-girlfriend of the `` 30 Rock '' television star .

Sabourin began her testimony Wednesday afternoon , detailing what she said were long personal phone conversations with Baldwin .

Then she talked about February 18 , 2011 .

Baldwin picked her up at her hotel at 7:30 p.m. and the couple attended a Broadway play , she testified . Afterward , they shared an intimate dinner , eating off of each other 's plate , she said . She drank chardonnay , while Baldwin had water .

They took a cab back to her hotel , where Baldwin suggested one last glass of water , she testified . The next several hours were spent in her hotel room where they made love and he made a promise , she said .

`` I make the best omelets in the world and I 'd be happy to make you omelets every morning for the rest of your life , '' she said he said .

Sabourin began crying at that point of her testimony , complaining how everyone finds their love , as companions , but that she now knows she made the wrong choice with Baldwin .

Baldwin left her hotel room the next morning , but later texted an e-mail address for her to use , she testified . She used it to maintain a relationship with romantic e-mails in which she said she gave `` her heart and soul to him . ''

While they were apart , they engaged in phone sex , she testfied . Baldwin was very charming in the calls , she said . Some of the talk was about her moving to New York from Montreal to be closer to him , she said .

But then Baldwin started seeing his future wife , she said .

The incidents of alleged stalking were attempts at finding `` closure , '' she said .

But Baldwin testified that she imagined the relationship , and she sent him numerous e-mails and voice mails along the way . CNN obtained copies of the e-mails .

`` I am less than 10 minutes away from you tonight . Say ` I do ' to me , '' one e-mail says .

In another e-mail , she said she was ready to get married .

`` I need to start my new life with my new name ... in my new country , help my newly husband , you ! ''

In another e-mail , she admits defeat .

`` I may have lost all the battles to win your heart over in the past two years , but I 've learn -LRB- sic -RRB- so much , '' it says .

Wiping away tears , Baldwin said Sabourin 's stalking has made him anxious and worried for his safety .

She showed up unannounced at his New York home on the day he proposed to his now-wife , the actor said .

Days later , she allegedly crashed an event the actor was hosting at New York City ` s Lincoln Center .

Baldwin has admitted they had dinner once in 2010 , but said that was it . They met through a mutual friend , he said .

Both Baldwin and Sabourin worked on the 2002 flop `` The Adventures of Pluto Nash . '' Baldwin has also appeared in numerous other movies , including `` Along Came Polly . ''

His past is checkered with various conflicts including an infamous berating of his then young daughter Ireland in 2007 as a `` rude , thoughtless little pig , '' a run in with American Airlines over his playing Words with Friends on a flight , and various scuffles with paparazzi .

Unlike the actor , who did n't say a word about the case to reporters , Sabourin is basking in the media spotlight . She grinned widely as she shared her side of the story with a group of reporters .

`` I 'm not gon na take a reduced plea for a crime I have not committed , '' she said .

Sabourin has been arrested several times , including late last year for violating a court order by allegedly sending a series of tweets to Baldwin and his wife .

She was released from jail after a judge rejected a prosecution request for bail .

If found guilty on the stalking charge , she faces up to a year in prison .
