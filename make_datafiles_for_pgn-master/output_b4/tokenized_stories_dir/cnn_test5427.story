Dhaka , Bangladesh -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rescuers searched frantically for survivors after a packed ferry carrying at least 250 people capsized in southern Bangladesh , killing at least 32 people , police said Tuesday .

The MV Shariatpur-1 sank in the Meghna River after colliding with a cargo ferry early Tuesday while passengers slept , a survivor said .

`` We were seven in a cabin in the ferry , and six of my family members are still missing , '' Mohammad Dulal Dewan told CNN .

`` Everything happened before I could understand anything . ''

The 55-year-old survivor said he `` jumped into the river and was rescued by people in another passing ferry . ''

Dewan and his family were traveling to Dhaka , Bangladesh 's capital , to see his brother-in-law off to the United States . Shamim Fakir was scheduled to fly on his U.S. trip early Wednesday , Dewan said . He was still missing Tuesday evening .

Mohammad Azizul Alam , the administrative chief of Munshiganj district , said officials had received a list of 61 missing people from families and the death toll might increase .

`` We believe many bodies are still trapped inside the sunken ferry , and the rescue operation is still on , '' Shahabuddin Khan , police chief of Munshiganj , told CNN .

The water authority 's chairman , Khandker Shamsuddoha Khandaker , told reporters the ferry had been traced 70 feet -LRB- more than 20 meters -RRB- under water .
