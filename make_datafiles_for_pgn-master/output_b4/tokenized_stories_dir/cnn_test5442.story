-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A diet of bread and water is the punishment for dozens of Arizona inmates who allegedly defaced American flags placed in their jail cells .

The 38 male inmates are part of the Maricopa County jail system , which is under the control of controversial sheriff Joe Arpaio .

For their alleged unpatriotic acts , the sheriff said Thursday , they 'll survive on bread and water for seven days .

`` These inmates have destroyed the American flag that was placed in their cells , '' Arpaio said . `` Tearing them , writing on them , stepping on them , throwing them in the toilet , trash or wherever they feel . It 's a disgrace ... this is government property that they are destroying , and we will take action against those who act this way . ''

The flags are part of a push for patriotism in county jail cells that includes listening to the `` Star-Spangled Banner '' every morning and `` God Bless America '' every night over the intercom system .

Arpaio implemented the American flag jailhouse initiative in November .

At the time , he announced a push to hire more veterans , saying his office employs more than 600 men and women who have served in the military . He manages about 8,000 inmates .

`` Sheriff Arpaio is a Korean War veteran and a big patriot , '' said Chrisopher Hegstrom , a spokesman for the Sheriff 's Office .

Arpaio 's tough , headline-grabbing punishments have earned him diehard supporters and fiery opponents along the way .

He 's issued pink underwear to the men detained in the county 's jails and said he is saving taxpayers money by removing salt and pepper from prison meals .

This month , the county announced that his racial and ethnic profiling will cost it at least $ 22 million . A court ruled in May that his office routinely profiled Latinos during traffic and immigration patrols .

His office has a history of targeting vehicles with occupants of Latino heritage , scrutinizing them more strictly and detaining them more often , U.S. District Judge Murray Snow ruled .

Arpaio has denied any discrimination or civil rights violations , and is appealing the decision .

He was elected to his sixth term as sheriff for the Phoenix area in November 2012 .
