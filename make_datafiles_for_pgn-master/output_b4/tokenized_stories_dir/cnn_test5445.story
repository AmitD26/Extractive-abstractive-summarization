-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The political pyrotechnics of a face-to-face encounter between U.S. President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin could eclipse a spectacular fireworks show set to illuminate the Normandy coastline to commemorate the D-Day anniversary .

French President Francois Hollande has gone to great lengths to prevent such an uncomfortable meeting .

On Thursday evening , Hollande dined with Obama before hosting a separate dinner with Putin . Talk about awkward dinner parties .

Obama and Putin are among the leaders invited to take part in French ceremonies Friday marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings , which helped change the course of World War II .

The two are likely to cross paths in France , Obama said , but no formal talks have been announced . If they should speak , Obama has said , he will give Putin the same message on Ukraine that he has given him in phone calls over past weeks and in his public statements .

On Thursday , after a meeting of G7 leaders in Brussels , Belgium , from which Russia was excluded , Obama offered stern words about Russia 's actions in Ukraine .

Putin `` has a chance to get back into a lane of international law , '' Obama said .

Obama said Putin could start by recognizing Ukraine 's new President-elect Petro Poroshenko , stopping the flow of weapons over the border into Ukraine and ceasing Russian support for pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine .

Putin , in an interview with French television station TF1 , did not discount the possibility of meeting with Obama .

`` As for my relations with Barack Obama , I have no reason whatsoever to believe he is not willing to talk to the President of Russia , '' he said . `` But ultimately , it is his choice . I am always ready for dialogue , and I think that dialogue is the best way to bridge any gaps . ''

The D-Day events also could bring Putin and Ukraine 's Poroshenko face to face .

Asked if he would speak with Ukraine 's new leader , Putin said he will not `` evade '' Poroshenko or anyone else .

`` There will be other guests , and I 'm not going to avoid any of them . I will talk with all of them , '' he said , according to the Kremlin 's translation .
