-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Five police officers brutally kicked and beat an unconscious suspect after a high-speed chase through Birmingham , Alabama , in an incident caught on camera and discovered a year later .

Video shows one black and four white officers beating and kicking unconscious man ejected from car .

The five officers have been fired , Mayor Larry Langford said at a news conference Wednesday . An internal inquiry is continuing .

The dashboard-cam footage , which officials believe was shot in January 2008 , was aired for reporters Wednesday . It showed the end of a 100-mile-an-hour police chase of a van driven by Anthony Warren , suspected of illegal drug activity .

Police had chased the van almost 50 miles , winding from downtown Birmingham to suburban Hoover . The video captured the van knocking down a police officer standing on a roadway , then turning up an interstate highway ramp , where it flipped over and rolled into a ditch .

Warren was ejected from the van and stopped moving . The five officers -- one black , four white -- ruthlessly beat the suspect , who is black , the video shows . Watch the tape that lead to the officers ' dismissal ''

A police mug shot taken five days after the beating was posted on the Web site of The Birmingham News . It shows a badly bruised man wearing a neck brace .

Police Chief A.C. Roper told CNN that the video was brought to his attention in March by the district attorney 's office , which stumbled upon the footage as it was preparing for Warren 's trial .

Warren was charged with attempted murder , but no trial took place because he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of aggravated assault . He is in prison serving a 20-year sentence .

Roper said he was `` shocked '' to learn of the video and that it had been around for so long without his knowledge .

In addition to a continuing internal investigation that could lead to disciplining supervisors , he said the Alabama Bureau of Investigation is considering criminal charges against the five officers .

Langford said the incident brought back to mind days of segregation and police brutality toward blacks .

`` The culture of the past was that police brutality was acceptable , '' Langford said . `` In Birmingham , Alabama , in the present day , it is not acceptable . ''

Langford said the five officers showed exceptional restraint in chasing the fleeing suspect and performed in exemplary fashion until the last scene caught on the video .

The camera captured 11 seconds of the five officers beating Warren with their fists and batons .

`` Those 11 seconds will not be tolerated , '' said Langford , who signed letters of termination for the five officers on Tuesday .

`` Over 50 years of combined police experience gone over 11 seconds , '' he said .
