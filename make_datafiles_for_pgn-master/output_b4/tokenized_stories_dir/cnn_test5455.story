-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If you are a coffee lover you might be tempted to pay for a cup of the most expensive coffee in the world . Indonesia 's velvety tasting brew , Kopi Luwak , gives new meaning to rich coffee . It can cost up to $ 50 per cup .

`` The supply is very limited in the world that makes the price is very expensive , '' Kopi Luwak brand managing director Henry Fernando said .

The reason the supply is limited has to do with how the beans are initially processed . Just a warning here , it is n't pretty .

Kopi means coffee in Indonesian and Luwak is a wild Asian palm civet , a fury creature that looks like a cross between a cat and a ferret . The civet climbs the coffee trees to find the best berries , eats them , digests the berries and eventually out comes the coffee beans in its stools . Farmers then pick up the civet droppings and take the beans to a processing plant . Something about the gastric juices in the civet 's stomach gives Kopi Luwak its unique flavor .

`` I do like it . Compared to other kinds of coffee , it has a more distinctive coffee taste and aroma , '' customer Yotje Hartono said as he sipped his coffee after watching the ritual of making a cup of the expensive brew .

At a Kopi Luwak Café in Jakarta the staff brings out a gold-lined cup , a hot thermos of water and vacuum packed sealed package of the Kopi Luwak . The package is opened and poured into the cup and then the hot water is poured in . It is stirred and then covered . You have to wait two minutes before sipping it .

When I first saw it being made I recoiled . I thought : `` I 'm paying all this money for instant coffee , no way ! ''

But after taking the first sip I felt a little better . It is very smooth with hints of chocolate and caramel flavors and it does n't have that acidic aftertaste that coffee sometimes does .

For years it has been more popular overseas than in Indonesia but that is fast changing as the economy in the country continues to grow at a rate far faster than those in the west .

`` We opened Kopi Luwak Café in 2002 and already have 20 stores , '' Fernando said .

It has become even more popular around the world after it was featured on `` Oprah '' and in the Hollywood movie `` The Bucket List '' where Jack Nicholson 's character was obsessed with it -LRB- not knowing of course what made it so special until the end -RRB- .

Kopi Luwak 's growing popularity and the way its made has run into trouble . It has been given some nasty names such as `` crappuccino '' and inspired two of Indonesia ¹ s main Muslim organizations to consider putting a fatwa on it because the process appeared to be ritually unclean .

But that all changed , Fernando said , after a bit of explanation about the bean when it is excreted .

`` It still has the skin , inner layer . And we do the cleansing process , before we do processing and roasting . It 's not a problem . And now , the Kopi Luwak is certified Halal , '' he said .

And it is being enjoyed for a heck of a lot less in its home country than elsewhere . A cup costs about $ 8 in Indonesia as opposed to up to $ 50 in other countries .

`` I feel it 's the type of thing you have to do once at least , '' an American customer who happened to visiting Indonesia said .
