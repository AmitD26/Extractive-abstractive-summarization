-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After weeks of fruitless searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane , it sounds like a promising sign .

When a Chinese patrol ship picked up two pulses in the southern Indian Ocean , the head of the Australian agency coordinating search efforts called it `` an important and encouraging lead . ''

Investigators hope the audio signals are locator beacons from the plane 's data recorders , but they 're not sure yet .

Is it the discovery we 've all been waiting for ? Could those be Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 's pingers ?

Here are four reasons to believe and six reasons to doubt :

REASONS TO BELIEVE

1 -RRB- The frequency does n't occur in nature .

The Chinese Haixun 01 patrol ship detected pulses at a frequency of 37.5 kHz , the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency reported . That 's the same frequency of black box pingers -- and that frequency is no accident . The pingers were designed to have that frequency because it does not occur in nature .

2 -RRB- There were two separate events .

The Haixun 01 reported two pulses within 2 kilometers -LRB- 1.25 miles -RRB- of each other . Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston , head of the Joint Agency Coordination Center , described them as `` fleeting , fleeting acoustic events . '' One was described as being 90 seconds long ; no time was given for the other , but it was evidently shorter .

`` I think the fact that we have had two detections , two acoustic events , in that location provides some promise which requires a full investigation of the location , '' Houston said .

3 -RRB- You usually know a ping when you hear one .

The pings are , under ideal conditions , easily recognizable . They `` ping '' like a metronome â € '' with a steady pulse about once a second .

4 -RRB- They 're in the right spot .

According to the latest analysis of Inmarsat satellite data and aircraft performance , the Haixun 01 is in the right spot . In fact , search supervisors , citing the new analysis , are moving the focus of the search to an area that includes the location of the Haixun 01 .

`` The area of highest probability , we think is now probably in the southern part of the area , pretty close to where Haixun 01 is operating , '' Houston said .

Pulse signals raise new questions

REASONS TO DOUBT

1 -RRB- The ocean is noisy .

In addition to the Haixun 01 's two `` acoustic events , '' ships detected two other events in a very short time , showing exactly how noisy the ocean is .

The British ship HMS Echo recorded one event that was determined to be unfounded . The Ocean Shield , an Australian naval vessel equipped with sophisticated listening equipment , has also detected `` an acoustic noise '' in another area of the ocean to the north . According to a CNN calculation , the Australian ship was about 350 miles -LRB- 565 kilometers -RRB- away from the spot where the Chinese ship detected the pulses . It 's also unclear whether the sound the Australian ship detected was related to Flight 370 .

The search team is urging patience and restraint .

2 -RRB- Only one pulse was detected at a time .

The Haixun 01 detected only one pulse at a time . Assuming both black box pingers are working , are close together , and are unobstructed by debris or terrain â € '' and those are , admittedly , big assumptions â € '' they should have heard two pingers , perhaps like a metronome with an echo .

3 -RRB- These are n't ideal conditions .

While pingers are easily identifiable under ideal conditions , the current conditions are far from perfect . Video of the searchers show them listening to the hydrophone with earbuds , not headsets that would block out ambient noise .

So the steady `` pings '' -- which actually sound like the snap of fingers -- could be confused with or overwhelmed by other noise , such as the waves lapping against the boat .

The Chinese said they did not have time to record the pulses , precluding a scientific analysis of the sounds .

4 -RRB- A spare pinger on the boat might have sent the signal .

In video of the Haixun 01 , it appears the Chinese had a spare pinger in the boat .

Anish Patel , president of pinger manufacturer Dukane Seacom , says it is not recommended to have a pinger near the area where you are trying to listen .

If that pinger gets wet , it will start transmitting , potentially confusing search teams .

`` I would n't put one where I 'm measuring , '' Patel said . `` It 's just not good common practice . ''

5 -RRB- The equipment was designed for shallow water .

The hydrophone the Chinese used to detect the pulse is `` designed for shallow water applications , '' not for the deep water , said Thomas Altshuler of Teledyne Marine Systems , manufacturer of the hydrophone .

`` They are using it in a scenario outside of our normal operation , '' he said .

Is it possible that it heard a ping from the depths of the Indian Ocean ?

`` It is possible , but it would be right at the edge of that detection -LRB- capability -RRB- , '' he said .

6 -RRB- The underwater search of a vast area started only recently .

The search area is so large , and the underwater search has just begun . It almost defies belief that the pingers could be found so soon . But then again , almost everything about this case defies belief .

THE BOTTOM LINE

We 'll give the final word to Angus Houston .

`` This is an important encouraging lead , but one which I urge you to continue to treat carefully , '' he told reporters . `` We are working in a very big ocean and within a very large search area , and so far , since the aircraft went missing , we have had very few leads which allow us to narrow the search area .
