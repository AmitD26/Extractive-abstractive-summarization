-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A newborn baby boy who was found alive inside a toilet pipe in Jinhua , China , has been released from a hospital and taken home by his maternal grandparents , police said .

The child 's mother is still being treated at the hospital , but has been cooperating with the investigation , Xiang Jiangsong , a police official , said Thursday .

The police are labeling the case an `` accident '' at this time , and no charges have been filed against the mother .

Dramatic video of the infant 's rescue made global headlines and sparked reactions worldwide .

Unable to pull the infant out , rescuers went to a floor below the toilet and sawed away a section of pipe to gain access from there .

Still unable to extract the infant , rescuers detached the section of pipe with the infant inside and took it to the hospital .

Working together , rescuers and doctors used pliers and gingerly tore away bits of the pipe .

CCTV video showed the exact moment hands in white gloves gingerly pulled away a part of the pipe to reveal the newborn 's face .

The infant , a boy referred to as `` Baby 59 , '' was drinking formula , doctors said .

Police said firefighters and other rescuers involved visited the baby at the hospital and sent clothes , formula powder and diapers .

The mother 's account

The mother of the infant is not being identified , but local police say she is 22 .

Police say that , so far , they believe her account of how the baby ended up in the pipe .

`` That day she felt stomachaches , '' said Jiang Song , the vice director of police . `` So she went to the toilet . It was actually close to her due date and the baby just slid out . ''

Police questioned the woman , who told them that she did not intend for the child to fall into the toilet , according to a local TV channel that was posted on the official police Weibo account .

The police said she tried to retrieve the baby with a stick , then decided to flush the toilet to clear away the blood .

Police : Young mother was embarrassed

A police officer in Pujiang County , in which the incident took place , told a journalist working for CNN that the unmarried woman broke up with her boyfriend six months ago . The officer refused to give his full name to the reporter , identifying himself only as Fang .

According to Fang , the young woman was embarrassed to have a child as a single woman and felt nervous , so after the baby fell in the toilet , she called her landlord and told him that she 'd heard crying , Fang said .

The landlord saw the baby and called police , the officer said , adding that the woman later begged police not to tell her story to anyone , including her parents , because she did n't want public attention , according to the officer .

The mother 's parents have agreed to help the mother take care of the baby , and police have identified a man they believe is the father . The police are conducting blood tests to confirm paternity , the officer told CNN .

Fang said that the mother has legal custody of the child and can decide if she wants help from the baby 's father .
