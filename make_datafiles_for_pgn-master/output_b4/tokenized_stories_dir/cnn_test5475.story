-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three woman in the Dominican Republic were paid to claim , falsely , that they had sex with U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez , police said in a statement Monday .

The women were paid by attorney Melanio Figueroa , who worked with Miguel Galvan , another attorney , they said .

Galvan has previously said that another lawyer asked him to assist in a divorce case by finding `` witnesses '' to claim they had sex with Menendez for money .

Attempts to contact Figueroa on Monday were unsuccessful .

For their services , two of the women received a bit more than $ 400 . The third woman was paid close to $ 300 , police said .

Menendez , a New Jersey Democrat , has long denied a report that accused him of partying with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic .

Confessions shows sex claims were ` false smears , ' senator says

The Daily Caller , a conservative website , first published the report shortly before the November election , citing a video with two women claiming they had sex with Menendez for money .

The three woman identified by police told investigators they made a recording . They first went to a hotel room to do it but later moved to a commercial area with an Internet connection after the connection at the hotel proved inadequate .

`` The evidence released today by Dominican law enforcement authorities proves what we have said all along : that the smear campaign against Senator Menendez is based on lies , lies we now know were paid for by interests whose identities have not yet been fully disclosed , '' Menendez 's communications director Tricia Enright said in a statement .

She urged authorities in the United States to investigate the case .

Menendez told CNN in January that the claims he 'd partied with prostitutes were `` absolutely false , '' calling the allegations `` smears . ''

Menendez faces scrutiny over ties to Florida doctor

In addition to those claims , Menendez has faced criticism over accepting unreported plane flights and allegedly advocating on behalf of a business .

Questions revolve around the senator 's relationship with Salomon Melgen , a Florida man who owned a plane Menendez admits to having flown on three times to the Dominican Republic in 2010 . One flight was on official Senate business , and two others were for personal reasons .

Melgen , his wife , Flor , and his daughter , Melissa , have been generous donors to Menendez , his fellow Democrats and related causes in recent years .

In January , Menendez paid approximately $ 58,500 to Melgen for the flights he took in 2010 , chalking up the lapse in payment to his busy schedule .

`` I was in a big travel schedule in 2010 as the chair of the -LRB- Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee -RRB- , plus my own campaign getting ready for a re-election cycle , and in the process of all of that , it unfortunately fell through the cracks , '' he told CNN 's Dana Bash , adding that when it came to his attention that the payment had not been made , he `` personally paid '' for it in order to meet his obligation .

Menendez has also been in hot water for raising questions before Obama administration officials about a port security contract for a company in which Melgen has a stake . The company had a contract to screen cargo that went through Dominican ports , but Menendez argued last July during a Senate subcommittee hearing that Dominican authorities did n't want to `` live by '' the contract .

Asked if he used his influence to help Melgen , Menendez told Bash : `` I have always advocated for issues and I have advocated for policies , and that 's what I have done across the board . ''
