-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police call the relationship `` toxic . '' If the details of the police report are accurate , folks wo n't need much convincing .

Bear the Pomeranian disappeared in early August after the dog 's owner and her then-boyfriend Ryan Eddy Watenpaugh had an argument .

The woman fled her apartment after she was physically assaulted by Watenpaugh , she told police in Redding , California . When she returned , Bear was gone .

The couple , which police say had a tumultuous dating relationship that included the woman being held against her will , briefly reconciled the first week in September . Watenpaugh , 35 , cooked her a meal that included meat .

Then the text messages began .

`` How 's your dog taste ? I thought it was better with BBQ and those Hawaiian buns . ''

`` I guess u could bury what u did n't eat . ''

`` The smile on my face when you read this ... priceless , '' CNN affiliate KRCR reported .

Then early Tuesday , Watenpaugh showed up at the woman 's house and left a small bag by her front door , police say . Inside was a note and two dog paws .

`` Burn in hell , '' the note says . `` I hate you so much it hurts . Stay away from me . I want nothing to do with you . F -- you . '' At the bottom of the note : a smiley face .

Redding police arrested him two days later . They say he 's admitted to sending the messages and placing the dog paws at the woman 's residence , but has denied killing or cooking Bear .

`` You know this is extremely strange , '' Redding Sgt. Todd Cogle told KRCR . `` Unusual , something we had never seen before . ''

Watenpaugh has been charged with domestic violence , false imprisonment , stalking and animal cruelty . He 's being held on $ 250,000 bail in the Shasta County jail .
