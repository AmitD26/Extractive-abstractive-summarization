Surabaya , Indonesia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman grieving for her brother and his family . Two teenage girls looking for their parents . A woman hoping her fiance is still alive .

They are among the distraught families of passengers and crew on AirAsia Flight QZ8501 who are gathering at airports in the region , hoping that their relatives are safe . The plane carrying 162 people disappeared Sunday morning traveling from Surabaya to Singapore .

Oei Endang Sulsilowati and her daughter arrived at the Juanda international Aiport in Surabaya looking for news of her brother , Oei Jimmy Sentosa Winata , his wife and their 13-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter .

`` We saw what had happened on the television , and we are coming here to find out what is happening , '' Sulsilowati said .

Her brother 's family was traveling to Japan via Singapore , she said .

`` I knew about this incident from watching TV and tried to get more information from my family . But my brother never flew with AirAsia , so I kept calm . Then someone told me that they saw his name on TV .

`` Then I saw it , '' she said , breaking down in tears .

`` We are just waiting for news ''

Now they just wait .

`` We do n't know what to do , '' she said . `` We are just waiting for news . ''

Two young teenage schoolgirls arrived at Juanda International in the early hours .

According to relatives and school officials who were traveling with the girls , they are friends whose parents were on the flight . The parents were traveling to Singapore to spend New Year 's with their daughters . That flight never arrived , so the girls traveled to Surabaya to find out what had happened to their parents .

They sat at a desk staffed by AirAsia officials , looking lost and bewildered , as they waited for information .

At Changi Airport in Singapore , Louise Sidharta told Channel NewsAsia her fiance and his family were on the plane .

`` When I was on the way to the airport , I listened to the radio and they said his plane was missing , '' she said .

`` It was supposed to be his last vacation with his family '' before the wedding , she said .

Indonesia is by far the hardest hit in this mystery because 149 of the 155 passengers were from that country . Surabaya is the crisis center . AirAsia Group CEO and founder Tony Fernandes flew in late Sunday night .

` It 's unbelievable '

His first words at the news conference : `` We are very devastated by what 's happened , it 's unbelievable .

`` Our concern right now is for the relatives and for the next of kin -- there is nothing more important to us , for our crew 's family , and for the passengers ' families . ''

On Monday morning , he briefed the families behind closed doors . It 's not known what he said .

AirAsia staff has been taking families from Juanda International to the nearby Ibis Hotel to keep them together and , critically , to keep them informed .

Many family members are in shock . They 're teary-eyed , exhausted , confused and afraid .

Some are grieving ; others exude pure despair . Children are among them , in some cases clearly too young to grasp what 's going on .

`` I should have gone with them but I canceled it two weeks ago as I had something to do , '' one relative of a passenger said , sobbing , according to a translation by Channel NewsAsia .

Speaking at Juanda International Airport , the relative -- whose name was not given -- said , `` This morning before I went to pray , one of them called me and jokingly said , ` See you in the new year and goodbye forever . ' That 's all , and then the bad news came . ''

` We still have hope '

William Kai , waiting in Surabaya for news of his brother-in-law and three other relatives who were on the flight , said he 's hopeful the plane will be found soon , according to the BBC .

`` This flight is only from Surabaya to Singapore , so it 's not like it 's missing in the Indian Ocean or the big seas , '' he said . `` It 's just there . So it should be easier to find . ''

He also said he 's not giving up hope for the safe return of his relatives .

`` We still have hope , '' he said . `` We can not lose hope . ''

The losses will be felt around the world . While nearly everyone on the flight is from Indonesia , there are also three South Koreans , one Malaysian , a French co-pilot , one Briton and one Singaporean , the airline said . Sixteen passengers were children and one was an infant .

The British national is Indonesia-based energy executive Choi Chi Man , and the Singaporean citizen is his 2-year-old daughter , Zoe , Channel NewsAsia reported .

Their names are on a flight manifest released by the airline .

Airline vows to help families through the ` nightmare '

Sunu Widyatmoko , the CEO of AirAsia Indonesia , said the company 's `` main priority is keeping the families of our passengers and colleagues informed on the latest developments . ''

`` We will do everything possible to support them as the investigation continues and have already mobilized a support team to help take care of their immediate needs , including accommodation and travel arrangements , '' he said .

Fernandes took to Twitter to console families and offer more information .

`` I am touched by the massive show of support especially from my fellow airlines , '' he wrote . `` This is my worse nightmare . But there is no stopping . ''

The company switched its logo on its Twitter and Facebook pages from bright red to gray .

What role did weather play ?

Families first

Peter Goelz , a CNN aviation analyst , chaired a task force that wrote the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996 , which the U.S. Congress passed to provide guidance on how to deal with families when responding to these types of crises .

That legislation `` set the worldwide standard '' in aviation disaster response , according to Goelz , and iterations of it have been adopted by `` virtually every country '' -- including Indonesia .

`` The key is families need to hear it first . They need to hear what 's going on , and they need to hear it from the investigators , '' Goelz said on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' `` If you do n't get the information to the families , it 's just torturous . ''

Pope Francis said Sunday his thoughts `` are with those on board the missing AirAsia plane '' and with their loved ones .
