-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I was introduced to pop -- soda for you Southerners -- at a young age .

My parents used it as a treat , like birthday cake . As I got older , I remember having pop around the house all the time .

As a kid , my drink of choice was Mountain Dew . I loved the taste of an ice cold Dew on a hot summer day . A lot of my favorite memories are associated with its sweet taste .

As I matured , my taste changed to Diet Pepsi and , more recently , Diet Coke . I enjoyed starting my day with a Diet Coke before the first period class arrived . It was part of my relaxation routine -- a comfort drink , so to speak . The taste , the sound , the `` fizz . '' I would tell people , `` I need my caffeine . ''

10 reasons to give up diet soda

I was aware of all the health problems that have been linked to drinking pop . It never stopped me . The empty calories , the dangers of sugar and artificial sweeteners could n't sway me . I had to have it .

After my first dose in the morning , I crashed a few hours later . I experienced huge energy swings throughout the day . I had acid reflux disease . But those could n't be because of what I drank , could it ?

This habit had a trickle-down effect to my children . I had it in the house at all times . My girlfriend kept it in her house as well . But it was n't a habit I wanted my two teenage girls starting up . I wanted to be a better role model . My words do n't hold much value if I am drinking what I tell them that they can not , I thought .

Then , on December 30 , that all changed . After I was selected to be part of the CNN Fit Nation team , I decided to take a look at all aspects of my life . What can I do to make myself healthier ? I asked myself .

How the ` Sassy Six ' came to be

That day , I decided to do the unthinkable : I quit drinking pop .

Do n't assume this has been easy for me . I struggle with the thought of it . I miss it and can still taste it six weeks later . Giving up pop has been one of the most difficult things I have done , and yet it 's also one of the healthiest .

Although I miss every aspect of drinking a Diet Coke every day , I know my body feels better . I feel less dependent on this comfort food . If I 'm having a bad day , I do n't have to run upstairs and grab a Diet Coke . I definitely have more energy , and my body does n't ache .

I have not had an issue with acid reflux since I quit . Is that a coincidence ? I think not .

Now I have to retrain my brain . Water has become my drink of choice . I know ... water is boring . But I have come to appreciate how good an ice cold glass of water actually tastes .

The desire to change myself into a healthier version became more important than the desire to drink pop . It took me a while to realize that I needed to make that change . I wish I had listened to my body sooner !

I challenge you to do the same . Will you give up pop with me ? Or make another small change in order to be healthier ? Tell me your plan in the comments below , and share your success with me on Twitter @TriHardMike .
