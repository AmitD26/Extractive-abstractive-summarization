-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Along the Rust Belt and in cities dotting the Northeast and Upper Midwest , Catholic communities are mourning the loss of parishes . It 's a five-year trend of sweeping church closures that most recently hit Cleveland , Ohio .

St. James parish in Lakewood , Ohio , is slated to close . The interior replicates a 16th-century Sicilian cathedral .

Wally Martens , a Cleveland native , can look out his kitchen window and see the spiritual home that has served his family for five generations . St. Ignatius of Antioch has been with him and his loved ones through life and death .

`` It 's the place where most of us were baptized , most of us got married , most of us graduated from grade school and some of us were buried , '' Martens , 68 , said of the west side urban parish that serves 1,200 households . To find out that the building is set to be shuttered is `` like losing somebody in your family . ''

Earlier this month , Bishop Richard G. Lennon of the Diocese of Cleveland , which serves more than 750,000 Catholics , announced that 29 parishes will close and 41 others will merge . The reconfiguration plan , which will effectively cut 52 parishes in the current tally of 224 , is scheduled to go into effect by June 30 , 2010 .

`` Closing a parish is very emotional , '' Bishop Lennon said in a written statement . `` I have personally experienced the closing of my own childhood parish in Boston , which members of my family helped establish in 1914 . ... I pray that my decisions will serve the needs of this Diocese and its people . '' Parishioners speak out on closings ''

Other cities that have had waves of closures have included places as various as Camden , New Jersey ; Allentown , Pennsylvania ; and New York City . All of this comes at a time when the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life reports that Catholicism in America has lost more affiliated members than any other faith tradition .

There are reportedly 67.1 million Catholics in the U.S. , according to The Official Catholic Directory 2008 . Compared to the 2007 number of 67.5 , that 's about a 400,000 decrease in one year . And the Pew Forum found that approximately a third of its survey respondents who were raised in the Roman Catholic Church no longer attend the church .

What drove the decision to close parishes in Cleveland were population shifts to outlying areas , financial strains that have 42 percent of parishes `` operating in the red '' and priest shortages , diocese spokesman Robert Tayek explained .

The bishop , he said , is trying to find `` an equitable solution . ''

But the announcement has raised many questions . Among them : What happens to the struggling neighborhoods that have come to rely on outreach and programs offered by some of these inner-city parishes ?

`` Too many bishops are treating parishes as if they were Starbucks franchises , '' said Sister Christine Schenk , a Cleveland-area nun who 's been fighting for nearly two decades to institute change in the church through her organization FutureChurch .

`` It 's about more than money . It 's about mission to the people , '' she said . `` This is n't what Jesus would do . ''

The Rev. Bob Begin of Saint Colman could n't agree more .

`` The founder of our church started his mission by saying , ` I came to bring good news to the poor , ' '' said Begin , who described his parish as serving about 1,300 people in a community where the average income is below $ 20,000 .

Saint Colman , which is slated to merge with another parish elsewhere , gets daily knocks on its doors from nearby residents , many of them immigrants from 25 different countries , who are in need of all kinds of assistance , he said .

`` If this parish were n't involved in bringing good news to the poor , I would not spend a lick of energy trying to keep it open , '' the pastor said . `` But because it is bringing good news to the poor , then I have a responsibility to guard and defend this mission against anyone who threatens it . ''

His parish and others affected by the recent announcement had until 5 p.m. Friday to file an appeal with the diocese . According to The Plain Dealer , which conducted a survey of the parishes , at least 11 had filed as of Friday morning . The diocese itself refused to comment on numbers .

For those who did n't file , the bishop 's decision is final . But if what happened in Boston , Massachusetts , is any indication , no parish should count on the appeal working .

Bishop Lennon came to Cleveland from the Archdiocese of Boston , where he oversaw the reorganization and closure of parishes and came under harsh criticism from many . One such critic was Peter Borré , chairman of the Council of Parishes , a Boston-based advocacy group for imperiled parishes .

In 2004 , within months of the Archdiocese of Boston announcing it would pay a settlement of $ 85 million to more than 500 alleged sex abuse victims , 83 parishes were put on the chopping block , `` which was a head spinner , '' Borré said .

In the end , because of his organization 's relentless efforts , Borré said , only 60 parishes were cut .

His group coordinated around-the-clock vigils or sit-ins that are ongoing , four and a half years later , in five Boston-area parishes . He also has led the charge to navigate the appeal process for nine parishioner groups that have now taken their battle all the way up to the Apostolic Signatura , or , as Borré called it , the `` Vatican Supreme Court . ''

The assumption is that the highest level of the Vatican will deny the appeals this spring , but Borré said it is important to him and the others to fight as far as they can go .

`` Other than vigils , this is the only step still open to us , '' he said . `` Secondly , we are the lead dog on this sled . We are the first that has experienced this phenomenon , and we have made it a self-appointed task to let the rest of America know what to expect . ''

As of Friday morning , eight Cleveland parishes had reached out to Borré for language to help in their appeals . Others likely drafted letters of their own .

But some affected parishes had no intention of fighting .

Ray Daull , 68 , a deacon at Christ the King in Cleveland Heights says a merger , which will combine his parish with three others , is a good thing . It 'll be sad to see his church of 52 years go , but given its deficit and shrinking attendance , with a merger , `` We will have more resources ... and the money can go into doing our work , '' he said .

But for parishes such as St. Ignatius of Antioch , the one Wally Martens can see from his window , accepting the end is not yet possible .

`` There was a general gasp , and then sadness turned to madness , '' the Rev. James McGonegdal , Marten 's pastor of 20 years , said of the announcement he made at Mass on March 15 . `` Some of the parishes knew they 'd be closing , whereas for St. Ignatius and a couple other parishes , it was almost like a sudden death . You grieve in a different way . ''

A standing-room only crowd poured into the parish last Sunday to show growing support . Martens said in a week 's time , $ 900,000 had been pledged to finance the church and send a message to the diocese .

For Martens ' 92-year-old mother , Pauline , pondering life without her parish is unthinkable . For most of her life , it 's the only one she 's known .

`` I just thought the church would go on forever , '' she said . `` I expected to be buried from there . But I guess the way things are going , I just do n't know what 'll happen to me . ''
