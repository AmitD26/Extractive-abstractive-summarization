-LRB- CNN -RRB- In the azure waters off the rocky coast of Antikythera , a remote island in the Mediterranean with a population of less than 50 , an international team of archaeologists has recovered new treasures from one of the most mysterious shipwrecks of all time .

The group of maritime archaeology experts have been at the site since mid-September and armed with the most advanced marine technology available , they have conducted the first-ever scientific excavation of the Antikythera wreck .

Despite facing fierce winds and choppy seas during the 30-day mission , the reclaimed items include tableware , anchors and other maritime components , as well as a giant spear , which they believe once belonged to a life-sized bronze warrior statue .

The recovered artifacts have been described as `` very promising '' by project co-director Theotokis Theodoulou in a press release from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute -LRB- WHOI -RRB- . The U.S.-based WHOI worked with Theodoulou and the Hellenic Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities in Greece to lead the expedition . He added : `` We have a lot of work to do at this site to uncover its secrets . ''

World 's first computer found at wreck

In 1900 , sponge divers from the Greek island of Symi anchored along the eastern coastline of the island while waiting for a ferocious storm to pass . What they would stumble upon would stun the world .

Underneath the crystalline waters , lay the incredible wreck undiscovered for thousands of years . And as the site was explored over the next year , they would uncover life-size bronze statues and remarkable artifacts . But it was the 1902 recovery of a clump of calcified stone with mysterious inscriptions that would push the wreck into archaeological lore .

The heavily corroded bronze fragments would turn out to be what has been described as the world 's earliest known `` computer , '' designed in the first century BC -- the Antikythera Mechanism . Built to track the astronomical calendar and lunar movements , later radiographic image analysis of the mechanism revealed 30 intricate gear wheels .

Famed underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau visited the site in 1976 to film a documentary and returned from below the surface with treasures galore . Since then , the site had remained dormant under the aegis of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture for almost 40 years .

`` The Antikythera shipwreck is maybe the most important , most famous shipwreck from antiquity , '' Brendan Foley , an archaeologist from WHOI and co-director of the expedition told CNN before the dive began in September . `` We are hardcore scientists and archaeologists . We hate to speak of treasure but in this case , it 's actually a treasure ship and there are just no two ways about it . ''

Shrouded in mystery

Analysis of the reclaimed artifacts has dated the vessel to the first century BC , while a horde of gold coins retrieved from the water suggests the boat 's origins lie east , from Asia Minor . But no one knows for certain how big it is , what it was doing there or why it went down . Yet .

Foley said : `` This not just an everyday trader . This is probably one of the largest , most expensive ships that was sailing in the first century BC . The 1901 sponge divers reported that the artifacts were spread among an area about 52 meters along the seafloor . And that corresponds nicely with what we 've observed in our dives on the site . ''

Supported by the Hellenic Navy , Foley and his 32-man team have been provided with research vessels capable of raising artifacts weighing up to five tons straight off the seabed .

`` You never want to speak about absolutes or guarantees but I 've never felt more confident in a shipwreck that there is going to be something interesting on it , '' Foley said . `` In the 1901 and '76 operations , they were getting gemstones , gold stones and human remains . And human remains almost never come up from ancient shipwrecks . So with modern ancient DNA analysis , there are all kinds of questions that can now be posed if we recover some . ''

With the location at around 55 meters deep , it 's not particularly hard to get to .

Foley explained : `` This shipwreck is close to the shore . It 's only about 70 meters off the cliff face so it makes it very difficult to bring in a big ship to support any kind of robotic systems so we came up with a plan and have been putting it into practice over the last three years -- incrementally training on new technology so that we could get and do very vigorous science .

`` At the most basic level , if we can come away from this important shipwreck site with a very , very good map and a much better understanding of the layout of the wreck , from that data we can begin to pose new questions to drive forward the research , '' explained Foley , who has worked with the Ministry of Culture in Greece for the last decade .

The international expedition started by mapping out the site using `` Sirius , '' an autonomous underwater vehicle -LRB- AUV -RRB- from the Australian Centre for Field Robotics . The AUV conducted a high-resolution survey of the wreck site to create precise 3D documentation of the expansive debris field . Meanwhile , technical divers equipped with metal detectors scanned the seafloor to determine the extent of the wreckage under the sediment before test trench excavations were able to begin .

Underwater `` Iron Man ''

The team also arrived in Greece with a next-generation diving suit that could revolutionize the future of ocean exploration . Looking like something straight out of `` Iron Man , '' the Exosuit is an atmospheric diving system , created by Vancover-based Nuytco Research , originally designed for offshore exploration of oil fields . Repurposed for the expedition , Foley explained it offers the team extensive bottom time at the site .

`` The system itself for the Exosuit has life support for something like 40 hours if all went to hell . I mean , really , it 's when you get tired and sore , and want to have a sandwich and use the toilet , that you come up , '' he said .

And the best part is the simplicity of the technology , revealed its creator Phil Nuytten .

`` You can literally operate the Exosuit after a few hours of training . The majority of the training is spent in emergency drills . But the actual functioning of it is as simple as learning to drive a golf cart , '' said Nuytten , a pioneer in deep-sea exploratory technology .

`` The suit is controlled by footpads that can tilt forward , backwards or from side to side . ''

Aside from Exosuit 's ease , Nuytten also highlighted how the suit negates some of the side effects of conventional saturation diving , like decompression sickness and prolonged , unnecessary dive times .

`` In the Exosuit , you jump into it and the compression time is zero . You 're down to 1,000 ft within 10 minutes and you can spend six to eight hours there and then come back in 10 minutes instead of 10 days . ''

But for the dive team , it 's the opportunity for exploration that is the biggest pull of Exosuit .

`` We figure by the end of the first two days with Exosuit , we 'll have more time on the Antikythera shipwreck than any other dive put together that 's gone before it , '' said Foley .

A doomed dowry ?

It 's been a mammoth undertaking and with a bill at over â‚¬ 2 million -LRB- over $ 2.5 million -RRB- , the team was hoping the Mediterranean would yield some of its secrets . Prior to this scientific dive , the archaeologists had little to go on and were left to come up with theories based on the little historical evidence at hand .

When human remains -- including a skull that was 80 % intact -- were recovered in ' 76 , a treasure trove of jewelry , perfume bottles and other female-related trinkets were found close by .

`` One of our pet theories is that maybe this ship was carrying a really wealthy woman from Asia Minor , and she was going to be married and this cargo was her dowry . It 's impossible to prove but it 's a nice romantic notion , '' said Foley .

With such a long passage of time between when the ship sank and the present day , and so many unanswered questions , the scientists and archaeologists expect to be working on the project for at least the next five years . And it 's a journey Foley is excited to have embarked on .

`` I like to think of shipwrecks as books , books in a library . The seafloor is a vast library and with every single shipwreck , there is a book telling us about the past and the artifact that we raise is like a page in that book .

`` So if we want to try to recreate the ancient past and figure out who we are , who we came from , why we live in this modern world , then the only way to do that is to look at the physical remains of past cultures . ''
