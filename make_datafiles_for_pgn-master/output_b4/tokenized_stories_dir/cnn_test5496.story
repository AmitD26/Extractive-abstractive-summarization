-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Amtrak Train 91 was way behind schedule . More than 13 hours behind schedule , thanks to a nearly half-day stranding just 2 miles from a train station .

The Miami-bound Silver Star train had departed New York City on Sunday at 11:02 a.m. with 261 passengers aboard , and it was supposed to arrive just after 5 p.m. in the Richmond , Virginia , area . Instead it arrived there on Monday around 6:45 a.m. , according to Amtrak 's website .

`` The dining car developed axle problems that disabled the train 2 miles north of the Staples Mill Road Station in Richmond around 5:30 p.m. Sunday , '' said Amtrak spokeswoman Kimberly Woods , via e-mail . `` The dining car could n't be moved or cut out at the scene , because of the axle problems . ''

`` The train was between stops so safely removing the passengers or arranging alternate transportation was too problematic , '' Woods said .

`` The train began a very slow move -LRB- at 3:45 a.m. -RRB- to a siding in Richmond and arrived to the station just after 6:30 a.m. and a replacement car was added , '' she said . `` The train resumed its trip around 7:12 a.m. '' -LRB- A siding is a section of track off the main line . -RRB-

During the delay , passengers were free to move around inside the train , and they had access to food and water , bathrooms , and heating and air conditioning , she said .

Passenger Kevin Smith was frustrated at how long it took Amtrak to solve the problem .

`` If you are a corporation that alienates its customer base , you ai n't going to have customers , '' Smith told CNN affiliate WTVR . `` I think Amtrak could have solved this a lot sooner . ''

Smith did n't fault the Amtrak employees on board , calling them fellow victims of the delay . `` The employees ca n't be faulted here . It 's obvious there 's an equipment problem . ''

Woods encouraged passengers to call 1-800-USA-RAIL for information about refunds and credits .

`` A delay of this magnitude is considered rare and we understand the passengers ' frustrations from last night 's events , '' she said .
