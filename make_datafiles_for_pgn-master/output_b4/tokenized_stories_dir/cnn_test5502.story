-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ashton Kutcher 's quiet romance with Mila Kunis has reportedly blossomed into an engagement .

The former `` That '70s Show '' co-stars have never been shy about PDA since they began dating in 2012 , but neither one has talked much about the relationship .

Reps for both actors have been mum , with only a telltale photo of a diamond ring on Kunis ' left hand to fuel speculation she and Kutcher will soon be tying the knot .

But how did these two go from friends and co-workers to a couple ? Here 's a recap of the love story :

1998 : Kutcher , then 20 , landed a role in `` That '70s Show , '' the Fox comedy about a high school kid growing up in Wisconsin during the late 1970s . Kutcher was the ditzy pretty boy Kelso , and Mila Kunis , at 15 , was Kelso 's on-again , off-again girlfriend , Jackie .

At the time , Kutcher was in a relationship with a pre - `` Mad Men '' January Jones , but working together definitely helped Kutcher and Kunis bond .

The actress told People magazine in 2001 that Kutcher , a former model , was her first kiss .

`` I was so nervous and uncomfortable , '' Kunis recalled . `` I had the biggest crush on him . ''

Kutcher , on the other hand , insisted in 2001 that he was the nervous wreck .

`` She acted so cool . She seemed as if she 'd done it a thousand times , '' Kutcher told the magazine . `` I was the one with the butterflies in my stomach . I mean , here 's this little girl , and I have to kiss her . It was nerve-racking . ''

2002 : With `` That '70s Show '' turning both Kutcher and Kunis into household names , their private lives became the interest of the public . Kutcher moved on from Jones and began dating actresses such as Ashley Scott and the late Brittany Murphy .

Meanwhile , Kunis struck up a relationship with Macaulay Culkin of `` Home Alone '' fame in 2002 , and their relationship lasted for eight years .

2005 : By now , Kutcher had fallen for Demi Moore , nearly 16 years his senior , and they wed in a private Kabbalah ceremony in 2005 .

2006 : As `` That '70s Show '' came to an end , Kutcher and Kunis had apparently forged an enduring friendship . When they were first spotted spending a lot of time together in 2012 , Kunis ' rep brushed off the romance reports by saying that `` they have been friends for years . ''

2011 : Kutcher and Kunis moved on personally and professionally after `` That '70s Show . '' Kutcher had been trying his hand in films with romantic comedies such as `` What Happens In Vegas '' -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , `` Valentine 's Day '' -LRB- 2010 -RRB- and `` No Strings Attached '' -LRB- 2011 -RRB- .

In 2011 , Moore released a statement she was ending her marriage to the star . `` It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton , '' she said at the time . `` As a woman , a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred , and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life . ''

April 2012 : The April following his separation from Moore , Kutcher and Kunis began spending a large amount of time together . They were seen dining out and going furniture shopping , and they reportedly went on a weekend trip .

A `` Kutcher source '' was n't surprised by the turn of events , telling People magazine that while nothing happened during `` That '70s Show , '' Kutcher `` was always talking about how beautiful she is . But she was with Macaulay -LRB- Culkin -RRB- for a lot of that time and also just generally gave off a not interested vibe . ''

Yet when `` Extra '' asked Kunis what was going on with Kutcher , the actress called the dating rumors `` absurd '' and said , `` A friend is a friend . ''

September 2012 : At some point , these `` friends '' found something more . While Kunis insisted she was having a hard time finding a date in July 2012 , paparazzi photos told a different story . She was seen kissing Kutcher in New York 's Central Park that September , a month after the two were rumored to have taken a vacation to Bali and two months after they seemed very into each other at a wrap party for his Steve Jobs biopic , `` Jobs . ''

December 2012 : As their relationship became more apparent , Kunis and Kutcher headed on a trip to his hometown in Iowa for the holidays .

February 2013 : While on Ellen DeGeneres ' talk show , Kunis was visibly flustered when the host grilled her about her relationship with Kutcher .

`` Have you talked to him at all ? When was the last time you talked to him ? '' DeGeneres asked .

Kunis , failing to keep a straight face , replied , `` Um , you know , it 's been , give or take , a couple minutes . ''

March 2013 : Last spring , Kutcher explained his reluctance to talk about what had become a pretty obvious love affair . `` You know , I 've learned the hard way how valuable privacy is , '' he told Elle magazine in its March 2013 issue . `` And I 've learned that there are a lot of things in your life that really benefit from being private . And relationships are one of them . And I am going to do everything in my power to have this relationship be private . ''

November : Following rumors that Kutcher and Kunis were engaged in September -- which turned out not to be true -- Kutcher became officially single again . Two years after Moore initially announced their marriage had ended , Kutcher 's attorney filed a document in court that made their final divorce settlement official .

January and February : As cameras kept catching Kutcher and Kunis in the act -- they were seen kissing courtside at a Los Angeles Lakers game -- Kunis began to open up a bit more about their bond . In a February interview with Cosmopolitan magazine , Kunis described her ideal date night :

`` We have a thing called white T-shirt night , and it 's when you wear jeans and a white T-shirt and you go on a date , '' she said . `` Nothing fancy , it 's just something that you love to do . ''
