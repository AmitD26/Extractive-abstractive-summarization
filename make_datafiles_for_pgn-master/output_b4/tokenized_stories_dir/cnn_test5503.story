-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Author Tim Federle has just wrapped a long day at the Atlanta Junior Theater festival , working with several thousand boys and girls who dream of stardom on the Broadway stage . Count these kids as lucky ; they 've found the perfect mentor .

Federle has danced in several big Broadway shows and a Super Bowl halftime show and worked as a choreographer with the young dancers of the hit musical `` Billy Elliot , '' and now he 's written his first novel , `` Better Nate Than Ever . ''

Despite his long day , an energetic Federle says , `` I think I was always a kid with his head in the clouds , '' which is appropriate since his book is about dreaming big .

In his novel , Nate Foster is a teenager who loves musical theater . Feeling a bit like an outsider at school , he escapes small-town Pennsylvania and hops a bus to New York , where he hopes to land a part in `` E.T. : The Musical '' and get back home before his parents find out .

The story is full of humor , a positive message and some Broadway insider moments . The book bears more than a passing resemblance to Federle 's own life , but he says , `` For legal purposes , enough is different that I do n't think my mom is going to sue me . ''

For Nate and for Federle , a love of musical theater is what sets them apart from their classmates , but it 's also their life-saver .

`` Musicals felt like a place where I could express myself in a safe way , even if my feelings were a little bit too big for school or home . It was the one place I really felt like , there 's lights , there 's scenery , and finally everything around me feels as big as my dreams , '' Federle said .

Whether it 's musical theater , sports or academics , Federle encourages young people to find that thing that makes them unique and hold on to it , because it could very well be their ticket to greatness and success as an adult .

`` I think so often when you 're a kid , we mellow out those more interesting edges in order to coast through middle school quietly . By the time you get to high school , you 're left asking , who the heck am I ? I would encourage kids to try and figure out the thing that sets you apart , not publicly but that you 're passionate about internally . ''

Federle hopes readers find `` Nate '' especially relevant in a day where many kids who want to perform on stage are bullied or picked on for being different .

`` Every time I think we 've gotten past the point where it 's weird to be a boy who performs , a girl who does n't quite fit in , I turn on the news , and I see another tragic story of a kid who could n't quite face what it felt to be alive amidst a group of kids who just did n't get them or would n't leave them alone . That tells me we can never have enough voices and mentors and stories . ''

While Federle ultimately made his Broadway dreams come true , after 10 years performing on stage , he found himself closing in on his 30th birthday and feeling like he was stuck in a creative rut . He thought about writing a novel but was n't sure he was up to the challenge .

It was his work as a choreographer on `` Billy Elliot , '' preparing young performers for a starring role on Broadway , that helped him conquer his own fears .

`` Here I was about to turn 30 , telling these kids to face their greatest fear and go out on stage for more than a thousand people who had all paid to see them play the title role in a Broadway show , and I was n't facing my own fear , which was to try writing . ''

Federle made a vow a week before he turned 30 to write a novel . Thirty days later , he had his first draft of `` Better Nate Than Ever . '' He calls the day he finished the book `` the best day of my life . ''

Now critics are raving about `` Nate . '' Kids love it , and even adults are approaching Federle .

`` Adults are saying to me , ` oh , my gosh , I remember what it was like , ' and it 's actually inspired a few to say things like , ` I 'm going to take up racquetball again , ' random stuff that has nothing to do with musicals . ''

Readers who are fans of TV shows like `` American Idol , '' `` The Voice '' and `` Glee '' might enjoy `` Better Nate Than Ever . '' Some may even read it looking for career tips .

Federle says desire , talent and hard work are all part of the equation , but what he really wants readers to take away from his book is to dream big , be brave and hold on to hope .

`` It 's really about putting yourself out there . Every time you leave the stage , you 're thinking , ` was that as good as I hoped it was , or was that as bad as I hope it was n't ? ' The amazing thing that every artist shares is , in a world where fear is huge , hope is just a little bit bigger . ''
