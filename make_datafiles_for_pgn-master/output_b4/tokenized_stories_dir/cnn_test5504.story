-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Working in public health for 14 years in Brownsville , Texas , in a border region with poor health conditions , has taught me a lot about how disease threats can get a boost from an unsuspected source .

For tuberculosis , this unsuspected source is now diabetes .

Tuberculosis is common globally but mistakenly thought of as something that does not affect the United States . It is an airborne , bacterial infection , easily spread by coughing , and it can be fatal .

It often lies dormant in the body for many years , and most of the 11 million people in the United States who have the infection are not even aware of it . The only vaccine has limited effectiveness and is not given in the United States .

TB continues to have a serious impact in America , with nearly 9,600 cases in 2013 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . It is not only an issue on the U.S. border with Mexico ; rather , it is found in every state , with a particular impact in Florida , Texas , California and New York . Drug-resistant varieties pose an alarming threat since the required treatment is so lengthy and often toxic .

Today , the biggest risk for tuberculosis is not HIV/AIDS , which led to a surge in cases in the late 1980s , but diabetes . Diabetes impairs the immune system and leaves a person who has been exposed to TB much more likely to develop active disease .

Fast facts on tuberculosis

This is precisely what we saw when we started to investigate TB in communities on the border with Mexico . The alarm has spread to California and the Pacific Northwest , where 20 % to 30 % of TB cases can be traced to diabetes . TB experts in Florida are also concerned about this phenomenon .

Is this on the radar of health providers treating diabetes patients in the United States ? Unfortunately , few are aware of the risk of TB or are looking for it .

They are also unaware that the course of TB disease is frequently more severe in patients with diabetes , who do not tolerate TB drugs well . Diabetes patients often have difficulty completing treatment , take longer to be cured and are more likely to relapse , even die , and develop drug-resistant TB .

TB physicians in Texas are acutely aware of the problem . One told me about a woman with severe diabetes in her 30s . When exposed to TB , she quickly developed active disease . Despite the best efforts of the medical staff , she was not able to absorb the TB medication due to nausea and vomiting .

As a result , her TB became drug-resistant , and she had to undergo a rigorous , two-year ordeal of treatment . Five of her children also became infected , and two had to be treated for active disease . She was cured and survived , but this is not always the case .

The dimensions of the problem are truly staggering . Diabetes is an exploding global epidemic , much larger than HIV/AIDS . In India , diabetes has nearly doubled the number of cases of TB .

Today , 26 million of the 382 million people with diabetes live in the United States . By 2035 , nearly 600 million people in the world will have diabetes , and by 2050 so will a third of all Americans , according to the International Diabetes Federation and the CDC . Ignoring this new threat could result in a reversal of the decline in TB experienced over recent years .

Diabetes took my teeth but not my life

So what do we need to do ?

We must educate health care providers , patients and communities . All TB patients should be screened for diabetes . Diabetes caregivers and their patients need to be aware of the risk of TB , and patients born in or traveling to neighborhoods or countries where TB is common should be screened . If TB is found , these patients need treatment , along with the support they need to get through the many months of daily medication .

We also need strong investment in research and development of TB vaccines , rapid and inexpensive diagnostic methods for both TB and diabetes , and fast-acting , easy-to-take TB medication .

Research largely depends on government funding since the pharmaceutical industry shows little interest in TB . Congress has not made TB a priority despite the increasing risk to the public at large .

We all know someone with diabetes . Diabetes could reverse the achievements of several decades in TB control , but , if we combine good science , adequate funding and above all , political will , we can get ahead of this looming crisis .

We responded slowly to the combined AIDS/TB threat in the 1980s . We need to react faster to the diabetes/TB threat today .

Diabetes continues to spread around the world

The rise in diabetes cases is worrisome , especially for tuberculosis , doctor says
