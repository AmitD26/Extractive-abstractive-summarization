-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the number of swine flu cases rises around the world , so is a gradual backlash -- with some saying the threat the virus poses is overblown .

Workers in South Korea , where one case of swine flu is confirmed , disinfect a terminal Sunday at Incheon airport .

By Monday , 985 cases of the virus , known as influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , had been confirmed in 20 countries , the World Health Organization said . The number of fatalities was at 26 , including one in the United States .

`` There is too much hysteria in the country and so far , there has n't been that great a danger , '' said Congressman Ron Paul , a Republican from Texas . `` It 's overblown , grossly so . ''

Paul , who was a freshman congressman during a swine flu outbreak in 1976 , said Congress voted to inoculate the whole country at the time .

Twenty-five people died from the inoculation while one person was killed by the flu , Paul said , adding that he voted against inoculation . Watch Ron Paul talk about 1976 swine flu ''

The United States ' only death this year from the virus was a 22-month-old boy in Texas who was visiting from Mexico . The other 25 deaths happened in Mexico .

`` I wish people would back off a little bit , '' Paul said .

Others shared Paul 's sentiment , saying the fear of the flu has gotten out of hand .

`` We have people without symptoms going into the emergency rooms asking to be screened for swine flu at the expense of people with real illness , '' said Cathy Gichema , a nurse in Pikesville , Maryland .

`` Schools are being shut for probable causes -- sending these kids congregating to the malls . How is that helping ? '' Gichema said .

Dr. Mark Bell , principal of Emergent Medical Associates , which operates 18 emergency departments in Southern California , said the level of fear is unprecedented .

`` I have n't seen such a panic among communities perhaps ever , '' Bell said . `` Right now , people think if they have a cough or a cold , they 're going to die . That 's a scary , frightening place to be in . I wish that this hysteria had not occurred and that we had tempered a little bit of our opinions and thoughts and fears in the media . ''

Governments and health officials , however , say the concern is not unfounded .

The virus , a hybrid of swine , avian and human flu , can jump from person to person with relative ease . And while most of the cases were reported in Mexico and the United States , some have been confirmed in countries outside North America .

On Saturday , the virus strain was found in a herd of swine in Alberta , Canada , and the animals may have caught the flu from a farmer who recently returned from a trip to Mexico .

It could be the first identified case of pigs infected in the recent outbreak .

`` We have determined that the virus H1N1 , found in these pigs , is the virus which is being tracked in the human population , '' said Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency .

But Evans and other officials said it is not uncommon for flu viruses to jump from humans to animals , and that it does not pose a risk for consuming pork . The number of pigs infected was not disclosed .

In his weekly radio address Saturday , President Obama said the concerns over the new virus are justified because lack of immunity makes it potentially risky .

`` Unlike the various strains of animal flu that were in the past , it 's a flu that is spreading from human to human . This creates the potential for a pandemic , which is why we are acting quickly and aggressively , '' Obama said .

The president , who said the virus is a `` cause for concern but not alarm , '' added the government has anti-viral treatment to treat the current strain of H1N1 .

In addition , WHO started distributing 2.4 million doses of a common anti-viral drug to 72 nations . iReport.com : How should H1N1 be handled ?

`` I think the world is infinitely better prepared than it was 90 years ago , '' said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl , referring to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed as many as 20 million people .

In Mexico , the epicenter of the outbreak , masks have become a common fixture . Nearly half the cases in Mexico involve patients 19 and younger , the health ministry said .

`` I can hold for maybe another week or two and that 's it , '' said Guillermo Jimenez , a waiter who has n't worked in a week since the government ordered about 35,000 public venues to shut down . `` We do n't have any money . We have mouths to feed . I do n't know what I 'm going to do now . ''

Still , some say the hype over H1N1 has led to undue hysteria .

`` I 'm sure the deaths in Mexico have something do with the infrastructure , '' said Anthony Markovich , a graduate student in Marina del Ray , California . `` I know our health care system has its flaws , but it is more advanced . ''

The world should focus on diseases that have more fatalities , according to Markovich .

`` This is a joke compared to other things going on , '' he said . `` Malaria is killing thousands of people daily , the economy is not getting any better , it is time to move on . ''

Pakistan resident Faisal Kapadia agreed .

`` When you put it in context , 700 cases in the world is nothing , '' said Kapadia , a commodities trader in Karachi . `` I understand it is a horrible new disease and governments should find a cure for it , but the media has created too much paranoia . ''
