U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan have killed far more people than the United States has acknowledged , have traumatized innocent residents and largely been ineffective , according to a new study released Tuesday .

The study by Stanford Law School and New York University 's School of Law calls for a re-evaluation of the practice , saying the number of `` high-level '' targets killed as a percentage of total casualties is extremely low -- about 2 % .

The report accuses Washington of misrepresenting drone strikes as `` a surgically precise and effective tool that makes the U.S. safer , '' saying that in reality , `` there is significant evidence that U.S. drone strikes have injured and killed civilians . ''

It also casts doubts on Washington 's claims that drone strikes produce zero to few civilian casualties and alleges that the United States makes `` efforts to shield the drone program from democratic accountability . ''

The drone strike program has long been controversial , with conflicting reports on its impact from U.S. and Pakistani officials and independent organizations .

President Barack Obama told CNN last month that a target must meet `` very tight and very strict standards , '' and John Brennan , the president 's top counter-terrorism adviser , said in April that in `` exceedingly rare '' cases , civilians have been `` accidentally injured , or worse , killed in these strikes . ''

In contrast to more conservative U.S. statements , the Stanford/NYU report -- titled `` Living Under Drones '' -- offers starker figures published by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism , an independent organization based at City University in London .

`` TBIJ reports that from June 2004 through mid-September 2012 , available data indicate that drone strikes killed 2,562 - 3,325 people in Pakistan , of whom 474 - 881 were civilians , including 176 children . TBIJ reports that these strikes also injured an additional 1,228 - 1,362 individuals , '' according to the Stanford/NYU study .

Based on interviews with witnesses , victims and experts , the report accuses the CIA of `` double-striking '' a target , moments after the initial hit , thereby killing first responders .

It also highlights harm `` beyond death and physical injury , '' publishing accounts of psychological trauma experienced by people living in Pakistan 's tribal northwest region , who it says hear drones hover 24 hours a day .

`` Before this we were all very happy , '' the report quotes an anonymous resident as saying . `` But after these drones attacks a lot of people are victims and have lost members of their family . A lot of them , they have mental illnesses . ''

People have to live with the fear that a strike could come down on them at any moment of the day or night , leaving behind dead whose `` bodies are shattered to pieces , '' and survivors who must be desperately sped to a hospital .

The report concedes that `` real threats to U.S. security and to Pakistani civilians exist in the Pakistani border areas now targeted by drones . '' And it acknowledges that drone strikes have `` killed alleged combatants and disrupted armed actor networks . ''

But it concludes that drone strikes , which are conducted by the CIA in a country not at war with the United States , are too harmful to civilians , too sloppy , legally questionable and do more harm to U.S. interests than good .

`` A significant rethinking of current U.S. targeted killing and drone strike policies is long overdue , '' it says . `` U.S. policy-makers , and the American public , can not continue to ignore evidence of the civilian harm and counter-productive impacts of U.S. targeted killings and drone strikes in Pakistan . ''

The study recommends that Washington undertake measures to rectify collateral damage -- including making public detailed legal justification for strikes , implementing mechanisms transparently to account for civilian casualties , ensuring independent investigations into drone strike deaths , prosecuting cases of civilian casualties and compensating civilians harmed by U.S. strikes in Pakistan .

Nine months of research went into the report , according to its authors , which included `` two investigations in Pakistan , more than 130 interviews with victims , witnesses , and experts , and review of thousands of pages of documentation and media reporting . ''

U.S. authorities have largely kept quiet on the subject of drone strikes in Pakistan .

However , the use of armed drones to target and kill suspected terrorists has increased dramatically during the Obama administration , according to Peter Bergen , CNN 's national security analyst and a director at the New America Foundation , a Washington-based think tank that monitors drone strikes .

Obama has already authorized 283 strikes in Pakistan , six times more than the number during President George W. Bush 's eight years in office , Bergen wrote earlier this month . As a result , the number of estimated deaths from the Obama administration 's drone strikes is more than four times what it was during the Bush administration -- somewhere between 1,494 and 2,618 .

However , an analysis by the New America Foundation says that the civilian casualty rate from drone strikes has been dropping sharply since 2008 despite the rising death toll .

`` The number of civilians plus those individuals whose precise status could not be determined from media reports -- labeled ` unknowns ' by NAF -- reported killed by drones in Pakistan during Obama 's tenure in office were 11 % of fatalities , '' said Bergen . `` So far in 2012 it is close to 2 % . Under President Bush it was 33 % . ''

The foundation 's analysis relies on credible media outlets in Pakistan , which in turn rely on Pakistani officials and local villagers ' accounts , Bergen said , rather than on U.S. figures .

The drone program is deeply unpopular in Pakistan , where the national parliament voted in April to end any authorization for it . This , however , was `` a vote that the United States government has simply ignored , '' according to Bergen .

Obama told CNN 's Jessica Yellin this month that the use of armed drones was `` something that you have to struggle with . ''

`` If you do n't , then it 's very easy to slip into a situation in which you end up bending rules thinking that the ends always justify the means , '' he continued . `` That 's not been our tradition . That 's not who we are as a country . ''

Obama also addressed his criteria for lethal action in the interview , although he repeatedly declined to acknowledge any direct involvement in selecting targets .

`` It has to be a target that is authorized by our laws . It has to be a threat that is serious and not speculative . It has to be a situation in which we ca n't capture the individual before they move forward on some sort of operational plot against the United States , '' Obama said .

His security adviser , Brennan , gave the Obama administration 's first public justification for drone strikes in his April speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center , a Washington think-tank .

Such strikes are used when capture is not a feasible option and are conducted `` in full accordance with the law , '' Brennan said .

`` We only authorize a strike if we have a high degree of confidence that innocent civilians will not be injured or killed , except in the rarest of circumstances , '' he said .

Despite the `` extraordinary precautions '' taken by the United States , Brennan said , civilians `` have been accidentally injured , or worse , killed in these strikes . It is exceedingly rare , but it has happened . When it does , it pains us , and we regret it deeply , as we do any time innocents are killed in war . ''

Brennan also cited the `` the seriousness , the extraordinary care '' taken by Obama and his national security team in deciding whether to use lethal force .

The London-based rights organization Reprieve , which with the help of a partner organization in Pakistan facilitated access to some of the people interviewed for the Stanford/NYU study , backed its finding that the drone program causes wider damage than is acknowledged by the U.S. government .

`` This shows that drone strikes go much further than simply killing innocent civilians . An entire region is being terrorized by the constant threat of death from the skies , '' said Reprieve 's director , Clive Stafford Smith .

`` Their way of life is collapsing : kids are too terrified to go to school , adults are afraid to attend weddings , funerals , business meetings , or anything that involves gathering in groups . Yet there is no end in sight , and nowhere the ordinary men , women and children of North West Pakistan can go to feel safe . ''
