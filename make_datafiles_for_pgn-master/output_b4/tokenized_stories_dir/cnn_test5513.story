-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Through time the art and architecture of the Islamic world has defined a civilization that once extended from Cordoba in Spain to the Mogul empire in China and India .

Today a new cultural landmark in Qatar brings together 14 centuries of that history under one roof at the Doha Museum of Islamic Art .

Designed by architect I.M. Pei , best known for his glass pyramids at Paris ' Louvre museum , the stunning building houses 3,800 square meters of treasures , spanning three continents .

From intricate metal work and calligraphy to ceramics , textiles and precious stones , the collection represents the feverish efforts of the Qatari royal family to assemble an unrivalled collection of Islamic antiquities over the past few years .

`` One of the enormous achievements is to have built up such a collection of such enormous historic and aesthetic importance in such a short space of time , '' Museum Director Oliver Watson told CNN .

Treasure trove of antiquities

Among the standout pieces in the museum 's collection are the earliest surviving pages of the Koran , dating from the late 7th century , the earliest surviving silk carpet from Iran and a 9th century Iraqi porcelain bowl .

Such objects bore enormous influence on the Islamic world and beyond . For example , Iraqi pottery such as the museum 's white glazed bowl with blue calligraphy was copied by the Chinese , eventually becoming the largest ceramics industry in the world .

`` The interesting thing is not only that the Islamic world had trade connections out to China , but that this kind of ware , that was n't used in China -LSB- at the time -RSB- was commissioned . These were works that were commissioned by merchants in Basra to be made in central China , '' Watson explained .

The Chinese `` took the blue color from the Middle East , and the Middle East was the first major customers for Chinese blue and white -LSB- porcelain -RSB- . ''

In a nearby gallery rests the jade pendant of Shah Jahan . The Mogul Emperor wore it as a necklace in the 17th century to calm the despair in his heart after his wife died during childbirth . Shah Jahan is perhaps better known for the mausoleum he built to his wife -- the Taj Mahal in India .

`` There is the whole history of a whole culture , a whole civilization embedded in these objects , and we are just beginning to explore that , '' said Watson .

Modern architectural icon

The Doha museum opened in 2008 with extravagant celebrations . In a region known for its glass and steel towers , this structure stands out as a modern icon paying homage to ancient traditions .

`` This building is very special to me , simply because it helped me to learn something about another world , another religion , another culture , '' said Pei at one of the opening events .

The building 's design combines minimalism , cubism and the arabesque . It has wide open spaces , geometric patterns typical of Islamic art , octagons , circles , domes and cubes .

Pei found his inspiration for the design in the courtyard of Cairo 's Ibn Tulun mosque , specifically the 13th century ablution fountain in the center , the sabil .
