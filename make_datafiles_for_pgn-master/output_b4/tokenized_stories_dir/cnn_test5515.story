BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. military coalition in Iraq confirmed Tuesday that a business jet -- not a U.S. military aircraft -- was recently forced down in Iran due to an airspace violation .

A Falcon business jet is shown in an undated file photo .

`` The airplane is now being confirmed as a light transport plane with no Americans onboard , '' Multi-National Forces-Iraq said in a statement issued Tuesday . `` From what we have been seeing , it was a Falcon business jet . We have accounted for all our aircraft and none are missing . ''

The U.S. coalition in Iraq had no information on who owned the aircraft , stressing that it was not a registered American plane .

Iran 's semi-official Fars News Agency initially reported that five American military officials were on board the U.S. aircraft . But other Iranian media reports -- quoting Iranian officials -- said the aircraft was Hungarian and no Americans were on the plane .

Iranian officials told Iran 's state-run Arabic language channel Al-Alam that the incident happened a week ago and that the plane was carrying humanitarian workers .

Fars later changed its Farsi language report , citing other Iranian and Arab media as saying the plane was not an American aircraft

Fars also initially reported that aircraft , which it called a `` Falcon fighter , '' entered Iranian airspace at a low altitude from Turkey to avoid radar detection , despite repeated warnings by the Islamic Republic Air Force . It said the plane also carried three civilians .

Washington is monitoring the reports , but White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said `` as far as we know -LRB- they are -RRB- totally bogus . ''

U.S. National Security Council Spokesman Gordon Johndroe also said there is no indication that the reports are accurate .

`` We 're looking into the various and conflicting reports coming from the Iranian ` news ' agencies , but do not have any information at this time that would lead us to believe they are correct , '' he said .

Fars said the aircraft , which was en route to Afghanistan , was forced to land at an Iranian airport that it did not name . Fars reported that the eight people aboard were released `` after daylong interrogations '' that revealed the aircraft had `` unintentionally '' violated Iran 's airspace .

Fars said the aircraft was later allowed to continue on to Afghanistan .

Two top U.S. military officials told CNN 's Barbara Starr that no U.S. military aircraft has been forced down . The U.S. military has an F-16 Fighting Falcon , but it is a one-seat jet fighter aircraft that is used by the U.S. Air Force for air-to-air and air-to-ground combat .

The Dassault Falcon is a European-made private passenger business jet that resembles a Lear jet . It can seat a crew of two and as many as 10 passengers . It 's used for passenger transport , but also has military uses .
