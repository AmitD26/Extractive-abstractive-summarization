-LRB- RollingStone.com -RRB- -- On May 4 , the day Adele turned 26 , the multi-platinum singer tweeted , `` Bye bye 25 ... See you again later in the year . ''

The tweet seemed to suggest that Adele 's much-anticipated follow-up to `` 21 '' would be arriving at some point in 2014 . However , according to the New York Times , that is no longer the case . A financial report from Adele 's label XL Recordings reveals that there are no plans to drop an album from the `` Rolling in the Deep '' singer in 2014 .

The good news is that XL made $ 15 million net profit this year , but further down in the report , which the label sent to regulators today , they added this sobering note : `` There will not be a further new release by Adele during 2014 and consequently there will be a fall in XL 's turnover and profits . Nevertheless , the directors are confident that by pursuing management policies ... XL will continue to achieve success with other artists . ''

In the report , the label notes that the singer 's back catalogue accounted for a `` significant proportion of the sales and profit '' during 2013 .

`` 21 '' sold more than 25 million copies worldwide , so the quiet revelation that 2014 will be Adele-less comes as an equally disappointing update to both XL 's distributor Columbia Records and the singer 's fans .

In a holiday season set to feature big album releases from Taylor Swift , Nicki Minaj , Pink Floyd , Foo Fighters and possibly Kendrick Lamar , Adele 's new LP was expected to be the marquee event and a dire shot in the arm for a music industry that has endured record low sales this year .

However , as we enter the fourth quarter of 2014 , Adele had n't made any announcements -- she has n't even tweeted since July -- or rolled out any new singles , which implied that the tentatively titled `` 25 '' might have to wait until `` 26 . ''
