Orinda , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As he lies in bed , Ryan Buchanan 's eyes flutter open . He gazes into his room but fixates on nothing . A stuffed toy lies motionless in his left hand .

Every two hours , a nurse turns him : first on his back , then to the right , then to the left .

Fourteen medications course through his gastrointestinal tube , given at different hours of the day . His parents or nurses monitor his oxygen levels , change his feeding bag , clean the various tubes that help him survive .

All this is happening in his bedroom , in the same home where Ryan grew up , learned to crawl , played with his dog and painted a California golden bear on his bedroom wall .

This is also where his family hopes he will awake from his yearlong ordeal .

The 17-year-old is in a persistent vegetative state after a beach accident deprived his brain of oxygen for more than 15 minutes .

Ryan 's parents , Bret and Janine Buchanan , turned their own bedroom into a hospital ward for their eldest son . Metal shelves in the room are stocked with adult diapers , splints , catheters and syringes .

Increasingly , families like the Buchanans are bringing children with complex medical needs home for long-term care .

In previous decades , children with neurological injuries would stay in hospitals or other facilities for the rest of their lives . Today , children are being moved through these institutions more quickly , said Dr. Ellen Elias , director of the clinic for kids with special health care needs at Children 's Hospital Colorado .

Part of the reason is that children with these and other health issues are living longer thanks to medical advances . Another reason for the change in care comes from the insurance companies ' refusal to pay for long inpatient stays , Elias said . Children requiring long-term antibiotics , feeding tubes and/or ventilator support are now sent home with nursing care , rather than living months at a time in the hospital .

`` It has changed dramatically . So many things we used to keep kids in the hospital -LRB- for -RRB- , we can now take care of in the home instead . ''

Elias is the lead author of an article published in the journal Pediatrics in April that outlines ways to transition complex pediatric patients home from the hospital .

`` We send very complicated kids home for their parents to take care of them , '' Elias said . `` This puts a huge amount of stress and responsibility onto parents . We realize this is an incredibly daunting task . ''

Home care places demands on parents ' time and finances , as well as their emotional and physical well-being . The most complex patients can require 24-hour nursing shifts , a rigorous medication schedule and various treatments . The cost can be staggering : Ryan 's monthly care is about $ 40,000 .

Home care costs less than lengthy hospital stays , but it 's still a major expense . The state-funded California Medical Assistance Program , known as Medi-Cal , covers Ryan 's home care .

Ryan 's condition requires nurses or caregivers around the clock to place his legs in and out of splints , change his feeding bag and bathe him .

`` This is just a new life , '' said Ryan 's father , Bret . `` I do n't look at it as any different than taking care of a normal child . ''

Deeply religious , the Buchanans have faith that Ryan will recover and wanted to bring him home so he would be in a familiar setting .

Throughout the day , his dad , mom and 15-year-old brother Jacob pop into Ryan 's room . A stream of visitors from his high school , youth group and lacrosse team stops by during the week . Sometimes , his family watches football in his room , cheering for teams together .

`` We never considered not bringing him home , '' Bret Buchanan said . `` Home is where his family and friends are and where he is most comfortable . Our goal has always been to bring him home when it was safe to do so . ''

The toll of caregiving can be intense , but parents are often willing to make the sacrifice .

`` It 's their child . They love them , '' said Elias , who has seen many parents take their children home . `` They want them to be part of their lives . ''

Ryan always had an easygoing swagger , said his mother , Janine . He aspired to study civil engineering and wanted to go to the University of California , Berkeley , like his dad . Fascinated by architecture , he would build model structures and houses .

As an infant , he played baby Jesus in his local Nativity play , and as a teen , he would strum his guitar playing gospel songs for his church youth group .

Teachers would rave about how much they loved him , said Jacob , who shared a room with Ryan for most of their lives .

`` I feel like if I did n't have my brother -LRB- growing up -RRB- , I 'd be a mess , '' he said . `` He kind of showed me the ropes and everything . I always wanted to do everything my brother did . ''

In June 2011 , the brothers and about 50 kids from their church went on a supervised youth retreat near Santa Cruz , California .

On a Saturday afternoon , Ryan and his friends started digging a sand tunnel on Sunset State Beach . Scooping the sand with their bare hands and Frisbees , they created an underground passage about 10 feet wide and 7 feet deep .

It was about 4 p.m. when Jacob heard one of his friends shout : `` Jacob , your brother is under the sand ! ''

The tunnel had collapsed , trapping Ryan underneath . There was no sign of him . Teens were screaming , and everyone dropped to the ground , frantically clawing at the sand with their hands to find Ryan , Jacob recalled .

He dropped to his knees and prayed to God : `` Lord , if you can do anything , please take him out now . I do n't want my brother to die . ''

By the time rescuers reached Ryan , he was unconscious . But his heart was beating .

Weeks after the accident , the diagnosis became clear : Ryan was in a persistent vegetative state because he had been deprived of oxygen for 15 to 20 minutes .

A month later , doctors asked the Buchanans whether they should resuscitate him the next time Ryan 's life was in jeopardy .

`` We have hope that he could still recover , '' his mother told the doctors . `` You 're going to do everything you can for our son to keep him alive . ''

After months in hospitals and other institutions , his family brought him home in February .

`` He seems more comfortable , relaxed at home , '' his dad said .

Doctors say it 's notoriously difficult to predict the outcome of neurological injuries , especially those stemming from oxygen deprivation . Without oxygen , brain cells die within a few minutes , causing extensive damage .

The situation is dire in most cases , yet no one really knows why a very small fraction of patients emerge from comas .

`` When it comes to neurology , there 's so much unknown , '' said Dr. Ricardo Komotar , a brain surgeon and professor at Miami University who is not involved in Ryan 's care . `` We do n't have any statistics . It 's very , very rare to be in a vegetative state for a long period of time and wake up . ''

Still , the Buchanans continue to hope .

The uncertainties and caregiving responsibilities they face are often overwhelming , but the Buchanans say they believe that choosing to sustain his life and bringing him home was best for Ryan .

Every day , Jacob pokes his head into Ryan 's room , which is right next to the bedroom they used to share . Having `` Rye '' at home brings a `` sense of normalness , '' Jacob said . He usually recounts to his brother what happened during each day and even pokes fun of him like he used to .

`` I look at him now , and I realize that 's the same exact kid , '' Jacob said . `` Why ca n't he be like the way he was before ? ''

The Buchanans have set up a website , the Ryan Buchanan Trust , where you can learn more about Ryan and how to help .
