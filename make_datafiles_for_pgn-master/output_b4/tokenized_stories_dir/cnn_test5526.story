-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the final days of 2012 trickle away , an uncommon emotional intensity hangs in the air in America . Something is happening here .

The country stands on the cusp of major change . Gun control is just one of the formerly taboo subjects that has come out of the political closet . Today , a majority of Americans support stricter gun laws , a majority support a more progressive tax system and most favor same-sex marriage . A majority of voters even support the idea of legalizing marijuana .

The laws have not caught up with this dramatic change in attitudes , and entrenched interests will fight what amounts to a quiet but pivotal social revolution . The coming year will see continuing battles in the courts , in the media and in legislatures , as the forces of change -- now representing the majority -- seek to upset the status quo .

No topic has stirred more passion in recent days than the clash between two competing rights : the right to own guns and the right not to get shot . Americans feel the lingering sadness , confusion and anger surrounding a recent massacre of schoolchildren , stirred more by the outrageous , dumbfounding , Christmas Eve murder of firefighters responding to a call for help in New York .

Then there 's that strange , unbecoming political show , the one with the ticking clock , known as the fiscal cliff . The contest over the budget sounds arcane , but it deals with a fundamental social value , the role of government in society , and the way the burden of financing ought to be shared .

Those are just the most immediate of the ongoing dramas adding stress to holiday dinners , energy to television shows and liveliness to coffee house debates .

The United States is reassessing matters that many thought had been settled . It was n't very long ago that the views from the most conservative elements of the political establishment dominated the social agenda .

Since the turn of the century we had seen a steady turn toward lower taxes , a ban on even discussing gun control , a rising wave of anti-gay legislation and all manner of conservative legislation . America seemed left behind , ossified , as other parts of the Western world , which generally share America 's culture and values , revised their views and rules on social issues .

In July , after the movie theater massacre in Colorado , President Obama unhelpfully , unnervingly , mused that `` if there 's anything to take away from this tragedy , it 's the reminder that life is very fragile . '' This time , in the wake of the Newtown massacre , he found a more practical takeaway , launching a push to stop gun violence . Most importantly , the tragedy energized the growing majority of Americans who support stepped-up gun control . It also prompted the powerful NRA to push back , and we can expect an all-out campaign whose outcome is far from certain . But the battle has been joined -- and not just in Washington .

It took far too many killings , but the massacre at Sandy Hook elementary finally pushed the matter of gun rights one awful step too far , and the conversation changed .

People who have spent decades working tirelessly for change will no doubt want to correct the impression that all this change has come suddenly . Surely , gay rights activists , gun control organizations have toiled with only minimal victories as reward . In recent months , however , we have reached a tipping point .

It may have something to do with the media -- social media , television , the Internet -- providing a boost to the message , a message of human dignity and common sense . It certainly has much to do with demographics . Young people , growing up with new ideas , are picking up the torch of social change .

Today , a majority of Americans -- 57 % -- favor stricter gun control , jumping sharply from 39 % just a few months ago . That 's bad news for the most conservative elements in society , who think the government should stand back from almost every aspect of our lives .

But the truly radical transformation has come in the area of gay rights . For the first time , Gallup Polls show a majority of Americans support full marriage equality for gay couples . That 's an astonishing change . But it 's not as astonishing as the wholesale acceptance of gay people that has suffused American society in the last few years .

Perhaps it was `` Will and Grace '' or `` Glee '' or President Obama 's long-delayed approval of same-sex marriage . Probably all of the above and much more , but a switch has been flipped . The cause has gained an unstoppable momentum , so unstoppable that even if full equality is denied by the conservative-tilted Supreme Court , scheduled to rule on the issue by this summer , it will only amount to a delay of the inevitable .

Once again , the people are leading their leaders . Public views , especially among the young , hold that discrimination is not only wrong , it 's silly .

Attitudes are changing in other ways that seemed unthinkable not long ago . Who would have thought Americans would favor legalizing drugs ? Two-thirds of voters under age 30 support legalizing pot , bringing the overall total to 51 % , and giving a boost to referendum campaigns on the issue .

The wisdom of lowering taxes also dominated for many years , but no more . Three-quarters of Americans agree it makes sense to make the tax system more progressive , raising the burden on the wealthy . What exactly `` wealthy '' means is still unclear . And , as in all the other areas of change , the battle to transform those majority views into law will be hard-fought .

With just a few days before the start of 2013 , the issues facing America are serious , the disagreements are intense , and the range of views is wide . And yet , the country is facing its choices with nervous anticipation . Something is happening in America .
