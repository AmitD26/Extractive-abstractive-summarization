-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- By the time he hit 327 pounds , Robert Foster had been playing `` the fat guy '' for decades . His size was the thing that made him stand out .

Publicly , he embraced his lifestyle as a `` BBQ-lovin ' , beef-eatin ' , no-veggie-buyin ' '' male who wore T-shirts flaunting his hefty size . There was a particularly perverse one , he says looking back on it , which read `` I beat anorexia . ''

Privately , he was resentful that he was n't thinner . He felt angry when he could n't bear to take his four little girls to the park because he was too exhausted from unloading groceries . He resented being told he was too big for the seat-belt latch on amusement park rides .

His wife , Jessica , was also obese , at 287 pounds . Unlike Rob , she felt invisible . Customers at the bank where she worked stared past her as they made their transactions . In late 2011 , a close family member made a comment at the dinner table that stuck with her :

`` She used to be something to look at . Not anymore . ''

In late March 2012 , the Colorado couple had an emotional conversation . Jess was coming up on her 30th birthday and was sick of the way she looked and felt . They had had talks like this before , where they talked about needing to change , but something was different that night .

`` I adore my kids and I love my husband very much , but there was that point I hated myself so much . I was n't giving them the full me because I was disgusted , '' Jess said . `` You have to look in the mirror and say , ` Am I going to allow this to continue or am I going to stand up and make those changes ? ' A light turned on upstairs . ''

The next week , she began taking Zumba classes . In just a few weeks , she had lost 14 pounds -- enough to motivate her to take on new physical challenges . She moved on to bikes and treadmills and made sure to sweat for an hour at least three times a week . After that , there was no turning back , she said .

Rob was a little slower to change -- the thought of going for a run was `` unappealing to the point of agony '' -- but he started playing tennis and stopped taking seconds at dinner .

In the summer of 2012 , they added other physical activities that did n't feel like working out , like hiking and recreational swimming with their kids and friends . They got hooked on the physical highs and wanted to do more .

Rob joined Jess in training for a 5-kilometer race that December . He walked as much as he ran , and Jess finished way ahead of him . But something in him changed .

`` The race environment and the high fives and the feeling of accomplishment became addicting to me , '' he said . `` After that day , I swore I would work to run a 5k without slowing to a walk . ''

In Rob 's words , `` it got crazy from there . ''

The more he ran , the more he felt he needed to run . When he put on his sneakers and took off , `` I felt like my whole life was skyrocketing upward , '' he said .

A few months after that first 5k , he ran his second , this time without walking . Then he did his first 10-mile run . And in May 2014 , he ran his first marathon . By then he was 160 pounds lighter .

Throughout the process , the couple used a calorie-counting app to keep track of everything they ate . They knew they wanted to break their family 's cycle of unhealthy relationships with food while their children were still young .

`` It got to the point where we realized it did n't matter what we fed them , '' Rob said . `` If we were n't eating the same way or if we were overeating , they were going to follow our example . ''

The Fosters began shopping only the periphery of grocery stores , never entering the aisles unless it was for cereal . They added more fruits , vegetables and lean white meats and fish . They also began cooking everything they ate from scratch , including breads , dressings and sauces .

`` Our whole philosophy towards food was adding good things , '' Rob said . `` What we found was , the more and more good things we added , the less we craved the garbage . ''

After months of a diet rich in whole grains , green vegetables and lean meats , they recently made the decision to go vegan for health , environmental and ethical reasons .

Rob and Jess now each weigh 167 pounds , down a collective 280 pounds . Jessica has lost 120 pounds from the start of their journey ; Rob has lost 160 . They feel healthier , happier and ready to tackle the world .

Rob , a former bank branch manager , has gone back to college to pursue a bachelor 's degree in integrative physiology with the goal of entering medical school . This May , he completed his first year of college .

He 's not `` the fat guy '' anymore , and he 's fine with that .

Jess feels pretty great , too . Now a size 10 , down from size 24 , she 's still getting used to people paying attention to her . She re-entered the workforce in July 2013 after five years as a stay-at-home mom and was surprised at the difference in how people treated her .

`` A lot of people became very friendly and were really looking at me in my face , instead of this blank stare . ... And obviously , the opposite sex was more playful , always complimentary . I never had that . Never , ever , ever , '' she said .

`` I love myself . I like what I 'm seeing in the mirror . I know there 's some work to still be done , but I 'm such a different person than I was before . ''
