-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A California man accused of running a `` revenge porn '' website told CNN affiliate KFMB that he has n't done anything criminal , but that he understands why people are upset and is done with the business .

`` I just do n't want to be involved in that kind of website anymore , '' Kevin Bollaert told KFMB . `` I want to do good things with my life . ''

Bollaert , 27 , of San Diego , is accused of creating one website that allowed people to post explicit images of people without their permission , and creating another one soliciting payments to get the photographs taken down .

Authorities on Tuesday charged Bollaert with 31 felony counts of conspiracy , identity theft and extortion , the state attorney general 's office said .

Court documents allege that in December 2012 , Bollaert created the website ugotposted.com , which allowed for the posting of sexually explicit photographs of people without their permission .

`` This website published intimate photos of unsuspecting victims and turned their public humiliation and betrayal into a commodity with the potential to devastate lives , '' Attorney General Kamala D. Harris said .

The sexually explicit material , primarily of women , was routinely posted by angry former boyfriends and ex-husbands , authorities said . It contained their real names and links to their Facebook profiles .

Prosecutors allege Bollaert also created a second website , changemyreputation.com , that charged up to $ 350 to remove the content , the documents said .

Bollaert made tens of thousands of dollars through the website , prosecutors allege .

Neither website was operational Wednesday morning .

A 20-year-old Reno , Nevada , woman whose nude pictures appeared on the site told KFMB that she did n't know how the photos got there , but that it was devastating .

`` You should have seen me . I was a wreck . I was bawling my eyes out , '' the woman said . `` That 's me , that 's my personal nakedness , and everyone can see it now . ''

Bollaert denied doing anything illegal .

`` I do n't feel like I 've committed any crime , '' he said , adding that he knows why there 's an uproar .

`` I understand that a lot of people would be upset by what would happen and be hurt , '' Bollaert said .

KFMB reported that court documents contained pleas to the website from women who said the postings resulted in nearly around-the-clock harassment from creepy men .

`` I have gone to the police , I 've had a restraining order put in place because of this site , -LRB- and -RRB- my phone has been going off EVERY 2 MINUTES with strange men sending inappropriate things to me , '' one woman , who said she was a minor when the photographs were posted , wrote to the website , according to the court documents cited by KFMB .

`` It 's disgusting . Also , I 've had to ... have a sexual harassment charge put in place in court because of this . I do n't know what gets you off about ruining people 's lives , but I was underage in the photos posted of me so , yes , you are showing child pornography , '' she wrote .
