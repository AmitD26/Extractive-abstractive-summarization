-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Days of violent unrest in the Thai capital have left dozens dead and hundreds injured , as security forces clashed with anti-government protesters , with the demonstrators finally surrendering on Wednesday evening .

Bangkok turned into a war zone Wednesday , as Thai military forces cracked down on anti-government protesters , ending a tense standoff that has troubled the capital for weeks . The chaotic day left at least five people dead , as Bangkok residents endured an edgy and unsettled night .

Wednesday 's violent clashes cap a months-long standoff between Thai authorities and protesters opposed to the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva . The protesters -- known as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship -LRB- UDD -RRB- -- support Thaksin Shinawatra , who was prime minister from 2001 to 2006 , before he was ousted in a bloodless coup .

What has happened up till now ?

The latest violence follows a government pledge to hold an election in November in an attempt to halt the protests . However , amid ongoing anger over a crackdown by security forces last month and a refusal by the protesters to comply with a deadline to vacate the district of Bangkok -- until Wednesday -- authorities say the election date is now under threat .

Prime Minister Abhisit declared a state of emergency April 7 , hours after anti-government demonstrators -LRB- known as `` Red Shirts '' for the clothes they wear -RRB- stormed the country 's parliament .

Following protests that have paralyzed parts of Bangkok for months , the army surged on Wednesday into Lumpini Park , with armored personnel carriers crushing bamboo and tire barricades , while protesters hurled M79 grenades at soldiers .

Witnesses reported a dozen buildings -- including a bank , a police station , a local television station and Thailand 's biggest shopping mall -- set ablaze .

At least five people , including an Italian journalist , were listed as killed by the Police Hospital in Bangkok . Another 64 -- two journalists among them -- were wounded .

What happens next ?

Thailand 's prime minister sought to calm public fears with a televised address in which he expressed confidence that peace would soon be restored .

`` I would like to give moral support to officers who are doing their duties now and would like to reassure you , '' Prime Minister Abhisit told citizens . `` And I am confident that we can overcome all the problems and bring the country to a long-lasting peace . ''

He said that the government had regained full control and that Red Shirt leaders had fled or had been taken into police custody . Seven anti-government protest leaders had been taken into custody , while several others fled , authorities said .

The prime minister 's office issued a statement Wednesday blaming the crackdown on failed talks between the two sides .

`` Negotiations failed because core -LRB- opposition -RRB- leaders are not able to make decisions by themselves , '' the statement said , alluding to an outside force influencing the protesters . '' -LRB- We -RRB- ask core leaders to stop the rally and surrender . ''

On Wednesday , it seemed that the time for talking had passed .

How long have protests being going on ?

Thailand has been embroiled in political chaos for years , and many Thai citizens are growing weary with the instability . Ever since Thaksin Shinawatra came to power in 2001 , there were protesters opposing his allegedly corrupt and autocratic rule .

Those protesters donned yellow shirts -LRB- the color of the king -RRB- and occupied the two main airports in Bangkok , until finally the pro-Thaksin government was brought down by a court ruling . In revenge Thaksin 's supporters copied the yellow-shirt tactics with a variation , and took to the streets in red shirts .

But the rift is largely between the Red Shirts and the so-called `` multi-colored shirts '' -LRB- who support Abhisit , the current prime minister -RRB- . The multi-colored shirts , generally middle-class city dwellers , are displeased with the disruption caused by the protests . They are not pro- or anti-government . They simply want the government to shut down the Reds to end the violence and interruptions to daily life .

Why do the sides identify themselves by colors ?

It 's an easy way for them to create an identity . It all started with the Yellow Shirts wearing a color associated with Monday , the day of the week that Thailand 's revered king was born on . That was designed to show their allegiance to the king and more broadly the traditional elite which has dominated Thai politics for years . Thaksin 's supporters then picked a color to distinguish themselves from the Yellow Shirts .

Why are they arguing ?

Essentially this is a classic power struggle . It 's easy to portray this as simply rich against poor , but it is much more complicated than that , as illustrated by the fact that the Reds ' leader is in fact a multi-billionaire . Thaksin rode to power by enacting populist policies which gained huge support from the rural poor . His radical approach ruffled a lot of feathers among the elite , who felt he was becoming too big for his boots and feared his policies would erode their position .

The `` civil society '' also become concerned over allegations of corruption and Thaksin 's brutal war on drugs , which saw summary executions . He was also criticized for his heavy handed response to violence in the Muslim-dominated south .

Finally , the army ousted Thaksin in a coup , which had the backing of the aristocratic elite and much of the middle class , who were becoming uneasy with the cult of personality growing around the leader . That set the stage for an embittered power struggle between Thaksin loyalists and those loyal to the army , aristocracy and their traditional Democrat Party .

From his self-imposed exile abroad to avoid a trial on corruption charges , Thaksin released a statement Wednesday saying that he was not the leader of the United Front for Democracy , the formal name of the Red Shirt opposition , and that their movement calling for new elections is not on his behalf .

`` They did not demand anything for me or on my behalf . I am not UDD , '' he said .

Thaksin also accused the Thai government of defaming him by saying he was the mastermind behind the violence in the country 's ongoing political crisis .

So who is Thaksin ?

Visionary leader or venal despot : Opinions vary , like the color of the shirts his supporters and detractors wear . If you sport red , you think Thaksin was the only prime minister to offer the rural poor a voice and real benefits ; if you wear yellow , you view him as opponents of the Philippines ' Ferdinand Marcos saw that leader : greedy and dangerous .

What is not in dispute is that Thaksin won two elections , was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full-term in office and is still hugely popular . But critics say he bought his support and was only in politics to help himself .

As a businessman , Thaksin made billions of dollars from his communications company , Shin Corporation . In 2008 he was found guilty and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for a land deal that enabled his wife to buy a valuable city plot for a fraction of its true value . Thaksin also faces other corruption charges . More than $ 2 billion in Thaksin 's family assets are currently frozen in Thailand , but there is speculation he has a great deal more money elsewhere .

What are the wider implications of the protests ?

If the divisions in Thailand ca n't be healed , it could lead to a deteriorating security situation which would have wider implications for the region . Thailand 's relations with Cambodia are especially frosty , since Thaksin was appointed economic adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen. The worst case scenario would see Cambodia drawn into the dispute , with Thaksin using the country as a political base , adding to the already considerable tensions on the border .

Is Thailand safe for visitors ?

Many western embassies have shut their doors and are warning their citizens against travel to Bangkok , as violence in the city continues . `` Due to escalating violence in central Bangkok , including gunfire near the U.S. Embassy , demonstrations in Chiang Mai , and other incidents throughout Thailand , U.S. citizens should defer all travel to Bangkok and defer all non-essential travel to the rest of Thailand , '' the U.S. State Department has warned .

As well as advising against travel to Bangkok , the United Kingdom 's Foreign Office warned of protests and violent incidents in popular tourist destinations such as Pattaya , Chiang Mai , Chiang Rai and Ayutthaya . But Bangkok 's main Suvarnabhumi airport is operating normally , according to its Web site .
