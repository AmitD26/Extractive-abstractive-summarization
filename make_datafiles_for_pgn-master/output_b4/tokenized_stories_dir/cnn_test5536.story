Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- China has urged U.S. President Barack Obama to call off a meeting at the White House with Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama that 's scheduled to take place Friday .

`` By arranging a meeting between the President and the Dalai Lama , the U.S. side will grossly interfere in the internal affairs of China , seriously violate norms governing international relations and severely impair China-U.S. relations , '' Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement Friday .

The White House on Thursday announced the planned meeting between Obama and the Dalai Lama , who lives in exile .

Obama has met with the Dalai Lama twice before , in February 2010 and July 2011 . China responded to those meetings with similarly angry comments .

Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama of being a separatist who foments unrest in Tibet , a region it claims has been part of China since `` ancient times . ''

The Dalai Lama , who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising , has long denied China 's assertion that he 's seeking Tibetan independence . He says he wants only enough autonomy to protect its traditional Buddhist culture .

The Obama administration says it supports the Dalai Lama 's `` Middle Way '' approach to the political tensions over protests for Tibetan independence .

`` The United States recognizes Tibet to be a part of the People 's Republic of China and we do not support Tibetan independence , '' said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden . `` The United States strongly supports human rights and religious freedom in China . ''

Concerns over human rights

Over the past five years , at least 125 Tibetans have set themselves on fire , most of them fatally , to protest Chinese rule , according to Tibetan advocacy groups .

Beijing has taken a tough line on Tibetan self-immolators , their associates and other forms of protest . Tibetans have been convicted of murder in Chinese courts for `` inciting '' people to set themselves on fire .

The frequency of self-immolations declined during 2013 , according to the London-based advocacy group Free Tibet .

`` We are concerned about continuing tensions and the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas of China , '' Hayden said . `` We will continue to urge the Chinese government to resume dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives , without preconditions , as a means to reduce tensions . ''

China rejects accusations of oppression , saying that under its rule , living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people .

Beijing has `` lodged solemn representations '' with the United States over the planned meeting Friday , saying `` Tibet-related affairs fall entirely within the internal affairs of China which allow no foreign interference , '' Hua of the Chinese foreign ministry said .

A meeting between British Prime Minister David Cameron and the Dalai Lama last year cast a chill over relations between London and Beijing , delaying a visit to China by Cameron .
