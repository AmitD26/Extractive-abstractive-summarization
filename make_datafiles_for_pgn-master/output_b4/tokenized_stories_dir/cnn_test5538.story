Shikumen Tour in Shanghai

`` All of this used to be old shikumen -LRB- stone-gate houses -RRB- , but they 've been demolished now , '' says Gang-feng Wang , photographer and tour guide , standing outside a construction site in Shanghai .

`` But do n't worry , we 'll build you lots of nice museums so you can see how it used to be , '' he cracks .

Wang is the irascible guide of the Four Seasons Hotel Shanghai 's four-hour photography tour through the disappearing shikumen houses of the city 's British Concession .

It 's a great way to pry into the local community .

After photographing the maze-like alleys -- garnished with clotheslines , chatting neighbors and cages of messenger pigeons -- travelers are taken inside some of the houses .

Originally built for British traders , the houses -- each now occupied by multiple local families -- are still adorned with imported British floor tiles .

`` This one houses more than 30 families , '' says Wang , as the group walks up a set of squeaky wooden stairs to a rooftop , where the tour finishes with a panoramic view of the Shikumen complex .
