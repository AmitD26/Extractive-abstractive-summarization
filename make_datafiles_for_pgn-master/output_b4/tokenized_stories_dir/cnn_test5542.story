-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He may have written his name into national folklore less than a week ago but Germany 's World Cup winning captain Philipp Lahm has decided to go out at the top by announcing his retirement from international football Friday .

The 30-year-old made 113 appearances for `` Die Nationalmannschaft '' over 10 years culminating in Sunday 's dramatic extra-time victory over Argentina in the Maracana , Rio de Janeiro .

Lahm will continue to play for club side Bayern Munich with whom he extended his contract prior to the tournament in Brazil .

In an open letter posted on the German Football Federation -LRB- DFB -RRB- website Friday , Lahm thanked fans , management and fellow players for `` a wonderful time . ''

He informed Germany coach Joachim Low of his decision on Monday over breakfast .

`` I am happy and grateful that the end of my career end with the national team coincides with winning the World Cup in Brazil , '' he said .

The surprise news was met with tributes from across the sporting world and beyond .

Lahm was at the center of celebrations as Germany paraded the World Cup trophy to an estimated one million people on the streets of Berlin Monday .

Germany coach Joachim Low said : `` Philipp is a model professional who puts the team 's success above everything else . ''

`` His intelligence and versatility as a player have allowed him to play at the highest level on the international stage for many years .

`` He is a world-class player , as he again demonstrated over the last few weeks in Brazil . He crowned his outstanding career by winning the World Cup title . ''

Team manager and former international Germany international striker Oliver Bierhoff added : `` Philipp is an absolute role model as a player and person .

`` He is a big personality and happily takes on a great deal of responsibility .

`` I have immense respect for Philipp 's career and his decision . What remains is for all of us to say a big thank you . ''

Meanwhile German chancellor Angela Merkel , who was pictured celebrating with the German team after their victory in Brazil , said `` I would like to express to him my utmost respect for what he has done for the national team . ''

Lahm made his debut for Germany in a 2-1 victory over Croatia in February 2004 and became German captain prior to the 2010 World Cup after injury to then captain Michael Ballack .

Traditionally a right sided defender , Lahm has been deployed more often as a central midfielder by Bayern and Germany over the past season .

This was a role he played in the early games of the 2014 World Cup before reverting to right back after injury to Shkodran Mustafi .

Only three players -- Lothar Matthaus -LRB- 150 caps -RRB- , Miroslav Klose -LRB- 137 caps -RRB- and Lukas Podolski -LRB- 116 caps -RRB- -- have made more appearances for the German national team .
