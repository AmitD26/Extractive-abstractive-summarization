Cairo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egypt 's military was quick to quash a newspaper report Thursday that quoted army chief Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi as saying he will run for president .

The interview appeared in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Siyasa earlier Thursday . And in it , El-Sisi appeared to confirm what many have long considered a foregone conclusion : that he 'll run for president .

`` The decision has been made , '' he is quoted as saying . `` I have to fulfill the people 's demands . ''

`` We do n't have a magic wand but we will not tamper with the people 's dreams and aspirations , '' he added . `` Let 's hold our hands together and work for the country . ''

Soon afterward , the army responded .

`` What was published in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Siyasa is merely journalistic speculation and not a direct statement from Field Marshal El-Sisi , '' it said in a statement .

If he does run , El-Sisi will have to resign his military post . But with no clear contender , his chances of winning the presidency are high .

He will become the sixth military leader to rule Egypt since its independence .

The only one who was democratically elected , Mohamed Morsy , was ousted by the military on July 3 after months of mass protests against his rule .

The interim government has not yet set a firm date for elections ; candidates can officially declare themselves on February 18 .

A most adored man

If one man can claim the title of Egypt 's most-adored , it would be El-Sisi .

Many Egyptians speak of him reverentially . `` A hero , '' or `` a man of respect '' are some of the terms thrown around .

`` If he could be my father , that would be great , '' said a repairman who gave his name as Mahmoud .

Last week , Egypt 's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces gave El-Sisi its blessing to run , calling his candidacy `` a mandate and an obligation . ''

The same day , he was promoted from general to field marshal . He was defense minister under Morsy .

Urging caution

But not everyone is enamored .

It was El-Sisi who announced Morsy 's ouster , sparking wild celebrations .

It was El-Sisi who oversaw the appointment of Egypt 's interim leaders .

Rights groups say talk of an El-Sisi run should n't be cause for celebration , but reasons to worry .

`` One has to be a little more worried about a return to military dictatorship , '' said political analyst Sarah Eltantawi .

`` This country has been under military dictatorship since 1952 . Anyone during that period who tried to organize politically , democratically was jailed and stymied in one way or another . ''

Allegations of abuse

The Egyptian army has long been marred by allegations of abusing its power .

It was accused of beating and killing protesters who took to the streets to demand then-President Hosni Mubarak 's ouster .

And when Morsy supporters demonstrated , the army was accused of doing the same .

Furthermore , El-Sisi is the same general who defended the use of virginity tests on female protesters . They were meant to shield soldiers from false accusations , he told state media .

Grievances gone

But for many Egyptians , the grievances are gone .

`` People 's livelihooods have really plummeted in the past year , two years , '' said Eltantawi . `` They want stability and the only form of stability that several generations of Egyptians have had have been in the form of the military . ''

For now , like it or not , the military seems to be playing a central role in post-revolution Egypt where establishing democracy is still the stated goal .

But the path to getting there is n't always democratic .
