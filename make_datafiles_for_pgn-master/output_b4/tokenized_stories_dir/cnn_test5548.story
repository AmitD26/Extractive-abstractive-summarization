-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Around the country on Friday , you 'll likely see the iconic black and white POW-MIA flag flying over federal buildings . At military bases , there will be ceremonies with troops in dress uniforms marching and leaders speaking .

At the Pentagon , Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta will oversee a ceremony that will conclude with a flyover by warplanes and helicopters in honor of the 83,000 known service members still listed as prisoners of war or missing in action .

But not every remembrance of those Americans will include such pomp and activity .

If you were to walk through the mess hall of a Navy ship or an Army installation , you might see a small table covered in a simple cloth . One chair sits in front of a single formal place setting . On the plate , salt and a slice of lemon . Next to the plate , a glass vase containing a red rose with a red ribbon around the base .

This silent tribute is full of symbolism .

The table is round `` to show our everlasting concern '' according to the National League of POW/MIA Families website .

The cloth is white , `` symbolizing the purity of their motives when answering the call to duty . ''

The rose reminds `` us of the lives of these men ... and their loved ones and friends who keep the faith , while seeking answers . ''

The red ribbon `` symbolizes our continued determination to account for them . ''

The slice of lemon `` reminds us of the bitter fate of those captured and missing in a foreign land . ''

The salt `` symbolizes the tears of our missing and their families who long for answers after decades of uncertainty . ''

A Bible represents the `` strength gained through faith in our country , founded as one nation under God , to sustain those lost from our midst . ''

A glass is inverted on the table `` to symbolize their inability to share this evening 's toast . ''

Finally , there is the empty chair , with that obvious symbolism .

At larger events where POW/MIA groups gather , a similar table will be set , but with identical place settings , one for each of the armed forces , including the Coast Guard , and a sixth for civilians still missing .

Pam Cain , secretary of the League of POW/MIA Families , said when an explanation is read of what each item symbolizes , she `` can barely get through it to the end . ''

Cain 's father , Col. Oscar Mauterer , disappeared after bailing out from his burning plane during a mission over Laos in 1966 .

She said the POW/MIA table is an important , if not well known , part of her organization 's efforts to remember the missing .

Friday night , as you sit down for dinner , look at the salt or perhaps the chair with a loved one next to you and remember there are those still waiting for a loved one to come home .
