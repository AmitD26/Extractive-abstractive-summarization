Alisa Weinstein was thrilled when she heard about Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl 's release . She hopes her father will be next .

Gunmen abducted Warren Weinstein nearly three years ago from his home in Lahore , Pakistan . They posed as neighbors , offered food and then pistol-whipped the American aid worker and tied up his guards .

Now he 's being held by al Qaeda . And as political backlash over the controversial prisoner swap for Bergdahl grows , Weinstein 's daughter says her happiness for the soldier and his family has turned to worry .

`` We started to realize that the administration is going to be a lot less likely to do this again if it causes some political problems for them , '' she told CNN 's `` AC360 '' on Wednesday . `` So does that mean that the door is closed for us ? ''

For years , when Warren Weinstein 's case came up , U.S. officials called for his release but repeatedly said Washington would n't bargain with al Qaeda .

Now , Alisa Weinstein says it 's clear that negotiating is an option .

`` They have shown with this exchange that they can get this done . If they want to , they can do this , '' she said . `` So I know that they can do it for us and they can do it for others . ''

Just as health was a concern for U.S. officials who negotiated Bergdahl 's release , Weinstein says she 's worried about her 72-year-old father 's health . He has a heart condition and severe asthma , she said , and a video of him released by al Qaeda on Christmas showed he 's suffering .

`` It was clear from that video that he is not in good physical condition . He was incredibly pale and gaunt . His voice was weak . ... My father is certainly not in good health , '' she said .

Listening to Obama administration officials justify the swap by pointing out that Bergdahl was a soldier does n't ease her worries .

`` My father is just as deserving of freedom as Sgt. Bergdahl , as are all of the Americans who are being held abroad , '' she said . `` You can not distinguish between these hostages . ... They ca n't just pick and choose , decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there . ''

Just a few months after Weinstein 's capture , al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a recording claiming the terror group was holding Weinstein -- and demanding , among other things , an end to airstrikes by the United States .

He described the captive as `` a former employee and a current contractor working with the U.S. government in its aid program to Pakistan , which aims to fight the jihad in Pakistan and Afghanistan , and just like the Americans arrest any suspect linked to al Qaeda and the Taliban , even if they were far related . ''

Weinstein was employed by J.E. Austin Associates Inc. , a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington , Virginia , that is a USAID contractor . He is a world-renowned development expert , according to the company 's website .

In the video al Qaeda released of him in December , Warren Weinstein said he felt abandoned .

`` Nine years ago , I came to Pakistan to help my government and I did so at a time when most Americans would not come here , '' he said . `` And now , when I need my government , it seems I have been totally abandoned and forgotten . ''

What about other Americans held captive ?
