San Diego -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With the Supreme Court poised this week to hear arguments in the legal challenge to Arizona 's immigration law , it 's a good time to explain what this law and the ruckus surrounding it are really about .

The left says it 's about racism and political extremism ; the right claims the issues are border security and public safety .

Wrong . In the two years since Gov. Jan Brewer signed SB 1070 into law , it 's become clear that this law , and the debate over it , are really about three things : fear , power , and freedom .

It 's about fear . As someone who lived in Phoenix and wrote for the Arizona Republic in the late 1990s , I can tell you that Arizonans only recently reached the conclusion that they wanted to get rid of illegal immigrants . The ` Zonies I knew could n't live without them .

Not a lot of U.S. citizens were lining up to do the hard and dirty jobs that the undocumented were doing . That includes landscaping or other jobs that require you to work outdoors in 115-degree weather .

In 1994 , when Californians passed Proposition 187 -- an anti-illegal immigration ballot initiative that intended to deny public services to illegal immigrants but was ultimately struck down by the courts -- and when President Bill Clinton launched `` Operation Gatekeeper '' to beef up enforcement on the U.S.-Mexico border south of San Diego , hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who had been headed to California took a detour through Arizona .

Those who crusade against illegal immigration in the Grand Canyon State will say that this is when the `` invasion '' began . In truth , it was more like a gigantic job fair where employers eagerly gobbled up illegal immigrants to do everything from cleaning houses to raising children to cooking in restaurants .

At the time , few people seemed concerned about verifying legal status . I once asked the crew washing my car at a popular Phoenix carwash if they had fake green cards , and one of the young men chuckled and said there was no need , since the employer never asked if they were legally eligible to work .

Fueled by illegal immigrant labor , cities like Phoenix boomed , and this was fine by the Phoenicians -- many of whom envisioned their city growing into a desert metropolis with all the amenities . But the problem was that they were n't prepared for the demographic side effect : the fear that they were losing control , and the realization that whites would soon become a statistical minority in Arizona just as they are in California , Texas and New Mexico .

Something had to be done to readjust the ethnic balance . And that something was SB 1070 , or as local activists have dubbed it : `` The Mexican Removal Act . ''

It 's about power . One of the main things that makes the law so controversial is also one of the things that the lower federal courts have said makes it unconstitutional -- that it essentially deputizes local and state police , who typically have n't been trained to enforce immigration law , and gives them the power to act as surrogates for Immigration and Customs Enforcement .

The Constitution is pretty clear that regulating immigration policy is exclusively a federal responsibility , which is the reason that Proposition 187 was struck down . And the scores of police chiefs who resist enforcing federal immigration law are correct that it erodes the trust between law enforcement and local communities . But perhaps the best argument against giving local and state police this power is that they almost always misuse it .

You see , this job is tougher than it looks , if you want to surgically remove illegal immigrants without harassing or disrupting the lives of U.S.-born Latinos , including some whose families have been in the Southwest for nearly 500 years . That is especially true in the place that used to be called the Arizona Territory .

For those of us who support the role of federal agents to enforce immigration law , including deporting people when appropriate , the problem is n't that the law is being enforced . By all means , the law should be enforced .

The problem is who is doing the enforcing . If the dirty work of asking people for birth certificates and other forms of identification to prove they have a legal right to be in this country is being done by amateurs , it is more likely that there will be mistakes . People will be profiled . Dark skins and accents will take the place of hard evidence and probable cause . Civil rights will be trampled upon .

That 's the concern in Arizona , where state lawmakers made a power grab and foolishly gave local and state police officers something that most of them never wanted : the authority to enforce federal immigration law . That authority has to be held in check and closely monitored , and that is where the courts come in .

This is the role that U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton fulfilled when , in July 2010 , she struck down some of the most grotesque parts of the law -- a requirement that local police determine the immigration status of individuals they suspect of being in the country illegally , a mandate that people carry documents that prove they have a legal right to be in the United States , and a provision making it a crime for laborers to solicit work .

And it 's about freedom , because U.S.-born Latinos should be free from harassment . They should n't have to prove they belong in their own country . In this case , they should be spared the additional humiliation of having to prove they have the legal right to be in a region to which they are indigenous .

They have the right to be left alone without mischief-making bureaucrats or lawmakers calling their `` American-ness '' into question . They and their families have earned it the hard way -- by answering this nation 's call , enlisting in the military , and often making the ultimate sacrifice dating back to the days of the American Revolution .

Conservatives get worked up over perceived threats to freedom all the time . Whether it 's a smoking ban or a government mandate to buy health insurance , those on the right know how to raise a fuss over big government . What could be worse that police agencies using the blunt instrument of racial and ethnic profiling to ferret out suspected illegal immigrants ? How does government get any `` bigger '' than that ?

This debate was never about the rights of illegal immigrants . It 's about the rights of those U.S. citizens and legal residents whom the untrained and uninformed might mistake for illegal immigrants .

It 's about the kind of country we 've always been , and the kind that we want to remain . We sometimes forget that personal liberty is the cornerstone of the United States of America . Once again , it 's up to the Supreme Court to remind us .

Navarrette : It 's fear the Latino immigrants who made Arizona boom will take over

It 's dangerous because it makes deputies out of local and state police , he writes

@highlight

It 's also wrong , he says , because it takes away U.S.-born Latinos ' freedom
