Roland Martin says the Republican statements downplaying role of community organizers are a mistake .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Republicans have made it clear where their focus is this week with their convention slogan , `` Country First . ''

With the abundance of flags , chants of `` U.S.A. , U.S.A. '' and tributes to those in the military , they have been laying it on thick .

Sen. John McCain has often talked about the need for Americans to dedicate themselves to service , namely military , and he is on the money .

But a line of attack that was used consistently last night by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , and later by Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , tried to call into question whether community organizers put their country first .

Palin focused on the issue , mainly to criticize the Obama campaign for offering up his community organizing work opposite her experience as mayor .

But when you examine Giuliani 's dismissive tone -- and the subsequent laughter by the Republicans in the XCel Energy Center -- regarding the community organizer jabs , the Democrats could have an opening .

After praising Palin 's speech , I said as much , and that they can expect the Obama-Biden camp to seize on that point . This morning , I read an e-mail from Obama campaign manager David Plouffe , who incorporated the community organizer argument into a fundraising appeal .

Republican operatives I talked to said the lines were brilliant and that community organizers do n't play to the GOP 's strength .

I disagree . And so do the many folks who have sent me angry e-mails . They include white Republicans , black Democrats , people from Small Town , U.S.A. , and Big City , America .

At a time when Americans are losing their homes to foreclosure , folks are trying to get by after layoffs , people are struggling with lack of healthcare , and we 're facing pressing environmental issues , it 's ludicrous to slam the little man and woman who is n't asking the government for handouts , but is doing what they can to make their neighborhood and city better .

I think of my parents . As a child growing up in the Clinton Park neighborhood in Houston , Texas , my parents were just regular folks trying to raise their five children -LRB- sounds like Gov. Sarah Palin -RRB- . They were always present at our local elementary school -LRB- sounds like Gov. Sarah Palin -RRB- and were heavily involved in our church .

But our neighborhood was dying . Drugs were ravaging it . Older homeowners were dying and their children did n't want to live there , so they began renting to people who really did n't care . We saw abandoned homes , weeded lots , no sidewalks , a park falling into disrepair , and a senior citizen center shuttered .

So they joined several others neighbors and decided to form a civic club . Others called them crazy for trying to advance their ideas , but they did n't give up .

They enlisted their children in passing out flyers and putting up signs , notifying folks of the monthly meetings . A few folks showed up , but they kept going .

And going . And going . And going .

After months , and then years , we began to see progress : Stepped up police patrols and crack houses raided by the Houston police , DEA and FBI . Abandoned houses torn down . Weeded lots cut . More heavy trash pickup days . New streetlights . New sidewalks . New sewer pipes . A refurbished park .

Bottom line , these average , low - to middle-income people did n't have political power . They focused on people power . They organized a community to take action . iReport.com : Is Palin really ready to start an experience debate ?

So when Rudy Giuliani and Palin mock community organizers , they do n't just toss a barb at Sen. Barack Obama , they demean Reginald and Emelda Martin . They degrade the women who fought for their rights . They disrespect the labor activists and immigrant worker activists like Cesar Chavez .

They dismiss those in the civil rights movement -- folks from small town America who were sick and tired of being sick and tired . They thumb their noses at the Nelson Mandelas of the world who want a better life for their children .

It would have been perfectly fine for Giuliani and Palin to say that Obama 's community organizing days did n't amount to enough experience to be president .

But when you openly laugh and mock those hard-working Americans who are in the trenches every day , then you really do n't care about `` Country First '' or service .

Will this be a major deal or a ripple ? Likely the latter . But the one thing I know about community organizers is that they know how to organize communities . And if the McCain-Palin ticket wants to win , they best not slap those folks they need for voter registration drives and systems to get folks to the polls .

Community organizers are always told they ca n't do something or are dismissed as meaningless .

Yet they often have the last laugh .

Rudy Giuliani , Sarah Palin and John McCain might want to remember that .
