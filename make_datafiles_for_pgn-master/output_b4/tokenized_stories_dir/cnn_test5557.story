-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If you were observing American elections from the outside , you might be asking yourself the following :

Ca n't these people make up their minds ? Four out of the last five elections -LRB- 2006 , 2008 , 2010 and now 2014 -RRB- were `` wave '' elections in which one party won a sweeping victory . They elect a president of one party , then two years later almost inevitably give the other party a huge victory in the midterm election . Why do they expect things to change ?

Good question . It 's always dangerous to speak of a country of 319 million as having a singular will , or of an election expressing that will . That 's particularly true when only about 40 % of eligible voters show up for midterm elections . Like every party that wins , the GOP will claim that `` the American people '' have endorsed its agenda in full , and therefore if President Barack Obama stands in its way , then he 's thwarting the public 's desires .

We 've established that the public is fed up with a Congress seemingly incapable of getting anything done . The trouble is that the voters -- unanimous in their abhorrence of gridlock -- just delivered a result almost guaranteed to produce more gridlock .

To be fair , there was one party assuring them that their votes would do just the opposite . Republican candidates promised voters that they 'd stand in Obama 's way , and also promised that they 'd `` get things done , '' sometimes in the same sentence . As The Atlantic 's Molly Ball reported last week , `` these two seemingly contradictory messages are at the heart of Republican Senate campaigns across the country . I 've heard them from candidate after candidate . ''

It 's one thing to vote Republican because it 's the party that reflects your beliefs . But if you 're voting Republican because you want to see Congress become more conciliatory and productive , you really should have been paying closer attention the last six years .

That 's because obstructionism has n't been an accident , or a reaction to moves on Obama 's part that Republicans found objectionable . It was a strategy they employed from the outset . Literally on the day Obama was inaugurated , Republican leaders gathered over dinner and made a decision to oppose everything he proposed , to deny him both substantive progress and whatever political benefits might accrue to a president who looks like he 's accomplishing things .

In 2010 , Mitch McConnell explained to The New York Times how important it was to present a unified front of opposition to the President 's proposals , because then the public would dismiss the debate as just partisan bickering . `` Mr. McConnell spent hours listening to the worries and ideas of Republicans , '' the paper reported , `` urging them not to be seduced by the attention-grabbing possibilities of cutting a bipartisan deal . ''

As political strategy , it was extremely astute and executed to near perfection . McConnell understood well that the President gets credit when Washington works and blame when it does n't -- whether he deserves it in either case . So Republicans could pour sand in the gears of government and watch Obama suffer for it .

And it worked . What was the result of six years of unprecedented filibusters , debt ceiling crises , a government shutdown , 50 futile Affordable Care Act repeal votes , endless conspiracy theorizing and a dramatic increase in general buffoonery ? Republicans took back the House in 2010 , and have now taken the Senate .

Voters rewarded their misdeeds by returning them to power .

And now politicians in both parties are saying they want to come together to accomplish things for the public . The problem is that they do n't agree on the things they 'd like to accomplish . The argument is n't over means ; it 's over ends . That 'll be even truer when the new Congress is inaugurated in January than it is now .

The new class of freshman Republicans in both the House and Senate is even more conservative than the existing GOP caucus -LRB- if you thought such a thing was possible -RRB- , and to them , `` getting things done '' means slashing environmental protections , taking away health coverage from the millions who have obtained it through the Affordable Care Act and cutting taxes on the wealthy .

If those new representatives actually managed to turn those beliefs into law , the public would say , `` Hey , we did n't vote for that ! '' And they did n't , even in this Republican-leaning year .

Voters in four deep-red states -- Arkansas , Alaska , Nebraska and South Dakota -- used ballot initiatives to approve one of the Democratic Party 's highest economic priorities , increasing the minimum wage . `` Personhood '' initiatives that would ban abortion failed , not only in the swing state of Colorado but in conservative North Dakota as well .

In other words , where voters had the chance to decide policy issues , they chose the Democratic position even as they were voting for Republican candidates .

So what do the American people want ? They want to have their cake and eat it , too . As political scientists have known for decades , Americans are `` symbolic conservatives '' but `` operational liberals '' -- they like things like small government in the abstract , but they also like all the things government does .

They elect Democrats who try to accomplish complex policy goals , then turn around and elect Republicans when things do n't work perfectly . They say they hate gridlock , then elect people who will give them more of it .

And two years from now , a whole new crop of candidates will barnstorm the country , saying , `` Elect me , and we 'll clean up this mess . '' And the voters -LRB- or at least enough of them -RRB- will , despite all evidence and experience , actually buy it .
