-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of the prosecutors in the Casey Anthony trial said Wednesday there could be perjury charges against Casey 's mother , Cindy Anthony .

Cindy Anthony testified that she was responsible for Internet searches on the family 's home computer for information about chloroform . But records indicated she was at work at the time .

Prosecutors had alleged that Casey Anthony , 25 , killed her daughter , Caylee , in 2008 by rendering her unconscious with chloroform , putting duct tape over her nose and mouth so she would suffocate , or a combination of the two acts .

Asked by NBC 's `` Today Show '' whether legal action will be taken against Cindy Anthony for allegedly perjuring herself on the witness stand , Jeff Ashton responded , `` I think there could be . That will be a decision made by another branch of our office . ''

Ashton himself is leaving his post , proceeding with a retirement that he had delayed to take on the Casey Anthony case . The trial ended Tuesday with Casey Anthony acquitted of murder , manslaughter , and child abuse in the death of her daughter . She was convicted of lying to police , a misdemeanor that usually results in no jail time .

Asked by NBC whether he would pursue Cindy Anthony for perjury if he were staying , Ashton responded , `` I honestly do n't know . That would be a very , very difficult decision to make . As a prosecutor -- I 've been a prosecutor for 30 years -- I hate to say this , but you 're somewhat accustomed to family members trying to help their fellow family members . So you 're kind of used to that .

`` This , of course , was a rather important , you know , deception , if you will , that obviously was proven to be so by the other evidence . What they do with it is going to be a difficult decision that I 'm glad I do n't have to make . ''

Ashton was on HLN 's `` Dr. Drew '' Wednesday evening at 9 p.m. ET .

Holly Hughes , a criminal defense attorney analyzing the Casey Anthony trial for CNN , said she believes `` they 've got enough evidence to prove '' perjury , but `` from a personal , human standpoint , I do n't think we 're going to see it happen .

`` Remember , no matter what we think of Cindy Anthony , she is a victim here . She is a grieving grandmother . ... So we know that she truly truly loved that little girl and misses her . And , at this point , all she was trying to do was save her daughter 's life and it worked . So at this point I think any prosecution is going to look like sour grapes . ''
