Mickey Rooney , whose roller-coaster , nine-decade career in show business included vaudeville , silent films , movies , television and Broadway , died Sunday . He was 93 .

Rooney died in California , the Los Angeles County Coroner 's office said .

Rooney 's career spanned almost the entire history of motion pictures . He made his first film , the silent `` Not to Be Trusted , '' in 1926 and followed it up with several shorts based on the `` Mickey McGuire '' comic strip . He was still making movies nine decades later , including `` Night at the Museum '' -LRB- 2006 -RRB- and `` The Muppets '' -LRB- 2011 -RRB- .

At the time of his death , he had three more films in the works , according to the Internet Movie Database , including a version of `` Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde '' with Margaret O'Brien .

Rooney had just completed his last movie role in the next installment of `` Night at the Museum '' with Ben Stiller .

`` He led a full life but did not have enough time to finish all he had planned to do . He had the time of his life and the utmost respect for the cast and crew , '' his son Mark Rooney said in a statement to CNN Monday .

He separated from his wife , Jan Chamberlin , two years ago and moved in with his son and his wife , Charlene , according to the statement . `` With them he finally found happiness , health and a feeling of safety and was able to enjoy life again . ''

`` Mickey was finally enjoying life as a bachelor , and the morning of his death , they spoke of all their future plans , '' the statement said . `` He loved the business he was in and had a great respect for his fellow actors . ''

For a period in the 1930s and 1940s , boosted by the popularity of the `` Andy Hardy '' series of films , Rooney was the No. 1 star at the box office and perhaps the brightest star at MGM -- a whole studio of `` more stars than there are in heaven , '' as the publicity said . Yet he became as famous for many marriages -- eight , all told -- and his regular tumbles off the Hollywood pedestal as he was for his incredible energy and longevity .

Still , he never stopped getting up .

`` I keep going because if you stop , you stop , '' he told the UK 's Guardian newspaper in 2009 . `` Why retire ? Inspire . ''

Top box-office draw

The diminutive 5-foot , 2-inch Rooney began his acting career shortly after his first birthday , appearing on vaudeville stages with his parents . He was born Joseph Yule Jr. on September 23 , 1920 , in Brooklyn , New York .

His parents split when he was young , but spurred by his mother , he soon found himself in Hollywood . Before he was 10 , he was a star , appearing in dozens of shorts based on the popular `` Mickey McGuire '' strip .

He worked steadily through the 1930s , with notable turns in a 1935 version of `` A Midsummer Night 's Dream '' and 1937 's `` Captains Courageous , '' the latter opposite Spencer Tracy . -LRB- Rooney also appeared in Tracy 's 1938 vehicle `` Boys Town . '' -RRB-

But he shot into Hollywood 's stratosphere in his next film series as Andy Hardy in more than a dozen films produced between 1937 and 1946 .

Andy Hardy was a good-hearted ball of teenage mischief , always trying to make a few dollars or willing to `` put on a show , '' no matter what it took : rounding up friends , using a barn , getting some spare parts from his wholesome middle-American neighborhood . Inevitably , he would be called to account with his father , Judge Hardy , played at first by Lionel Barrymore and later by Lewis Stone . Judge Hardy would reiterate the basics of fairness and morality , and Andy -- and the movie audience -- would have once again learned a valuable lesson .

The films were hugely popular , even more so when Rooney 's character became the centerpiece starting with 1938 's `` Love Finds Andy Hardy . '' It did n't hurt that Rooney was paired with Judy Garland for three of the films .

Garland and Rooney also co-starred in several Busby Berkeley musicals , including 1940 's `` Strike up the Band '' and `` Babes on Broadway '' a year later .

Many marriages , money troubles

But Rooney 's private life was n't always as wonderful as his on-screen persona would indicate . He was married eight times , three times in the 1940s alone . His first marriage , to Ava Gardner , began in 1942 and ended in 1943 . In 1944 , he married an Alabama beauty queen , Betty Jane Phillips ; that one ended in 1948 . His third marriage , to Martha Vickers , lasted less than three years .

Throughout , Rooney was known as a spendthrift and a challenging partner . He loved horseracing and routinely spent his earnings at the track , even when there were n't many earnings to speak of , as there was during a fallow period in the 1950s . As an adult of a certain size , Rooney found it much harder to find roles into which he could channel his prodigious talents .

But he would n't stay unemployed for long . There was a TV series , `` The Mickey Rooney Show , '' for a season in 1954-55 . More important , there was a supporting actor Oscar nomination for 1956 's `` The Bold and the Brave . ''

Rooney , however , was n't very discriminating about his roles . Other films during the late '50s and early '60s included forgettable flicks such as `` Operation Mad Ball '' -LRB- 1957 -RRB- , `` The Private Lives of Adam and Eve '' -LRB- 1960 -RRB- and `` Platinum High School '' -LRB- 1960 -RRB- . He appeared in the classic `` Breakfast at Tiffany 's '' -LRB- 1961 -RRB- but in the unfortunate , broadly acted role of Holly Golightly 's Japanese neighbor , Mr. Yunioshi .

He was one of the cast of a thousand comedians in `` It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World '' -LRB- 1963 -RRB- .

Rooney also made TV guest appearances on such shows as `` The Investigators , '' `` Naked City '' and `` The Twilight Zone . '' On the latter , he played a jockey .

` He is a showman '

After another 15 years of minor movie parts and TV roles , Rooney 's up-and-down career once again hit the heights . He earned an Oscar nomination for his performance as a horse trainer in 1979 's `` The Black Stallion '' and dazzled Broadway in the song-and-dance revue `` Sugar Babies '' -- a role , given his start , he was born to play . The show earned him a Tony nomination and ran for almost three years .

Over the years , Rooney earned four Oscar nominations . In addition , he received a special Oscar in 1939 and an honorary one in 1983 .

Rooney also triumphed on television in the 1981 TV movie `` Bill , '' about a mentally disabled man trying to live on his own . That performance garnered him an Emmy .

He also found a lasting marriage when he wed Jan Chamberlin in 1978 . Chamberlin survives the actor .

However , Rooney once again faced financial struggles as he entered his later decades . They came to national attention when he asked a Los Angeles court to appoint a conservator to protect him from his stepson and stepdaughter . Rooney blamed his financial troubles on a stepson whom he successfully sued .

He also took his case to Congress , delivering emotional testimony to a House committee in March 2011 in which he said family members took control of his life , making him `` scared , disappointed , yes , and angry . ''

Rooney made his audience laugh and cry when he implored senators to stop what experts call chronic emotional , physical , sexual and financial abuse of elderly Americans by family members and other caregivers .

Rooney called on Congress to make elder abuse a specific crime . `` I 'm asking you to stop this elderly abuse . I mean to stop it . Now . Not tomorrow , not next month but now , '' he shouted from the witness table .

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Reva Goetz appointed attorney Michael Augustine as Rooney 's permanent conservator that month . Augustine immediately began seeking entertainment gigs for the aging performer , telling CNN that he had to revive his show business career quickly or would die `` in very short order . ''

Augustine summed up Rooney 's drive in a few sentences .

`` Mr. Rooney 's parents put him on the vaudeville stage when he was 17 months old , '' he said in 2011 . `` If Mr. Rooney were to not work , I think we would be attending Mr. Rooney 's funeral in very short order .

`` It 's part of his fiber , '' Augustine continued . `` He loves it . He is a showman . ''

His last months included reunions with old friends , the family statement said .

`` Even someone of Mickey 's iconic statue was quite star struck and was extremely thrilled to attend Vanity Fair 's Oscar party recently , '' the family said . `` Just last week Mickey was ecstatic when they surprised him by reuniting him with one of his great loves , the race track . There they spent time with Mel Brooks and Dick Van Patten . He had exceptional care and a new lease on life . ''
