-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Coast Guard and the Jamaica Defence Force suspended their searches Sunday for signs of a prominent New York couple whose plane crashed in the Caribbean Sea north of Jamaica .

`` The Coast Guard suspends a search and rescue case with extremely great care and deliberation , '' Capt. Todd M. Coggeshall , chief of response management for the Coast Guard , said in a news release .

`` After a search area is saturated several times with a maximum number of assets , resources and crew effort , and persons in distress are still not located , a decision is made to suspend a case . ''

Jamaica suspended its search because of bad weather , said Capt. Basil Jarett of the Jamaica Defence Force .

The Coast Guard said a C-130 aircraft located several small objects in the water .

The crew used smoke flares and two data marker buoys to mark the location for Coast Guard and Jamaican Defense Force boat crews , the Coast Guard said , but none of the searchers could relocate the objects on Saturday .

Jamaica had said one of its military search team spotted the objects .

The single-engine TBM-900 aircraft , owned by estate developer Larry Glazer and his wife , Jane , crashed into the Caribbean hours after the pilot told an air traffic controller that something was wrong as it flew south over the eastern United States .

Couple who went down in plane helped reshape a city

The plane 's radio was silent for hours after the pilot 's call , prompting U.S. and Cuban military jets to trail the small private plane . The North American Aerospace Defense Command said those aboard might have suffered from hypoxia , which sets in when oxygen is lacking .

There were conflicting reports on how many people were on the plane , with the U.S. Coast Guard indicating there were three .

But relatives said the couple were the only two people on board and were headed from Rochester , New York , to their vacation home in Naples , Florida .

Those aboard were unresponsive for more than four hours , drifting southward over the U.S. mainland , the Atlantic Ocean and eventually into the Caribbean .

Plane crash : What happened ?

Pilot seen slumped over

U.S. fighter jet pilots said when they looked into the aircraft , they saw the pilot slumped over and the windows frosted .

The plane 's radio communication ended about 10 a.m. ET Friday , the Federal Aviation Administration said .

At that time , it was above Statesville , North Carolina , about 600 miles south of the Rochester airport , which it left around 8:45 a.m. .

The pilot asked to descend to 18,000 feet because `` we have an indication that is not correct in the plane , '' according to a stream of that transmission posted on LiveATC.net , which provides live air traffic control broadcasts .

The air traffic controller told the pilot to `` stand by '' and proceed to 25,000 feet as he worked on clearing the plane to go lower . The conversation continued off and on for more than four minutes , though it was largely one-sided : The pilot was n't clear in his remarks and did n't declare any sort of emergency .

At one point , he simply repeated his call sign twice when the controller asked if he heard the request to drop down to 20,000 feet .

Data indicate the plane did n't descend . It cruised for hours about 25,000 feet above the ground .

The private plane dropped off radar at 2:11 p.m. , according to the flight tracking site FlightAware.com .

Estimates suggested the fuel would have run out at 2:15 p.m. .

It crashed 14 miles off Jamaica 's northeast coast .

Fate of couple unknown

Jamaica and the United States swiftly dispatched government aircraft to the scene . Jamaican authorities said they found an oil slick in the prime search area .

The Coast Guard said search crews completed 12 search patterns covering about 3,750 square miles over 70 hours .

As they searched , the Glazer family in Rochester mourned . The couple have three children .

The children said in a statement they were `` devastated by the tragic and sudden loss of our parents . '' They said they are waiting for answers .

Larry Glazer co-founded Buckingham Properties in 1970 after graduating from Columbia University . The company owns and manages more than 50 properties in the greater Rochester area , according to his official bio .

The TBM-900 plane was owned by the company .

Jane Glazer founded QCI Direct , a 100-employee company that has an outlet store , according to its website .

Both Glazers knew how to fly .

U.S. , Cuban fighter jets trail aircraft

The government stepped in when the plane lost communications with air traffic control .

NORAD dispatched two F-16 fighter jets from a base in Richland County , South Carolina . Another pair of fighter jets from Homestead , Florida , took over around 11:30 a.m. and escorted the plane past the U.S. mainland .

The American fighter jets broke off their pursuit 12 miles off Cuba , at which point a Cuban fighter jet took over .

Despite the longstanding tensions between the two countries , Cuba cooperated with the United States and did not consider the plane 's movement a violation of its airspace .

Cuba let the U.S. Coast Guard aircraft go through its airspace and gave permission for American `` military aircraft , if necessary , '' according to an official statement .
