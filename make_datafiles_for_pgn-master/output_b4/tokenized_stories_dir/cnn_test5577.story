-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Lose weight '' is one of the top New Year 's resolutions every year . You 've probably made it once or twice yourself , and we commend you for accomplishing such an ambitious goal .

Oh , you did n't ?

Do n't worry , the majority of your fellow resolutioners did n't either .

`` Do you know the meaning of ` resolution ' ? '' asked Dr. Caroline Cederquist , medical director for bistroMD and the Cederquist Medical Wellness Center . `` It 's ` solution , ' meaning you are solving a problem , with the prefix 're , ' which usually means again . ... We strive to solve a problem again and again and again .

`` They tend to become empty promises to ourselves . ''

The good news is that losing weight is n't the only path to well-being in 2014 . If there 's one thing we 've learned at CNN Health , it 's that a lot of factors affect your health , from where you live to how much TV you watch .

`` Good health happens when the physical , emotional and social or environmental parts of our lives are in balance , '' said Dr. Amy Crawford-Faucher , a family physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center . `` When people resolve to ` lose weight , ' they are actually saying , ` I want to feel and look better . ' ''

So this year , we challenge you to make a new kind of New Year 's resolution . We asked a few of our favorite experts for recommendations , and their answers may surprise you .

Pick one , or several , from the list below . Then make a deal with yourself : This year , `` lose weight '' is n't going to be your main goal , just a nice side benefit to being happy and healthy .

Get some fresh air

Simply being in nature can have a big effect on an overloaded mind , says Jennifer Beaton , vice president for fitness with the Bay Club Company in San Francisco .

When the body 's sympathetic nervous system mobilizes our fight-or-flight response , it ca n't tell the difference between stress caused by a bear attack and stress caused by a meeting with the boss .

In other words , it 's always on . `` Though we might not feel it directly , our bodies do , '' Beaton said .

Find a place in nature that speaks to you , whether it 's a spot in your backyard or a bench at a local park . Visit there regularly , even if it 's only for a short time .

Then make an effort to get some fresh air every day . Park your car a little farther from the door in parking lots , take a quick walk around your office building at lunch , or wake up 15 minutes earlier and jog around your neighborhood , suggests Dr. Rebecca Cipriano , co-founder of Healthy Woman USA .

You 'll be surprised by how much you missed the great outdoors .

Step away from the screen

As shiny as that new device you got for Christmas is , once in a while , you need to put it down .

Research shows children who spend too much time in front of screens -- computers , TV , video games -- are at a greater risk for obesity , have a harder time falling and staying asleep , do n't focus well and experience more anxiety and depression . Who 's to say adults are any different ?

`` My 9-year-old daughter loves when I paint with her , so I make sure to turn off the cell phone and step away from all things work , and just enjoy the moment , '' Cipriano said . `` Turn the TV off , leave the tablet out of your bedroom , and pick up a good book . ''

Sleep more

If you want a major life overhaul without much effort , getting more shut-eye is the way to go . Sleeping helps you burn fat , decreases stress , improves your immune system and boosts your mood and mental clarity , says Jae Berman , a registered dietician and personal trainer with the Bay Club Company .

`` Slowly change your routine to add 15 minutes a night until you get to eight hours , '' she said .

Add something

Instead of subtracting soda , sugar or fat from your diet , make a resolution to add something , suggests Crawford-Faucher . Add a serving of vegetables to every meal . Add protein to your snacks . Add two glasses of water to your daily routine . You 'll find over time that these additions will leave no room for unhealthy habits .

The same resolution can be used for other areas of your life , too . Add 15 minutes of meditation to your bedtime routine or 15 minutes of classical music to your commute to help you destress . Add some organization time to your daily schedule . Add a book on financial planning to your reading list .

Get the point ? Good , add this one to your New Year 's resolutions .

Stop multitasking

If there 's one word that sums up health advice in 2013 , it 's mindfulness : a `` state of active , open attention on the present , '' according to Psychology Today .

`` We teach our guests to be mindful around their eating , '' said registered dietician Kimberly Gomer of the Pritikin Longevity Center + Spa . `` What does this mean ? It means not eating in front of the TV , while on the computer , checking e-mails on the phone or iPad , eating while driving in the car . ... The list goes on and on . ''

Research shows that people who practice mindfulness weigh less , stress less and smile more . And those who try to multitask do it badly . So make an effort to be present this year .

Take time to breathe

When was the last time you inhaled deeply , feeling your ribcage lift and your chest expand ?

Most people take only shallow breaths throughout the day . This limits the oxygen circulating throughout the body , leading to increased anxiety and higher blood pressure , according to Harvard 's Family Health Guide .

`` When a thought comes to your mind , acknowledge it and let it go , '' Berman recommended . `` Count your breaths until you get to 10 breaths and then start back at 1 . ''

Try something new

Try a yoga class or a Spin class . If you do n't enjoy that , try Pilates or Zumba . Go ice skating , snow tubing or skiing , says Deborah Levy , a health and nutrition consultant for Carrington Co. , LLC . Want to eat better ? Take a healthy cooking class .

If you enjoy something , you 're more likely to do it again . And meeting people who share your passion will help incorporate those healthy habits into your social life .

`` The goal is to rediscover yourself , '' Levy said . `` Find those things that bring a smile to your face and good health to your body , and your New Year 's resolution will become a way of life . ''

Be better

No one is perfect . But what if every day , you made a pact with yourself to be a little bit better ?

Today at lunch , instead of chips , you could buy an apple . Instead of watching TV to relax after work , you could do 15 minutes of yoga . Today , you 'll take the kids to the park instead of handing them a video game controller . Not all at once but one thing every day .

`` How can you truly treat yourself and your loved ones better ? That should be the start of your New Year 's resolution , '' said Paula Procida , a personal trainer at CLAY Health Club + Spa . `` The good habits will follow . ''

Choose a theme

If we were giving prizes for the most innovative New Year 's resolution , trainer Shay Kostabi would take home the gold .

Every year , Kostabi picks a theme as her New Year 's resolution . In 2011 , it was `` authenticity . '' In 2012 , it was `` clarity . '' Next year , her theme will be `` Maitri , '' a Sanskrit word that means gentle , loving kindness toward oneself .

`` Choosing just one word that describes how you want to feel instead of what you think you should do or accomplish in the New Year is really powerful , '' Kostabi said . `` Once you 've chosen your theme or your one word , say it out loud , write it down and make sure you really connect to it on a personal level . ''

`` Throughout the year , your theme will guide you in aligning actions , behavior , goal-setting and even how to make the best use of your free time . ''
