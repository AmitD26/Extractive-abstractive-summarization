Charlotte , North Carolina -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Negative , expensive campaigns is something Sen. Kay Hagan is getting an education in this year . And something Hillary Clinton knows very well .

Clinton campaigned Saturday for her fellow Democrat at a Charlotte rally of about 1,800 supporter . The former U.S. senator and secretary of state -- and widely presumed 2016 presidential contender -- used her appearance for Hagan to decry Thom Tillis , the Republican looking to unseat Hagan in November , as someone who will answer to big business , not raise the minimum wage and slash education funding .

And unlike other appearances Clinton has made on the midterm campaign trail , the former first lady spent a portion of her speech Saturday decrying the level of outside spending in the Hagan-Tillis race .

`` Elections come down often to who has got more money , who is pedaling more fear and who turns out , '' Clinton told an excited crowd . The former first lady later criticized the `` onslaught of out of state money and negativity that is coming in against '' Hagan .

`` You have to prove them wrong , '' Clinton urged the crowd . Prove to them `` that no matter how much money has flooded into this state , North Carolina is not for sale '' -- the latter phrase having a mantra for Hagan supporters .

There is a reason Clinton focused on this : The North Carolina Senate race is by far the most expensive in the country this year . So far , campaigns and outside groups have spent close to $ 80 million in the state .

According to the Center for Responsive Politics , Tillis has had $ 44 million of outside money spent on his behalf . Hagan has had $ 22 million .

Tillis is backed by groups like Americans For Prosperity , Crossroads GPS and the Chamber of Commerce . Hagan has been supported by Senate Majority PAC , the National Education Association and AFSCME , a labor organization .

The onslaught of spending likely wo n't stop soon , either . A spokesman for Hagan said he sees the total spent in the campaign jumping to over $ 100 million in the last 10 days of campaign .

What key Senate race means for 2016

This level of spending is something Clinton understands personally : According to the Center for Responsive Politics , Clinton 's New York Senate race in 2000 , which cost over $ 100 million , is the most expensive race ever -LRB- in 2014 dollar terms -RRB- .

Clinton did her part on Saturday to make sure that Hagan had enough money in the final days of the campaign . Before her speech -- which was free for those who attended -- the former first lady took part in a fundraising reception and photo line for the Hagan campaign .

Organizers would not say how much that event raised , but pointed out that it was also used as a reward for active volunteers .

Hagan , too , belied the amount of outside spending in the race , even though she is benefiting from some .

She criticized `` out-of-state billionaires '' who are `` trying to buy this election . ''

`` I want you to help send a message loud and clear to my opponent and his special interest allies , '' Hagan said . `` I want it to be so loud that the Koch Brothers and Karl Rove , wherever they are , because we know they are n't in North Carolina , we want to tell them that North Carolina is not for sale . ''

What the outside spending has meant is near constant negative ads on televisions across the state .

At a focus group of ten North Carolina moms earlier this week , the negative ads were one of many reasons that the women said they were tuning out the Hagan-Tillis race .

`` All I get from all of those is do n't vote for that person , because they are a bad person , vote for me , '' said one woman .

`` Everything we are teaching your kids is ridiculous , '' said another , reflecting on the ads . `` We teach our kids not to bully and that is all they are doing . ''
