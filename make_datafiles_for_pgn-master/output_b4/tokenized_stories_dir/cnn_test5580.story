-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Michigan toddler has died of enterovirus D68 , another reminder of the deadly potential of a disease that has infected hundreds nationwide in two months .

Madeline Reid died at Children 's Hospital of Michigan , where she had been transferred `` for advanced services , '' according to the Detroit hospital 's chief medical officer , Dr. Rudolph Valentini .

`` The CDC confirmed EV-D68 after her arrival here , and she subsequently succumbed to her illness , '' Valentini said .

A Facebook page , dubbed `` Team Maddie ! , '' devoted to the 21-month-old 's plight also confirmed the sad news .

`` Madeline Reid became our angel at 2:55 p.m. -LRB- Friday -RRB- , '' read one post . `` She passed peacefully in her mother and father 's arms . ''

The little girl 's death spurred an outpouring of condolences online , from `` rest in peace sweet baby girl '' to `` enjoy your wings . ''

One of them read : `` Your daughter touched more lives than you 'll probably ever know . May your Angel rest now . ''

Enterovirus is very common , with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the United States .

But like the flu or other viruses , not all the roughly 100 enterovirus strains are the same . D68 is particularly pernicious .

Authorities say this strain has sent more children than usual to the hospital with severe respiratory illness . It seems to be most affecting children with a history of asthma or breathing problems . Yet there are exceptions , such as a 4-year-old from Hamilton Township , New Jersey , who went to bed `` asymptomatic and fine '' only to be found dead the next morning , said Jeff Plunkett , Hamilton Township health officer .

Boy went to bed fine , did n't wake up -- due to enterovirus D68

Enterovirus may also be linked to a small number of cases of a mysterious neurologic illness in Colorado , Boston and Michigan .

Doctors in Colorado spotted it first : a group of 10 children hospitalized with limb weakness , cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter

Staff at Boston Children 's Hospital have since identified four patients with the same symptoms . And a child in Washtenaw County , Michigan , has also developed partial paralysis in the lower limbs after being hospitalized with the virus , according to the Michigan Department of Community Health .

Parents growing anxious about enterovirus D68

As of Friday , the CDC and state public health laboratories had documented 691 cases of enterovirus D68 in 46 states and the District of Columbia . Five patients who died had the virus strain , even if it 's not certain all of them died because of it . Madeline 's case is not yet counted in this tally .

There will be more cases , and perhaps more deaths , in the coming weeks , officials said .

Part of this has to do with a backlog on samples , with the CDC explaining `` it can take a while ... because the testing is complex and slower and can only be done by -LRB- the -RRB- CDC and a small number of state public health laboratories . ''

The virus also has not yet run its course .

As the CDC pointed out , `` Enteroviruses commonly circulate in summer and fall . We 're currently in the middle of the enterovirus season . ''
