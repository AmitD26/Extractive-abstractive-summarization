Pasadena , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A tender smile frames the face of Eva Perez as she remembers the life of her 6-year old son .

`` Hernan was a very happy boy , '' she says . `` He gave me flowers all the time . He 's the first ` man ' -LRB- to -RRB- give me flowers . ''

But her smile is thinly veiled -- her face splintering into tears as she permits the raw truth to surface .

On Valentine 's Day in 1999 , Hernan suffered severe head trauma while sledding in the snow-covered mountains above the Los Angeles basin .

Eva says she tried to reach her son but could n't navigate thick snow and ice . She flagged down a passing vehicle and asked the occupants to alert authorities .

Hernan was airlifted to Huntington Memorial Hospital , where , two days later , he was declared brain dead .

A family care coordinator with One Legacy , an organ and tissue recovery agency , approached Eva and her husband , Arnold , to talk about donating Hernan 's organs .

They decided to donate four of Hernan 's organs : his heart , liver and both kidneys .

`` The right kidney went to an older white gentleman , '' says Arnold Perez , Hernan 's stepfather . `` The left kidney went to an older Vietnamese gentleman . His heart went to a young American boy , and his liver was given to a young girl . ''

That young girl , 9-year old Megan Corfee , recently recalled the day when she and her mother , Debbie , received word that a donor organ was available .

They were at a car wash when the pager from One Legacy started buzzing .

`` I called the coordinator and she told me , ` We have a liver for Megan , get here as soon as you can , ' '' Debbie said . `` I was like ` Wow ! That was fast , after only being of the donor waiting list two weeks . ' ''

When Megan was just 7 years old , she was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis , a liver disease that she says `` made my body think I did n't have a liver . ''

`` I was jaundiced and I was throwing up blood , '' says Megan , who turns 22 this month . `` Basically , when they did the transplant , they said my liver was shrinking , so I was pretty sick . ''

Four years after her successful transplant , Megan sent a thank-you letter to the Perez family . In the letter , printed on floral paper , Megan tells the unnamed `` Donor family '' she enjoys music and watching `` Cosby Show '' reruns .

`` I had my liver transplant when I was 9 years old . I am now 13 and I am doing very well , '' she wrote . `` I am very thankful that you decided to have your loved one 's organs donated . ''

Three years after Megan sent that letter , the two families -- who lived about 30 miles away -- agreed to meet .

`` Megan Corfee came to gladden our hearts , '' Arnold Perez said . `` To me , she is an angel that was given life by another angel , and in our lives , she is a source of light . ''

Since they first met in 2006 , the Corfee and Perez families get together every year at fundraising events for Donate Life , which handles the national organ and tissue registry and helps to raise awareness about the benefits of organ donations .

The Perezes treat Megan like their own child , and Eva and Megan have formed a particularly close bond , communicating nearly every day , either on the phone or via Facebook .

It 's rare for donor and recipient families to meet , let alone forge such a close relationship , according to Bryan Stewart of Donate Life .

`` In the case of Hernan , it was devastating for the family to lose him in such an accident , '' Stewart said . `` And yet at that time , they saw the opportunity to leave a legacy of life where they could see Hernan 's gift grow into other people . ''

Megan 's mother said that sometimes , the meetings between the two families have `` been a little awkward , I think maybe -LRB- because of -RRB- the language barrier . ''

But , Debbie Corfee added , `` I see , especially in Megan , that it 's something that gives her a boost and a spark in life . That life is worth living because of her connection with this family . ''

On a recent Saturday morning at the Rosemont Pavilion next to the Rose Bowl , the Corfee and Perez families met to help hundreds of other volunteers decorate the Donate Life float for the Tournament of Roses Parade scheduled for January 1 .

Eva grasped Megan 's hand tightly and said , `` Look at the float ! ''

`` One More Day , '' read the banner , `` One more day I can have with Hernan and one more day that people are on the waiting list -- they want one more day to receive the transplant . ''

Three years ago , the Perez family was chosen to make a floragraph -- a floral portrait of Hernan on the Donate Life float featured in the parade . Eva Perez was selected to walk alongside the float , holding a tether to a hot-air balloon that featured a portrait of Hernan .

'' -LRB- She -RRB- was literally connected to his portrait , '' Stewart said . `` So for her , it was like walking five miles with her son again . ''

This year , Arnold Perez was chosen by his fellow volunteers to represent them on the Donate Life float . He will be one of 28 float riders .

The Perez family volunteers with Donate Life . Every week , Eva shares her story of loss to visitors to the Mexican Consulate in downtown Los Angeles in the hopes they will sign up to become organ and tissue donors .

Eva Perez credits the organization for giving `` my son 's death meaning . ''

`` I realize that his organs and his life live on in other people , '' she said .

With their son never far from their thoughts , the Perez family will spend this Christmas at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City decorating Hernan 's grave site with tinsel , wreaths and artificial snow as they do every year .

`` In the six short years that Hernan was on Earth , it was clear to see that he was a marvelous boy , '' Arnold Perez said . `` The fact that he was so marvelous and generous made it easier for us to make the choice to have him be an organ and tissue donor .

`` He was a happy child , and the time that I spent with him and held him were really the joy in my life . ''
