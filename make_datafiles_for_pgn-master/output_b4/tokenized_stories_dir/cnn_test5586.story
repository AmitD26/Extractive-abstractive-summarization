WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An 88-year-old Maryland man with a long history of ties to white supremacist groups is the suspect in Wednesday 's fatal shooting at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum , two law enforcement officials told CNN .

The Web site Holy Western Empire includes writings by James von Brunn and a biography .

James W. von Brunn served six years in prison for trying to make what he called a `` legal , non-violent citizens arrest '' of Federal Reserve Board members in 1981 -- a prison term he blamed on `` a Negro jury , Jew/Negro attorneys '' and `` a Jew judge , '' he said on his Web site , Holy Western Empire .

`` He is in our files going back way into the 1980s , '' said Heidi Beirich , a researcher for the Southern Poverty Law Center , based in Montgomery , Alabama . `` He has an extremely long history with neo-Nazis and white supremacists . He 's written extremely incendiary publications , raging about Jews , blacks and the like . ''

Von Brunn is a native of St. Louis , Missouri , and a 1943 graduate of Washington University there . According to his online biography , he served as a Navy officer in World War II and became an advertising artist and executive after the war .

But by the late 1970s , Beirich told CNN , he had become a `` hard-core neo-Nazi '' and an associate of William Pierce -- the white supremacist leader whose 1978 book , `` The Turner Diaries , '' is blamed for inspiring Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh .

In December 1981 , angered by what he called the `` treacherous and unconstitutional '' acts of the Federal Reserve , von Brunn entered the central bank 's Washington headquarters armed with a pistol , a shotgun , a knife and a mock bomb , according to court records . He claimed to be a photographer who wanted to shoot pictures of the boardroom , and bolted up the stairs when security guards told him to wait .

While being subdued , he claimed to have planted a bomb , which forced the building 's evacuation , court records state . He told officers he was upset over high interest rates -- then well into double digits -- and the state of the economy , which was in a recession .

Von Brunn , then 62 , was sentenced to 11 years in prison on attempted kidnapping , second-degree burglary , assault and weapons charges . Read more about von Brunn 's criminal record

In a December 1984 appeal , his court-appointed attorney , John Hogrogian , asked the court to release the defendant on bail , saying his client had `` renounced his actions of December 7 , 1981 , and expressed remorse in a letter addressed to this court . '' Von Brunn has `` a young son and aches to see him again , '' his lawyer wrote .

His trial dealt extensively with Von Brunn 's `` attitudes about black and Jewish people , '' which his lawyer said were irrelevant to the charges he was facing .

Documents were read at trial in which von Brunn wrote , `` Goal : to deport all Jews and blacks from the white nations , '' among other racist statements . In his testimony , he also said `` the basic plan was to wind up where I am now , '' meaning in court to raise publicity for his campaign against the Federal Reserve .

In a telephone interview with CNN , Hogrogian said that he never met von Brunn , since his client was serving his time in Ray Brook Federal Prison in upstate New York .

He said that von Brunn had approached a guard at the Federal Reserve carrying a rifle , but put his rifle on the ground and surrendered when told that he would not be allowed entry .

Hogrogian said he was surprised to hear Wednesday that his former client had shot anyone .

`` I thought it was absolutely consistent with him to lay down his weapon , as he did in ' 81 , because he viewed himself as a man of honor , military code and all that kind of stuff . ''

Von Brunn had told him he served as a PT boat captain during World War II , Hogrogian said .

Hogrogian , who now works for the New York City Law Department , said the two men often communicated via telephone .

`` He was an intelligent guy , he was well-spoken , '' he said . `` Did n't seem like a rabid kind of guy . He seemed sincere in his beliefs . ''

One of those beliefs was that the Federal Reserve was `` debasing the American currency and sapping America 's financial strength in the face of the communist threat , or something , '' Hogrogian recalled .

The appeal was based on the assertion that von Brunn 's lower-court conviction should have been thrown out , Hogrogian said .

`` When he was arrested in 1981 , he had on his person a 12-page manifesto , which went into stuff about racial and ethnic stuff , '' the lawyer said . `` That manifesto was read to the jury at his criminal trial , which I thought was unnecessary and inflammatory . ... There 's no way he could get a fair trial reading this manifesto to the jury . ''

In an unpublished opinion , the three-member panel on the court of appeals disagreed and upheld the lower court 's conviction of von Brunn .

Though von Brunn did not attend Hogrogian 's oral argument before the D.C. Court of Appeals , several of von Brunn 's supporters did -- `` people who call themselves patriots , before they had militias and all that white supremacy stuff ... he called himself a patriot . That was his thing . ''

The lawyer said one of the `` patriots '' approached him in a hallway of the courthouse and told him , `` I 'm a friend of Jim . When we watch the football game and they play the national anthem , he stands in the room and makes everyone else stand at attention . ''

The appeal was denied .

Hogrogian said he could not remember whether von Brunn thanked him afterward , but did remember that von Brunn 's Web site accuses him of having made mistakes in the appeal .

Asked whether he had done so , the 59-year-old responded , `` Well , I was a young lawyer . I did the best I could . '' He added , `` The D.C. Court of Appeals found no mistakes . ''

Von Brunn 's Web site proclaims itself `` a new , hard-hitting expose of the Jew conspiracy to destroy the white gene-pool . '' Postings attributed to von Brunn have appeared on numerous other sites , including ones that call the Holocaust and `` The Diary of Anne Frank '' hoaxes and bemoan the decline of the `` Aryan gene pool .

`` Bit by bit Liberalism ascended . Bit by bit the Constitution was re-interpreted . Bit by bit government institutions and Congressmen fell into JEW hands -- then U.S. diplomacy , businesses , resources and manpower came under JEW control , '' one such message reads . `` Whitemen sat on their collective asses and did NOTHING -- NOTHING BUT TALK . ''

More recently , messages attributed to von Brunn question the authenticity of President Obama 's birth certificate , the subject of numerous conspiracy theories . Advocates of those theories imply that Obama was born overseas and therefore would be constitutionally ineligible to hold office .

Von Brunn was in critical condition Wednesday after being shot by a security guard at the museum . Another guard , Stephen Tyrone Johns , was killed in the shooting , museum officials said . Watch witness describe shooting ''

Washington police and the FBI said the shooting appeared to have been the work of a single gunman , and there was no prior indication of the attack .
