-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Anyone who 's ever read a nutrition label knows that our food supply is full of hard-to-pronounce chemicals . Most are generally recognized as safe , as the Food and Drug Administration likes to say , but a few have given scientists cause for concern .

Azodicarbonamide , for instance . Subway announced last week that it would be removing the controversial chemical from its bread . Generally used for strengthening dough , azodicarbonamide is also found in yoga mats and shoe soles , according to the Centers for Science in the Public Interest . One of the breakdown products is a recognized carcinogen .

Though Subway is going to remove azodicarbonamide , there 's a long list of other chemicals used in its bread : calcium carbonate , calcium sulfate , ammonium sulfate , DATEM , sodium stearoyl lactylate , potassium iodate and ascorbic acid , according to the restaurant 's website -LRB- PDF -RRB- .

And Subway certainly is n't alone . What other chemical additives are commonly found in your food ? Here are seven , picked at random as good practice for the upcoming CNN Spelling Bee -LRB- just kidding -RRB- .

1 . Tartrazine and other food dyes

When Kraft announced last year that it would be removing Yellow No. 5 -LRB- tartrazine -RRB- and No. 6 from certain varieties of its Macaroni & Cheese products , advocates rejoiced . Blue 1 , Green 3 , Red 40 and others have been loosely linked to everything from hyperactivity in children to cancer in lab animals . Generally found in candy , beverages and baked goods , color additives are also used in cosmetics .

But you knew that , right ? Did you also know about the ground-up insects in your drinks ? Cochineal extract is an approved artificial dye derived from a small bug that lives on cactus plants in Mexico and South America . As long as you 're not allergic , you 're safe to drink up , according to the Centers for Science in the Public Interest . Mmmm ...

2 . Butylated hydroxyanisole -LRB- BHA -RRB-

Well , that 's a mouthful . BHA is used to preserve some cereals , chewing gum and potato chips , according to the centers . It 's also used in rubber and petroleum products .

Butylated hydroxyanisole is `` reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen , '' according to the National Institutes of Health -LRB- PDF -RRB- , because of animal studies that have shown that the chemical can cause tumors in rats ' and hamsters ' forestomachs -LRB- something humans do n't have -RRB- and fish livers .

3 . Propyl gallate

Propyl gallate is often used in conjunction with BHA and a chemical called butylated hydroxytoluene , or BHT . These antioxidant preservatives protect oily products from oxidation , which would otherwise cause them to go bad . Propyl gallate can be found in mayonnaise , dried meats , chicken soup and gum , as well as hair-grooming products and adhesives .

Some scientists believe that propyl gallate is an `` endocrine disruptor -LRB- PDF -RRB- , '' meaning it can interfere with humans ' hormones . Endocrine disruptors can lead to developmental , reproductive and/or neurological problems , according to the National Institutes of Health , including fertility issues and an increased risk of some cancers . But the link between propyl gallate and the endocrine system needs to be studied further .

4 . Sodium nitrite

Sodium nitrite is most often used in the preservation and coloring of meats , such as bacon , ham , hot dogs , lunch meat and smoked fish . Without it , these products would look gray instead of red .

Sodium nitrite is also found naturally in many vegetables , including beets , celery , radishes and lettuce . But the nitrite found in vegetables comes with ascorbic acid , which prevents our bodies from turning nitrite into nitrosamines .

Nitrosamines are considered potentially carcinogenic to humans . So some companies are adding ascorbic acid to their meat products to inhibit nitrosamine formation , according to the Centers for Science in the Public Interest .

However , the American Meat Institute points out the National Toxicology Program conducted a multi-year review in which rats and mice were fed high levels of nitrate and nitrite in drinking water , and a panel reviewed the findings and concluded that nitrite is safe at the levels used and not a carcinogen .

5 . TBHQ -LRB- tert-Butylhydroquinone -RRB-

This chemical preservative is a form of butane that is used in crackers , potato chips and some fast food . It can also be found in varnish , lacquer and resin . It helps prolong the shelf life of food and , if it 's consumed at low levels , is considered safe .

In higher doses -- above what the FDA says manufactures can use in food prep -- TBHQ has been found to cause `` nausea , vomiting , ringing in the ears , delirium , a sense of suffocation , and collapse , '' according to `` A Consumer 's Dictionary of Food Additives . '' It may also cause restlessness and vision problems .

6 . Silicon dioxide , silica and calcium silicate

Silicon dioxide , also known as silica , is a naturally occurring material -LRB- PDF -RRB- made up of shells of tiny single-celled algae . You might also recognize it as sand , the kind that gets stuck in your suit at the beach .

Silicon dioxide is used in dry coffee creamer , dried soups and other powdery foods . It is also used as an insect repellent , removing the oily film that covers an insect 's body , causing them to dry out and die .

The EPA concluded that the human health risk is low and `` not unreasonable . '' In rat studies , high-dose exposure has caused some lung problems . Another study of Chinese workers who were heavily exposed to the chemical showed a disproportionate number of deaths related to respiratory diseases , lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases . Silicon dioxide has also been associated with the risk of developing autoimmune diseases -- again only after heavy exposure .

7 . Triacetin -LRB- glycerol triacetate -RRB-

Triacetin , also known as glyceryl triacetate , has been approved and generally recognized as safe by the FDA as a food additive .

In food , it is used as a plasticizer for chewing gum and gummy candy . It can be used to keep food from drying out and in some cookies , muffins and cakes . It is also used in perfume , cosmetics and cigarette filters and in drugs like Viagra .
