-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Girls do n't do science .

If that 's the stereotype , then good luck telling that to these women .

From space archaeologists , to racing car drivers , and Higgs Boson physicists , here are 12 ladies with some of the world 's coolest jobs in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics -LRB- STEM -RRB- .

But it was n't always this way . Growing up , some were told `` You 're OK for a girl , '' or `` If you 're beautiful , you ca n't also be smart . ''

Luckily for us , they did n't take much notice .

We take a look at their most inspirational quotes .

1 . Karen Nyberg , Astronaut

`` When I was in high school , I was certain that being an astronaut was my goal . It was a very important time -- Sally Ride was making her first flight into space and she had a real impact on me .

Those ` firsts ' kind of stick in your head and really become inspirations for you . ''

2 . Zaha Hadid , Architect

`` I used to not like being called a ` woman architect . ' I 'm an architect , not just a woman architect . The guys used to tap me on the head and say ` you 're OK for a girl . '

But I see an incredible amount of need from other women for reassurance that it can be done , so I do n't mind anymore . ''

3 . Fabiola Gianotti , Higgs Boson physicist

`` This job is a great scientific adventure . But it 's also a great human adventure .

`` Mankind has made giant steps forward , '' she said . `` However , what we know is really very , very little compared to what we still have to know . ''

4 . Milka Duno , Race car driver

`` When you put the helmet on , it does n't matter if you are woman or man : your mission is to compete to win .

The important thing is your ability , your intelligence and your determination . ''

5 . Marissa Mayer , CEO of Yahoo , former engineer at Google

`` People ask me all the time : ` What is it like to be a woman at Google ? ' I 'm not a woman at Google , I 'm a geek at Google . And being a geek is just great .

`` I 'm a geek , I like to code , I even like to use spreadsheets when I cook . ''

6 . Nichelle Nichols , former NASA Ambassador and actress

`` Science is not a boy 's game , it 's not a girl 's game . It 's everyone 's game . It 's about where we are and where we 're going .

`` Space travel benefits us here on Earth . And we ai n't stopped yet . There 's more exploration to come . ''

7 . Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw , Founder of drug company Biocon

`` I have never let gender get in my way .

`` It has taken me over 30 years to get from a garage to the huge campus that we have today . And it 's been a long journey . ''

8 . Danica McKellar , Mathematician , writer and actress

`` If you 're beautiful , you 're led to believe that you ca n't also be smart , ''

`` But you can be fun and fit and social and be really smart . And the smarter you are , the more capable you 'll be to handle whatever challenges come up in life . ''

9 . Regina Agyare , Founder of software company Soronko Solutions

`` When I was young I was very interested in science and technology , and my dad brought home the first computer . I played pac man and I was hooked !

By learning to create technology , girls learn to speak up . ''

10 . Weili Dai , Co-founder of Marvell Tech

`` I believe every single woman could accomplish what I 've accomplished . ''

11 . Peta Clarke , Technical Lead at Black Girls Code

`` Now we 're in an age where technology is mandatory , and we wanted young girls to have this understanding and know how to build an app . ''

12 . Dr Sarah Parcak , Space Archaeologist

`` When I was a kid we 'd rent Indiana Jones movies on VHS tapes . It inspired a whole generation of scholars because we saw the excitement , and the passion , and the drama .

What 's amazing to me about archaeology is the stories are even better than what you see in a Hollywood movie . ''
