-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- California voters have just rejected Proposition 19 , the ballot initiative that would have legalized marijuana under state law . Where did Prop 19 go wrong ?

Prop 19 failed in part because many proponents emphasized the wrong arguments for legalization . Many advocates promised major benefits to California 's budget because of reduced expenditure on marijuana prohibition and increased revenue from marijuana taxation . Other supporters claimed that Mexican drug violence would fall substantially .

Both claims were overblown . The budgetary benefits , while not insignificant , would have been small compared with California 's fiscal mess . Mexican drug violence is mainly associated with the cocaine and methamphetamine trades , as well as from marijuana traffic to other states .

Many voters sensed that Prop 19 supporters were overreaching , and this made them suspicious of all the arguments in its favor . Common sense should have recognized that since marijuana was close to legal already , Prop 19 would not have had dramatic effects .

Prop 19 failed also because it overreached . One feature attempted to protect the `` rights '' of employees who get fired or disciplined for using marijuana , including a provision that employers could only discipline marijuana use that `` actually impairs job performance . '' That is a much higher bar than required by current policy .

This provision allowed Prop 19 opponents to claim that workplaces would become infested with impaired pot users . That assertion is not well-founded , but that is not the point . Prop 19 did not need to address employee marijuana-testing in the first place .

A more effective position for Prop 19 supporters would have been that employee marijuana-testing should be unencumbered by state or federal law . That would allow employers to protect themselves and their employees against perceived risks from marijuana , thereby promoting support for legalization .

A final problem with Prop 19 is that it would only have legalized marijuana under state law , since federal law also bans marijuana . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder , moreover , announced just weeks before Tuesday 's election that the administration would enforce the federal law fully even if Prop 19 passed .

This legal limbo would have kept the marijuana market underground , limiting tax revenue and continuing the ills of black market . This ambiguity also dimmed support by making state-level legalization feel like an empty gesture .

So what is the path to legalizing marijuana in the United States ?

First and foremost , advocates must emphasize that in a free society , the burden of proof should be on prohibitionists to justify the interference with liberty that results from outlawing marijuana , a burden the prohibitionists have never met . Any calm assessment of marijuana versus alcohol , for example , shows that alcohol is the substance with the greater potential for harm .

Ancillary benefits of legalization are naturally important : by eliminating the black market , legalization promises reduced crime and corruption , fewer infringements on civil liberties , better quality control for marijuana users , along with budgetary benefits . But these considerations are unlikely to convince the majority until more people agree that government should not interfere in the private decision to consume marijuana .

Marijuana advocates should also focus on federal law , in addition to or even instead of state law . Legalization proponents have long despaired of affecting change at the federal level and assumed that state-by-state change would someday bring down federal prohibition . That position is understandable , and it has achieved some success , such as the decriminalization of medicalization of marijuana in many states .

Yet it 's hard to see the federal apparatus yielding ground without direct elimination of its authorization ; the stakes for those who hold this power are too high . Legalizers can also argue compellingly that no reasonable interpretation of the Constitution justifies federal imposition of a marijuana ban .

A final key to legalizing marijuana is to get conservatives , not just liberals , more involved . A number of well-known conservatives have advocated legalization , such as Milton Friedman , George Schultz , and William Buckley , but the general perception is that legalizers are `` stoners , '' acting mainly out of self-interest .

Yet legalization can appeal to conservatives , especially if the arguments emphasize freedom , personal responsibility , and the Constitution , along with up-front clarity about the goal : legal production and use of marijuana for adults , whatever their motivations . Past liberal efforts , such as medical marijuana , invite charges of hypocrisy and weaken support .

Marijuana can and should be legal , Prop 19 's failure notwithstanding . But the strategy for achieving that end must change .
