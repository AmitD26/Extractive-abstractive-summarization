-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's being called the most expensive divorce in the history of ... well , marriage .

Russia 's Dmitry Rybolovlev , 47 , earned the dubious honor when Geneva , Switzerland 's Court of First Instance last week ordered the 47-year-old billionaire to pay his wife , Elena , about 4 billion Swiss francs , according to CNN 's French affiliate BFM .

That 's a little more than $ 4.5 billion -LRB- little being a relative term -RRB- .

The couple was married for 23 years but have been engaged in divorce proceedings since 2008 , BFM reported , citing the Swiss daily newspaper Le Temps .

Rybolovlev , who owns the French soccer team AS Monaco , which finished second in Ligue 1 this season , is No. 148 on Forbes ' list of billionaires . His estimated worth is $ 8.8 billion , according to Forbes .

Known lately for real estate moves -- including the purchases of a $ 300 million penthouse in Monaco and a $ 98 million Palm Beach , Florida , mansion owned by Donald Trump , along with his daughter 's purchases of an $ 88 million New York apartment and the Greek island of Skorpios -- Rybolovlev made his original fortune in fertilizer , according to Forbes .

He and his father , a scientist , started their business in 1990 , and Rybolovlev began buying shares of industrial enterprises in 1992 , Forbes reported .

In 1995 , he was named chairman of the board of Uralkali , Russia 's top producer of potassium fertilizers , Forbes said . He sold his stake in Uralkali for $ 6.5 billion in 2010 and procured a controlling stake in AS Monaco the following year .
