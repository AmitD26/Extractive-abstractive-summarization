-LRB- TIME.com -RRB- -- Peter Salk and Aseefa Zardari never met before today , but they have an odd and very significant thing in common : both of them were inoculated against polio by one of their parents .

In the case of Salk , of course , it was his father Jonas , who administered his just-developed vaccine to himself , his lab workers and his family even before it was formally approved and released . Aseefa 's inoculator was her mother , the late Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , assassinated in 2007 .

`` I have a picture of my wife immunizing our daughter 18 years ago , '' said Asif Zardari , the current president and Aseefa 's father , at a United Nations gathering Saturday . `` My martyred wife told the world she dreamt of a world in which all children are free of disease . ''

Father , daughter and Salk had come to the U.N. as part of a new international push to eradicate polio once and for all , and they were hardly alone .

Also in attendance were U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon ; Afghan President Hamid Karzai ; Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan ; Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard ; U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius ; and -- significantly -- Bill Gates , head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .

All of them and others addressed a plenary session of the U.N. 's Economic and Social Council , and all of them had a single promise : by 2015 , if not earlier , polio would join smallpox as the only diseases in human history to be finally and fully snuffed out in the wild .

TIME.com : Polio 's back . Why now ?

There was an odd-seeming disconnect between the financial and institutional firepower assembled Saturday and the actual , lingering incidence of polio .

In 1952 , three years before the Salk vaccine was introduced , 52,000 children were paralyzed or killed in the U.S. alone . In 1988 , polio was endemic in more than 120 countries , still afflicting an average of 350,000 people -- mostly children -- per year .

Today , the disease is endemic in just three countries -- Pakistan , Afghanistan and Nigeria -- and only in isolated pockets at that , an improvement due in no small part to the efforts of Rotary International , whose 34,000 chapters worldwide have spent more than $ 1.2 billion in the past 24 years to wipe out the disease .

So far in 2012 , there have been just 88 reported cases , and India , which once had a higher incidence than any country in the world , just celebrated a full polio-free year .

In epidemiological terms , that ought to be enough to declare victory -- especially in a world in which 34 million people are infected with HIV and a staggering 225 million have malaria .

But numbers can be dangerously misleading , and this is especially the case with polio . For one thing , only about 1 of 200 polio infections actually produce disease symptoms . The other 199 are subclinical , which means patients may have no idea they 're infected , even though they can still pass on the virus -- and it 's one that 's exceedingly easy to pass , especially in the developing world where poor sanitation accelerates transmission .

Why polio has n't gone away yet

In 2003 , polio was on the brink of extinction just as it is today , until clerics in northern Nigeria banned the vaccine claiming that it was part of a plot to infect Nigerian youth with HIV . By 2005 , polio cases -- nearly all of them the Nigerian strain -- were raging across 16 countries , from Africa through India and into Oceania . `` As long as the polio virus survives , '' said Sebelius in her U.N. remarks , `` there 's a risk of resurgence . ''

Ensuring that it does n't survive was the announced mission of the gathering , and that mission is being prosecuted in a lot of ways -- starting with money .

Gates has committed more than $ 1 billion to polio vaccination efforts so far and is keeping the funding spigot open as long as necessary . Rotary Chairman Wilford Wilkinson announced another $ 75 million to add to the group 's already huge contribution ; Australia pledged another $ 50 million .

Perhaps most important , the Islamic Development Bank has now stepped into the game , pledging $ 227 million to Pakistan to help close an existing funding gap until the virus is at last eradicated .

TIME.com : How a ban on polio puts the entire world at risk

It 's Pakistan that is currently ground zero in the polio war , not because it has the greatest number of remaining cases -- though it does -- but because the anti-polio effort has recently been politicized , just as it was in Nigeria nine years ago .

In June , the Taliban blocked a planned round of vaccinations for 161,000 children , demanding that U.S. drone strikes in the country be halted first .

Western vaccinators have also been newly suspect , ever since the British newspaper the Guardian revealed that CIA operatives involved in the killing of Osama bin Laden used a faux vaccine campaign in Pakistan to obtain DNA from suspected bin Laden family members , in order to determine if he was in the country at all . In July , gunmen attacked polio teams administering vaccines after the prohibition was lifted , critically wounding a Ghanaian doctor . That tragedy hung over the U.N. proceedings .

Taliban 's vaccine ban may affect 280,000 children

`` This is a matter of health and justice , '' Ban said in his prepared remarks . `` Where there is fighting and insecurity , I appeal to all parties to provide safe access to health workers . '' Zardari announced that government forces are mobilizing community leaders `` to understand that the polio vaccine is a blessing . ''

Gates 's remarks were less about geopolitics than about common sense -- fiscal and otherwise . In a conversation with TIME last week , he described a vaccination program that costs even $ 1 billion per year as `` a heck of a bargain '' since it avoids tens of billions of dollars in downstream treatment costs -- to say nothing of human suffering .

`` I 'm very focused on impact per dollar , '' he said at the U.N. `` This is one of the smartest allocations of resources the world can make . ''

To help the world make that investment well , he is employing satellite mapping tools to target more precisely where in often off-the-grid places vaccination teams must go . He is also arranging to equip vaccine crates with GPS tracking systems to ensure that vaccines do n't wind up lost , discarded or on the black market .

Ultimately , he 'd like to see the techniques and infrastructure that are built to eradicate polio today put to work against malaria , measles , HIV , cholera and similar global scourges tomorrow . `` We want to leave in place a primary health care system that can be used for other diseases , '' he said .

Gates sounded confident that polio could indeed be beaten and in relatively short order -- within just two or three years ; Goodluck Jonathan pledged that in Nigeria at least the disease would be finished by 2015 , when his term in office expires ; and Alan Duncan , the U.K. 's Minister of State for International Development -- representing the world 's second largest donor country after the U.S. -- delivered an open scolding to developed nations that have yet to get off their wallets and help pay for the eradication effort .

`` We need to understand why some countries are reluctant to contribute , '' he said with pointed emphasis . `` India has shown the world what is possible . Other countries have got to learn from that excellent example . ''

Bin Laden raid harms Pakistan polio fight

For all the new emphasis and fresh blood being brought to the anti-polio fight , it was the seniors in the crowd who spoke with the most poignancy .

Sebelius recalled being a small child during that viral summer of 1952 when so many of her peers were claimed , and then , in 1955 , becoming part of what was known as the Polio Pioneers -- the first schoolchildren to step forward and receive the new vaccine .

In the waiting area before the event began , an elderly polio survivor moving with the aid of two walking sticks approached Peter Salk to thank him for the work his father had done -- even if it came too late to spare him the disease .

In a pre-vaccine world , there was no one to blame for that victim 's long-ago infection . But in ways big and small , we 'll all be to blame for any infections to come .
