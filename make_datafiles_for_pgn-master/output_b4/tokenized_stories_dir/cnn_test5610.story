-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The price of silverware just got a whole lot more expensive .

But can $ 134 million and the royal seal of approval of the Duchess of Cambridge , Kate Middleton , bring the coveted America 's Cup back to British shores for the first time in history ?

`` This is about righting a wrong , '' said Ben Ainslie , the most successful Olympic sailor of all time , as he revealed the British team he hopes will defeat billionaire Larry Ellison 's reigning U.S. champions .

`` We 've never won it . We have a huge maritime history . We have to bring this thing home . ''

In the 163 year history of the race , Britain has never won the prestigious silver trophy . Adding insult to injury , the first competition took place on its shores in 1851 .

Will the `` Auld Mug , '' as it is affectionately known , finally return to its birthplace in the next edition of the race in 2017 ?

Thanks to that hefty budget -- partly spent on designing high-tech boats capable of slicing through the water at 95 kilometers per hour -- Britain 's challenge is not to be taken lightly .

Rule Britannia

Glamor to the bid was provided by the Duchess , who joined Ainslie on the manicured lawns of London 's Maritime Museum for the official launch on a sweltering summer morning .

A keen sailor herself , the Duchess went head-to-head against her husband Prince William in a yacht race during their recent tour of Australia and New Zealand -- emerging victorious 2-0 .

It 's hoped she 'll not only pass on some of that winning spirit to Ainslie 's team , but also add the type of international lustre so attractive to the world 's richest investors .

Money matters

Around 40 % of the $ 134 million budget has already been raised , with Ainslie and his board now on the hunt for big commercial sponsorship .

It 's a huge investment -- and one they 're touting as the advertising chance of a lifetime .

`` If you could be the brand that brings the America 's Cup back to Britain , I think that 's a phenomenally powerful thing to be associated with , '' said Charles Dunstone , chairman of the racing team and co-founder of British phone retailer The Carphone Warehouse .

`` We certainly would n't say it has to be a British company , '' he added . `` But I think it needs to be someone who has business interests and is supportive of Britain . ''

Ellison 's Oracle

The team will need deep pockets to be a serious contender against reigning champions Oracle Team USA -- owned by tech billionaire Larry Ellison , the fifth wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes .

Ainslie is under no illusions about the challenges ahead . He was part of Ellison 's 2013 winning team , helping them to a thrilling comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand .

`` Standing on that podium it did cross my mind that this would be more satisfying with a British team , '' said 37-year-old Ainslie .

`` This is n't Larry Ellison 's budget , so we have to be very focused with the money we have , '' he said , adding that the multimillion dollar pot would go towards design , logistics , and a world class crew .

And if anyone is up to the mammoth task of taking on Ellison , it 's got to be Ainslie .

`` They say Ainslie has the Midas touch -- I 'm not sure about that , but I have seen him time and time again achieve the impossible , '' said Olympic gold medalist and CNN 's Main Sail presenter Shirley Robertson .

`` That said , he 's also no stranger to the monetary might of Ellison and what that can achieve . ''

Daring design

This is not a competition based on brute strength alone , and part of Britain 's success will come down to the clever design of their vessel .

Gone are the days of heavy yachts with single hulls and white billowing sails .

Today 's multihulls are like airplanes on water , sitting high above the waves , with crew members wearing wetsuits , carry oxygen tanks , and communicating via radio .

Combined with advancements in TV coverage -- thrilling angles , graphics and on board cameras -- last year 's Cup coverage breathed new life into a notoriously unfriendly spectator sport .

`` Finally here was a format the public seemed to absolutely love , '' said Dunstone .

`` People who had never talked about sailing before , never had any interest in it , suddenly became absolutely captivated by the Cup . ''

Britain 's best bet ?

Of the six crew members revealed , four hail from Britain and two from New Zealand -- including three times America 's Cup winner Jono MacBeth .

The New Zealander was quick to point out that Ainslie was `` the type of bloke who always gets in the first round of beers , '' and you get the feeling this is n't just an assemblage of world class athletes , but close friends hoping to make history together .

`` I remember as a kid watching these amazing boats racing , '' said Ainslie , who grew up in Cornwall , on England 's picturesque south west coast .

`` It 's just something that hit me , and I had this burning ambition and desire to be part of the America 's Cup team -- and ultimately part of the winning British America 's Cup team . ''

How true that turns out to be , we 'll soon find out .
