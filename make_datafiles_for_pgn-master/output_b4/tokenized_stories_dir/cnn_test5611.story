The Chinese government had stern words for Israel at the start of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's five-day visit to the country .

`` We oppose the use of weapons . We believe the sovereignty of any country should be respected , '' said Hua Chunying , China 's foreign ministry spokeswoman on Monday , responding to reports that Israel carried out airstrikes against its neighbor Syria last weekend .

`` China calls upon relevant parties to bear in mind peace and stability of the region , to exercise restraint and refrain from any actions that may escalate the tension , '' she added .

Strangely , Netanyahu 's visit to China on Monday coincided with the arrival of the President of the Palestinian Authority , Mahmoud Abbas .

Beijing said it would be willing to host a bilateral meeting between the two Middle Eastern leaders . But an Israeli government official told CNN there were no plans for secret talks in China between Netanyahu and Abbas .

`` Do n't hold your breath for a summit in Beijing , '' the Israeli official told CNN , on condition of anonymity .

The Israeli official said the Chinese had `` never been involved in mediating or suggesting new ideas or making plans . They are the big silent giant . ''

China has not traditionally played a mediation role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . But this week the world 's second largest economy appeared to be flexing its diplomatic muscles in the Middle East , proposing a four-point peace plan and repeating its call for the establishment of a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem .

`` The issue , already lasting more than half a century , has brought deep suffering to the Palestinian people and remains an important reason of extended turbulence in the Middle East region , '' said Chinese president Xi Jinping , during a meeting with Abbas on Monday , according to China 's state news agency Xinhua .

Israel 's prime minister is visiting China 's commercial capital Shanghai on Tuesday . He is expected to travel on to Beijing on Wednesday .

China 's foreign ministry spokesman suggested Netanyahu may get a tough , unwelcome message from his Chinese hosts .

`` On the current Syrian situation and Israel 's continuous air raid inside , I have already expounded China 's position , '' Hua said on Tuesday . `` And we will explicitly tell the Israeli side China 's position . ''

China has a long history of expressing public support for the Palestinians .

The Chinese government has also used its veto in the United Nations Security Council to protect the Syrian government from facing Western-backed sanctions , throughout two years of bloody violence in Syria .

However , Beijing has also quietly established closer trade ties in recent years with Israel .
