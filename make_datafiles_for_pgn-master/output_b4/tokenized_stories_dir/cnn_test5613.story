Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Members of the Congressional Black Caucus gave voice to the frustrations of demonstrators who gathered in Ferguson , Missouri , as well as places like Washington , D.C. , Monday night to protest a grand jury 's decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown .

Rep. Marcia Fudge , the caucus ' chair , called the grand jury 's decision a `` slap in the face to Americans nationwide '' in a statement released just moments after St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced the grand jury 's decision .

`` This decision seems to underscore an unwritten rule that Black lives hold no value ; that you may kill Black men in this country without consequences or repercussions , '' Fudge said , calling the decision a `` miscarriage of justice . ''

The shooting of Brown , an unarmed black teenager , at the hands of Wilson , who is white , drove locals and activists around the country to the streets of Ferguson this summer and again this week in anticipation of a grand jury announcement which many hoped would at least deliver a trial in the shooting .

As tensions in Ferguson flared and violence erupted amid largely peaceful protests , the caucus members called on protesters to remain peaceful in expressing their anger and urged activists to channel a moment of frustration into a larger movement to effect change on the justice system and relations between African-American communities and police departments nationwide .

Rep. John Lewis , a veteran of the civil rights movement who helped lead the 1963 March on Washington alongside Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr. , sent a message to protestors on Twitter :

`` Only love can overcome hate . Only nonviolence can overcome violence , '' he tweeted . `` I know this hard . I know this is difficult . Do not succumb to the temptations of violence . There is a more powerful way . ''

The Black Caucus members also stressed the need for the Justice Department to pursue its federal civil rights investigation into the deadly shooting , with several calling the local investigation deeply flawed .

Rep. Karen Bass said in a statement Monday that she was `` deeply disturbed '' that the grand jury did not indict Wilson .

`` The announcement continues a trend of injustice that has rightfully created an environment of anger and concern in Ferguson , Missouri and across the United States , '' Bass said . `` From the onset , Ferguson law officials have been negligent in their handling of this tragic death . ''

She said Ferguson officials `` botched '' the case from the start , noting that Brown 's body was in the street for hours after he was killed and called officials `` mean-spirited '' for leaking surveillance footage of Brown stealing cigars from a convenience store shortly before he was gunned down . That footage had not been requested by media in an information request .

`` And tonight the grand jury attacked justice by not holding Officer Wilson accountable for his actions , '' she said . ''

Attorney General Eric Holder pledged Monday night to pursue the civil rights investigation into the shooting and a second investigation into allegations of misconduct by the Ferguson Police Department .

Rep. Lacy Clay , who represents Ferguson and St. Louis County in Congress , called the grand jury 's decision `` extremely disappointing '' and said he shares `` the anger and frustration , '' but called on protesters to be nonviolent .

Clay added that he was not surprised by the grand jury 's decision and said he had been concerned about the local investigation since Brown 's death .

`` The pursuit of justice for Michael Brown , Jr. and his family is not over , '' he said . ''

The two senators from Missouri , Democrat Claire McCaskill and Republican Roy Blunt released statements following the grand jury 's decision calling for protests to remain peaceful .

Blunt said in a statement he hoped the community could `` move forward and heal as we work to find better job opportunities in and more investment for challenged communities . ''

He added that his thoughts were with Brown 's family and with `` those in law enforcement who continue to protect the rights of all they serve . ''

McCaskill acknowledged that many were disappointed by the decision and said she is waiting for the results of the Justice Department 's civil rights investigation .

`` While we await the conclusion of that independent investigationâ € '' and continue working together for solutions to systemic issues highlighted by this tragedyâ € '' I 'm praying that the good people of St. Louis and local law enforcement will remain peaceful and respectful of one another , '' McCaskill said .

Another Missouri lawmaker and member of the Congressional Black Caucus , Rep. Emanuel Cleaver , posted a dozen messages on Twitter as St. Louis County prosecutor began his press conference to announce the grand jury 's conclusion .

Sen. Cory Booker , the only Senator in the black caucus , tweeted after the grand jury decision Thursday that his thoughts were with Michael Brown 's family and echoed `` their calls for peace / nonviolence . ''

Sen. Tim Scott , a black Republican who is not a member of the caucus , said he hoped that `` good can come out of this tragic situation '' and called on activists to channel their frustration into `` productive ways to build our communities . ''
