While the demographic composition of the 113th Congress is in some sense historic , many issues it will face - government spending , entitlement reform , and immigration - are nothing new .

Will the new Congress continue the reputation of its predecessor as a ` do-nothing Congress ' or will be productive ?

Here 's a look - by the numbers - at the new wave of legislators on Capitol Hill :

13 - New senators .

New Congress more diverse than ever

84 - New House members .

98 - Women in the new Congress : 78 in the House , 20 in the Senate .
