-LRB- CNN -RRB- Before you fly this holiday season , do n't forget to remove your gun from your carry-on bag .

Not remembering could get you in trouble .

The U.S. Transportation Security Administration has seized a record 2,000 firearms from carry-on luggage this year , as of December 1 .

That 's more than the TSA has ever seized in any other full year of its existence . And we still have another month to go .

`` The vast majority of passengers have no nefarious intent but forgot their firearm in their carry-on bag , '' TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein wrote in an email .

Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport security has seized the most guns this year , with 109 guns as of December 1 . Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is in second place with 93 gun seizures , and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is in third place with 73 gun seizures .

Forgetting can be costly .

Passengers whose guns are spotted by TSA security during the screening process can be arrested by airport or local police and face criminal charges , and the TSA can impose civil penalties . And TSA Pre-check members can be temporarily or permanently banned from the expedited screening program .

`` It is a reminder that passengers should check their personal belongings before arriving at the TSA checkpoint , to ensure they do not have any prohibited items in their possession , '' Feinstein said .

In 2013 , the TSA seized 1,813 guns , up from 1,556 in 2012 and 1,320 seized in 2011 . The agency seized 1,123 guns in 2010 , 976 guns in 2009 , 926 guns in 2008 , 803 guns in 2007 and 821 guns in 2006 .

If you need your gun at your final destination , do n't just drop it into your suitcase and check that bag to your mom 's house . Go to www.tsa.gov to find the TSA rules to follow for checking firearms and other weapons . There are also state and local weapons laws that vary by jurisdiction .

And it 's not just about real guns . The TSA does n't want you to attempt bring your firearm replicas , special gravy , cranberry sauce or super-special snow globes through passenger screening this December . Check them , ship them ahead of time or consider making your special sauce once you arrive .

Pies and cakes can go through passenger screening but may be subject to secondary screening . And a horror for Santa-believing parents everywhere : Presents may be unwrapped .
