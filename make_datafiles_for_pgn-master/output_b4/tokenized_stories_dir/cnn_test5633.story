-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Annette Fredskov 's recipe to alleviate the often crippling effects of multiple sclerosis is a curious concoction .

It consists of one year , 366 marathons , 15,442 kilometers and 20 pairs of running shoes .

`` It 's amazing because now I know I have a diagnosis , but I know I feel healthy and I am healthy , I have no disease , '' she told CNN 's Human to Hero series .

`` I know my body now and I also listened to my body every day during the project , so I have no fear at all . It 's amazing .

`` My muscles got stronger during the project and also my bones got stronger and my body found a balance , so I 'm in good shape . ''

It was n't always this way , though .

The Dane was diagnosed with MS three years ago . The disease -- which attacks the body 's central nervous system -- has several forms , ranging in seriousness .

Like 85 per cent of sufferers , Fredskov has relapsing remitting MS , which means symptoms can appear then fade away , either partially or completely .

Initially , it enveloped the 41-year-old , prompting a six-month spell of introspection and fear .

As well as numbness down her left side , she was also blighted with dizziness and extreme tiredness .

`` At one point I was really sad about that and I was feeling sorry for myself , '' Fredskov explained .

`` Some days were very hard and I thought , ` What am I going to do ? I ca n't work , I 'm so tired and I 'm going to sit in a wheelchair . '

`` Other days I thought , ` Well , this is going to be OK , I 'll handle it . ' So I had six months on a rollercoaster ride , you could say .

`` Then I got my act together and I thought , ` I 'm feeling sorry for myself and I 'm sick and it 's not the way I wanted things to be , but I can decide for myself what I am going to do from now . ' ''

The outlet for this enduring commitment to vitality was running -- a whole lot of running .

Having flirted with the sport at various stages of her life , Fredskov was a committed runner by the time her multiple sclerosis was confirmed .

And it proved to be a valuable vehicle in her fight to remain physically and mentally fit .

`` The curiosity about our mind and our body is really a big motivation for me that started with my diagnosis , '' said Fredskov , who has written a book about her feats .

`` It 's hard to explain what happened . Before I would run once in a while and I could n't really get the hang of it , I did n't really enjoy it . But six years ago I was ready to fall in love with running . ''

Even the most committed of athletes would surely tremble at the prospect of completing 26 miles every day for a whole year .

But Fredskov says her decision was empowering , helping to reinforce her viewpoint that she could retain an important element of control over her disease .

`` A year after my first marathon , I was sitting in the car with my husband and thinking out loud , ` Would n't it be amazing if I could run a marathon every day for a year ?! '

`` Instead of just letting it go or not answering he said , ` If anybody can do it , it would be you . '

`` So the dream was alive . We talked about it , it just felt right in both our stomachs . I wanted to run and he wanted to support me . I 've learned that if there 's anything I want to do , I can do it .

`` It 's not every day I just jump out of bed and say , ` Wow , this is a happy day , ' but I know if I wake up and feel my head is heavy , that I 'm not feeling so good , I know I can make it a good day anyway -- that 's my choice .

`` I can choose to be , ` Oh , tell everybody I 'm not feeling so well , ' or I can tell myself , ` No , I want to feel good and tell everybody I 'm feeling good . ' It 's my choice . That 's kind of a freedom . ''

Even scrolling through the complete list of Fredskov 's marathons on her website is exhausting .

All of them were completed in Denmark , most around the town of NÃ ¦ stved . Unsurprisingly , Fredskov 's very first marathon was her quickest , clocking in at four hours , 25 minutes and 30 seconds .

She drank two liters of soda a day to keep her body infused with sugar , got through a pair of running shoes every 18 days , and maintained an average time of around five hours .

`` There were lonely moments , because I was the only one doing this , '' she explained .

`` Sometimes I just felt so tired and thought , ` Nobody knows what I 'm feeling right now , ' and that sometimes felt lonely .

`` Also when people told me , ` You can do this , try that , ' and I thought you do n't know what you 're talking about because I 'm the only one who has tried to run a marathon and it 's hard -- I 'm tired ! ''

A glutton for punishment , Fredskov decided to run not one but two marathons on her 365th day , spending a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes pounding the roads .

`` When I got to the finish line , I had no words , '' she said . `` It was overwhelming , my head was empty . The only thing going through my mind was thank you for everything .

`` I ran over the finish line and my kids and my husband were there ready to hug me , and Emilia and Victor they made a big sign saying , ` You are awesome mum ! '

`` I just started crying -- it was the best day of my life . I have a lot of those but it 's going into history . ''

As you might have guessed , her marathon year is n't the limit of Fredskov 's ambitions , and another assignment is already in the pipeline .

`` My next challenge in the running shoes is completing five marathons in 48 hours , '' she reports .
