The loudspeaker at a nearby mosque warned Ifat Najeeb what was coming .

Najeeb , 60 , woke to warnings that a flood was imminent in the Gogjibagh region of Srinagar , Kashmir , where she and her husband live . Residents were advised to leave and move to safer areas .

`` I woke up suddenly and felt something was wrong , '' Najeeb told CNN . `` Soon there was a thud and our main gate had been flung open by gushing waters which were rising alarmingly . ''

Moments later , water was pouring into Najeeb 's home .

`` Within no time our first floor was inundated . We rushed upstairs to the third floor as we watched dreadfully the waters covered the second floor in no time as well , '' Najeeb said .

Najeeb and her husband were rescued by authorities , eventually relocating to an unaffected area in uptown Srinagar .

They consider themselves lucky .

`` Mercifully , the waters did not rise beyond the second floor , otherwise I and my husband would not be alive to tell the story , '' she said .

Recent flooding brought by heavy monsoon rains has wrought death and destruction in India and Pakistan since the rains began on September 2 .

Floods are n't uncommon in Kashmir , but these have been particularly severe in terms of damage and loss of life .

Nearly 500 have lost their lives in both countries , officials tell CNN .

At least 280 people have been killed in Pakistan and more than 500 others injured , the government there said .

And at least 200 people have died in flooding in Indian-administered Kashmir , Indian Home Ministry spokesman Kuldeep Dhatwalia told CNN .

Some volunteers in that country fear the toll could be much higher .

`` Our teams on the ground in Srinagar have seen a number of bodies floating . The casualty is believed to be much more than what his being officially reported , '' said Syed Zafar Mahmood , president of the nonprofit Zakat Foundation of India group . `` A number of villages have been washed away . ''

By Saturday , military and other emergency crews were able to rescue more than 276,000 people from parts of the flood-ravaged region under Indian control , according to officials .

Home to 12 million people , the state of Jammu and Kashmir is India 's 19th most populous province .

Public anger

Indian officials said rescue efforts continued on a massive scale , but refused to confirm reports that hundreds of thousands of people still remained stranded a week after floods wreaked havoc in the Himalayan valley .

Public anger has grown over the government response to the disaster in the restive mountain state , beset with decades-old militancy and a center of conflict between archrivals India and Pakistan .

TV footage showed frustrated residents shouting slogans and heckling at least one senior Kashmiri politician , who visited a relief camp in Srinagar in the aftermath of the catastrophe . There have also been reports of sporadic attacks against rescuers .

Many people are accusing the local government of a failure to deal with the disaster .

`` There was a complete breakdown of communication , '' said Sheikh Manzoor Ahmed , a New Delhi-based Kashmiri man whose ancestral house collapsed in Srinagar . `` Hospitals got flooded . There was no one to coordinate locally with rescue teams arriving from other parts of the country . How can they be expected to know the topography of the valley ? ''

Pakistani military delivers aid

In Pakistan , the flooding has affected more than 2 million people , the government said .

The military has blown up dykes in the central part of the country to prevent overflowing rivers from swamping cities , according to the government .

Meanwhile , the military is evacuating residents and dropping food by air in the districts of Multan , Muzaffargarh and Jhang , the Pakistani military said .

Civilian and military officials have been using helicopters and boats to evacuate marooned people since September 3 , the military said .

Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited flood-affected residents in Athara Hazari in Jhang district Saturday , according to his office .

Sharif said the federal and provincial governments were working together to help the flood victims , adding that `` this is not a favor , but the responsibility of the government to extend a helping hand to the calamity-hit people . ''
