Sudan has withdrawn its soldiers from Abyei , a disputed border region also claimed by South Sudan , but has left police officers , the United Nations peacekeeping mission said Wednesday .

`` The mission has confirmed the full withdrawal of the SAF from Abyei area yesterday , '' said Josephine Guerrero , a spokeswoman for the U.N. 's Department of Peacekeeping Operations in New York , referring to the Sudan Armed Forces . `` Armed police forces are still in the area . ''

South Sudan 's army spokesman , Philip Aguer , said he is `` skeptical '' that Sudan has truly pulled troops out .

He said he had received reports that the Sudan Armed Forces left two platoons of soldiers dressed in police uniforms in Abyei town , and that two battalions remain about 40 miles away in Diffra , which is the only oil field inside the disputed territory .

`` We have our reservations about Sudan 's claims that it withdrew from Abyei , '' he said , adding that his government is investigating reports that Sudanese soldiers remain in the area .

The conflicting claims come on the second day of renewed peace talks between Sudan and South Sudan , which are being hosted by the African Union in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa .

Talks have been ongoing since the South declared independence on July 9 of last year , but Sudan pulled out of negotiations last month as border clashes brought the countries to the brink of war .

A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted this month threatened sanctions if the countries refused to cease hostilities and return to talks .

South Sudan complied with the Security Council 's demand that it withdraw forces from the contested , oil-rich area of Heglig , as well as police it had stationed in Abyei . The resolution also required Sudan to withdraw its forces from Abyei .

The United Nations and the African Union have made repeated requests that Sudan withdraw troops after it invaded Abyei a year ago . More than 100,000 people remain displaced , according to the World Food Program , which is supporting the displaced community in the South Sudanese town of Agok .

Under a 2005 peace agreement that ended Sudan 's two-decade civil war , Abyei residents were to take part in a referendum on whether to join the South or remain a special administrative region within Sudan . The vote was to take place in January 2011 , at the same time as the referendum that led to South Sudan 's secession . But disputes over who was eligible to vote prevented the referendum from going forward in Abyei .

In a 2009 ruling , the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague placed Abyei 's boundaries around the traditional homeland of the Ngok Dinka tribe . Those borders excluded most of the oil fields in the area as well as the members of the Misseriya tribe , who often receive support from Khartoum , Sudan 's capital . The nomads spend part of the year grazing their cattle in Abyei and said they should also be able to vote .

The U.N. Security Council and the African Union have given Sudan and South Sudan three months to resolve post-secession issues , including the fate of Abyei . Other points of contention are citizenship for people from both countries who now find themselves living in either country , border demarcation and oil revenue sharing .

With independence , South Sudan acquired three-quarters of the formerly united country 's oil reserves . But the new nation depends on pipelines and processing facilities that remain in Sudan .

Negotiators have failed to agree on how much the landlocked South should pay to use those facilities . South Sudan halted oil production in late January after accusing Sudan of stealing $ 815 million worth of its crude . Sudan said it had confiscated the oil to make up for unpaid fees .
