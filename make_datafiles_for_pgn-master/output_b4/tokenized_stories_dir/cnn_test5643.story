Last night , a video emerged of the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff , at the hands of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 's ISIS , the extreme jihadist group that has illegitimately declared the establishment of a militant `` caliphate '' in Syria and Iraq .

This latest execution video follows that of a similar crime committed against another U.S. journalist , James Foley , a fortnight ago . Like the first `` Message to America , '' this latest video ended with the executioner threatening to behead another captive non-combatant , this time a Briton .

First and foremost , it is imperative that we do not allow the traction that these videos have gained in the West to eclipse ISIS 's other inhumane actions .

In years gone by , ISIS -- which refers to itself as the Islamic State -- and its forebears have consistently and persistently committed the most atrocious of war crimes against communities in the Middle East .

In the last month alone , it has been held responsible for attempting a genocide against the Yazidi minority sect , as well as the extermination of the Turkmen Shia Muslims of Amerli .

These come on top of the wholesale massacre it committed against the Sunni peoples of the Shu'aytat tribe in East Syria in August , as well as countless other summary executions of people it deems to be its enemies .

We must not be fooled into thinking that ISIS only beheads its Western captives ; last week , a Kurdish man - unarmed , of course - was executed in front of a mosque in Mosul in a video entitled `` A message written in blood . '' But because it was directed at the president of Iraqi Kurdistan , this particular piece of propaganda did not receive widespread coverage in the international media .

A cursory glance at ISIS propaganda suggests that the West is its primary target . While this may be the case in terms of the group 's long-term ambitions , events on the ground in Syria and Iraq paint a very different picture , with ISIS predominantly killing those it deems to be `` apostate '' , including its co-religionists .

In light of events in Syria and Iraq , the international community must react robustly and swiftly . This week 's NATO summit is fortuitously timed , and one would hope that the ISIS crisis takes its place at the top of the meeting 's agenda .

However , as I 've said before , a strategy of solely Western intervention would play right into the ISIS ideology . Indeed , it would be exactly what the group wants . As such , it is paramount that other states -- particularly those within the region -- step up to the plate as well . Countries such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia must actively respond instead of leaving it to others .

It is not just the international community that has a responsibility , though : the media must act as well . It is paramount that it carefully considers its treatment of ISIS propaganda , with its twin aims of intimidation and recruitment .

Every time a still or clip from an ISIS video is shown , the group gets what it wants : the oxygen of publicity . Of course , it is necessary that people the world over are aware of the atrocities occurring at the hands of ISIS , but journalists must be careful not to do the jihadists ' job for them .

This also involves establishing a firm no-platform policy for al-Baghadi 's stooges in the West . These insidious individuals thrive on media attention , which they use to amplify their otherwise ostracized voices .

As Quilliam 's last report , which looked at extremist content online , showed , it is an unfortunate truth that online censorship does not work .

Any attempts at censorship in the aftermath of the Foley killing were always doomed to failure . Simply put , corporations and governments are unable to remove propaganda from the internet at the rate that it is uploaded . More effective than government-led censorship was the `` ISIS media blackout , '' in which users across the internet resolutely refused to publicize ISIS material . After all , videos like these have minimal propaganda value if they have no audience .

At the same time , instead of publicizing what ISIS wants , we must popularize what it does n't .

The anti-ISIS fatwa recently released by prominent Sunni British imams would be a good place to start , because it dismantles any sense of legitimacy for the self-proclaimed `` caliphate '' and directly calls for Muslim communities to take an active stance in opposing this appalling group .

More initiatives like this must emerge . That they have not materialized already is testament an untenable situation in which the vast majority of Muslims , who are invariably moderate , are largely silent , something which leaves extremists to dominate the discourse on Islam .

The time has passed when we can allow ISIS to popularize itself unchallenged . Challenging ISIS propaganda must be at the forefront of international policy towards Syria and Iraq . And it is not just something for governments to deal with . People all over the world , Muslim and non-Muslim alike , are responsible too .
