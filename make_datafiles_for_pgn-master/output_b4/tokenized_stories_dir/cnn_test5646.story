-LRB- RollingStone.com -RRB- -- Paul Reubens is dusting off his red bow-tie once more for a film revival of his iconic character Pee-wee Herman .

The comedian confirmed the Judd Apatow-produced film was moving forward during an appearance on `` The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon '' on Wednesday , but was n't able to divulge too many details just yet .

`` There is going to be one , '' Reubens said . `` And I was hoping I could make this huge announcement tonight , but it 's a week away , I think , from being announced . ''

Reubens , however , did say that production on the film would begin next February and that a director had been hired as well , though he would n't say who .

`` Steven Spielberg ? '' Fallon cracked . `` Steven Spielberg ! '' Reubens gamely responded , before shaking his head no and adding : `` It 's called P.T. ''

As Reubens noted , news of a new Pee-wee Herman movie , and of Apatow 's involvement , has been bouncing around for the better part of three years now . The script was written by Reubens and comedian Paul Rust â € '' whose writing credits also include `` Arrested Development '' and `` Comedy Bang ! Bang ! '' â € '' though what kind of adventure the titular hero will embark on remains unknown .

The Pee-wee persona originally developed in the 1970s , evolving from Reubens ' early improv work with Los Angeles troupe the Groundlings . After missing the final cut for the 1980 cast of `` Saturday Night Live , '' Reubens adapted the eccentric character for the stage with `` The Pee-wee Herman Show , '' which gained national exposure after being filmed and released by HBO as a 1981 special .

Of course , Pee-wee became a major star once he hit the big screen with 1985 's Tim Burton-directed `` Pee-wee 's Big Adventure . '' The success of that bizarre comedy helped Reubens launch a TV series , the eventual cult-classic `` Pee-wee 's Playhouse , '' in 1986 . A film sequel , `` Big Top Pee-wee , '' was released in 1988 , though was a critical disaster and relative commercial flop .

As a sign of his character 's '80s legacy , Pee-wee -LRB- not Reubens -RRB- was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .

In 1991 , Reubens was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult theater in Sarasota , Florida . With Pee-wee then the punchline of dirty schoolyard jokes , Reubens retired the character for most of the decade .

In 2007 , the actor appeared in character at Spike TV 's Guy 's Choice Awards , marking Pee-wee 's first public appearance since 1992 ; then in 2011 , Reubens appeared as Pee-wee in a `` Saturday Night Live '' segment opposite cast member Andy Samberg .
