When Emperor Qin Shi Huang , the first emperor of China , anticipated his death more than 2,000 years ago , he wanted an army of warriors to guard his mausoleum forever and protect him in the afterlife .

So he ordered the creation of some 8,000 terra-cotta soldiers , along with hundreds of terra-cotta horses and chariots , to be buried with him in his tomb . Historians speculate the soldiers were modeled after eight individuals . When the statues were discovered by workers digging a well in Xi'an , Shaanxi Province , in 1974 , the world was stunned by the spectacular funerary art and the legacy of the powerful emperor . Since then , it 's become a major tourist attraction and a World Heritage site .

Now , these soldiers have a counterpart : female terra-cotta warriors .

Prune Nourry , a Paris-born artist based in New York City , has created a small army of them . In `` Terracotta Daughters , '' 116 are featured in an exhibition at the China Institute from September 10 through October 4 . The show 's U.S. premiere is presented by the French Institute Alliance Francaise and China Institute as part of FIAF 's Crossing the Line festival .

The difference is these female terra-cotta warriors are not out to protect any emperor , but were created to bring attention to the plight of girls in China .

`` In China , there is a huge imbalance between boys and girls . I wanted to highlight the issue of gender preference , '' said Nourry . `` I needed a strong cultural symbol to base this project on , and a universal one that would speak both to Chinese villagers in the countryside and to citizens abroad . ''

And , in a striking parallel to the terra-cotta soldiers , the terra-cotta girls will also become an archaeological project . After the exhibition , they will be buried in China until 2030 , the year that , according to Chinese sociologists , men will have the hardest time finding a wife because of the skewed gender ratio .

The imbalance of the sexes is a serious problem for the Chinese . A 2010 census indicates there are at least 34 million more men than women . Due to the one-child policy and traditional preference for boys , as well as sex-selective technologies , China will have a huge surplus of men , which presents daunting demographic challenges for the world 's most populous country .

Perhaps for those reasons , Nourry did n't encounter difficulties with the Chinese government in pursuing this project in China . She started working on the terra-cotta statues two years ago after finishing an installation in India that also explored gender bias .

In deciding on the size of the female army , Nourry chose the number eight because of its auspiciousness in Chinese culture . She created the first eight statues modeled after eight girls whom she met through an orphan charity in China .

Then , working with local craftsmen in Xi'an , 108 permutations of statues were made based Nourry 's original eight statues by combining the different heads , torsos and legs . `` For Xian Feng , the main craftsman I worked with in China , my project seemed at first impossible since women ` ca n't be soldiers . ' But after we began the project , he changed his view and even turned one of the 108 combinations into a portrait of his own daughter , '' said Nourry .

The local craftsmen of Xi'an are used to making copies of the terra-cotta warriors which are sold primarily to tourists . When Nourry asked them to give their artistic interpretation in sculpting the female statues , they were initially tentative . Over time , they lost their hesitancy and gave each statue unique faces . No two statues have the same features .

Each terra-cotta warrior girl stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs about 260 pounds . Their hairstyles are contemporary , as are their uniform , which is modeled after the orphan girls ' school attire . Unlike the male warriors , they look approachable , friendly and even charming .

`` It was a very enriching collaboration , based on exchange and mutual respect , '' said Nourry .

Her favorite moment was when the eight girls saw the terra-cotta statues of themselves and were delighted . Part of the proceeds from the sale of the eight original statues will pay for the cost of the eight girls ' education for three years .

`` Terracotta Daughters '' is impressive in its artistic craftsmanship and social statement . It 's a refreshing reinterpretation of one of China 's national symbols . With these modern female warriors , Prune raises the pressing issue of gender discrimination without pointing fingers at anyone or anything . One looks at these amazing terra-cotta statues and feel compelled to ask -- why are n't there more of them ? And why are n't there more girls in China ?
