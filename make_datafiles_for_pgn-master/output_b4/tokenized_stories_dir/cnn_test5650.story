Let 's face it -- it does n't take much to convince us to do ridiculous things , document them and share them on the Internet .

Make it for a good cause , and you get a viral sensation that starts with a single person and rides the wave of social media all the way to Hollywood , the White House and sports stadiums around the world .

The Ice Bucket Challenge is a social media campaign that aims to raise awareness and money to fight Lou Gehrig 's disease , also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or ALS .

And it 's simple , in the same way that laying stiff as a board in weird places or dancing the `` Harlem Shake '' is simple . Dump a bucket of ice-cold water over your head , then challenge a friend , or friends , to either do the same or donate money to the The ALS Association . Make a video of the whole thing and post it to your social media accounts .

Voila ! You 've completed the #IceBucketChallenge .

And while most viral Web trends tend to crop up , then disappear without accomplishing much other than providing a few chuckles , the Ice Bucket Challenge is making a difference .

The ALS Association reports that it , and its 38 chapters , received $ 4 million in donations in just two weeks . Last year during that same time period , July 29-August 12 , the association brought in $ 1.1 million .

`` We have never seen anything like this in the history of the disease , '' said Barbara Newhouse , president and CEO of The ALS Association , in a news release . `` We could n't be more thrilled with the level of compassion , generosity and sense of humor that people are exhibiting as they take part in this impactful viral initiative . ''

It all started with Pete Frates , a former baseball player at Boston College who has been living with ALS since 2012 . He floated the idea and his former teammates , as well as other Boston-area athletes , took him up on it . It was noticed and covered by local media and that attention , along with the social Web 's viral nature , launched it onto a much larger stage .

Athletes , celebrities and politicians , as well as everyday folks , have gotten in on the act .

For example , Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan , himself a Boston College alum , took the challenge last week , then challenged his wide receiver corps -- Roddy White , Julio Jones and Harry Douglas -- to do the same . So far , Douglas and White have taken him up on it , with Douglas passing the challenge along to Cleveland Cavaliers star Lebron James and White challenging fellow NFL players Champ Bailey , Larry Fitzgerald and Eric Weems .

-LRB- Of course for the Falcons , who are currently being profiled on HBO 's documentary series `` Hard Knocks , '' a bucket of ice water might not have seemed so bad during training camp in the Georgia heat -RRB- .

And leave it to a hockey player to try to show he 's tougher than everybody else .

NHL player Paul Bissonnette , most recently of the Phoenix Coyotes , posted a YouTube video of himself in his underwear , having frigid glacier water dumped on him by a helicopter . He , too , called out James , as well as NFL quarterbacks Aaron Murray and Russell Wilson .

Jimmy Fallon , Martha Stewart , and Justin Timberlake are among the celebrities who have gotten wet for the cause . Even broadcasting legend and former CNN host Larry King joined in -- well , kind of . King made one of his producers take the icy plunge .

In the world of politics , the Boston area 's most famous family , the Kennedys , joined in a big way . More than 20 members dumped buckets of ice water on their heads then challenged `` Grandma Ethel '' -- the 86-year-old family matriarch and widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- who did so after challenging President Obama himself .

Obama declined the opportunity to dump ice water on himself on camera . But he 'll be making a donation to the cause .

`` The President appreciates Mrs. Kennedy thinking of him for the challenge -- though his contribution to this effort will be monetary , '' Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz said Tuesday .

Of course , many of the folks who take the challenge also donate , which accounts in part for the big numbers for the ALS Association . But the very act of making the cause viral has been hugely important , too .

`` While the monetary donations are absolutely incredible , '' said Newhouse , `` the visibility that this disease is getting as a result of the challenge is truly invaluable . People who have never before heard of ALS are now engaged in the fight to find treatments and a cure for ALS . ''

Currently , there is only one FDA-approved drug for ALS and that one only extends survival by several months , according to the ALSA .

People with the disease lose control of muscle movement , eventually losing their ability to eat , speak , walk and , ultimately , breathe .
