-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eden Foods has become the new front line in the contest over religion , health care and the workplace .

Eden Foods is a closely held , for-profit corporation that objects to covering contraception on religious grounds . It lost its lawsuit last October , but the ruling was stayed pending the Supreme Court 's decision on Hobby Lobby . Now , Eden Foods has a clear legal pathway to deny contraception coverage to its employees .

Eden Foods , however , is in a very different business than Hobby Lobby . It sells organic products , a market that relies on educated , well-informed , urban consumers , a demographic that trends liberal . In response to the renewed attention on the Eden Foods case , defenders of the company , people who want to buy their products with a clean conscience , and the organic food stores who want to stay out of the crossfire , are all arguing that this is just a political dispute .

They 're wrong . This is not just another argument between the right and the left . Instead , the situation raises complicated and competing ethical claims on which we do have to take a position . That 's not just my perspective ; it 's what Eden Foods implies as well .

Michael Potter , the chairman and sole shareholder of Eden Foods , is an interesting fellow . He considers contraceptives to be `` lifestyle drugs , '' links birth-control pills to Jack Daniels , and calls President Barack Obama a dictator . He is a Catholic , but rather than focusing on a religious principle , he said the government should n't be able to make him provide birth control , although his lawyer has since clarified the matter .

In response to a flood of customer complaints , the company released a statement :

`` Eden Foods is a principled food company . We were convinced that actions of the federal government were illegal , and so filed a formal objection . The recent Supreme Court decision confirms , at least in part , that we were correct . We realized in making our objection that it would give rise to grotesque mischaracterizations and fallacious arguments . We did not fully anticipate the degree of maliciousness and corruption that would visit us . Nevertheless , we believe we did what we should have . ''

Look at that language . `` Grotesque . '' `` Fallacious . '' `` Corruption . '' Eden Foods casts itself as the righteous victim , unjustly accused , a rhetorical move particularly popular among the American Christian right wing . Even when the U.S. Supreme Court has handed them a victory , they portray themselves as victimized , although they did not respond , beyond their prepared statement , to a request I made for examples for mischaracterizations , untrue arguments , or corruption . In the meantime , some consumers are demanding their stores stop carrying Eden Foods , a complicated matter given the company 's solid niche in the market . Organic food stores have tried to resolve their dilemma by dodging the question .

Whole Foods , for example , responded to a Change.org petition on Eden Foods with a statement , saying , `` Our primary consideration is whether the product 's ingredients meet our Quality Standards . '' No one is questioning the quality , so Whole Foods will continue stocking the products . The Wedge , a major food co-op in Minneapolis , takes a slightly different path . They write , `` While we are disappointed by Eden Foods ' stand on this issue , The Wedge has a long-standing tradition of not engaging in boycotts that are called for political reasons . ''

That word `` political '' rings out . Businesses are probably wise to stay out of politics much of the time , but they do stop buying products for ethical reasons . For example , when news broke about slave labor in the Asian shrimp industry , companies such as Costco and Wal-Mart acted to use their purchasing power to force change . For them , the ethics of slave labor , obviously , mandated action .

I am not saying that the Eden Foods case is analogous to slave labor , but only that is reasonable to demand your grocery store respond to ethical complaints . Moreover , I base my conclusion that the issue at hand is ethical , and not political , on the statements coming from Eden Foods itself . The company is n't demanding an exemption because of politics , or because it supports one party over another , or even to save money .

Instead , Eden officials claim that their position emerges out of their principles , their religious convictions , and that they are just trying to do the right thing . If we respect their claim , then we also have to respect the counter-argument . Access to birth control and the protection of women 's rights likewise emerge from core principles . We are weighing competing ethical stances .

There 's a bigger context of competing claims here . Some religious people argue that their beliefs are under attack . Many women , and those concerned with gender equality , argue that the birth-control issue is just a first step toward broader conservative attempt to police female sexuality . In the meantime , five conservative Catholic men on the Supreme Court have made a ruling .

Companies engaging in discriminatory practices and those who patronize them may be legally entitled to religious exemptions , but they are not exempt from the consequences of their actions . Consumers , especially in the organic food market , often choose what to buy based on ethical principles . The stores they patronize should , too .
