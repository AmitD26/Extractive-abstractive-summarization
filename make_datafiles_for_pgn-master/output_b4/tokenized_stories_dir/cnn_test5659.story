What a week it 's been for Mariam Yehya Ibrahim , the Sudanese Christian woman who initially faced a death sentence after refusing to renounce her faith .

She thought she was finally free Monday after a higher court ordered her release . A day later , she was back in police custody .

Now she faces a new charge , accused of falsifying travel documents , and has taken refuge in a safe house in Sudan 's capital , Khartoum , amid concerns for her security .

In a phone interview with CNN , Ibrahim spoke of the ordeal of giving birth while in prison , her fears for her family and how she is facing a future full of unknowns .

Asked how she felt in prison , refused access to a hospital as the birth of her child neared , Ibrahim said , `` I was only thinking about my children and how I was going to give birth . I was mostly scared of giving birth in prison . ''

The 27-year-old had reason to be alarmed .

`` I gave birth chained . Not cuffs but chains on my legs . I could n't open my legs so the women had to lift me off the table . I was n't attached to the table , '' she said .

Doctors fear that the circumstances of the baby 's birth may have lasting consequences .

`` I do n't know in the future whether she 'll need support to walk or not , '' said Ibrahim .

She her husband , American Daniel Wani , were freed from custody Thursday after having been detained two days earlier upon arriving at the airport in Khartoum . They were trying to fly with their baby and toddler son to the United States .

Now they are waiting to see what happens in light of the latest allegations against Ibrahim , of traveling with falsified documents and giving false information .

`` I 'm currently in a safe place . It 's definitely safe but not comfortable , '' Ibrahim said .

Persecuted as a ` nonbeliever '

Ibrahim 's ordeal started when one of her relatives , a Muslim , filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married Wani , a Christian , after she was missing for several years .

A Sudanese court considered Ibrahim a Muslim because her father was Muslim . She was charged with adultery , because a Muslim woman 's marriage to a Christian man is illegal in Sudan . She was also charged with apostasy , accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith .

Convicted while about eight months pregnant , she gave birth about two weeks later in a women 's hospital in Khartoum .

She insists she has never been a Muslim -- and says she was persecuted as a Christian while in prison .

`` I 've always been Christian . I could n't have been Muslim with the things they say and the way they treat me -- with a different sheikh coming to speak to me every other time and women in prison saying all sorts of things , like ` do n't eat the nonbeliever 's food ' and calling me a Christian , '' she said . `` There was all this talk and even the officers in the prison would join -LRB- in -RRB- . ''

A string of people , from politicians to humanitarian workers to lawmakers , came to visit while she was locked up with promises to help , she said , but none offered any real assistance . Eventually , following weeks of international controversy over her conviction for apostasy and adultery , it was overturned .

Ibrahim : My paperwork was ' 100 % correct '

Now , the Sudanese authorities have accused Ibrahim of trying to leave without the correct paperwork . Sudan 's National Intelligence and Security Services said that she had South Sudanese travel documents despite not being a citizen of South Sudan , and she was heading to the United States , which is not her native country .

But she is adamant that she `` never forged any papers '' and was entitled to travel on the documents she had .

`` How can my paperwork be wrong ? My paperwork came from the embassy . It 's 100 % correct and it was approved by the South Sudan ambassador and the American ambassador , '' she said .

`` The South Sudanese embassy took responsibility and released the papers . It 's in my right to use the papers and have a South Sudanese passport because my husband is a South Sudanese citizen . He has an American passport and South Sudanese passport . ''

Ibrahim had also been given a U.S. visa .

She described as `` terrorizing '' the way that Sudanese police officers took her and her husband , who uses a wheelchair , from the VIP departures hall as they waited to check in for their flight .

`` We were scared and wondering what was wrong . They locked us in that room for four to five hours and the whole time we were trying to figure out what the problem was , '' she said .

She claims that the charges were filed in court before the police even investigated the claims against her and her husband . When they finally figured out what the alleged offense was , she was shocked , Ibrahim said .

`` I ca n't even decide what I should do right now . I want to travel but at the same time I do n't want to travel . But the state I 'm in right now means that I 'm forced to . There 's a new problem every day about me leaving . ''

Asked if the authorities were trying to make life difficult for her , Ibrahim replied , `` I do n't know what their problem is . ''

Faith in her husband

Ibrahim simply hopes that she can leave , together with her husband and their children .

`` That 's exactly what I want . Not anything more , '' she said .

But despite her experiences so far , she insists that she is not scared . She will put her faith in her husband , Ibrahim said , and count on him to protect the family .

`` If anything happens to us , he 's responsible for us in the face of everyone else . This is protection and better for us . I 'll go wherever he takes us , it 's not a problem . ''
