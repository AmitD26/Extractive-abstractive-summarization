Seoul , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South Korea will `` firmly '' respond to future provocations from North Korea , South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said Monday , declaring that his nation `` can not remain patient '' in the face of continued hostility from Pyongyang .

`` Fellow citizens , at this point , actions are more important than words , '' Lee said in a televised address Monday morning . `` Please have trust in the government and the military and support us . ''

The divided peninsula -- tense at the best of times -- has been near the boiling point since Tuesday , when four people died in a North Korean artillery barrage that targeted the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong . Lee called that attack an `` inhuman crime '' that followed decades of previous attacks from North Korea , including the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March .

`` It is difficult at this point to expect North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons or military adventurism , '' he said . `` We are now clearly aware that we can not stay patient and be generous . That will only give rise to bigger provocations . ''

Lee 's address came a day after South Korean and U.S. forces started joint military exercises Sunday , prompting a furious response from North Korea . The aircraft carrier USS George Washington is set to join South Korea 's forces near the coasts of China and North Korea for the four-day drill , which the North called `` no more than an attempt to find a pretext for aggression and ignite a war at any cost , '' according to the official Korean Central News Agency .

China , North Korea 's closest ally , called Sunday for an emergency meeting of the six major powers involved in talks about the Korean peninsula . Top diplomats from the six nations -- which also include Japan , the United States and Russia -- need to meet soon to `` maintain peace and stability on the peninsula and ease the tension '' in the region , Beijing 's special representative for the region , Wu Dawei , said Sunday .

A top Chinese envoy met with Lee on Sunday , and a high-ranking North Korean official will visit Beijing this week , China 's Xinhua news agency said . South Korea said Sunday it did not think the time was right for a resumption of the six-party talks , but said it would `` bear in mind '' the Chinese proposal .

In Washington , meanwhile , a State Department spokesperson told CNN that it is consulting with its allies , but resumed six-party talks `` can not substitute for action by North Korea to comply with its obligations . ''

`` Clear steps by North Korea are needed to demonstrate a change of behavior , '' said the spokesperson , who was not authorized to speak for attribution .

And U.S. Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , said on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' Sunday that the flare-up exposed the failure of `` continued appeasment '' of North Korea by Republican and Democratic administrations . He said the United States has given North Korea more than $ 1 billion in aid over the past 15 years with the goal of getting them to the negotiating table .

`` It seems the purpose of everything is to get the North Koreans to the table , '' said McCain , the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee . `` The North Koreans ' only claim to their position on the world stage is their nuclear capability . And they have a terrible , most repressive , oppressive regime in the world . They have hundreds of thousands of people in slave labor camps . And all of that seems to be sacrificed in the altar of , quote , ` negotiations . ' ''

In his Monday speech , South Korea 's Lee said efforts to resolve the international standoff through negotiations and humanitarian assistance to the North were met with `` nuclear development and the sinking of the Cheonan . ''

He said the attack on Yeonpyeong Island would have been unlawful even in wartime , adding , `` I can not but be angered at their cruelty . ''

North Korea said the South provoked the attack because shells from a South Korean millitary drill landed in the North 's waters . And it has consistently denied responsibility for the sinking of the Cheonan , which killed 46 South Korean sailors .

A group of 124 people left Yeonpyeong Island by boat Sunday . The South Korean defense ministry is urging journalists to leave the island voluntarily because of the instability , the Foreign Correspondents ' Club of Seoul said Sunday .

The North called reports of civilian casualties part of South Korea 's `` propaganda campaign '' and accused the `` enemy '' of creating `` a human shield by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation . ''

The violence has sparked anger and political turmoil in South Korea . The country 's defense minister , Kim Tae-young resigned after the exchange of fire , and veterans of the South Korean military protested Saturday on the streets of Seoul , stating they were angry that their country 's government had not done enough to respond to the North 's shelling .

The tense maritime border between the two Koreas has become the major military flashpoint on the Korean peninsula in recent years .

The Yeonpyeong attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953 , when an armistice ended fighting . North and South Korea are still technically at war .
