-LRB- CNN -RRB- What is Africa 's most prosperous country ?

According to new research from the Legatum Institute , which last week ranked prosperity in 38 African countries around criteria ranging from economics to education to health , the title belongs to Botswana , the diamond-rich country in southern Africa .

As well as posting a relatively high per capita Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB- of $ 15,176 , Botswana also fared well in terms of governance , education and personal freedom . As the country spends 8 % of its GDP on education , it is among the biggest proportional spenders in the world according to the World Bank . This is the third year in a row that Botswana has topped the index .

In contrast , the Central African Republic was the lowest ranked country on the continent . The country , which has a per capita GDP of $ 584 , has seen increasing violence since the end of 2012 , and only 21.5 % of the population have access to sanitation according to the prosperity index .

Biggest gainers

Rwanda was the best improver , gaining five ranking places to end up as the eighth most prosperous country in Africa . The country was found to have the sixth highest ranking in regulation and government effectiveness , the eighth highest score in rule of law and the lowest perceptions of corruption in Africa .

`` Rwanda deserves credit for actively encouraging women to play a central role in shaping the future of their country . And it seems to be paying dividends , '' says the report .

These findings bucked trends across the continent , where 41 % of women are out of work , as opposed to 23 % of men .

`` We can not talk about the prosperity of women in Africa if we do n't change the inappropriate policies that hinder their progress , '' argues Marieme Jamme , a Davos Young Global leader and CEO of SpotOne Global Solutions . `` We can not sugar coat the issues of funding , mentoring , gender equality , recognition and representation and expect women to come winners within the current framework and plans we have in Africa . ''

Other notable gainers since 2012 included countries from East Africa -- while neither Kenya nor Mozambique featured in the top 10 most prosperous countries in Africa , they both rose by four places in the rankings since 2012 .

As over 44 % of Kenyans thought it was a good time to find employment , the country ranked ninth in terms of entrepreneurship and opportunity . But following the 2013 siege in Nairobi 's Westgate Mall , the country ranked 32 of 38 in terms of safety and security .

Falling down the ranks

Regional partner Tanzania , by contrast , fell eight places since 2012 going from 11th to 19th in the latest rankings . A drop in five-year average growth and an increase in inflation were coupled with a decline in confidence in financial institutions and falling satisfaction with living standards .

The country fared particularly badly in terms of personal freedom , where it fell from 24th to 28th .

While Tanzania 's education score rose by one place in the rankings , the report argues that Tanzania needs to improve the quality of education in schools rather than focusing on enrollment rates . `` Tanzanian education is not producing graduates with the skills needed to work in the formal sector , '' the report says . `` The lack of an adequately skilled workforce is a hindrance to investment in sectors such as manufacturing , construction , mining , agriculture , finance , and communications ... Tanzania needs education that improves students ' chances of finding employment . ''

The biggest faller was Malawi , which dropped 11 places since 2012 to 20th in the index . The report cites a drop in the five-year GDP growth rate as part of the reason the country fell by 18 places in the Economy sub-index .

In all , average prosperity in Africa has been on the up since 2012 . In the past two years all countries have seen increases in at least one area tracked by the report .

But Nathan Gamester , program director of the Prosperity Index , added a cautious note to the findings : `` As African economies grow , a chief concern for many governments is how to ensure that the fruits of growth benefit a majority of the population and contribute to true long term prosperity .
