The main character in Nick Harkaway 's new novel , `` Tigerman , '' is a British solider who becomes a self-made superhero .

But all Sgt. Lester Ferris really wants to be is `` Dad . ''

`` Tigerman '' is about geopolitics , environmental disaster and the 24-hour news culture . But , at its core , Harkaways says `` Tigerman '' is a story about fatherhood and the `` power of paternal and filial love . ''

It 's not your typical father-son story , says Harkaway , a married father of two and the son of legendary spy novelist John le Carré . But , `` something about the nature of guns and the similarities between being an NCO -LRB- noncommissioned officer -RRB- and a parent , '' combined with revelations in the British press in 2010 about rendition , led Harkaway to start writing .

The book deals with darker themes of justice and vengeance , similar to another hero with father issues , `` Batman . '' Despite the comic book overtones and its location on a fictional island scheduled by NATO for demolition , Harkaway says he tried to keep the story grounded in reality .

In other words , no laws of physics are broken , he says . `` It 's the most real , in a way , of the books I 've written . ''

After years of dodging enemy fire in Afghanistan and Iraq , the main character Ferris is sent to the fictional island of Mancreu , a `` spit of land '' in the Arabian Sea , to serve as the last representative of Her Majesty 's government .

On Mancreu , Ferris meets a nameless , streetwise boy raised on comic books , action movies and video games . His self-taught English is a mish-mash of `` leetspeak '' -- the language of the elite -- riddled with pop-culture references and Internet slang .

Most importantly , the boy may be an orphan . Ferris is also a man without a family . When he and the boy bond over their mutual love of comic books and afternoon tea , Ferris starts to imagine life as a father . Ferris ' hopes bloom into a plan to adopt the boy -LRB- if he 's willing -RRB- and forge a future together .

But the sergeant and the boy face a deadline for their would-be family . After years of ecological abuse , Mancreu has become an environmental disaster . NATO has earmarked the island for destruction . Residents who can afford it are `` Leaving '' with a capital `` L. '' Others are hanging on and facing eventual evacuation .

With an end date looming , anarchy and lawlessness spread across the island , think Casablanca , only with `` discharge clouds '' of toxic pollution .

When a group of gun-toting thugs kills a mutual friend , the boy inspires Ferris to become `` Tigerman , '' part vigilante , part myth and `` full of win , '' as the boy says .

The sergeant dons a homemade mask , body armor and utility belt to battle bad guys and hopefully convince the boy to become his son when the dust settles .

Comic book fans will recognize elements of the Caped Crusader , with Ferris playfully referring to the boy as `` Robin '' in the book .

Harkaway names `` Dark Knight '' and `` Sandman '' among his childhood favorites . But `` Tigerman '' is n't so much his version of `` Batman '' as it is his take `` on me , or any of us , shoved into being a costumed hero , '' he says .

`` Batman is one of a small number of characters who get the title ` superhero ' despite having no actual superpowers . Although I 've heard it said that he has the best superpower of all , that of being ridiculously rich in a world where technology can make you a god . ''

Harkaway is the author of two previous genre-bending and critically-acclaimed novels , `` The Gone-Away World '' and `` Angelmaker . '' Despite his famous lineage , he says he does n't pattern his work after his famous father .

`` We have n't spent a lot of time consciously talking about writing in a master-student kind of way , but we have similar concerns , ethical worries , -LRB- and -RRB- geopolitical perceptions in some areas . I like to think that my thought influences his in some areas , too . ''

For now , Harkaway is already at work on his next novel about `` semiotics , murder , alchemy , sharks , banking , game design and the surveillance state , '' he said .

He 's also making time for fatherhood , something he describes as `` the best , and the most extreme '' adventure .
