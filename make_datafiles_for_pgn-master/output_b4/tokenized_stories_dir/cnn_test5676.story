If Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016 , Bill Clinton will be her closest political adviser and confidant .

So when the former President laid out a detailed Democratic platform after being asked how he would advise a presidential candidate , the connection to Hillary Clinton 's possible presidential run was not far from anyone 's mind , including Bill Clinton 's .

`` Let 's assume that you are advising a presidential candidate , '' Charlie Rose said in an interview that was taped Monday at the Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York . `` That 's a heavy assumption , '' Bill Clinton said with a laugh . `` My advice has sometimes been welcome , sometimes not . Sometimes right and sometimes not . ''

Clinton said that in presidential campaigns , `` the past is relevant insofar as it 's an indication of what might happen in the future , '' but he was clear to say that `` by and large , almost all elections are about the future . ''

Here are , according to Bill Clinton , the forward-looking policies a presidential candidate , and possibly a president , will have to focus on :

Economic growth :

`` Well first on the home front , we need a table plan that has the prospect of restoring more rapid growth that actually generates jobs and raises incomes and gives poor people a chance to work their way from poverty into the middle class . I think that 's really important . The most likely way to do that is flowing investments into areas that we know will create a lot of jobs and that simultaneously will change the job mix . ''

Energy and infrastructure investment :

`` A much more vigorous orientation toward the future , that is making future-related investments like a modern electrical grid . ''

`` I think the most reasonable , easy , low-hanging fruit targets are a revived effort in the energy area and particularly in making all these buildings in America more efficient . And then other kinds of infrastructure . ''

Health care :

`` I think secondly , continuing to work on the health care system is important because the four-year hiatus we 've had in health care inflation , we 've got to keep it going . I do n't care what anybody says ; the federal health care law that expanded Medicaid to working people with low incomes and their kids was a big boon . ''

Education :

`` Then you 've got to do , you 've got to keep working on education and reform the student loan problem and figure out a way to deliver online or in person much more affordable higher education . And we have to erase , totally erase , the difference between technical and academic education . ''

Reforming the corporate tax rate :

`` We should bring the money home . The corporate money that 's been lodged overseas can be brought home ; the corporations have told us how to do it . Whether we like it or not , this inversion , this is their money . And we are going to have to have a more competitive corporate tax system . ''
