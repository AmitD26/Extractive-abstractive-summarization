The scandal over allegations about NSA surveillance overseas , including monitoring of the cell phone conversations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and millions of phone calls in France , is another huge blow to President Barack Obama .

The news has caused a big uproar in Western Europe , with Merkel demanding a response from Washington . It was `` incredible that an allied country like the United States and at this point goes as far as spying on private communications that have no strategic justification , '' said Jean-Marc Ayrault , the Prime Minister of France . `` Trust needs to be rebuilt , '' Merkel said .

While observers warn these complaints are hypocritical and have more to do with domestic politics in Western Europe than true feelings about the United States , this incident is nonetheless much more than a mere blip in the time line of Obama 's presidency . The recent National Security Agency revelation is one more step in a series of revelations about practices that have undercut a central promise that candidate Obama made in 2008 -- to repair America 's standing in the world .

When Obama took office , America 's position in the global community had greatly deteriorated . President George W. Bush 's war in Iraq , and his unilateral approach to foreign policy , had generated tremendous distrust and anger overseas , including among our closest allies .

So , too , had Bush 's apparent disregard for civil liberties and willingness to ignore international standards against the use of torture . The United States was seen as a country that acted solely in its own interest and that cared little for protecting strong and durable multilateral alliances . The United States , in the minds of its critics , also took reckless actions to defend its national security interests without thinking about the consequences .

Obama was determined to correct this . This had been a constant theme of his campaign against presidential opponent Sen. John McCain , more so than almost any domestic issue . In June 2008 , speaking in Germany near the place where the Berlin Wall once stood , Obama said that , `` In Europe , the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in the world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common . ''

He continued to expound on this theme in his first year as president . His stirring speech in Cairo in June 2009 offered inspirational words to many of his supporters , evidence that the president was serious about fixing the damage that had occurred under Bush .

But the promise is unfulfilled . Over the years , it has become clear that Obama left much more of Bush 's foreign policy framework in place than many of his supporters had expected .

He continued with an extremely aggressive campaign against terrorist networks , employing drone strikes to destroy networks even when there have been significant civilian causalities , allowing for tough interrogation techniques and detention policies and depending on secret processes that created little accountability for what the government was doing , other than when leakers revealed classified information . Inconsistent policies toward authoritarian Middle Eastern regimes in countries such as Syria , as well as turbulence in Egypt following the fall of Hosni Mubarak , have greatly dampened the enthusiasm about Obama that had existed after 2008 .

Nor did Obama do much to strengthen civil liberties . The public has begun to learn how extensive the surveillance has been on their phones , on their computers and every other type of communication that occurs . In short , the government has been watching .

To be sure , the success at generally preventing terrorist strikes within the U.S. , barring Boston , is a central accomplishment of his presidency . But the difficulties he has faced achieving the balance he promised in relations with the rest of the world have come with a cost .

The NSA issue began with a debate about the proper domestic balance between civil liberties and counterterrorism and has now has extended into the realm of diplomacy .

Obama needs to make this right . The controversy hurts the ability of the United States to maintain strong relations with the allies whose support is essential to the war on terrorism , as well as in fighting against other global threats . He must provide answers and show that the government is responding to concerns about NSA practices .

One administration official has told the Wall Street Journal that President Obama had been unaware of NSA spying on 35 world leaders and that , as soon as he learned of the practice through an internal review -LRB- a response to the political outrage over the revelations of the spy program -RRB- , he put parts of the program to an end . Even if this is the case -- and the president will need to make clear this is so given how cynical and skeptical the world has become about U.S. political rhetoric on these matters -- the information begs the question of how the NSA was allowed to remain so unaccountable even to the Commander-in-Chief and , more importantly , what steps President Obama will now take to make sure we conduct our counterterrorism programs within some kinds of parameters and guidelines .

If Obama does nothing further , the ongoing revelations will leave behind the same kinds of problems that he , as a candidate , understood to be so devastating in 2008 .
