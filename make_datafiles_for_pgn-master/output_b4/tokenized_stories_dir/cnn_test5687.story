A canoe glides through South Florida 's endless maze of freshwater ways and emerges from a thicket of sawgrass into the saltwater of Florida Bay .

Behind it are alligators , snakes and endangered Florida panthers . Ahead are crocodiles , manatees , wading birds and far beyond -- the Gulf of Mexico .

Everglades National Park was established as a national park in 1947 and consists of nearly 2,400 square miles . Often referred to as a swamp , the Everglades ' biggest water sources , approximately 60 inches of rain per year and overflow from Lake Okeechobee , help make it a southwestwardly flowing river running through the third largest national park in the lower 48 states .

Park stats : Everglades National Park has averaged almost 950,000 visitors since 2008 . In 2012 , it welcomed more than 1 million visitors for the first time since 2007 .

The location : Everglades National Park spans three counties . The park 's main road entrance is in Homestead , which allows easy access to the Royal Palm and Flamingo areas . The Shark Valley entrance is in Miami and the Gulf Coast entrance is in Everglades City .

There also is water access via coastal boundaries and waterways .

If you go : Admission is $ 10 per vehicle and $ 5 for hikers , motorcyclists and cyclists . Passes are valid for seven days . There are four park visitor centers located at the main entrance , Flamingo , Shark Valley and Gulf Coast . The park is open year-round , but be sure to check the website as some entrances close seasonally or at night .

South Florida is generally dry during the winter , which is when the park offers the most access and the widest range of activities .

Meet our ranger : Sabrina Diaz , supervisory park ranger at Everglades National Park , grew up in suburban Montreal , Canada . She always loved being outdoors , but was terrified of wildlife until a visit to Sea World .

`` I wanted to be the girl who gets thrown off Shamu , '' she says .

Diaz studied ecology in college at Vanier College in Quebec and afterwards taught environmental education . A romantic encounter during an internship rehabilitating birds at the Florida Keys Wild Bird Center led her to Everglades and a 2001 seasonal interpretative ranger position .

Diaz enjoyed Everglades so much that she continued to work as a seasonal ranger for seven years , living in places such as Kings Canyon National Park , Yellowstone National Park and Katmai National Park . In the meantime , she married Shane Harrington , the man she met at Florida Keys , on December 6 , 2008 -- the 61st anniversary of the Everglades ' dedication .

`` We had both fallen in love -- not only with each other , but also with the national parks , '' she says . `` We both decided to go at it together . ''

Her first permanent position came in 2009 at Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site south of Asheville , North Carolina . In 2012 , she returned to Everglades . Shane works as a park ranger in nearby Biscayne National Park and the couple now has an 18-month-old daughter , Sierra Harrington .

`` It 's a park that is beautiful in a way that is different from other national parks , '' she says . `` It almost grows on you . There are so many mixtures of tropical and temperate plants and animals . ''

For a day trip , do n't miss : Drive the 36-mile main road from Royal Palm to Flamingo . Diaz says there are several boardwalks along the way that are easily accessible and offer 10 - to 15-minute walks into the wilderness .

`` There are lots of unique habitats that are dependent on the small changes in elevation , '' she says . `` Most people think South Florida is perfectly flat . It could be a foot -LRB- difference -RRB- but that means a different habitat -- tropical , hardwood hammock , cypress domes -- all the way down to the salty waters of Florida Bay . ''

Favorite less-traveled spot : Snake Bight in Florida Bay . Diaz says Snake Bight is a `` bay within a bay '' where thousands of multi-colored wading birds congregate .

`` It is a water park , '' she says . `` The best way to experience it is by boat . ''

Favorite spot to view wildlife : Anhinga Trail . Diaz says the water is lower during the winter , so wildlife congregates in the deeper waters near the trail . It 's a great place to see birds , alligators and fish .

`` It 's really amazing for its biodiversity , '' she says .

Most magical moment in the park : In 2001 , a flock of birds flew over her kayak while she watched the sunset in Flamingo Bay .

`` There was a loud noise from behind me and I could n't turn around , '' she says . `` They came in waves . Dozens of tropical birds flying back to their roosting areas . ''

Funniest moment in the park : Fish jumping out of the water and into canoes as she led a six-boat tour in 2002 .

`` We must have spooked a school of fish , '' she says . `` Dozens of fish began jumping in a frenzy that lasted about eight seconds . It was such a quiet moment and then we were scrambling to flip them back in the water . ''

A ranger 's request : Do n't feed the wildlife , especially alligators and crocodiles . Diaz says crocodiles have a grayish color , V-shaped snout and usually prefer saltwater . Alligators , she says , are blacker in color , have a U-shaped snout and prefer freshwater .

`` If you feed them , they will -LRB- begin to -RRB- assume people mean food , '' she says . `` That can lead to negative interactions in the future . ''

Another park she 'd like to visit : Redwood National Park in California .

`` I have a love affair with giant trees , '' she says . `` I think it would be amazing to be in a forest with trees that are 300 feet tall . ''
