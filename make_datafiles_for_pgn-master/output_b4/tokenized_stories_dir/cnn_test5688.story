Achilles ' heel was his weak spot in the Greek myth , but the heel of a newly discovered primate provides a strong connection between humans and their possible ancestors .

Scientists have discovered the oldest primate skeleton to date , from a creature that resembles humans ' evolutionary line -- the anthropoids -- and a different primate lineage called the tarsiers . They have named this specimen Archicebus achilles , making reference to its heel bone , which resembles those of modern monkeys .

Anthropoids include humans , apes and monkeys . Tarsiers are nocturnal primates that live only in Southeast Asia today . The study is published in the journal Nature .

`` For the first time , it really shines a light on an important phase of primate and human evolution that we just had very little information about before , '' said K. Christopher Beard , paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and senior author of the study .

The specimen 's completeness , age and position in the primate family tree make it special , said Erik Seiffert , associate professor at Stony Brook University , who was not involved in the study .

`` In my opinion , it is one of the most important discoveries in the history of paleoprimatology , '' Seiffert said in an e-mail .

While fragments of other ancient primates have been found in the past , this skeleton -- about 55 million years old -- is by far the most complete example of a primate from this period , Beard said .

Archicebus achilles represents a never-before-seen link between the anthropoids and the tarsiers , Beard said , but he expects the creature 's exact position on the evolutionary tree to be quite controversial .

Some of its features suggest to his group that it is slightly more closely related to tarsiers than to anthropoids , but other scientists may reach different conclusions . Still , he said , it seems to be clearly related to both groups .

`` Archicebus -LRB- achilles -RRB- gives us our first really detailed look at a species that branched off right near the base of the primate family tree -- when anthropoids , tarsiers , and lemurs had just started out on their separate evolutionary pathways , '' Seiffert said .

This creature was tiny -- only 2.8 inches long -- and weighed no more than 1 ounce , making it between the size of a shrew and a mouse .

Scientists find the small size fascinating because until about a decade ago , researchers believed that anthropoids needed to be a lot bigger , Beard said . But there are counterexamples , even today : The pygmy mouse lemur , found in Madagascar , weighs only about an ounce as well .

A creature so tiny must have been `` active and frenetic , '' Beard said . Shrews , for instance , act anxious because they are always looking for their next meal , since they need a lot of food for their high metabolic rate .

Archicebus achilles , being small , probably also had a high metabolism , and likely ate high-calorie foods such as insects and very ripe fruits with lots of sugar content .

`` When you 're that small , you ca n't afford to eat salad , '' Beard said . `` You ca n't ingest enough calories rapidly enough to keep your body going . ''

Unlike modern tarsiers , Archicebus achilles was active during the day . Tarsiers also tend to have eyeballs that are the same volume as their brains , whereas this ancient creature had relatively small eye sockets compared to its face -- an attribute of monkeys .

The creature 's foot made a big impression on Beard because of how much it resembles the feet of modern-day marmosets . Its features are much more like those of a monkey than a tarsier .

On the other hand , other features -- the hip , knee , elbow and pelvis -- more closely resemble a tarsier .

Paleontologists ca n't say that this specific creature is the ancestor of humans and tarsiers , but this is the best approximation so far of something resembling a hypothetical common ancestor , he said .

Archicebus achilles was discovered in an ancient lake in Hubei province , China , at a site called the lower Eocene Yangxi Formation , in the Jingzhou area .

The scientists plan on going back and looking for more , but it 's hard work . They were lucky to have found this creature , Beard said . It must have died near the lake and then its carcass was swept into the lake , perhaps by a stream . The body settled at the bottom , covered up by mud which then hardened .

For researchers digging at this site , ancient fish fossils are far more likely to turn up than primates , `` which is cool -- fossil fish are cool . I like fossil fish , but I 'm not an expert on fossil fish , '' Beard added .

But if you 're looking for ancient mammals at this site , `` you have to have an incredible amount of patience because it 's probably going to be years before you find something that 's really , really exciting . But when you do , you hit the jackpot . ''
