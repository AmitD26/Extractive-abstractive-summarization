If we want to see a live Martian , even a tiny microbial one , we may be billions of years too late .

Two new studies in the journal Science this week suggest that the Martian atmosphere has n't changed much in terms of chemical composition in the past 4 billion years . It 's much thinner than our planet 's atmosphere , and the mix of ingredients is n't friendly to living organisms that are known to us .

On the plus side , scientists are excited that the atmospheric analyses from instruments on board the Mars rover Curiosity square with what has been seen from meteorites that have landed on Earth from Mars .

`` In a sense our measurements confirm that those meteorites are from Mars , '' said Chris Webster , program manager of the Planetary Science Instruments Office at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , who led one of the studies .

The main gas in Mars ' atmosphere is carbon dioxide , at a whopping 96 % , according to the scientists . Earth 's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen , at 78 % .

The Martian atmosphere also has very low oxygen content -- 0.1 % -- especially compared with our own atmosphere , which has 19 % .

More bad news for those who are eager to find life on the Red Planet : The rover has not detected methane so far , Webster said . This colorless gas is released by organisms as they digest nutrients , so it is an indicator of life , although it can also be produced in geological processes .

Because of the harsh environment on Mars , the assumption is that any life that might be there is below the surface , and that it 's microbial .

`` By definition , if we do n't detect methane , it means the probability that that 's happening today is reduced significantly , '' he said .

Still , the hunt for methane will continue as Curiosity , the most technologically advanced rover to explore Mars , continues its journey .

Where did all that atmosphere go ?

Mars formed about 4.5 billion years ago . Scientists believe that , initially , the planet 's atmosphere was 100 times denser than the Earth 's atmosphere , Webster said . Now it 's only about 1 % as thick as Earth 's atmosphere .

So what happened ?

Sometime more than 4 billion years ago , scientists say , much of the atmosphere was stripped away . A leading theory is that the planet was hit hard during the Late Heavy Bombardment , a period in which comets , asteroids and other celestial objects were flying all over the solar system , delivering water to both Earth and Mars .

One possible idea is that Mars was hit by a Pluto-sized planet , Webster said , which knocked out a lot of the atmosphere .

The sun was also younger and more intense in its output of solar wind and certain kinds of high-energy radiation at that time . Without a protective magnetic field , Mars was vulnerable to high-energy particles from the sun , which is thought to have blown out a lot of the atmosphere , Webster said .

`` It was lot of action in the first hundred million years or so , and then it settled down to be the atmosphere that we see today , '' he said .

The Curiosity rover has given scientists better evidence than ever that Mars was once habitable ; NASA announced in March that , based on the chemical analysis of a drilling sample from the rover , life could have existed there in the past . The rover found traces of clay that forms in the presence of water , indicating that water once flowed in Gale Crater , where the rover landed on August 6 , 2012 .

Scientists can not yet say how long that water sloshed around -- was it hundreds of thousands of years ? Millions of years ? Even hundreds of millions ?

`` The heavier the atmosphere would be back then , the easier it would be to maintain stable surface temperatures and for water to persist longer , '' said Paul Mahaffy , Chief of the Atmospheric Experiments Laboratory in the Solar System Exploration Division at NASA Goddard , who led the second Science study .

What we 've done on Mars and what 's next

How isotopes tell the story

In the studies , scientists used instruments in Curiosity 's onboard laboratory to study ratios of isotopes ' key elements , such as the carbon and oxygen in carbon dioxide . Isotopes are different versions of a single chemical element but differ in the number of neutrons , which gives them unique atomic weights .

Isotope ratios indicate a temperature history and other characteristics about the history of a substance , Webster said .

`` If the gases in the atmosphere are the fingers on your hands , then the isotope ratios are the individual fingerprints ; they 're very high-resolution detail about the gas , '' he said .

Scientists found a higher proportion of heavy isotopes of carbon and oxygen in the Martian atmosphere compared with what scientists believe was present in the raw material that went into forming the planet . In other words , there has been a loss of lighter isotopes over time .

That indicates that much of the atmosphere has been lost over time , and that it happened from the top of the atmosphere rather than through interactions with the ground .

`` Evidence in the atmosphere of loss of the lighter species -- in carbon , oxygen , hydrogen , and so on -- kind of all point toward a process where the top of the atmosphere is eroding away into space , '' Mahaffy said .

Webster and Mahaffy each used a different SAM instrument but came up with nearly the same ratios of carbon-12 to carbon-13 , indicating accuracy .

What else to come

Curiosity has a sophisticated suite of instruments on board , but other probes may be able to get a better handle on what 's going on with the planet 's atmosphere .

In November , NASA will launch the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission -LRB- MAVEN -RRB- orbiter , which will try to measure the current rate of loss of the atmosphere , Mahaffy said . With that information , scientists can extrapolate back billions of years and calculate more precisely when it was that the atmosphere was thick and hospitable to life .

There are also plans for a 2020 NASA rover mission . That mission 's science team said in a recent report that it should look for indications that life once existed on the planet , collect samples for potential return to Earth and test technology relevant to human exploration .

As of Wednesday , Curiosity had driven a total of more than a kilometer -LRB- 0.62 miles -RRB- since landing last year . It is currently progressing toward Mount Sharp , which is composed of many layers that represent a record of geological time . By climbing this mountain and sampling layers along the way , the rover will unearth more clues about how the Martian environment evolved in the course of the planet 's history .

The $ 2.5 billion mission has already fulfilled the goal of showing that Mars was once habitable .

The question remains : For whom ?
