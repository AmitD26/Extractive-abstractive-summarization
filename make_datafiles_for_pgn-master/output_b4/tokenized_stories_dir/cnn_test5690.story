-LRB- CNN -RRB- Bess Myerson , the 1945 Miss America winner who became a celebrated media personality and public servant and then was brought down by scandal , has died . She was 90 .

According to a statement from the Miss America Organization , she died in Santa Monica , California , on December 14 . No cause of death was given .

Myerson 's rise to fame was a classic rags-to-riches American success story : a bright Bronx girl from a housing project , the daughter of a house painter , who won the nation 's most famous beauty contest and parlayed her renown into a media career . She became a model and spokesperson and spent many years on the game show `` I 've Got a Secret . ''

The path to celebrity was one followed by such pageant winners as Lee Meriwether , Mary Ann Mobley , Phyllis George and Vanessa Williams .

Later Myerson became part of New York 's city government , serving as both commissioner of consumer affairs and commissioner of cultural affairs .

Myerson was also a role model in the Jewish community . If Jewish baseball players Hank Greenberg and Sandy Koufax were celebrated for their athletic abilities -- a response to jokes about Jews ' lack of athletic skills -- Myerson was celebrated for her role as the first -LRB- and , to this day , only -RRB- Jewish Miss America . She won her pageant title in early September 1945 just after the end of World War II , a time when the horrors of the Holocaust were just being revealed .

`` Her victory was seen by many as a symbolic statement of America 's post-war rejection of the crimes and prejudices that ravaged Europe as well as a representation of the vitality of the American Jewish community , '' noted a biography on the Jewish Women 's Archive site .

Myerson had even been asked to change her name for the pageant -- an idea she refused .

`` It was the most important decision I ever made , '' she recalled . `` It told me who I was , that I was first and foremost a Jew . ''

It was a decision with consequences , as some Miss America sponsors refused to have her represent them .

Nonetheless , the talented and intelligent Myerson -- who played the flute and piano at the pageant and used her Miss America scholarship money to pay for graduate studies at Juilliard and Columbia -- landed on her feet , becoming a popular TV personality in the '50s and '60s .

Members of the Jewish community looked up to her .

`` Bess Myerson was the most important female image in your life , '' said a 1940s teenager quoted in Edward S. Shapiro 's `` We Are Many : Reflections On American Jewish History And Identity . '' `` We did n't just know about her . We felt her . ''

For decades , Myerson was a well-known and beloved figure around New York . During Ed Koch 's 1977 campaign for New York mayor , she was often at his side , giving rise to rumors of a romance with the bachelor politician .

`` Koch would n't have won without Bess , '' Koch 's campaign strategist , David Garth , told New York magazine .

But she fell short of higher office herself , losing a U.S. Senate primary in 1980 . After Koch named her to the city 's Cultural Affairs department in 1983 , she saw her name tarred by the `` Bess Mess , '' a mid - '80s scandal involving a romantic affair with a married contractor and an alleged quid pro quo with the judge in his divorce trial .

Myerson was eventually acquitted , but she was forced to resign her job . Moreover , other revelations about her life came to light , including another affair and a shoplifting charge .

She lived out the remainder of her life quietly , devoting her energy to charitable causes .

Myerson was married three times . Her first marriage , to Navy veteran Allan Wayne , ended in divorce in 1956 . She was married twice to lawyer Arnold Grant before finally divorcing him in 1971 . She is survived by a daughter .
