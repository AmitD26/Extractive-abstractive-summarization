-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Hurricane Katrina walloped New Orleans in late August 2005 , Kate Schneiderman was in New York , 10 states and 1,100 miles away from the storm .

Kate Schneiderman , 24 , is originally from New York , and works in politics in New Orleans .

Fifteen months later , she traded New York 's streets for those submerged during what the Federal Emergency Management Agency called the nation 's worst natural disaster .

`` I literally quit my job , bought a car , packed it up , drove down , '' Schneiderman , 24 , told CNN . She said a college friend who was living in New Orleans persuaded her to quit her Wall Street job in financial communications -- a career that did n't make her happy and did n't fit her political science degree -- and move to New Orleans .

`` It 's the best decision I ever made , '' Schneiderman said .

Now nearly a year into her position as director of communications for New Orleans Councilman-at-Large Arnie Fielkow , the native New Yorker has become a self-described `` grizzled veteran '' of the Big Easy . She speaks affectionately of the city 's people and of its slower pace , although she laughingly notes that she 'll `` never ever '' get used to the city 's soupy summer heat .

She says she 's here for the long haul . `` When I first moved down , I said , ` I 'll give it two years ... it 'll be my little adventure . ' And something sort of funny happened almost immediately , '' she said . `` I felt immediately at home . ''

Schneiderman is one of many young professionals who have arrived in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina ransacked the city , according to experts who study population trends in the area . Armed with college degrees and buoyed with seemingly boundless optimism and energy , these 20 - and 30-year-olds have taken up work in various sectors of the community , ranging from business to politics , or in the several humanitarian programs helping to rebuild the city .

`` From what you can tell in talking to people and looking at organizations ... there does seem to be a significant influx of young , usually very well educated college graduates ... who have come to New Orleans to help , '' said Tim Ryan , the University of New Orleans ' chancellor . `` Many have decided that this is an interesting place to live , and decide , at least for some short period of time , to stay here . ''

While there is speculation on whether the number of young professionals moving here actually constitutes a `` significant influx , '' there is ample anecdotal evidence to show that beleaguered New Orleans is softly luring young people looking for meaningful and purposeful work .

Dubbed New Orleans ' `` brain gain , '' these newcomers all have their own stories , their own path to the city . Some were volunteers who arrived soon after the storm . Others , like Schneiderman , came well after . Some are New Orleans natives , many are not . Regardless of their hometowns , their professions , their reasons for moving , they are bound by a common thread : a pull to this city that so many left behind .

`` In other cities , '' Mike Heid , a 26-year-old copy editor for an advertising firm , said , `` I probably would have just done my job and gone home and been happy with that . Because those other cities ... I do n't think would have needed my help as much as this city . ''

Heid worked in New York for a time before he arrived in New Orleans , he said .

`` Just being down here ... even if it 's just to help business down here , '' Heid said , `` anything that 's down here is helping . ''

After volunteering for a short time with The Idea Village , a nonprofit group that supports entrepreneurs , University of Pennsylvania graduate Miji Park said she did n't want to leave . `` Being involved in that and ... getting to understand the city made me realize that the impact I could make here was so much greater than at a boring real estate economic research firm back home , '' the 23-year-old said . She gave up the well paid `` boring '' job in her hometown of Berkeley , California , for a full-time job with The Idea Village . And she has n't regretted it at all .

`` I believe in the power of place , '' she said . `` I think history incorporates itself not only in the architecture , but also the atmosphere of different cities , and in New Orleans you definitely feel that atmosphere and you can feel the history . And I think that 's what drew me closer to New Orleans . ''

Richard Campanella , a geographer and associate director of the Center for Bioenvironmental Research at Tulane University , says there are probably 2,000 to 3,000 of these newly arrived young professionals in New Orleans . In an e-mail , Campanella said he bases this rough estimate on the 2006 Louisiana Health and Population Survey .

However , amid the city 's current population of 273,000 , this group of newcomers is a `` small segment of the population , '' according to Greg Rigamer , the chief executive officer for GCR & Associates Inc. , a New Orleans research firm . They are by no means replenishing the approximately 40 percent of the city 's pre-Katrina population who have not returned .

`` We are not the ` Mecca ' in the country for these young people , '' Rigamer said .

William Frey , a researcher with the Brookings Institution , which has kept detailed records and analysis of the city 's population since the storm , said his analysis of 2006 census data released this month shows that those in the 25 - to 35-year-old age range were least likely to be present in the city by July of last year .

Still , Rigamer said , `` There are a number of young people coming to help out . '' What makes this group 's arrival notable , he said , is that before the storm , the city had difficulty drawing or keeping the young and educated . `` We are attracting ... young people that we were n't before , '' Rigamer said .

Asked whether Campanella 's estimate of 2,000 to 3,000 is accurate , Rigamer said it likely was . `` It 's really probably in that range , '' he said .

Hanging over these young people , however , is a persistent question . Will they stay ?

`` I do n't think that many of those people have made permanent decisions , '' Ryan said , adding that the answer to that question depends on whether the city is able to fix many of its problems -- among them a weakened infrastructure , a high murder rate and limited career growth opportunities .

`` I think they 're willing to certainly keep an open mind about the future and see how things go over the next couple of years , '' Ryan said .

Rigamer concurred . `` This is the most mobile segment of our community , '' he said . `` So guess what ? They 're going to be mobile . ''

For Harvard Business School graduate John Alford , 32 , who arrived in June 2006 , the rate of progress can be frustrating . Alford is the school leader of the Langston Hughes Academy Charter School . '' -LSB- I 'm -RSB- driving past the same potholes ... since last year , '' he said . `` They 're not being fixed . I know that 's just a pothole , but it 's also a sign of where the city 's at . ''

For Heid and Schneiderman , crime is a concern . `` Crime kind of freaks me out , '' Heid said , adding that he also grows anxious when storms draw near . But both say it is n't enough to push them out of the city .

Likewise , Alford , a Brooklyn , New York , native , says he 's here to stay . `` This is my new home , '' he said . What about the question of whether to rebuild the city ? Irrelevant , he says . `` The question 's already been answered . We are rebuilding it now . '' E-mail to a friend
