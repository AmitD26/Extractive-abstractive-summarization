The search continued Thursday for a gay porn actor suspected of dismembering his acquaintance , posting the video of the incident online and mailing the severed limbs to different locations in Ottawa , including to a political party 's headquarters , according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation .

Authorities are searching for Luka Rocco Magnotta , 29 , who they allege is responsible for a human torso discovered in Montreal , thought to be linked to a human hand and foot that were separately mailed from Montreal to Ottawa .

Magnotta , also known as Eric Clinton Newman , is a Montreal resident who allegedly knew the victim , identified only as a white male , Montreal police spokesman Ian Lafreniere told reporters Wednesday .

The suspect has no criminal background , and his image and information related to him were later recovered from a `` very graphic '' website , Lafreniere said .

The source later confirmed that at least one of the websites examined by authorities was a pornographic site .

It 's possible the body parts all came from the same dismembered victim , Lafreniere said , but police are still awaiting the results of forensic testing for confirmation .

`` The two parts of the body that were found in Ottawa ... we 've got all the reasons to believe that it 's linked to our homicide , '' he added , referring to the human torso found in Montreal .

Authorities said they are asking the public for help in locating Magnotta , after a `` coast-to-coast '' warrant was issued for his arrest . Police say they plan to charge him with murder once he 's apprehended .

Lafreniere said authorities have also found other body parts , potentially from the same attack , which is believed to have been committed in Montreal . It would be the 11th homicide there this year .

`` It was n't a random attack , '' Lafreniere said . `` They knew each other . ''

Lafreniere added that Magnotta had been `` involved in some stuff on the Web , that 's for sure , '' though he would not elaborate .

The human foot was sent to the Conservative Party of Canada headquarters in Ottawa , prompting a hazardous materials team to investigate . The officers who responded noticed what appeared to be bloodstains on the box , police said .

Ottawa police Sgt. Steve Hodgson told reporters outside the office that the package had been addressed to the Conservative Party . Staffers had begun to open the package before calling police , he said .

The hand was intercepted by workers at a Montreal postal terminal .

Ottawa 's major-crimes unit is checking with other police departments for similar cases and looking back through missing-persons files for any clues , according to Constable Marc Soucy , an Ottawa police spokesman .

`` We 're going to look at every avenue , '' he said .

In Montreal , the human torso was found behind an apartment building , authorities said .
