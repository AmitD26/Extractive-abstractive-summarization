The `` world 's most wanted man '' may be holed up in Russia , but Edward Snowden 's story will soon be available -- as they say -- everywhere books are sold .

`` The Snowden Files : The Inside Story Of The World 's Most Wanted Man , '' by reporter Luke Harding , from the British newspaper The Guardian , comes out in the UK this week , with a U.S. release date of February 11 .

The Guardian is a key player in the Snowden saga , having provided an outlet for the former NSA contractor-turned-whistle-blower to expose what he knew about the U.S. government 's mass surveillance programs . Harding accessed a wealth of inside information , such as this story about how Snowden first connected via e-mail with Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald .

Harding writes in the book : `` This mystery correspondent asked Greenwald to install PGP encryption software on his laptop . Once up and running , it guarantees privacy -LRB- the initials stand for Pretty Good Privacy -RRB- for an online chat . Greenwald had no objections . But there were two problems . ` I 'm basically technically illiterate , ' he admits . Greenwald also had a lingering sense that the kind of person who insisted on encryption might turn out to be slightly crazy . ''

Greenwald and Snowden eventually built a mutual trust , and the former IT contractor divulged many of the top secret documents in his possession .

At that point , The Guardian 's U.S. Editor Janine Gibson drew up plan before publishing , including seeking legal advice and working out a strategy for approaching the White House . She had some tough decisions to make .

Harding wrote : `` Gibson decided to give the NSA a four-hour window to comment , so the agency had an opportunity to disavow the story . By British standards , the deadline was fair : long enough to make a few calls , agree a line . But for Washington , where journalist-administration relations sometimes resemble a country club , this was nothing short of outrageous . ''

Harding said Gibson 's tough decisions meant she 'd have to face down some tough people , including FBI deputy director Sean M. Joyce , NSA deputy director Chris Inglis , and Robert S. Litt , general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence .

The author writes : `` By fielding heavyweights , the White House had perhaps reckoned it could flatter , and if necessary bully , the Guardian into delaying publication . Gibson explained that the editor-in-chief -- in the air halfway across the Atlantic -- was unavailable . She said : ` I 'm the final decision-maker . ' After 20 minutes , the White House was frustrated . The conversation was going in circles . Finally , one of the team could take no more . Losing his temper , he shouted , ` You do n't need to publish this ! No serious news organisation would publish this ! ' Gibson replied , ` With the greatest respect , we will take the decisions about what we publish . ' ''

The newspaper ran the story and , soon thereafter , Snowden disappeared . He 's currently in Russia , where he has asylum .

`` I think ... he 's achieved far more than he could have possibly imagined when he was sitting in Hawaii planning this leak , '' Harding told CNN on Sunday .

He described Snowden 's transformation from contractor to leaker .

`` He got hardened . In other words , the more information he saw about what he viewed as ... mass surveillance , the more disillusioned he became . He says quite explicitly that he thought that -LRB- President Barack -RRB- Obama would roll back some of these programs when he came into the White House , and when this did n't happen , essentially Snowden decided he would take things into his own hands , and become a whistle-blower , '' he author said .

`` There 's no doubt that he 's changed history by what he 's done . ''
