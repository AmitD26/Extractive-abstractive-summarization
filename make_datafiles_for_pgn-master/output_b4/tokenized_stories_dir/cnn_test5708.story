Taking the stand on Wednesday , the third day of the George Zimmerman trial , a friend of Trayvon Martin testified Wednesday about the final moments of the teenager 's life , saying that Martin told her someone was following him .

`` A man was watching him , '' said Rachel Jeantel , 19 , who was on the phone with Martin just before he was fatally shot . `` He said the man kept watching him . He kept complaining that a man was just watching him . ''

That man was Zimmerman , a former neighborhood watch captain charged with second-degree murder for killing 17-year-old Martin in Sanford , Florida , on February 26 , 2012 . He told police he was pursuing the teenager because there had been a rash of crime in the area . A confrontation ensued , and Zimmerman said he was forced to kill Martin in self-defense .

Jeantel testified that as he neared the home of his father 's girlfriend , Martin tried to lose Zimmerman .

`` And then he said , ` That N-word is still following me now , ' '' said Jeantel . `` I asked him how the man looked like . He just told me the man looked ` creepy . ' ` Creepy , white ' -- excuse my language -- ` cracker . Creepy -LSB- expletive -RSB- cracker . ''

Jeantel says she heard Martin talking to Zimmerman in the background of the call .

`` He said , ` Why are you following me for ? ' And I heard a hard-breathing man say , ` What you doing around here ? ' '' said Jeantel .

Jeantel also said she heard a bump from Martin 's headset hitting something and `` wet grass sounds . ''

`` I start hearing a little bit of Trayvon saying , ` Get off , get off ! ' '' said Jeantel .

Fast facts : Trayvon Martin shooting

She told the prosecutor that the screams for help heard on the 911 call made by a neighbor belong to Martin . But on cross-examination , defense attorney Don West read part of a transcript from Jeantel 's deposition , in which she said she was n't sure if it was Martin 's voice or not .

`` It could be . Like I said , I do n't know but it could be , '' said Jeantel , according to the transcript . `` The dude sound kind of like Trayvon . Trayvon do got that soft voice and that baby voice sometimes , so it could be , I do n't know . ''

Jeantel admitted to West that she lied several times to Martin 's family . She said she told them she was 16 , not 18 , because she wanted to be treated like a minor and have privacy . She also said she lied about not attending Martin 's memorial service because she was in the hospital . The truth , she said , was that she was afraid to see the body .

`` You got to understand , you the last person to talk to the person and he died on the phone after you talked to him -- you got to understand what I 'm trying to tell you , '' said Jeantel . `` I 'm the last person , you do n't know how it felt . You think I really want to go see the body after I just talked to him ? '' Jeantel said .

Jeantel appeared to get frustrated several times during the cross-examination , including one time when West suggested they could break until the morning so she 'd have more time to review the deposition transcript .

`` No , I 'm leaving today , '' Jeantel told the defense attorney as she looked over the papers .

`` Are you refusing to come back tomorrow ? '' asked West .

The judge stepped in and asked West to keep the questions and answers to Jeantel 's testimony .

Earlier in the afternoon , jurors heard five other non-emergency calls Zimmerman made reporting suspicious people in his neighborhood . The defense wanted the calls to be thrown out , questioning their relevance , but the judge ruled they would be allowed in . Prosecutors had argued that the calls show Zimmerman 's state of mind the night he shot Martin .

In one of the calls , made on February 2 , 2012 , about three weeks before Martin 's death , Zimmerman told the dispatcher he saw a black man walking around a neighbor 's home . He said he also had seen this man walking around the neighborhood on trash days .

`` I do n't know what he 's doing , I do n't want to approach him , personally , '' said Zimmerman on the recording .

Opening statements : Expletives and a knock-knock joke

In another call made in October 2011 , Zimmerman reported two `` suspicious characters '' who were `` just hanging out , loitering '' in his neighborhood . When the dispatcher asked if he can still see the suspects , Zimmerman said no because he `` did n't want to attract attention '' to himself .

An eyewitness who also testified on Wednesday said she heard what sounded `` like a boy '' cry for help during the altercation that ended in Martin 's death .

Jayne Surdyka , Zimmerman 's former neighbor , said she heard screams and opened her window to look out into the courtyard on the night of the shooting .

Defense attorney West challenged Surdyka about what she heard that night , saying it is possible for a teenager to have a deeper voice and for a man to have a higher-pitched voice .

`` It sounded more like a boy to me , '' said Surdyka .

Multiple times , Surdyka said she saw two men struggling on the ground , one on top of the other , but she could n't discern who was on top because it was dark and rainy that night .

Prosecutor Bernie De La Rionda played for the jury the 911 call Surdyka made the night of shooting . On the recording , Surdyka is heard crying and becoming hysterical . The 911 operator stayed on the phone with her to calm her down .

Prosecutors also called Jeannee Manalo , another witness , to the stand Wednesday . Manalo testified that from her point of view inside her townhome , she could see two men struggling on the ground . She also said she believes Zimmerman was on top of Martin during the altercation and that she could see his hands moving .

During cross-examination , Manalo said photographs she saw on the news of a younger Martin support her view that Zimmerman was on top during the altercation . Defense attorney Mark O'Mara asked her if she had ever seen recent photos of Martin . She said no but maintained that based on the photographs , the bigger person was on top , and Zimmerman seemed to be the bigger person .

Before court recessed for the day , the defense told the judge it expects to need a couple more hours to question Martin 's friend , Jeantel . Testimony is scheduled to resume Thursday at 9 a.m. ET .
