More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer 's today , with another person developing the disease every 68 seconds . By 2050 , the number of people living with Alzheimer 's disease is expected to triple .

As if those numbers were n't staggering enough , consider this : Alzheimer 's disease is the only cause of death among the top 10 -LRB- it 's currently ranked No. 6 -RRB- in the United States that ca n't be prevented , cured or slowed down .

Ask any expert , and he or she will tell you that early diagnosis is key to helping patients live better day to day , so even though the disease is still progressing , the symptoms are less harsh .

`` Our hope is that if we could identify patients who are developing the disease early , it would give us a much better opportunity to intervene with treatments , and it 's much more likely for those treatments to be effective , '' says Dr. Keith Black , chairman of neurosurgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center .

But while early diagnosis leads to early intervention , some news out of the 2013 Alzheimer 's Association International Conference is troubling : An expert panel found 16 online tests for Alzheimer 's disease scored poorly on scales of overall scientific validity , reliability and ethical factors .

`` Self-diagnosis behavior ... is increasingly popular online , and freely accessible quizzes that call themselves ` tests ' for Alzheimer 's are available on the Internet , '' says Julie Robillard , who presented the data this week in Boston . `` However , little is known about the scientific validity and reliability of these offerings and ethics-related factors , including research and commercial conflict of interest , confidentiality and consent . ''

`` Frankly , '' Robillard adds , `` what we found online was distressing and potentially harmful . ''

Robillard and her colleagues at the University of British Columbia found that unique monthly visitors for the parent sites hosting the online tests reached as high as 8.8 million .

At the same conference , another study concluded that the misdiagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease in Medicare patients who actually have vascular dementia or Parkinson 's disease leads to substantial excess costs of care . The study , conducted by Analysis Group , Inc. and Eli Lilly and Co. , found the costs of erroneous care to be in excess of $ 14,000 a year per patient .

The silver lining : Those excess costs decline and eventually dissipate following a correct diagnosis .

`` Recent developments in technology have greatly improved our ability to properly diagnose patients with cognitive impairment , '' said Analysis Group 's Noam Kirson . `` Our results suggest that there are economic benefits to properly diagnosing -- as early as possible -- the cause of the cognitive impairment . ''

If you suspect a family member or friend is developing Alzheimer 's , take a look at these 10 warning signs of Alzheimer 's Disease , put together by the Alzheimer 's Association :

1 . Memory changes that disrupt daily life

2 . Challenges in planning or solving problems

3 . Difficulty completing familiar tasks at home , at work , or at leisure

4 . Confusion with time or place

5 . Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships

6 . New problems with words in speaking or writing

7 . Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps

8 . Decreased or poor judgment

9 . Withdrawal from work or social activities

10 . Changes in mood and personality

Rather than diagnose Alzheimer 's disease at home , head to your doctor 's office . You can also find more information at www.alz.org , or by calling the Alzheimer 's Association 's 24-hour hotline at -LRB-800-RRB-Â 272-3900 .

The importance of early detection and early intervention ca n't be stressed strongly enough . It could mean added years of lucidity and life for you or someone you love .
