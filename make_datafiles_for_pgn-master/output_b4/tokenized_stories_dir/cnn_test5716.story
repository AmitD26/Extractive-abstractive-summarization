A Turkish-Armenian blogger vowed to appeal a day after an Istanbul court sentenced him to more than a year in prison for blasphemy .

In a phone interview with CNN , Sevan Nisanyan accused Turkey 's Islamic-rooted government of politically persecuting him .

`` When I attacked the Islamist establishment they felt I overstepped my boundaries , '' said Nisanyan , who is a member of Turkey 's tiny Armenian ethnic minority . `` Here I am an Armenian doing something no Armenian has done in a Muslim country . This is really the height of boldness , of impudence . This is something you are not supposed to do . ''

According to Turkey 's semi-official Anatolian Agency , Nisanyan received a one year and 45-day jail sentence for `` openly denigrating the religious values held by a certain portion of the population . ''

Anatolian reported that Nisanyan 's initial nine-month jail sentence was extended because `` the crime was committed through the press . ''

Turkey is a majority Muslim country .

Nisanyan said the court cited a passage in his blog published last September that referred to the international uproar triggered by cheaply made Hollywood film called the `` Innocence of Muslims . '' The film , which ridiculed the most revered figure in Islam , the Prophet Mohammed , sparked violent protests in Egypt and Libya . The Turkish prime minister also denounced the movie as `` Islamophobic , '' though protests on Turkish streets were small and peaceful .

On Wednesday , Nisanyan published an English translation of the passage in question from his September 2012 blog post :

`` It is not ` hate crime ' to poke fun at some Arab leader who , many hundred years ago , claimed to have established contact with Deity and made political , economic and sexual profit as a result . It is almost a kindergarten-level case of what we call freedom of expression , '' Nisanyan wrote .

Since the blog was published last year , Nisanyan said , prosecutors have taken him to court simultaneously for this passage in three separate courts across Turkey .

Nisanyan said he represented himself at the criminal court in Istanbul , without the help of an attorney . He acknowledged that he took a confrontational approach in his statement to the court , arguing that no one should be prosecuted for discussing the historical background of a religious figure .

`` In consequence of his claim to have established contact with Deity , this Muhammed , who was a lowly merchant , acquired political dominion over all Arabian and gained the financial means to raise 30-thousand-strong armies , '' Nisanyan wrote , citing his statement to the court .

`` It is an incontrovertible historical fact that this person made political , economic and sexual profit from his alleged contact with Deity . ''

In his interview with CNN , Nisanyan recognized that he was deliberately throwing fuel on the fire regarding his conviction .

`` I 'm hoping to contribute to the ongoing debate in this country on freedom of expression and freedom of religion , '' Nisanyan said . `` I think I 'm performing a useful public service . ''

This is not the first time people have been convicted of insulting Islam in Turkey .

Last month Fazil Say , Turkey 's most famous classical pianist , received a 10-month suspended jail sentence for insulting Islamic values in a series of statements disseminated on Twitter .

International press freedom organizations have slammed Turkey in previous years for having more journalists in prison than any other country .

On April 30 , the human rights watchdog Amnesty International denounced a new package of legislation sponsored by the Turkish government .

`` Amnesty International believes the reform package will allow abusive prosecutions to continue , forcing still more political activists , journalists and human rights defenders to face jail sentences for carrying out their work , '' Amnesty wrote .

According to Anatolian , the judge in Istanbul ruled `` not to postpone the punishment '' for Nisanyan because he has a record of prior convictions .

Nisanyan served 11 months in prison a decade ago for committing building violations in the touristic Turkish village of Sirince , where he owned and operated a hotel .

Prior to becoming an outspoken political blogger and newspaper columnist , Nisanyan was a prominent travel writer and hotelier who promoted the boutique hotel and bed-and-breakfast industry in Turkey .

He said he is currently appealing a dozen convictions with sentences that add up to 20 years in jail .

During his previous prison term , Nisanyan wrote and published a dictionary of Turkish etymology , a study of the history of words .
