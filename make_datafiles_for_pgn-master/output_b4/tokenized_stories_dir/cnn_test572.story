-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Enietra Washington does n't remember the flash or the bang when she was shot .

All she recalls is a stunned silence in the orange Ford Pinto , driven by the man who 'd offered her a ride to a party .

The bullet that doctors pulled from her body in 1988 became a key piece of evidence against the man now suspected of being the `` Grim Sleeper '' serial killer , blamed for the deaths of at least 10 women in the Los Angeles area between 1985 and 2007 . The .25-caliber slug matched a weapon police now link to eight of those killings , which detectives say were committed by 58-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr. .

Washington is the only known survivor of an encounter with the Grim Sleeper , whose nickname comes from a 13-year gap between slayings police blamed on him . But now , investigators are looking into whether Franklin can be connected to any more of another 230 Los Angeles-area slayings , including some they previously considered solved .

Washington told HLN 's `` Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell '' that her attacker turned on her so quickly she hardly knew what happened .

`` He does it unexpectedly , '' she said . `` It 's not like the woman is forewarned and can even protect herself . If she 's not paying attention just as I was , you turn around to say something to him and he point-blank shoots you first .

`` If you 're not in the grace of God and you know how to keep yourself from panicking , you 're at his will , '' she said .

Washington , then 29 , said she was drawn to the orange Pinto with the striped top . When its driver offered her a ride , she turned him down , only to have him retort , `` That 's what 's wrong with you black women . Men ca n't be men to you , '' she recounted .

She agreed to accept a ride to a gathering at a friend 's house , thinking she could pawn him off on someone there . After he stopped at what he said was his uncle 's house to get cash , she said he muttered something she did n't quite hear -- `` then all of a sudden , everything just went real quiet . ''

Only when her attacker told her , `` Bitch , I 'll shoot you again , '' did she realize she had been shot a first time , she told HLN .

Most of the sleeper 's victims were discovered dumped in south Los Angeles alleys and covered with debris , authorities said . All victims were shot ; some were strangled too , an indictment alleges .

Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty against Franklin , who was arrested in July 2010 . A pretrial hearing is scheduled for November 7 , according to the district attorney 's office .
