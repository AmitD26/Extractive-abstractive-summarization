After months of hints , China announced Friday it will relax its decades-long one-child policy and abolish labor camps in an effort to improve human rights , the state-run Xinhua news agency reported .

Officials had said earlier both controversial policies were under review , but that did not diminish the force of Friday 's announcement .

The biggest change could be the abolishment of the so-called `` re-education through labor '' system under which tens of thousands are imprisoned in China without trial .

Set up in 1957 , the system allows the police to detain petty offenders -- such as thieves , prostitutes and drug addicts -- in labor camps for up to four years without a trial . China 's judicial process itself is already controlled by the ruling Communists in a one-party regime . In a 2009 report to a United Nations human rights forum , the Chinese government acknowledged 320 such facilities nationwide holding 190,000 people . Other estimates have put the number of inmates much higher .

Critics have long accused of the authorities of misusing the camps to silence so-called trouble makers , including political dissidents , rights activists and Falun Gong members .

As part of the reforms , China said it will reduce the number of crimes subject to the death penalty .

Even those who know little about China have likely heard about its one-child policy . China 's family planning laws require most families living in urban areas to have one child .

The policy will be slightly relaxed so that couples will be allowed to have two children if one of the parents was an only child , Xinhua reported . Currently , both parents must be sole children to be eligible for a second child .

The one-child policy , though applauded by many for slowing down China 's population growth , has been widely criticized for resulting in forced abortions and hefty fines that are sometimes used to enforce it .

Some critics say the law hurts China 's elderly , who typically rely on their children for support in old age , and even constrains economic growth as the working age population begins to decline .

`` Since the policy now allows it , I will definitely have a second child , '' one 25-year-old woman in Beijing told CNN . `` It 's too lonely for a single child . ''

Another man , walking through the Beijing metro with his girlfriend , agreed .

`` When I get married , I would prefer having two children as I 'm the only child in my family . My childhood was a bit boring , '' he said .

A third commuter also praised the changes : `` It 's a great new policy . Raising three kids is a bit stressful , but two are just perfect . ''
