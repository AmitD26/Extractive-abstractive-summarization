Seventy one years ago -- December 22 , 1942 -- Congress got the United States out of what had turned into an unexpectedly embarrassing situation .

It concerned the Pledge of Allegiance -- specifically , something called the Bellamy Salute .

Most people today have likely never heard of it , but the Bellamy Salute was once a constant part of the country 's life .

Until 1892 , there was no such thing as a Pledge of Allegiance .

Daniel Sharp Ford , the owner of a magazine called Youth 's Companion , was on a crusade to put American flags in every school in the country . He sensed that the U.S. needed a boost of patriotism . Keep in mind : Not even 30 years before , the Civil War had still been raging . National unity was a fragile concept .

As part of the campaign , Sharp gave an assignment to a member of his staff : Francis J. Bellamy , who was an author , a minister and an advocate of the tenets of Christian socialism . Sharp asked Bellamy to compose a Pledge of Allegiance to the flag . Bellamy wrote it , and it was published in the magazine .

It did n't take long for the Pledge to become wildly popular , even omnipresent . At schools , at campgrounds , at public gatherings , in Congress , people routinely faced the flag and pledged their allegiance to it .

Because , inherently , there is something physically awkward about people simply standing in place , their arms hanging limply by their sides , staring at a flag and reciting a pledge , it was decided that devising a salute would be appropriate .

Instructions for carrying out the salute were printed in the pages of Youth 's Companion . The gesture came to be called the Bellamy Salute , in honor of the Pledge 's author .

The Bellamy Salute consisted of each person -- man , woman or child -- extending his or her right arm straight forward , angling slightly upward , fingers pointing directly ahead .

With their right arms aiming stiffly toward the flag , they recited : `` I pledge allegiance ... ''

For a while , the salute was n't especially controversial .

But , as World War II was forming in Europe , and Italians and Germans began saluting Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler with extended-armed `` Heil Hitler ! '' - style gestures ...

Well , perhaps you can see the problem .

In the United States there was a growing feeling of discomfort that , when people within the nation 's own borders pledged their right-arms-extended allegiance to the flag , they might be construed as inadvertently showing solidarity with the fascist regimes across the ocean . Richard J. Ellis , in his book `` To the Flag : The Unlikely History of the Pledge of Allegiance , '' wrote that `` the similarities in the salute had begun to attract comment as early as the mid-1930s . ''

Newsreels and still photos were regularly depicting rallies in Europe 's dictatorships , with thousands of people showing their fealty by extending straight-armed salutes . In the United States , the general unease about it -- `` the embarrassing resemblance between the ` Heil Hitler ' salute and the salute that accompanied the Pledge of Allegiance , '' in Richard Ellis 's words -- was combined with the fear that scenes of Americans offering the Bellamy Salute could be used for propaganda purposes .

It would n't be terribly difficult to crop the American flag out of photos of U.S. citizens reciting the Pledge of Allegiance ; without the flag in the shots , the photos could be mischaracterized as proof that Americans were expressing support for the ideologies of Hitler and Mussolini .

Thus , on December 22 , 1942 , Congress , just before its Christmas break , took care of it . On that day , the amended Flag Code was passed , Section 7 of which decreed that the Pledge of Allegiance should `` be rendered by standing with the right hand over the heart . ''

And with that , it became official : Those millions of extended right arms were brought down . The stiff-armed salute was for other people , in countries far away .

It was purely symbolic , of course , but symbols are powerful . Over the years , there have been various disputes about the Pledge of Allegiance , the most basic of which is the question of whether citizens should even be expected to publicly pledge their allegiance to their country . The United States was founded on ideals of freedom , and freedom includes not being forced , or cajoled by peer pressure , into publicly declaring any belief .

The exact wording of the Pledge has changed several times since Francis Bellamy wrote it ; each change was reflective of contemporaneous concerns about the meaning . For example : `` I pledge allegiance to the flag '' was originally `` I pledge allegiance to my flag . '' The `` my '' was dropped out of worries that recent arrivals from other nations might be seen as pledging their loyalty to the flag of the country of their birth .

The most significant change in the wording came in 1954 , when -- with the enthusiastic support of President Dwight D. Eisenhower -- the phrase `` under God '' was added just after `` one nation . '' Eisenhower declared : `` In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America 's heritage and future ; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country 's most powerful resource in peace and war . ''

The wording of the Pledge of Allegiance may or may not be changed again in centuries to come , but it 's a pretty safe bet that the Bellamy Salute is never coming back . Once ubiquitous and unquestioned , it has become a faded and mostly forgotten bit of U.S. history .

All because , 71 Decembers ago , a solution to a quandary -- a quandary no one could have anticipated when the Pledge was written -- was formalized :

Lower those stiff arms .

Bend those elbows .

Direct those palms inward .

And take them to heart .

After the Pledge of Allegiance was written , a stiff-armed salute was developed to accompany it

Bob Greene writes that its meaning got clouded when Fascist movements used similar salute

After outbreak of World War II , Congress passed legislation to replace the salute
