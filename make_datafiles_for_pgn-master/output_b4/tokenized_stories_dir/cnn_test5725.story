The point-blank shooting of two New York City police officers this weekend is testing whether Mayor Bill de Blasio 's brand of unapologetic liberalism can work in a city that 's spent decades under mayors who made law and order a top priority .

De Blasio 's pledge to reform police practices helped sweep him into office last year . And in recent weeks he 's pushed for the right of demonstrators to gather to protest the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner , two unarmed African-American men , at the hands of white police officers .

But critics -- including those in the police force -- are accusing him of fomenting an anti-police fervor that contributed to the killings of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos .

On Monday , de Blasio tried to reduce tension in the city .

`` We have to get everyone to move away from anger and hatred , '' he said during an afternoon press conference . `` If there are differences , we have to address them peacefully . We have to give people faith that their concerns can be heard peacefully across the spectrum and we have to move forward . ''

He said New York will not `` be the kind of city it was meant to be if there is a division between our police and the community . ''

`` The police are our protectors and they must be respected as such , '' he added .

He said the murders this weekend were `` an attack on all of us '' during luncheon remarks at the Police Athletic League shortly before his afternoon press conference . And the mayor also called for a hiatus from the protests that have gripped the city and the nation , saying the should focus instead on Liu and Ramos ' families .

`` It 's time for everyone to put aside political debates , put aside protests , put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time , '' he said . `` Let 's accompany these families on their difficult journey . Let 's see them through the funerals ... then the debate can begin again . ''

But during his afternoon press conference , he also pushed back against his critics , calling remarks from the head of the city 's police union `` wrong and mistaken . ''

De Blasio also accused the media of contributing to the atmosphere of tension between police and protesters .

`` What are you guys gon na do -- are you going to keep dividing us ? '' a visibly angry de Blasio asked reporters , asserting that the media had unfairly focused on a few examples of violence that did not reflect the majority of protesters .

`` You all are part of this , too , '' he added .

President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have spoken out on the killings of Brown and Garner , calling for Americans to open up a dialogue on race and law enforcement and sharing their own experiences with racism . Obama has launched a task force to examine cases where there may be uneven applications of the law and propose fixes .

But a startling divide between how white Americans and minorities view the criminal justice system , revealed by a new CNN/ORC poll , underscores the challenge facing both de Blasio and Obama as they struggle to find a solution to broken relationship between the police and the communities they serve .

The nationwide poll , conducted largely before Liu and Ramos were shot and released Monday , shows 57 percent of white Americans think none or almost none of the police in their area are prejudiced against blacks .

Just a quarter of non-white Americans feel the same .

And while 50 percent of white Americans say the criminal justice system treats blacks fairly , only 21 percent of non-white Americans agree .

The shooting this weekend prompted police departments from Colorado to Washington , DC , to warn their officers to remain vigilant and watch out for potential copycat violence against them .

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said this weekend on CNN that de Blasio had sparked `` intense , anti-police hatred '' with his support for protesters . Patrick Lynch , the head of NYPD 's police union , also lashed out at de Blasio , saying that there 's blood on the hands of those who have supported the protesters and it `` starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor . ''

While de Blasio tried to downplay the politics of the situation during a press conference this weekend , Giuliani and others -- largely Republicans -- have argued his policies are directly to blame .

`` It is the right time to talk about -LSB- de Blasio 's -RSB- policies . His policies of allowing protests to get out of control , and of his not emphasizing enough the importance of fatherhood , the importance of education , the importance of an alternative to a public education system that is failing the black children , '' Giuliani , a Republican , said on Fox News this weekend .

Giuliani also placed the blame on `` propaganda '' from the President .

`` We 've had four months of propaganda starting with the President , that everybody should hate the police . I do n't care how you want to describe it , that 's what those protests are all about , '' Giuliani said .

Others took aim at Holder .

`` Sickened by these barbaric acts , which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of #ericholder & #mayordeblasio , '' tweeted former New York Gov. George Pataki , a Republican .

Still , tensions between the police and the city 's mayors are nothing new , and indeed have n't yet reached the breaking point they saw under former Mayor David Dinkins , who oversaw -- and was unable to control -- an all-out riot by police in 1992 .

Then , much of the criticism from police was the same : `` He never supports us on anything , '' an officer quoted by the New York Times said at the time .

New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Monday , however , that his first 10 years in the police force , in 1970 , `` were around this type of tension . ''

Bratton cautioned against politicizing the tragedy , but agreed that the shooting of the two officers this weekend `` was a direct spinoff '' of the recent protests , and that de Blasio has work to do in rebuilding support within the police community .

`` I think he has lost -LSB- the trust of -RSB- some officers , '' Bratton said .
