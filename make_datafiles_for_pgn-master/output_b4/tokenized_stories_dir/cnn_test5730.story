New Delhi -LRB- CNN -RRB- Taking militants out with drones is n't simple , but it 's the best strategy available to eliminate the threat of terrorists in Yemen , U.S. President Barack Obama said Sunday .

The administration 's policy in the increasingly unstable country has come under scrutiny in recent days as the U.S.-backed government crumbled under pressure from Shiite Houthi rebels .

`` Yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability , '' Obama said in New Delhi , where he 's on a three-day state visit . He described the U.S. policy there -- `` partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government '' -- as the best approach in a bad situation .

`` The alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country , '' Obama said .

The unraveling security situation in Yemen -- the same country Obama cited as a model for his fight against ISIS terrorists -- has thrown the President 's counterterror message into question .

In the capital , Sanaa , last week , the presidential palace was overrun by Houthi rebels and President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi announced he was resigning .

That 's a problem for the United States , which has relied on the government in Yemen as an ally in battling the al Qaeda affiliate that 's based there . A power vacuum could benefit al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , the terrorist offshoot that U.S. officials consider the most dangerous branch of the global jihadi network .

Amid the uncertainty in Yemen last week , it was reported the U.S. had suspended its counterterror efforts there . Obama said definitively on Sunday those reports were wrong .

`` We continue to go after high-value targets inside Yemen , '' he said .

Obama himself cited the U.S.-Yemen partnership when he announced in September he was going after ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria .

Explaining why he was ruling out sending American troops to fight ISIS , Obama said he was modeling his strategy after what he said were successful efforts in Yemen and Somalia to partner with governments to go after terrorists .

`` This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us , while supporting partners on the front lines , is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years , '' Obama said on September 10 . `` It is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year : to use force against anyone who threatens America 's core interests , but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order . ''

What that strategy relied on , however , was a strong partnership between the United States and the existing government in Yemen , led by Hadi . Hadi reorganized Yemen 's military to better go after AQAP , a strategy that worked for a time . But the plan was waylaid when resources were diverted to battle the militant Houthis , a group of Shiites who say they feel marginalized in the majority Sunni country .

Obama was confident on Sunday that U.S. anti-terror efforts would continue in Yemen .

`` What we have shown is that we can maintain the kind of pressure on these terrorist networks even in these kind of difficult environments , '' he said .
