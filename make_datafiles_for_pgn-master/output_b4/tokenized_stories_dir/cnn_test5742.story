A leading drug candidate for low sexual desire in women has n't gotten approved for use in the United States , but the company backing it is n't giving up .

Sprout Pharmaceuticals announced Tuesday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the company `` clear guidance '' on `` the path forward '' for its drug to treat low libido in women , called flibanserin . The FDA had rejected an application to approve the drug last year , which Sprout appealed .

`` The FDA has requested that Sprout complete two additional Phase I drug interaction studies and a Phase I driving simulator study , '' Sprout said in a statement . Such studies will look at different enzyme pathways and investigate whether the drug 's side effects would impair driving .

Sprout will resubmit the new drug application for flibanserin by the third quarter of this year , the company said .

`` We are encouraged by the FDA 's response and view it as a significant step toward the approval of flibanserin , '' said Cindy Whitehead , president and chief operating officer of Sprout Pharmaceuticals , in a statement .

The FDA declined to answer specific questions regarding the matter when contacted by CNN in January .

FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer said in a statement : `` The FDA is only able to provide information on approved drug product applications . Any information on an application that has yet to receive an approval or was denied approval belongs to the manufacturer/sponsor developing the drug . ''

Where 's the sex drive drug for women ?

Sprouting a drug

Flibanserin was initially developed by pharmaceutical giant Boehringer Ingelheim , but the company ditched it in 2010 after the FDA declined to approve their new drug application , asking for more research , said Dr. Irwin Goldstein , director of sexual medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego , California , who collaborated on clinical trials for flibanserin .

A smaller operation , Sprout Pharmaceuticals , took over work on the drug in 2011 , and resubmitted an application with 14 new clinical studies , encompassing data on more than 3,000 new patients , according to the company .

The drug is designed for the treatment of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in women . That 's the technical term for when women have a distressing lack or absence of sexual desire or fantasy . Up to one-third of adult women may experience it , according to a 2002 study .

In total , more than 11,000 people have participated in clinical trials for flibanserin , Whitehead said . Still , the most recent attempt to get flibanserin off the ground failed ; the FDA did not approve the company 's revised drug application in October .

The FDA characterized the drug as having a `` modest '' effect in its response letter , Whitehead said . But clinical trial results show statistically significant improvement in the women who took the drug , compared to those who took a placebo , she said .

`` In terms of what we see , I would say ` modest ' is meaningful , '' Whitehead said .

Sex is doctor 's life 's work

A 2013 study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine showed that women taking the drug reported an average increase of 2.5 satisfying sexual events in four weeks , compared to an increase of 1.5 among women using a placebo .

Flibanserin is not a hormonal treatment and does not appear to affect fertility or interact with birth control medications , Whitehead said .

Given that the drug has been through numerous , rigorous clinical trials , and so much has been invested in it , the FDA 's refusal to approve it is a turning point in the field of sexual medicine , Goldstein said .

The drug works by increasing brain blood flow in particular ways , Goldstein said . It increases levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline , and lowers levels of serotonin .

Side effects of flibanserin include dizziness , nausea , fatigue and sleepiness . Unlike some treatments for men , flibanserin needs to be taken once a day , every day .

If there is no positive action on the drug , it could spell doom for pharmacological efforts to manage female sexual desire , he said . `` It will go back to dark ages of saying , ` This is all a relationship problem , ' even though we know it 's not , '' he said .

Other options

There are other experimental treatments for low female sex drive in the works .

Drugs called Lybrido and Lybridos , developed by a company called Emotional Brain , have undergone several randomized studies with results that are `` very promising and will be published soon , '' according to the company 's website . A drug called Bremelanotide is being investigated by Palatin Technologies for both men and women . None of these drugs has completed phase 3 trials , which are necessary before approval .

Whitehead counts 24 FDA-approved treatments available in the United States for male sexual dysfunction , including popular drugs such as Viagra -LRB- sildenafil citrate -RRB- . For women , it 's zero .

`` A lot of times , the medical community has really put men 's needs first and has n't really addressed women 's sexual needs , '' said Jennifer Foust , a sex therapist in Aventura , Florida , who is not affiliated with flibanserin .

Because doctors have no solutions , women have tried less-proven treatments for their low sexual desire , such as diets and herbs . None of Foust 's clients has had success with them . She said some women who are n't functioning well sexually would be `` open to anything . ''

`` I 've had women complain , ` Why is n't there a female Viagra ? ' '' Foust said .

Sex drive : It 's complicated

Sex drive is more complicated for women than for men , Foust said . There are a lot of factors that could explain a woman 's low desire -- and not all of them are medical , she said . Lifestyle and relationship issues may come into play .

Having a first child can be a problematic factor for some women ; the adjustment and figuring out how to restructure their sex life can throw off desire . Foust has spoken to some new mothers who feel they are constantly being asked for something from their body , as if they are `` touched out , '' but find their lack of desire troubling .

Some couples maintain satisfying sex lives over many years -- but some , over time , go on autopilot and have less and less sex .

`` You have to continue to feed your sexual relationship , and feed your relationship in general , '' Foust said . `` A lot of it depends on how much importance and energy you put toward your sex life . ''

Sometimes stress is the issue , too , she said .

Foust offers cognitive-behavioral , focused exercises to help women who are distressed about their low sexual desire .

Low sexual desire in women is n't necessarily a problem in menopause or later . Foust works with many women complaining of low sex drive who are in their 30s and 40s . The average age of participants in the flibanserin trials was 36 , Whitehead said .

The new drug application the company will submit will be specifically for premenopausal women .
