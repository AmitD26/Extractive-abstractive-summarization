NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Art Capital Group has withdrawn its lawsuit against celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz and extended the due date for repayment of her $ 24 million loan , the two sides announced Friday .

Annie Leibovitz appears before her photo of Demi Moore during an exhibition of her work in June in Madrid , Spain .

It is part of an agreement reached between Leibovitz and Art Capital Group , which restructured her debts , according to a joint statement from the two sides .

Under the agreement , Art Capital also agreed to extend the maturity date for the loan it provided to Leibovitz , which was originally due on Tuesday . The statement did not say when the loan is now due .

In addition , Leibovitz bought back from Art Capital the rights to act as exclusive agent in the sale of her pictures and her property , the statement said .

`` Ms. Leibovitz will therefore retain control of those assets within the context of the loan agreement which shall prevail until satisfied , '' it said .

Art Capital Group said Leibovitz initially approached the company , an adviser to artists and art owners , around June 2008 regarding her `` dire financial condition arising from ... mortgage obligations , tax liens and unpaid bills to service providers and other creditors , '' the complaint said

In July , Art Capital filed a complaint with the New York Supreme Court , asking it to uphold the sales agreement it signed with Leibovitz , including its right to sell her art and real estate .

Leibovitz , who has photographed everyone from the Rolling Stones to Queen Elizabeth , put her art , intellectual property and even real estate assets up for collateral last year when she consolidated her massive debts .

`` In these challenging times , I am appreciative to Art Capital for all they have done to resolve this matter and for their cooperation and continued support , '' Leibovitz said in the joint statement .

`` I also want to thank my family , friends , and colleagues for being there for me and look forward to concentrating on my work . ''

The tone of the agreement differed markedly from that of a complaint filed July 29 in New York Supreme Court by Art Capital Group , in which the company accused the photographer of `` willful and flagrant '' breaches of her agreement , adding : `` It appears that Leibovitz entered into the sales agreement with no intention of performing or permitting performance under it . ''

One of Leibovitz 's best-known photos is of John Lennon with his wife , Yoko Ono , shortly before the Beatles star was assassinated in 1980 .

She is no stranger to controversy .

In 1991 , Leibovitz photographed a nude and extremely pregnant Demi Moore for the cover of Vanity Fair . The issue , considered scandalous at the time , was sold in many places nationwide with a sheath of white paper . Watch more about the suit she faced , controversy she 's stirred ''

Last year , Leibovitz photographed Disney star Miley Cyrus wrapped in a bedsheet , eliciting claims that the photographer pressured the teen queen into poses that were too provocative for her young age .
