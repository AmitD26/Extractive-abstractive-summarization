German authorities have asked pop star Justin Bieber to hand over nearly $ 8,000 for the costs of caring for the capuchin monkey he left behind in Munich after bringing it on tour without the right paperwork .

The bill covers the cost of vaccinations , accommodation and transport for the monkey , known as Mally , which is now being cared for at a zoo in northern Germany .

Customs officials posted a public notice of the bill after failing to get a response from Bieber at the address he gave to customs officials , said Martin Brandlhuber , a customs spokesman at Munich 's airport .

In light of that , German authorities have followed the applicable laws and made the claim publicly known , he said .

Bieber must pay up the next time he comes to Germany or risk being denied entry , Brandlhuber said .

If he is unable to pay cash , then customs officials could confiscate other property to meet the claim , Brandlhuber said . Alternatively , Bieber could be denied entry and be required to provide a valid address .

The young monkey was taken to a Munich animal shelter after it was confiscated at the end of March as Bieber arrived in Germany on a European tour .

Mally was transferred to the Serengeti Park in Hodenhagen , near Hanover , in June after spending several weeks in quarantine .

Bieber had until May 7 to present the paperwork to reclaim his pet but failed to do so , zoo spokeswoman Juliane Gunkel said last month .

As a result , Mally is now the property of the German government , and the Serengeti Park is acting as the caretaker . The park was picked because it is the only zoo in Germany that has a family of capuchins for Mally to join .

Bieber 's representatives declined to comment at the time the animal was confiscated .
