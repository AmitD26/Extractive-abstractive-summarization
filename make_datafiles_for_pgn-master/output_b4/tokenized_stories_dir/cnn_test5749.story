-LRB- CNN -RRB- #BlackLivesMatter has been a hashtag , a mantra , a movement and now it 's a college course .

This spring , Dartmouth College will offer a new class , `` 10 Weeks , 10 Professors : #BlackLivesMatter , '' which will examine race , violence and inequality through current events and throughout history .

The 2014 deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , and Eric Garner in New York during confrontations with police sparked conversations on social media and protests around the world , including Dartmouth 's Hanover , New Hampshire , campus .

`` Even though we might be sort of cloistered away in the ivory tower or something , we felt very much moved by , incited by , inspired by a lot of the activists ' work following the failure to indict Darren Wilson after the events in Ferguson , '' said Aimee Bahng , an assistant professor of English at Dartmouth . `` We wanted to not leave this behind after winter break . ''

Then , around Martin Luther King Jr. . Day , Missouri Rev. Starsky Wilson , co-chairman of the Ferguson Commission , spoke with Dartmouth faculty about `` teaching Ferguson . '' By the end of Wilson 's two-hour workshop , faculty members were already brainstorming how to integrate the events and the response into coursework and campus life .

The result was a teaching collective that draws faculty from geography , history , English , math and other areas , and the idea for an interdisciplinary course crafted and taught by all of them . The course is also expected to draw outside speakers and to explore ways to engage the community beyond parading professors in front of lecture halls .

`` There is a special energy around this , '' said Abigail Neely , an assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth . `` It 's designed to transgress the boundaries between disciplines in an effort to do some really deep , sustained critical thinking about some of the most important issues in the country and world at this moment . ''

The course came together quickly with support from college leaders and Dartmouth 's African and African-American Studies Program , Neely and Bahng said . Enrollment opens on Friday , but faculty members are still finalizing the syllabus and deciding how many students will be admitted .

An early lesson is expected to focus on St. Louis and its racial history . Another will consider poetry , prose , music and religious sermons . Still others will look at how events in Ferguson were documented through different media and how black activism has evolved , `` from hip-hop to hashtags . ''

As word spread about the course , there 's been an outpouring of support on campus , Bahng and Neely said . Far more than 10 faculty have signed on -- as of Wednesday , 21 are `` thinking together , teaching together , working together '' -- and students have approached to ask whether they can sit in on the course , even if they are n't enrolled .

In planning the course , `` we 've already begun the work as a teaching collective , '' Neely said . `` I 'm so excited to see what happens when the students join . ''
