The drive from Tallinn to Auvere in North-Eastern Estonia was long and dark . The winter sun had yet to rise and we saw little of the outside world from our misty car windows .

But as we arrived at Narva , Estonia 's border with Russia , a picture began to form of the economic strength of this region . In front of us , swaths of land were being bitten into and scooped up by colossal Soviet diggers .

That 's because underneath this grey-brown land is a soft-brown sedimentary rock that is rich in oil .

But unlike shale oil and shale gas which is drilled and often associated with fracking , oil shale is found in rocks just 30 metres underground .

The rock is blasted and crushed , before releasing oil when heated . It will then be burned to create electric power or processed even further to produce liquid fuel .

They have so much of the stuff here -- 18 million tonnes are mined here every year -- that they are completely energy independent .

Eesti Energia 's CEO , Sandor Liive , tells me that around 90 % of the power produced in Estonia is made of oil shale and they even have enough to provide for their neighbors .

`` Our production of electricity in Estonia is 11 terrawatts . Estonia consumes less than eight terrawats , so we are a very strong electricity exporter today . ''

But this is not a new industry for Estonia .

They have been squeezing rocks here for a century and , now that they 're making money , companies such as Eesti Energia are investing heavily on new plants , Liive told me .

`` Commercial utilization of oil shale started nearly 100 years ago . Estonia got our independence in 1918 and actually Estonia independence is very much close links with the oil shale industry , because in 1924 we already had oil plants in operation , and even gasoline was produced , '' he said .

`` As you can see from here , during last three years , we have invested one billion euros here . So this is not only 100 years of history but this is actually modernization and continuous development of technology and new investments . ''

During our visit here , one of their proudest achievements -- the Enefit 280 oil shale plant , which will double output of kerogen oil -- was already taking shape .

But talk of new plants , more open-cast pits and more shifting of land makes environmentalist cringe . Valdur Lahtvee is one of those calling for Estonia to ditch this primitive way of mining , arguing that there are enough renewable resources in the country to have 100 % power supply based on renewables .

He should know -- he used to work at Eesti Energia . Now , he 's the Director of Climate and Energy Programme at Stockholm 's Environment Institute .

`` Oil shale is the dirtiest fuel used today in European Union . The external cost of the oil shale power is 18 euro cents , coal is about is 10 cents per kw hour , wind is 0.4 euro cents -- that gives you a picture of the ecological footprint of the oil shale used , '' he told me .

`` Oil shale industry contributes approximately 4 % of Estonia 's GDP , but , at the same time , total national emissions it provides 90 % of the hazardous waste , about 80 % of the major air emissions and 70/80 % of the water used . So , it has a really huge impact to the environment . ''

It 's a charge that I put to Eesti Energia 's CEO who counter-argued by telling me that for the land they shift is replanted with trees .

One thing is very clear , the environmental impact is very predictable . Off course , we mine , we have some mining impact -- we move the land , but we put it back and we plant a lot of trees . I think in -LSB- the -RSB- energy business anyway , and in any industry , -LSB- there is -RSB- an environmental impact , even in the wind turbine has an environmental impact . ''

He continued : `` Yes , they do n't emit Co2 in the place where you produce electricity but you know a lot of environmental impact has been done getting metals , transporting it and building it . I think it 's very important in the oil shale case that you know what you get , you know that this environmental impact is very predictable . ''

The problem is Estonia wo n't want to let go of its oil shale dependence , because it 's competitive . It 's cheaper than Russian gas , onshore and offshore wind . On top of that , it would cost companies too much to change their Soviet infrastructure .

And then there is political pressure , Lahtvee told me . `` There is biomass , there is a nice wind condition , we are a coastal country , by the Baltic sea so there is a lot of wind . But mainly the question is we have inherited these power production systems , these power plants ; it 's much more costly to replace . ''

Lahtvee pointed to political pressure , too . `` Elections are every four years , and the voters will ask what will happen with their electricity or their energy costs . Politicians always try to answer that `` we keep the power prices down . '' Therefore , the system stays without major changes . ''

But these advantages may not last . Estonia 's oil shale gamble assumes that oil prices will remain high , and that the price they pay the European Union for carbon emissions remains low .

This may be the case -LRB- carbon is hovering around four euros a tonne -RRB- . But some in the European parliament are calling for prices to be pushed back up as much as fifty euros a tonne , a price that could be damaging for a business like this one which has built itself mostly on shale .

While Liive may be worried about oil prices and emission costs , he tells me it 's not enough to make him lose sleep .

So , for the time being , Eesti Energia is powering on . Its international arm Enefit is betting on shale selling beyond its borders , with a plant in Jordan and recently bought land in the U.S. state of Utah .

A risky strategy . But if shale does stay strong , Estonia could win big .
