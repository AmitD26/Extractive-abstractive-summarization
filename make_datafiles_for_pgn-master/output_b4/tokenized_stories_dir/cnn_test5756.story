Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Pennsylvania woman has been indicted for conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and kill a person in a foreign country , the Justice Department announced Tuesday .

Colleen LaRose , known as `` Jihad Jane '' and `` Fatima LaRose , '' has also been charged with making false statements to a government official and attempted identity theft .

She was arrested in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , on October 15 , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney 's Office said . No arraignment date has been set , the official said .

LaRose is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia , according to the U.S. Attorney 's Office .

LaRose and five unindicted co-conspirators recruited men on the Internet `` to wage violent jihad in South Asia and Europe , and recruited women on the Internet who had passports and the ability to travel to and around Europe in support of violent jihad , '' according to a Justice Department statement .

If convicted , LaRose faces a possible life prison sentence and a $ 1 million fine , the statement said .

The conspiracy began in June 2008 , when LaRose posted a comment on YouTube under the username JihadJane saying she is `` desperate to do something somehow to help '' Muslims , according to the indictment unsealed Tuesday .

From December 2008 to October 2009 , LaRose engaged in electronic communication with the five co-conspirators about their shared desires to wage jihad and become martyrs , according to the indictment .

LaRose and the co-conspirators , according to the statement , used the Internet to establish relationships with each another and develop plans `` which included martyring themselves , soliciting funds for terrorists , soliciting passports and avoiding travel restrictions -LRB- through the collection of passports and through marriage -RRB- in order to wage violent jihad . ''

According to a U.S. government official familiar with the case , LaRose was successful in recruiting some people to join the cause . She also was able to raise money , the official said , adding that she was in contact with committed jihadists in South Asia , Western Europe and Eastern Europe . The official declined to link her to any specific terrorist organizations .

LaRose , the indictment claims , stole a U.S. passport at one point in order to `` facilitate an act of international terrorism . ''

She received `` a direct order to kill a citizen and resident of Sweden , and to do so in a way that would frighten ` the whole Kufar -LSB- non-believer -RSB- world . ' ''

The indictment does not identify the Swedish resident , but a government official familiar with the case acknowledged that Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks was the intended target . Justice Department officials declined to comment .

`` I will make this my goal till I achieve it or die trying , '' LaRose said via electronic communication , according to the indictment .

LaRose , along with the co-conspirators , believed that `` her appearance and American citizenship would help her blend in while carrying out her plans , calling it a possible `` way to achieve what is in my heart , '' according to the indictment .

The indictment alleges that LaRose even agreed to marry one of the co-conspirators to obtain residency status in a European country .

LaRose traveled to Europe in August and `` tracked the intended target online in an effort to complete her task , '' the statement said .

According to the indictment , LaRose told the co-conspirator who ordered the murder that she considers it an `` honour & a great pleasure to die or kill for '' the co-conspirator and pledged that `` only death will stop me here that I am so close to the target . ''

The killing did not occur , and LaRose was arrested about two weeks after the electronic message was sent .

Mark Wilson , a federal public defender representing LaRose , declined to comment on the case Tuesday .

LaRose , according to the Justice Department , was born in 1963 and lives outside Philadelphia in Montgomery County , Pennsylvania .
