One moment , a man reaches into his vehicle after a South Carolina trooper asked for his driver 's license .

Seconds later , the trooper shoots him , and the man asks why . Days afterward , prosecutors are n't satisfied with the answer .

Authorities released dash-camera video Wednesday showing what they say is Sean Groubert , a decorated South Carolina Highway Patrol trooper , shooting Levar Jones , who was unarmed , in the parking lot of a gas station just outside Columbia on September 4 .

Jones , 35 , survived the shooting . But Groubert , who has since been fired for the incident , has been charged with aggravated assault and battery , a felony that could get him up to 20 years in prison if convicted , the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said Wednesday .

`` The force administered in this case was unwarranted , inconsistent with how our troopers are trained , and clearly in violation of department policies , '' South Carolina Public Safety Director Leroy Smith said last week in announcing Groubert 's firing .

This was n't the first time Groubert had fired his weapon . He was lauded the previous time : His department gave him a medal of valor for an incident in which he and another trooper shot and injured a man who had shot at them in 2012 , SCPSD spokeswoman Sherri Iacobelli said .

` Why did you shoot me ? '

In this year 's incident , police said Groubert , 31 , stopped Jones in the parking lot of a Circle K station in daylight , for what police say was an alleged seat belt violation , around 5 p.m.

Video that authorities say was recorded from Groubert 's police car shows the trooper driving up to a vehicle just as its driver -- who authorities say is Jones -- steps out of the vehicle .

When Groubert asks for Jones ' license , Jones pivots toward the vehicle he just exited -- the driver 's door is still open -- and leans inside as if to retrieve something , the video shows .

About two seconds later , the trooper that police identify as Groubert comes into view with a gun drawn and yells `` Get out of the car ! Get out of the car ! '' The gun is fired -- at least four shots are heard -- and Jones steps away from the vehicle , raising his hands in the air and eventually moving off camera .

`` I just got my license ! You said get my license ! '' says someone off camera , apparently Jones .

After being told to put his hands behind his back , Jones asks : `` What did I do , sir ? ''

`` Are you hit ? '' asks another off-camera voice , apparently Groubert 's .

`` I think so , '' comes the response . `` I ca n't feel my leg . I do n't know what happened . ''

The conversation continues :

`` Why did you shoot me ? ''

`` Well , you dove head-first back into your car . Then you -LRB- unintelligible -RRB- , I 'm telling you get out of your car . ''

Shot in the hip

Jones was shot in the hip , CNN affiliate WACH reported . He was taken to a hospital and later released , authorities said .

Jones was found not to be armed , Smith said .

`` I believe this case was an isolated incident in which Mr. Groubert reacted to a perceived threat where there was none , '' Smith said last week .

In a court hearing Wednesday night , a judge ordered Groubert held with bond set at $ 75,000 , WACH reported .

CNN 's attempts to reach Groubert 's and Jones ' lawyers were n't immediately successful .

In explaining Groubert 's firing Friday , Smith said the department 's policy on using force says that officers can use `` only the level of force necessary to accomplish lawful objectives . ''

`` That protocol was not followed in this case . Further , this incident occurred in broad daylight . Mr. Groubert had a clear and unobstructed view of Mr. Jones , '' Smith said .

The shooting , Smith said , `` deviates from SCDPS standards and can not be tolerated . ''

Medal of valor

Groubert , who joined the Highway Patrol in 2005 , earned kudos for the other time he 'd fired his gun in the line of duty .

Police said Groubert stopped a car that had passed him at a high rate of speed in Richland County in August 2012 . The driver eventually took off without permission , and Groubert pursued him , police said .

Another trooper joined the pursuit , and the driver stopped at a bank , exited his vehicle and fired shots at both troopers in the parking lot , police said .

Groubert and the other trooper returned fire , injuring the suspect , the SCDPS said . At some point , it appeared that the suspect intended to go inside the bank , Iacobelli said .

That suspect was charged with attempted murder and convicted in 2013 , according to the SCDPS .

The SCDPS gave Groubert a medal of valor in 2013 for his handling of the incident , Iacobelli said .
