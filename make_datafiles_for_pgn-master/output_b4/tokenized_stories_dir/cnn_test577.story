-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The current round of fighting between Hamas and Israel will eventually stop . When it does , grieving and exhausted Israelis and Palestinians will still be neighbors . Their differences will remain .

The aftershocks of this war will reverberate not just in Gaza , the West Bank and Israel , but also in the streets of Cairo and Riyadh , in the cafes and living rooms of Paris , in the foreign ministries of Arab countries and in the meetings rooms of the U.S. State Department . This war has exposed damaged nerves , deep prejudices and flawed policies .

Here are five places where we will see the impact after the fighting stops .

Israel

As Israelis were taking cover from Hamas rockets and the Gaza-based Islamist group announced it was also targeting planes flying in and out of Israel 's main airport , a television anchor in Lebanon offered a most unhelpful suggestion . Iran , she said , should give nuclear weapons to Hamas to fight Israel . Meanwhile , Iran 's Supreme Leader reiterated his wish to see Israel wiped away .

These messages remind Israelis of the seriousness of their situation . Hamas has no interest in a two-state solution . It is committed to obliterating Israel . Israelis do have disagreements regarding settlements and withdrawal from the West Bank . But when it comes to Hamas , there is no question . The Hamas charter reads : `` Our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious . ''

As the writer David Grossman put it , leftist Israelis now see that `` the right wing 's fears are not mere paranoia , '' and the right will see that there are limits to the use of force .

This fight will erode the position of the extreme left and the extreme right in Israel , giving a boost to pragmatic advocates of security . The debate will revive calls to find other options and strengthen more moderate forces among Palestinians who have lost ground to Hamas .

The imperative to find a new way forward with moderate Palestinians will re-emerge after frayed nerves cool . But an old obstacle has grown : Israelis ' greatest fear is a Palestinian state falling to extremists , as Gaza did to Hamas , receiving weapons from Iran and others . There is no way Israelis will now accept an armed Palestinian state within tunneling distance of its major cities , especially if Hamas remains a dangerous player .

Palestine

Hamas ' bravado and its killing of Israelis may give a popularity boost to the group . But Palestinians are pondering Hamas 's tactics . They will blame primarily Israel , no question , but they will take a look at the Hamas strategy that resulted in so much death and destruction .

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was one of the first to say it publicly . When Israel was warning Hamas to stop the rocket fire that triggered a ground assault , Abbas sounded exasperated . `` What are you trying to achieve launching rockets ? '' he asked Hamas , adding , `` We prefer to fight with wisdom . ''

With Hamas fighters hidden in tunnels , drawing Israeli fire to civilian areas , no matter how much you hate your enemy , is a tactic that warrants examination if not outright condemnation .

In a stark shift from previous conflicts , criticism of Hamas was widespread in Arab media . Egyptian journalists , in particular , fulminated against Hamas .

Europe

The suffering of the Palestinian population of Gaza has been a heartbreaking aspect of this conflict , and it 's hardly surprising that it spurred protests , particularly in cities with large Muslim populations . But what happened in a number of European cities in France , Germany , Belgium , the Netherlands and elsewhere was something that goes far beyond a show of sympathy for the victims of war or a rejection of Israel 's tactics .

Europe saw some of the ugliest eruptions of blatant anti-Semitism since the 1940s . Critics of Israel often claim that Israel unfairly hides from critics by charging anti-Semitism , but cries of `` death to the Jews , '' `` slit the Jews throats , '' or `` Jews to the gas chambers '' along with the smashing and torching of Jewish-owned shops and attacks on synagogues , have pulled back the cover , revealing anti-Jewish sentiment that still runs deep , and in most cases remains unspoken in polite circles . We will find out how seriously European leaders address the matter now that we have found what lay hidden behind the curtain of civil discourse .

Middle East

The Israel-Hamas war has highlighted the emerging ideological and political alliances of a new Middle East . Turkey and Qatar have emerged as the champions of Hamas . Their support for the Muslim Brotherhood during the Arab Spring became increasingly bold . Now the two countries have become the defenders of Islamist groups across the region , drawing the ire of other Arab governments .

Advocating for Islamists in Gaza is particularly beneficial to their political objectives , because the Palestinian cause draws popular support . That 's why Egypt 's decision to stand back is so remarkable . Egypt under its new government has taken a firm stance against Hamas and increasingly clashes with its supporters , particularly with Turkey . These political alliances complicate matters for the Washington .

United States

The fighting in Gaza , with the dramatic pictures of Palestinians civilian deaths and thousands of rockets fired by Hamas towards Israeli civilians , has caused a diplomatic conundrum for Washington . Israel is America 's foremost ally in the region . But President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have disagreements . Instead of taking a firm stance on Israel 's side , the United States has engaged in diplomacy with Qatar , which supports Israel 's deadliest enemies , and Turkey , whose leaders have slandered and smeared Israel .

Details of the diplomatic process , which amazingly excluded Palestinian moderates , have caused consternation in Israel , fury in Palestinian circles and disdain in Egypt . When the cease-fire comes , the United States should review how it balances allies and their antagonists in times of crisis , because even after the shooting stops , this conflict is far from over .
