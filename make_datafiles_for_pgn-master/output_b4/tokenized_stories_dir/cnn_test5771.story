-LRB- CNN -RRB- Its a high stakes game of stick or twist with billions of dollars at stake .

Traditionally at this time of year , a clutch of nervous owners in charge of struggling clubs in England 's top flight grapple with the prospect of relegation , and the enormous hole it threatens to blow in their finances .

Do they stick by a floundering manager hoping he can regroup and lead his team out of the mire , or do they get rid and hope the appointment of new coach can transform its fortunes ?

On Monday , Sunderland 's American owner Ellis Short elected to twist and fired the club 's Uruguayan manager Gus Poyet , confirmed by a statement on its official website .

Less than a year ago Poyet masterminded a miraculous run of form that saw the north east outfit triumph at Chelsea and Manchester United in order to stave off the threat of demotion .

Now that task is for someone else as Short and Sunderland try to protect the cool $ 106m it pocketed last season , with one eye on the new television deal in 2016 that 's worth over $ 7.8 billion to the Premier League 's 20 clubs .

`` It 's inevitable Sunderland will have been thinking about money , '' Simon Chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at Coventry University , told CNN .

`` Particularly television money , because it now accounts for over 50 % of most , if not all , Premier League clubs ' turnover .

`` It 'd be very easy to say they are thinking long term about money and long term about the next television contract but in reality , very often it is short term thinking .

`` Whilst I 'm sure Sunderland are mindful of what 's going to happen in 2016 , they 'll be even more mindful of what 's going to happen in the summer of 2015 if they go down . ''

The tipping point came Saturday when fellow strugglers Aston Villa fired in four unanswered first-half goals against Sunderland , having scored four away goals in its previous 14 Premier League matches .

Some fans streamed out of the Stadium of Light before halftime while one group tried to storm the home dugout to confront Poyet .

It left Sunderland just one point away from the drop zone and was enough to convince billionaire Short to swing the axe , the financial implications no doubt rattling round his mind .

Even though Cardiff City , which finished bottom of the Premier League last season , still banked $ 92.1 m for its efforts , the disparity between tiers one and two in England is vast .

`` Most obviously , the TV revenues from the Premier League deal , '' Chadwick answered when asked what Sunderland stands to lose if it does fall through the trapdoor .

`` Also attendances tend to diminish rapidly so your two biggest sources of revenue are almost instantaneously undermined .

`` I would n't want to put a figure on it but you 're talking tens of millions heading up towards potentially hundreds of millions . ''

Ironically , Aston Villa were marshaled to victory on Saturday by its new manager Tim Sherwood , installed in the wake of Paul Lambert 's sacking in February .

Villa 's American owner Randy Lerner , who is in the process of trying to sell the club , decided to act after a miserable run of form that saw them score just 12 goals in its opening 25 EPL matches .

After Saturday 's win , the Birmingham club is now three points clear of the relegation places and Short will be hoping for a similar bounce when he appoints a new man .

According to Chadwick , research shows a change of manager at this late stage of the campaign can provide all-important impetus , but he argues there are few `` impact managers '' available at present .

And he suggests the approach of Short and Lerner proves American owners still do n't fully understand the dynamic of English football as well as they perhaps should .

`` It 's easy to succumb to fan pressure and results but there 's a particular culture in football generally -- obviously inside clubs as well -- and I 'm not sure American owners are in tune with that , '' he said .

`` We 've seen it with Aston Villa -- this is probably a prime example of an owner that many people speak highly of even now but I do n't think they understand local communities or the somewhat parochial nature sometimes of English football still .

`` So they are making decisions that are not entirely culturally consistent with their experiences and the experiences of English football clubs . ''

Chadwick also says the bumper television revenue afforded to clubs in modern football has created a tiered Premier League in which few teams outside the established giants can realistically expect to compete at the top end .

`` In one sense , it 's always been like this , '' he said . `` You go back to the 1980s when Liverpool were dominant -- some teams knew they were n't going to be champions .

`` I think the television revenues have cemented that position of the dominant teams .

`` Whilst the Premier League would argue it 's a progressive system in the sense that the collective deal does allocate finances to clubs that perhaps those in Spain do n't have , even so , such is the magnitude of the payments made to the achieving clubs its almost inevitable you will get the likes of Manchester United , Arsenal and the rest dominating .

`` For the likes of the north east clubs Sunderland , Newcastle and Middlesbrough it is great if they can get there , even better if they can stay there . ''
