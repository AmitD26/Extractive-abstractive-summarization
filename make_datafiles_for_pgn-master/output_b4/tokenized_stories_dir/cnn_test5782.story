LONDON , England -- UEFA has punished Benfica midfielder Augustin Binya with a six-match European ban following his horror tackle on Celtic 's Scott Brown last week .

Augustin Binya , right , lunges towards Celtic midfielder Scott Brown during Benfica 's 1-0 defeat in Glasgow .

The Cameroon international was sent off for the challenge in his side 's 1-0 defeat in the Champions League match in Glasgow last Wednesday .

Scotland international Brown avoided injury , but claimed Binya had tried to break his leg with the tackle in the 85th minute -- and demanded that Europe 's governing body take further action .

Binya , 24 , apologized for the challenge -- described by officiating referee Martin Hansson of Sweden as one of the worst he had ever seen -- on the day after the match .

But UEFA 's control and disciplinary body announced their sanction on Friday morning , having deliberated on the case on Thursday .

In a statement on uefa.com , Binya 's challenge was described as one which `` seriously endangered the physical health of the opposing player '' .

Benfica can appeal against the ban , which rules Binya out of the Portuguese club 's remaining Group D matches against AC Milan and Shakhtar Donetsk .

If unsuccessful , he will also miss any matches in the knockout stages of the Champions League or UEFA Cup .

The suspension will also carry over to future seasons if , as seems likely , Benfica finish bottom of Group D and bow out of Europe for this campaign .

Brown , who has been passed fit for Scotland 's Euro 2008 qualifier against Italy , said straight after the Benfica match : `` He obviously tried to do me as hard as possible . ''

It is the second time that UEFA has had to intervene following an incident involving Celtic this season .

AC Milan keeper Dida was handed a two-match ban , subsequently reduced to one on appeal , after collapsing theatrically when a fan of the Scottish club invaded the pitch and lightly slapped the Brazilian in the face .

Celtic were fined $ 50,000 and barred the supporter for life . E-mail to a friend
