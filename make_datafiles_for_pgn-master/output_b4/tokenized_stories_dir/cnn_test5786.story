BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A top Iraqi political figure -- who also is an imam at a prominent Shiite mosque in the capital -- urged the abolition of militias Friday and decried violence and pervasive corruption in Baghdad 's Sadr City .

Sheikh Jalal al-Din Ali al-Saghir is a parliament member and a representative of the most influential Shiite cleric .

Sheikh Jalal al-Din Ali al-Saghir , speaking at Buratha Mosque , blamed the corruption on followers of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr .

Al-Saghir is the most senior representative in Baghdad of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani , arguably the most influential Shiite cleric in Iraq . As a member of Iraq 's parliament , Al-Saghir represents the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , part of the ruling United Iraqi Alliance .

His political group dominates the Iraqi security forces and has been fighting members of a rival Shiite group , al-Sadr 's Mehdi Army militia .

He said the Supreme Council , part of the ruling United Iraqi Alliance , once had an armed group called the Badr Brigade that is now a renamed non-military organization . He repeated Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki 's call for all armed groups not affiliated with the government to disband .

`` We said from the beginning , and since 2003 , the necessity of laying down the weapons by all , and the weapons should be in the hand of the state , '' al-Saghir said .

He praised Iraqi security forces ' efforts in Basra , the southern Shiite city where al-Maliki launched an offensive in March . The cleric said al-Maliki freed the region of gangs .

`` We can say that the Iraqi security forces have made a great change in terms of establishing the security and imposing the law , '' al-Saghir said , adding that effective security must be imposed to ensure the fairness of this autumn 's provincial elections .

`` The elections will be tomorrow , '' he said , meaning soon . `` How can we respect ourselves as politicians , political parties and officials within the government ? How can we respect ourselves by saying we conduct honest elections while there are gangs controlling areas or provinces ? ''

Meanwhile , Sadrist cleric Suhail al-Iqabi delivered a fiery sermon in the eastern part of Baghdad as hundreds of Sadr City residents sat on the street performing Friday prayers . Al-Iqabi said an `` act of genocide '' is taking place in the town .

Speaking to hundreds of worshippers chanting pro-Sadr slogans , al-Iqabi accused the government of holding a grudge against Sadrists and the people of Sadr City `` who are facing genocide in every sense of the word , cutting off the water , electricity and shelling the innocent civilians , killing women and children and detaining women . ''

His sermon included a prayer asking God to strengthen al-Sadr 's Mehdi army and `` sharpen their weapons . ''

`` What the prime minister stated in his press conference , all that he said that was so far from reality , the nonsense and false accusations he used to cover up his huge failure leading the nation 's affairs , '' al-Iqabi said . '' ... We call on all politicians , journalists , intellectuals , civil society institutions , tribal leaders and clergy to visit Sadr City to witness the crimes committed by the occupier and government forces . ''

In Sadr City , nearly 1,000 civilians and fighters are thought to have been killed since late March in fighting between security forces and Shiite militants . However , al-Saghir said there has been `` good security progress . '' Watch as fighting destroys a school ''

`` I believe the coming days will witness many developments which will lead to the protection of this city from these gangs , '' he said .

He urged people who have grievances to make their voices heard through the political process . He decried those who arm themselves under the pretext of sectarianism or occupation .

Al-Saghir emphasized what he called corruption in Sadr City and the role of Sadrist followers in promoting it .

He noted that imams from the Supreme Council were booted from several mosques and replaced by politically correct imams , and he said companies have to pay off the Sadrists to get contracts . He said fuel tanker drivers face the risk of losing their trucks to fire or theft if they do n't pay off political groups .

Meanwhile Friday , a U.S. soldier was killed in Baghdad after a roadside bomb struck the soldier 's vehicle , the military said .

The soldier was part of a combat patrol in eastern Baghdad when a roadside bomb struck the patrol vehicle at about 6:15 p.m. local time .

The soldier 's name is being withheld until family has been notified , the U.S. army 's public affairs department in Baghdad said .

Also Friday , the U.S. military said one of the two suicide bombers who struck a wedding convoy this week in northern Iraq was a woman `` imitating pregnancy . ''

The military blamed the Sunni militant group al Qaeda in Iraq for Thursdays ' attack that killed 35 people and wounded dozens more in Balad Ruz , a town northeast of Baghdad in the volatile Diyala province .

The U.S. military announced Friday that a U.S. Air Force drone crashed in southern Iraq , and investigators suspect mechanical failure . The MQ-1 Predator drone was used mainly for reconnaissance , the military said .

On Thursday , Iraqi lawmakers were in Iran to confront officials there with evidence of Tehran 's support for militias and outlaws in Iraq , Iraqi officials said .

Iran 's state-run news agency IRNA confirmed the delegation was in Tehran .

Parliament members from the ruling United Iraqi Alliance , the Shiite coalition , intended to discuss how the training and arming of militias is harmful for Iraq -- and for Iran as a neighbor , said Sami al-Askari , an adviser to al-Maliki .

Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman said the delegation intended to provide evidence , confessions and pictures indicating that Iran is supplying weapons and training fighters inside Iraq .

Bush administration officials have said Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ' Quds Force has provided training and weapons for militants in Iraq . E-mail to a friend
