-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two fishermen remain missing after a commercial fishing vessel went down in frigid , treacherous waters off the Aleutian Islands about 1,400 miles southwest of Anchorage , Alaska .

The fishing vessel Courageous helps search for missing men in waters off Alaska .

A search for the two crew members of the 93-foot Katmai resumed at daybreak Friday .

An e-mail sent by the doomed fishing boat to a nearby vessel said it was taking on water in the rear , where the steering was housed , the Coast Guard told The Associated Press on Thursday .

Four of the boat 's crew members were rescued and five bodies retrieved Wednesday near the Amchitka Pass , a strait that connects the Bering Sea to the Pacific Ocean .

The names have been withheld pending the notification of families , a Coast Guard statement said .

`` What can you say ? '' said Jeff DeBell , chief financial officer of Katmai Fisheries , which owned the boat .

He told The AP , `` We are devastated by what has happened . We are elated there have been survivors . We are just terribly saddened by the ones that are dead and are praying that those that are still in the water are alive . '' Watch rescue footage from the choppy waters ''

The Seattle-based company told the AP the survivors were Capt. Henry Blake and crew members Guy Schroeder , Adam Foster and Harold Attling .

The search began at about 1 a.m. Wednesday when the Coast Guard received an emergency signal from the Katmai , a 93-foot fishing vessel that had been battling 50-knot winds and nearly 20-foot waves .

The signal originated from a wall-mounted satellite positioning device on the Katmai that reacts when it 's touched or splashed with water , Coast Guard Petty Officer Levi Read said . Watch a `` Deadliest Catch '' captain talk about what may have happened on the rough seas ''

At about that time , another vessel , the Blue Balard , sent an e-mail to the Coast Guard saying that it received a message from the Katmai that water was flooding its rear compartment . The message also said that the vessel had lost steering .

The Coast Guard tried to e-mail the Balard back but received no response , likely because the seas are remote and Internet access can be spotty , Read said .

Rescuers launched a C-130 , a long-range surveillance aircraft , and went straight to the scene twice Wednesday morning , Read said . The boat was nowhere in sight , but the C-130 did spot two strobe lights on top of the water , he said .

By this time , the weather was treacherous and the sky was darkening , according to Read . The C-130 , having found no signs of life , dropped two life rafts and headed back , he said .

On the second trip , at 11 a.m. , the C-130 and a Jayhawk helicopter found two strobe lights floating in the water , one attached to a survival suit and the other to the emergency device that had first alerted the Coast Guard , Read said . They also found a body , he said .

`` We knew the person was from the Katmai because the suit he was wearing had the name of the vessel on it , '' Read said .

Roughly five hours later , the Coast Guard spotted four men on a life raft , all wearing survival suits .

With the assistance of other vessels , the Courageous and the Patricia Lee , the bodies of four other men were recovered from the water , all wearing survival suits , Read said .

The odds of someone surviving the frigid waters off Alaska 's Aleutian Islands is minimal , said Read . Crews usually have survival suits that allow water to seep inside but have a mechanism that traps body heat .

The search for the two remaining men began at 9:30 a.m. Alaska time Thursday , an hour before sunrise there .

`` You just could n't do anything earlier , '' Read said . `` It 's darker the farther out you go , and they are really , really out there . ''
