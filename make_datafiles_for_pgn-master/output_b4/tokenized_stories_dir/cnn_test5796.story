MINNEAPOLIS , Minnesota -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Bush surveyed this week 's bridge collapse in Minneapolis , Minnesota , and pledged the government would `` eliminate roadblocks '' and `` cut through paperwork '' to get it rebuilt .

`` I bring prayers from the American people to those who have suffered loss of life as a result of the collapse of the 35W bridge in the Twin Cities . I bring prayers to those who wonder whether they 'll ever see a loved one again , '' Bush said on his visit .

`` I have met with the chief of police and the sheriff and rescue workers -- people who represent men and women working as hard as they possibly can to save life and to find life -- to go under these murky waters to find the facts . And it 's going to take awhile . ''

Shortly after Bush left the site , a diver bobbed in the water and communicated with an attending boat with hand signals .

`` I have been impressed not only by their determination but by their compassion , '' the president said . Watch Bush tour the disaster site ''

`` We want to get this bridge rebuilt as quick as possible . We understand that this is a main artery , '' Bush said . `` People depend on this bridge , on this highway . ''

Bush was accompanied by Transportation Secretary Mary Peters , who pledged that she would do what she could to meet the needs of the city .

On Friday , the chief federal investigator said the south end of the bridge `` behaved differently '' from the rest of the structure during its catastrophic collapse .

National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Mark Rosenker said , based on a video of the collapse and where the bridge debris lies , the southern end shifted 50 feet to the east .

`` And when we compare that to what we 've seen in the rest of the bridge , the rest of the bridge appears to have collapsed in place , '' Rosenker told reporters .

Rosenker cautioned that investigators ' interest in the southern end does not mean they have found the cause of the bridge collapse .

`` What we have is a step forward , '' he said .

`` We believe that as the bridge began to fall , as it began to collapse , it shifted , '' Rosenker said . `` I am not saying that the 50-foot shift created the fall . That is not what we believe . What we believe is whatever created the failure , we also saw a 50-foot shift in the southern end of the structure . ''

Rosenker would not offer any theories on what caused the collapse , saying that would come after the 19 investigators have completed their analysis . See which states have most troubled bridges ''

The 1,907-foot bridge came down Wednesday in a cloud of dust and river water during the evening rush hour .

Divers searched the river throughout Friday , locating 12 submerged or partially submerged vehicles , Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek said . While no bodies were found , two of the vehicles were so badly crushed that divers could not check inside . Five people were confirmed to have died in the collapse . View photos from the disaster ''

`` I 'm hopeful that the death toll will remain low , but I ca n't be absolutely certain , '' Stanek said . `` I can only pray . ''

The Hennepin County medical examiner 's office Friday identified a fifth victim as Paul Eickstadt , 51 , of Mounds View , Minnesota , who was the driver of the tractor-trailer that was ablaze in the immediate aftermath of the collapse . The other four victims were previously identified . E-mail to a friend
