-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Key West 's historic Duval Street reopened Monday morning after a fire swept through a building housing three well-known businesses and temporarily shut down other popular spots on the island city 's main street .

A fire broke out late Sunday night on Duval Street in Key West .

The fire , which started at about 10:30 p.m. Sunday and was contained by 1 a.m. Monday , wiped out a crepe shop , an art gallery and a sign shop . Two firefighters suffered minor injuries , city spokeswoman Alyson Crean said .

The fire department was working Monday to determine the cause of the blaze , Crean said .

Singer Jimmy Buffet 's Margaritaville restaurant and store was one of the businesses initially shut down , halting late-night festivities at the popular watering hole in mid-pour .

`` I was hoping to go back in , finish off my shift and clean up , but they would n't let us back in , '' said waitress Patricija Hambrook . `` It became bigger than we thought .

`` We could n't close out checks , and the drinks we made were never served . ''

Margaritaville 's restaurant reopened Monday afternoon , and its adjacent retail store reopened a few hours later , the fire department said .

In addition to protecting Margaritaville , firefighters kept flames away from the historic San Carlos theater , although the facility 's administrator said that a large broken out window and about 2 inches of water on the floor of the lobby would keep it closed for a few days .

Alex Pascual said he anticipated the theater would reopen by Thursday , in time for a concert scheduled for that evening .

The San Carlos was founded in 1871 and was the site of Cuban patriot Jose Marti 's 1892 speech launching his drive for Cuban independence .

Fire officials initially shut down Duval Street to vehicular traffic but allowed pedestrians to stroll the sidewalks . Traffic restrictions prompted some business owners to be concerned about their livelihoods , at least for the short term .

Robert Porter , assistant manager of Crazy Shirts , was concerned early Monday `` because there are n't any cars driving through . ''

But Banana Republic general manager Darren Paugh said the foot traffic and onlookers curious to see the aftermath of the fire `` should increase business for the day . '' Plus , he said , three cruise ships were in port Monday morning .

And Crean indicated life for tourists wo n't stop in Key West because of the fire .

`` We have a lot of spring breakers on vacation and bikers coming from Bike Week in Daytona , '' Crean said .

All the concern proved unfounded when officials reopened Duval Street at about 10 a.m. Monday morning .

For the owners of the three businesses that took the brunt of the fire , however , it will be some time before it 's business as usual .

`` It 's a big loss for us . And we worked so hard , it 's not fair , '' said La Creperie Cafe owner Yolande Findlay in a story published on the Keynoter newspaper 's Web site Monday . Findlay , according to the paper 's Web site , opened the popular crepe shop with her partner , Sylvie Lenouail , six years ago . Both are from Brittany , France .

The American Royal Art gallery , which specialized in entertainment art , and the sign shop Montage were destroyed in the fire .
