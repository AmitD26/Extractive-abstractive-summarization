LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Singer Chris Brown , sought by Los Angeles police after an alleged domestic violence incident , turned himself in Sunday , police said .

Chris Brown attends a party saluting music producer Clive Davis in Beverly Hills , California , on Saturday .

Brown , nominated for two Grammy Awards , was a no-show Sunday night at the nationally televised awards show . He was scheduled to perform at the show . His girlfriend , singer Rihanna , abruptly canceled her planned Grammys performance , but neither her spokesman nor the show organizers gave a reason .

`` Rihanna is well , '' her spokesman said in a written statement . `` Thank you for concern and support . ''

Police have not identified the alleged victim , who they said `` suffered visible injuries and identified Brown as her attacker . ''

Brown , 19 , and Rihanna , 20 , were seen together Saturday night at a pre-Grammys dinner at the Beverly Hills Hilton , about five miles from where police said the alleged incident happened at 12:30 a.m. Sunday .

The police statement said Brown and a woman were in a vehicle near Hollywood 's Hancock Park when `` they became involved in an argument . ''

`` After stopping his car , Brown and the woman got out and the argument escalated , '' police said .

After receiving a 911 call at about 12:30 a.m. Sunday , officers found the woman at the scene of the alleged fight , but Brown had left , the department said .

Investigators were treating the incident as a possible felony battery case , police said .

Executives with Brown 's record label at the Grammy Awards told CNN they knew nothing about the incident and declined further comment .

Brown was nominated for two Grammys this year , including in the best male R&B vocal performance category for his song `` Take You Down . ''

He also shares a best pop collaboration with vocals nomination with Jordin Sparks for `` No Air . ''

The introduction to the CBS broadcast of the Grammys , apparently pre-taped , listed both Brown and Rihanna as performers .
