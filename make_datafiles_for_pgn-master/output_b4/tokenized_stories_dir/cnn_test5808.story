A television image of Chinonso Ononaku , who died after being given the medicine `` My Pikin . ''

Giving him what they thought was a baby teething medicine , they were in fact dosing him with anti-freeze .

The bottle had been contaminated with a toxic chemical called diethylene glycol .

More than 30 Nigerian children are thought to have died recently after taking the medicine .

Nneka is angry .

`` It 's not easy carrying a pregnancy for nine months , -LSB- and -RSB- after that getting a drug from a pharmacy to kill your own child , '' she says .

When Nigeria 's Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control -LRB- NAFDAC -RRB- tested the medicine , `` My Pikin , '' the results were terrifying .

It found the medicine contained almost 90 ml of diethylene glycol per 100 ml .

`` It 's a bottle of poison , '' the NAFDAC laboratory said .

The `` My Pikin '' factory 's managing director and eight others have been charged with negligence . The company could not be reached for comment .

Nigeria is on the frontline in the global fight against counterfeit drugs .

NAFDAC claims most of the counterfeit drugs come from India and China .

And it 's big business -- America 's Centre for Medicines in the Public Interest predicts counterfeit drug sales will reach $ 75 billion in 2010 .

NAFDAC 's director-general Dora Akunyili warns counterfeiting is not just a Nigerian problem .

`` These criminals are cooperating , so we too need to cooperate if we can face them . Not only in Nigeria but internationally , because drug counterfeiting involves a trans-national criminal network and can only be dismantled through international co-operation . ''
