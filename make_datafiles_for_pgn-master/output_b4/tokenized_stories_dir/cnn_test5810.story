PARIS , France -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Opposition lawmakers Tuesday ridiculed President Nicolas Sarkozy for taking France back into NATO 's military command after more than 40 years , but were unable to stop the move when it came to a vote .

The National Assembly voted in favor of Sarkozy 's plan , 329-238 .

Socialist Laurent Fabius , a former prime minister , told Prime Minister Francois Fillon : `` You tell us this would mean more independence and more influence . It would probably mean less independence and less influence . ''

The move did not technically require parliamentary approval , but the president 's party scheduled the debate to give opponents a chance to voice their opinions -- and to show a majority backed it .

Asking the National Assembly to vote on the issue also showed how sensitive the matter is in France .

France was a founding member of the NATO alliance in 1949 but it left the military structure in 1966 amid friction with the United States .

`` To cooperate is to lose your independence , '' French President Charles de Gaulle said at the time .

For the next 43 years , even though France selectively participated in NATO military operations , de Gaulle 's principle remained the governing cornerstone of French foreign policy .

If Paris took orders from NATO military commanders , it was reasoned , the nation would no longer have complete control of its destiny .

Sarkozy , however , believes the opposite -- that cooperation in NATO is a guarantee of French independence .

Rejoining NATO 's military command , he argued , will give France a seat at the table for decision-making .

From its earliest years , the organization 's trans-Atlantic ties were strained because U.S. analysts warned that if the European allies failed to increase their contributions to the alliance , they risked losing the support of the United States , according to NATO .

Meanwhile , the European nations felt the United States was trying to dominate the organization , according to NATO .

De Gaulle 's 1966 decision meant no French forces could be under permanent allied command and that France would have no participation in defense planning .

In 1995 , France rejoined NATO 's military committee , which advises NATO 's political authorities on military policy and strategy and provides guidance on military matters to NATO 's strategic commanders .

While France was still not a part of the military command , it contributed troops and funding to NATO activities , including actions in Kosovo and Afghanistan . Half of all French troops outside the country are assigned to NATO military operations .

Opponents of Sarkozy 's move -- who include some members of his party -- believe de Gaulle , not Sarkozy , had it right . They started a last-minute petition drive to stop his march back into NATO .

`` With this decision , France will return as a subordinate country and will lose its ability to represent another image in the world , '' said Nicolas Dupont-Aignan , a member of the French National Assembly .

The president 's allies calculate Sarkozy 's move will strengthen Europe 's hand on defense issues .

`` There will be more European weight in the way decisions will be made , '' said Louis Giscard d'Estaing , a member of the National Assembly 's U.S. Friendship Committee . `` Therefore , the balance of power between the USA and Europe will be re-established within this French move . ''
