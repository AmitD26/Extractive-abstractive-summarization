ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Conflict raged Wednesday in volatile northwestern Pakistan , with nine militants killed in a gun battle , the Taliban 's abduction and release of about 30 police officers , and strikes on stranded NATO trucks .

It 's the latest fighting between Pakistani security forces and the Taliban militants in the northwestern region near Afghanistan .

The country 's central government has little control in the area , and U.S. intelligence officials say the area is a haven for militants .

Nine militants were killed when police and local residents foiled an attempted kidnapping of the mayor in a village on the outskirts of Peshawar , police told CNN . Taliban fighters attempted to abduct Fahim Ur Rehman , but police and residents resisted and a gun battle ensued .

Along with the slain militants , two police and two civilians were wounded and some of the militants fled . The village , Bazid Khel , is located between Peshawar and the Khyber Agency in the tribal areas .

In the Swat Valley , militants abducted around 30 police Tuesday night but eventually released them on Wednesday . Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan confirmed to CNN that the personnel had been released after returning to the path of Islam and promising not to return to their jobs .

Police told CNN that the security personnel had been forced to agree to the Taliban 's terms and confirmed the release .

There are conflicting details about the incident , in which Taliban forces attacked the Shamozai check post in the Barikot area of Swat Valley on Tuesday night and captured the people after a nightlong firefight .

Khan said the personnel surrendered after Taliban forces mined the area , preventing access . He said their ammunition was seized when supply vehicles coming to assist government forces were stopped by Taliban mines .

Pakistan police said the security personnel did n't surrender ; they were caught after they used up their ammunition . Police and military sources said the personnel were police , but Khan said paramilitary officers as well as police were among the group . Locals said government forces came under attack Tuesday evening and ran out of ammunition before surrendering .

This comes as the Pakistani military beefed up its operations this week in the Swat Valley .

In the latest in a series of recent attacks meant to choke off supplies into Afghanistan for the United States and its allies , a rocket strike destroyed at least nine vehicles near the town Landi Kotal in the Khyber Agency -- one of seven semiautonomous tribal agencies along the Afghan border , a Khyber official told CNN .

The trucks were returning from Afghanistan but were stranded in the town because , a day earlier , suspected militants had destroyed a bridge connecting Landi Kotal to Jamrod , another part of the Khyber Agency .

The bridge 's destruction had forced authorities to halt traffic .

Because Afghanistan is landlocked , many of the supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants there have to be trucked from Pakistan . In recent months , militants aligned with the Taliban and al Qaeda have carried out several attacks to disrupt supplies , Pakistani officials said .
