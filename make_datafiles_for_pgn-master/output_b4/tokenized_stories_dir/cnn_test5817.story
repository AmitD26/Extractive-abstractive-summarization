WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Terror attacks have spiked dramatically in Afghanistan and Pakistan as extremists in both countries strengthen their power and expand operations , according to a State Department report released Thursday .

The number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan , like this bombing in April , has more than quadrupled from 2006 to 2008 .

But the State Department annual terrorism report notes an overall decline in attacks worldwide and fewer attacks in Iraq .

The attacks worldwide have decreased by 20 percent , with 30 percent fewer fatalities , said Russell Travers of the National Counterterrorism Center .

The report says al Qaeda and its extremist supporters have moved across the Afghan border `` to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier , where they have used this terrain as a safe haven to hide , train terrorists , communicate with the followers , plot attacks and send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan . ''

In Pakistan alone , the report says , attacks more than quadrupled between 2006 and 2008 , with a sharp increase in their `` coordination , sophistication and frequency . '' Last year there were 1,839 terrorist `` incidents , '' compared with 890 in 2007 , Travers said .

The rise in violence has complicated the Obama administration 's effort to implement its strategy of boosting military and civilian programs in both countries .

The report says the largest number of attacks occurred in Pakistani provinces near the Afghan border , including Balochistan , the North West Frontier and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , where extremists have sought to challenge the government and extend Islamic law .

It also notes the government 's inability to get a handle on the extremists . Despite having 80,000 to 100,000 troops in those provinces , it says , `` the government of Pakistan 's authority in the area continued to be challenged . ''

Ronald Schlicher , the State Department 's acting coordinator of counterterrorism , told reporters the Obama administration has `` real concerns '' that al Qaeda 's senior leadership may be operating from those areas and could be plotting attacks against the United States .

`` We have a real sense that it 's happening , but we have imperfect knowledge of what they 're doing , '' he said .

Pakistan 's military in the past week launched an assault on militants in Taliban-held areas after they seized territory in violation of an agreement signed this year by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari . The deal , criticized by the United States , allowed the Taliban to implement Islamic law , or sharia , in the region in exchange for an end to fighting .

The recent operations are part of the Pakistani army 's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions . The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan . As a result , the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan . The strikes have rankled relations between the two countries .

Pakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters , communication equipment and night-vision technology as part of a U.S. plan to beef up the country 's counterterrorism efforts .

President Obama told reporters Wednesday night that he is `` gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan . ''

Speaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office , Obama said the United States has `` huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable '' and does n't end up a `` nuclear-armed militant state . ''

After making two visits to Pakistan in less than three weeks , Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , is `` very alarmed by the growing extremist threat in Pakistan and remains frustrated particularly by the political leaderships ' inability to confront that threat , '' according to his chief spokesman .

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have called Taliban gains in Pakistan an `` existential threat '' to the country .

The State Department report notes the terrorist attacks in Mumbai , India , in November , attributing them to the Pakistan-based Kashmir terrorist group Laskhar-e-Tayyiba and to its fundraising subsidiary , amaat ud-Dawa . Although Pakistan has cracked down on some of the groups ' camps and made several arrests , the report warned of continuing tension between India and Pakistan .

The report says Afghanistan is plagued by `` an insurgency that more and more relied on vicious and increasingly sophisticated terrorist attacks , '' despite the efforts of NATO forces and the Afghan government .

`` The anti-government insurgency remained a capable , determined and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority , '' the report warns . Although the Taliban continued to suffer heavy combat loses , the report says its ability to leverage support from al Qaeda and recruit soldiers `` remained undiminished . ''

`` Taliban information operations were increasingly aggressive and sophisticated , '' it says . `` Streams of Taliban financing from across the border in Pakistan , along with funds gained from narcotics trafficking , have allowed the insurgency to strengthen its military and technical capabilities . ''

Iran is also a source of training to the Taliban `` on small-unit tactics , small arms , explosives and indirect-fire weapons , '' the report says .

`` Since at least 2006 , Iran has arranged arms shipments including small arms and associated ammunition , rocket-propelled grenades , mortar rounds , 107 mm rockets and plastic explosives to select Taliban members , '' it says .

While terrorists in Iraq still launched attacks last year , `` there was a notable reduction in the number of security incidents throughout much of the country , including a decrease in civilian casualties , enemy attacks , and improvised explosive device attacks in the last quarter of the year , '' the report says .

There were 3,258 terrorist incidents in 2008 , down almost half from the 6,210 attacks in 2007 , Travers said . He added there was a decrease during the first quarter of 2009 , although there has a been a spike in terrorist attacks in April .

Although the threat from al Qaeda in Iraq `` continued to diminish '' due to significant defections and a loss of both territory and funding , al Qaeda continued to benefit from safe haven in Somalia and has strengthened its North African operations , the report says .

It notes a sharp increase in attacks by al Qaeda affiliates in North Africa . In Algeria , many of the attacks were blamed on al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , whose tactics `` appeared to be influenced by -LSB- al Qaeda 's -RSB- experience in Iraq . ''

The report also warns `` the security situation in Yemen continued to deteriorate during 2008 and was marked by a series of attacks against both Western and Yemeni interests , '' culminating in the September 17 suicide bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa that killed 18 .

`` Recruitment for al Qaeda in Yemen -LRB- AQY -RRB- remained strong , and the use of vehicle borne improvised explosive devices -LRB- VBIEDs -RRB- and suicide vests indicated a high level of training , coordination , and sophistication by Yemen 's terrorist leadership , '' the report says .

The report calls the government 's response to the terrorist threat `` intermittent and its ability to pursue and prosecute suspected terrorists remained weak due to a number of shortcomings , including stalled draft counterterrorism legislation . ''

Although a raid in August on an al Qaeda in Yemen cell in the country uncovered large number of weapons , the report warns the action `` did little to deter or disrupt other AQY cells . ''

It was a month later that at least seven assailants dressed in Yemeni security-service uniforms attacked the U.S. Embassy with explosives and suicide vests , launching what the report calls a `` sophisticated and well-coordinated '' attack .

The report says Iran `` remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism , '' including supporting terrorist groups such as Hamas , Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad , all of which opposed the Middle East peace process , as well as Iraq-based militants and the Taliban fighters in Afghanistan .

It cites the Qods Force , an elite branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , as the regime 's `` primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorists abroad . ''

`` Iran 's involvement in the planning and financial support of terrorist attacks throughout the Middle East , Europe and Central Asia had a direct impact on international efforts to promote peace , threatened economic stability in the Gulf , and undermined the growth of democracy , '' the report says .

Schlicher also said that the United States is `` troubled by indications that the Iranians may be seeking to extend their influence into other parts of the world and expand its military ties into Latin America . ''

The Obama administration has adopted a policy of engagement with Iran in an effort to curb its nuclear ambitions .
