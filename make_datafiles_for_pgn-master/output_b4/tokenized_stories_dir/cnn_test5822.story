BEIJING , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Chinese women 's gymnastics team did not use underage competitors during this year 's Summer Olympic Games in Beijing , the International Gymnastics Federation said Wednesday .

Widespread reports claimed that gold medal winner He Kexin was only 14 years old .

The federation said it has concluded its inquiry into the matter after it confirmed the gymnasts ' ages through official documents that the Chinese Gymnasts Association provided . The documents included passports , identity cards and household registers .

However , the organization intends to further investigate the ages of two gymnasts , Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun , who participated in the 2000 summer games in Sydney , Australia . The federation said it did not consider the explanations and evidence that Chinese authorities provided in regard to those athletes as satisfactory .

The International Olympic Committee had asked gymnastics officials to clarify the situation after numerous commentators , bloggers and others questioned whether about half the members of China 's team were old enough to compete . Watch tiny gymnasts work out ''

Athletes must be at least 16 in the year the games take place . In women 's gymnastics , younger girls can have an advantage over older competitors on account of their often smaller , lighter and more agile bodies .

The Chinese women 's gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition at the Beijing games , and five members won individual medals .

One of the challenges came from a blogger known as `` Stryde Hax . '' The blogger claimed to have uncovered proof that Chinese gymnast He Kexin is only 14 .

In Internet searches , `` Stryde Hax '' allegedly uncovered Web pages showing lists complied by China 's General Administration of Sport that show a 1994 date of birth for He .

CNN was not been able to independently verify the information , but snapshots of the Web pages appeared to back up the claim . Other bloggers joined the search and reported similar results .

The New York Times conducted its own investigation , producing similar results that seem to implicate He and two other members of the team . The Times uncovered a 2006 biography on He that lists her birthday as January 1 , 1994 .

The International Gymnastics Federation , however , has said that those gymnasts were eligible and that the ages on their passports were correct .

Chinese gymnastics coaches also defended their team .

`` Asians have different figures than people from the West , so that 's what caused their suspicion , '' said Huang Yubin , head coach of the men 's and women 's teams , referring to media inquiries . `` They should n't be suspicious . ''
