-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two tainted lots of a generic version of a drug reportedly taken by Michael Jackson have been recalled by the drug maker .

However , no link has been established between the drug -- a powerful sedative and anesthetic called propofol -- and the singer 's death .

`` I have no way of knowing anything related to this specific product -- if it might have played a role or not played a role , '' said Dr. Arjun Srinivasan , the chief investigator on the recall for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

The agency is not involved in the investigation into Jackson 's death , he said .

The CDC issued a health advisory Monday , saying two lots of a generic version of the drug had tested positive for endotoxin , a contaminant . The drug maker , Teva Pharmaceuticals , voluntarily recalled the lots .

Srinivasan said the agency received 40 reports of patients around the country developing high fevers and muscle aches after being injected with the drug .

`` All of the cases had high fevers , some muscle aches , headaches , but no issues with heart problems that we were told of , '' he said .

Jackson died June 25 of cardiac arrest . The exact cause of death is pending toxicology results .

All of the people who had taken propofol recovered ; only one was hospitalized and that patient was quickly discharged , he said .

But , he added , `` at high doses , endotoxin can absolutely cause lowered blood pressure and much more serious reactions . ''

`` It can cause decreases in blood pressure , which could precipitate problems with your heart . ''

The manufacturer , Teva Pharmaceuticals , is working with the Food and Drug Administration to determine how the contamination occurred and is voluntarily recalling the affected lots , he said .

A spokeswoman for Teva said about 57,000 vials were included in the recall of the drug , and said the company had been contacted by the Drug Enforcement Administration .

`` I can say the DEA did contact us about a specific lot number , and that lot number is not from the two we are recalling , '' said spokeswoman Denise Bradley .

She would not say whether the contact was related to the Jackson investigation .

A DEA spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment .

The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times , citing unidentified sources , have reported that police found the drug Diprivan , a brand-name version of propofol , among Jackson 's medicines .

A source involved with the probe into Jackson 's death told CNN that investigators found numerous bottles of prescription drugs in his $ 100,000-a-month rented mansion in Holmby Hills , California .

ProPublica , an online news organization , first reported a possible link between Jackson 's death and the drug recall on Tuesday .

But an FDA spokeswoman denied there could have been a link .

`` This is fever , chills , '' said Karen Riley . `` Does that sound like heart failure ? ''

She said at least three companies make the generic version of the drug and only one of them -- AstraZeneca -- makes Diprivan , the brand-name version .

`` We do n't know what was at Michael Jackson 's house , but I 'm guessing it was Diprivan because that 's what the reporting has been , '' Riley said . `` This -LSB- the propofol recall -RSB- was endotoxin in the drug . It would not cause heart failure . ... It 's unrelated . ''

Authorities have said the cause of Jackson 's heart failure will not be determined officially until toxicology tests are complete .
