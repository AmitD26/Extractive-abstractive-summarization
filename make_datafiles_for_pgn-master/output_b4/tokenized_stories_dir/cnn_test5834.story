-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A judge has ordered mediation in the case of a teen girl who says her family threatened to kill her for converting from Islam to Christianity .

Rifqa Bary , 17 , ran away from her family in Columbus , Ohio , in July . She claims her father threatened to kill her .

The 17-year-old girl , Rifqa Bary , ran away from her family in Columbus , Ohio , in July and took refuge in the home of the Rev. Blake Lorenz with the Global Revolution Church in Orlando , Florida .

Bary 's parents want her back home .

At a court hearing Thursday in Orlando , the girl 's parents denied all the allegations against them .

Also at the hearing , Judge Daniel Dawson of the Orange County Juvenile Court ordered the girl and her parents to seek the mediation within 30 days . The judge had previously ruled that the girl will remain in Florida foster care until the allegations are resolved .

The parents , Mohamed and Aysha Bary , could not attend the hearing in person but listened through a telephone conference as their lawyer spoke for them . They denied they ever threatened to kill their daughter because she converted to Christianity .

Mohamed Bary told CNN he believes a lot of false information has been circulated about the case .

`` We would n't do her harm , '' the father said , adding that he knew his daughter was involved with Christian organizations .

`` I have no problem with her practicing any faith , '' he said . But Bary conceded he would have preferred that his daughter practice the Muslim faith first .

The teen had heard of pastor Lorenz and his church through a prayer group on Facebook . The girl 's parents reported her missing to Columbus police , who found her two weeks later in Florida through cell phone records .

The teenager , in a sworn affidavit , claims her father , 47 , was pressured by the mosque the family attends in Ohio to `` deal with the situation . '' In the court filing , Rifqa Bary stated her father said , `` If you have this Jesus in your heart , you are dead to me ! '' The teenager claims her father added , `` I will kill you ! '' Watch the teen talk about her fears ''

Also at Thursday 's hearing , the judge sealed a report on the girl from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and issued a gag order for attorneys in the case .

At one point during the hearing , the girl 's court-appointed guardian , Krista Bartholomew , told the court : `` This is not a holy war but a case about a broken family . ''

Outside the courthouse after the hearing , a Muslim activist and several Christian activists exchanged words over the case . Watch the heated exchanges ''

Another hearing is scheduled for September 29 if the family is not able to resolve the conflict through mediation .
