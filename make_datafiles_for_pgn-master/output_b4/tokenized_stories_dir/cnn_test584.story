In an embarrassing blow to its perception from an increasingly skeptical public , the Nigerian military Thursday retracted a report that nearly all the 129 school girls kidnapped by suspected Boko Haram militants had been released .

Just hours after a parent of an abducted girl claimed the Defense Ministry lied Wednesday about all but eight girls finding freedom , the director of defense said the initial report was `` not intended to deceive the public . ''

Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade 's statement did n't indicate how many of the girls were still unaccounted for .

`` The number of those still missing is not the issue now as the life of every Nigerian is very precious , '' it said .

` Blatant lie '

Distraught parents have waited for news for four days , putting their faith in a military rescue , said Lawan Zanna , father of one of the students .

They are shocked that the government resorted to `` blatant propaganda '' and a `` blatant lie , '' he said .

Olukolade said the military received a `` major breakthrough '' report from a reliable source who supposedly included information from the principal of the school where the students were seized by gunmen Monday night .

But the principal denied releasing any information .

`` I never made that claim to anybody , '' said Asabe Kwambura , principal of Government Girls Secondary School in the northeastern town of Chibok . `` A total of 14 out of the 129 students taken away managed to escape and the rest are still being held by their captors . ''

Olukolade called the misinformation an `` unfortunate development indeed . ''

How many are still missing ?

Musa Inuwa Kubo , the Borno state education commissioner , said Thursday that 30 students had come home .

But the principal and Zanna each put the number at 14 . Three girls escaped their captors Wednesday and were returned home by herdsmen , Zanna said . Others escaped from a broken truck as the abductors stopped , he said .

The military said `` ongoing frantic efforts '' of security forces , vigilante groups and hunters are attempting to find and free the students .

Rescue teams , aided by surveillance helicopters , were moving deeper into the vast forest that extends into neighboring Cameroon , said Ali Ndume , a senator representing southern Borno state .

A broken-down truck believed to have been part of the kidnappers ' convoy was found at the edge of the forest , which suggests the abductors took their hostages into the woods on foot , he added .

We ` ran into the bush '

The incident began Monday night , when militants engaged in a gunbattle with guards at the boarding school , and then herded the students onto vehicles and drove off , authorities said .

`` They left with us in a convoy into the bush , '' said one girl who escaped , but , citing security concerns , declined to identify herself . `` A group of motorcyclists flanked the convoy to ensure none of us escaped . ''

When a truck broke down , the girls inside were transferred to another truck and the broken one was set afire , the girl said .

Another vehicle then broke down and , as the men tried to fix it , `` some of us jumped out of the vehicles and ran into the bush , '' she said . `` We later found our way back to Chibok . ''

Boko Haram means `` Western education is sin '' in the local Hausa language . The Islamist militant group is waging a campaign of violence in northeastern Nigeria , particularly in Borno , Yobe and Adamawa states .

The militant group has bombed schools , churches and mosques ; kidnapped women and children ; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike . Human Rights Watch says more than 3,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram-related violence in the past five years .

Armed militant groups in Nigeria 's northeastern region are nothing new , but Boko Haram has taken the violence to unprecedented levels since 2009 .

In early March , Borno closed its 85 secondary schools and sent more than 120,000 students home after increasing attacks by the group . Chibok is in Borno state .

Borno is one of three states under a state of emergency since mid-May .

Britain offers help

UNICEF has called for the girls ' `` immediate and unconditional release '' and said attacks on Nigerian schools are getting out of control .

British Foreign Secretary William Hague was among the world leaders condemning the kidnappings .

`` We stand ready to provide assistance to help the Nigerian government ensure that these children can be returned to their families in safety , and to bring to justice those responsible '' for the `` cowardly act , '' he said .
