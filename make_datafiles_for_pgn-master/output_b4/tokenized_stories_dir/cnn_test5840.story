NAIROBI , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran 's trial of more than 100 people who it has linked to post-election unrest is a `` sign of weakness '' and shows that the Islamic republic `` is afraid of its own people , '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN Thursday .

Iran is `` afraid of the truth and the facts coming out , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said .

`` It is a show trial , there 's no doubt about it , '' Clinton told CNN 's Fareed Zakaria in a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on his `` GPS '' program Sunday .

`` It demonstrates I think better than any of us could ever say that this Iranian leadership is afraid of their own people , and afraid of the truth and the facts coming out . ''

Clinton spoke to Zakaria during her visit to Africa .

Those on trial include Newsweek reporter Maziar Bahari , who has dual citizenship in Iran and Canada , and Kian Tajbakhsh , an Iranian-American scholar . The trial , which began over the weekend , is scheduled to resume Saturday , according to Iran 's semi-official Fars News Agency .

This week , the State Department issued a statement expressing deep concern for Tajbakhsh .

`` Given that the charges facing Mr. Tajbakhsh are without foundation , we call on Iran 's leadership to release Mr. Tajbakhsh without delay , '' State Department spokesman Robert Wood said Tuesday , reading a prepared statement . `` He has played absolutely no role in the election and poses no threat to the Iranian government or its national security . ''

Wood said Tajbakhsh has not been provided an attorney , which he is entitled to , and warned Iran that `` the world is watching what is happening in Iran and will bear witness . ''

Speaking on Thursday , Clinton said the United States also has `` expressed our concern about Mr. Bahari 's confinement and trial '' to Canada 's government , and offered its help .

All of those on trial in Iran -- who include Iranian journalists and supporters of the opposition -- have been charged for their alleged roles in protests that followed last month 's disputed presidential election .

The June 12 election gave President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term in office , but it also sparked a massive opposition movement that has regularly protested against the Iranian leadership and has shaken the foundation of Iran 's Islamic theocracy .

Those on trial will be placed into three categories , according to Fars : the `` plotters , intriguers , and planners of the riots '' ; `` the antagonists and those affiliated to foreign services '' ; and `` the opportunists , hooligans , and hoodlums who set ablaze , or destroyed private and public properties , and those that have had hands in disturbing public security .
