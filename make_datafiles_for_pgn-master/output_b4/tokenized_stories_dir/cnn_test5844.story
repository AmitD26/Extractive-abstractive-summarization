-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As part of the investigation into the remains of 11 women found inside and outside the Cleveland , Ohio , home of a registered sex offender , police have turned to the self-described `` bug guy . ''

Joe Keiper , curator of invertebrate zoology from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History , started consulting with law enforcement in 2001 . His job is to identify the bugs found on bodies and determine their age , to help police determine the `` post-mortem interval '' : the time between death and body discovery .

It 's a grisly task but a useful one , as it can help police determine a timeline for deaths .

Bugs `` can be the most important evidence when it comes to pinpointing a timeline , '' Keiper said , adding that bugs ' sense of smell `` puts bloodhounds to shame . ''

And in this case , with 11 deaths -- each with their own mystery -- bugs could play a huge role in helping investigators figure out how and when each of these bodies ended up at the home of Anthony Sowell , 50 .

From the beginning , Keiper was involved in the case of the remains found at Sowell 's home . All the remains are of African-American women , police said . All that remains of one victim is a skull , wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the basement .

Police conducted an additional search at Sowell 's home and an adjacent property Wednesday , Cleveland police Lt. Thomas Stacho said . Although `` various items '' were removed , no more remains were found , he said . Police had used ground-penetrating radar to analyze the properties .

Sowell , who served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape , now faces five counts of aggravated murder , rape , felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths .

Typically , Keiper said , he requires three weeks to a month to complete a report on one body , but in the Sowell case , he hopes to have an initial report completed `` before Christmas . ... It is n't going to be a three-week process . ''

The difference between one bug and another can be `` minute , '' with some of them looking `` very similar , '' he said . But the minute difference can be huge in terms of bug species , as different species can tell very different stories about the time of death .

For instance , there are only a few dozen species of flies in his part of Ohio , he said , but the presence or absence of each one can tell a story , since each has a different rate of growth in varying temperatures .

Temperature will be a factor in this case , he said , because some of the bodies were found inside and others outside . Keiper said he 'll need to determine what effect the bodies being `` hidden '' will have on the bugs he finds , as well .

In research done with dead pigs , he said , bugs will cover the pig 's face within an hour .

Keiper said his job is to be `` meticulous , '' as any mistakes can disrupt an investigation .

Preliminary information is generally not useful , he said , so he has not spoken to police or the coroner regarding any of his findings .

Asked how exact his findings will be concerning time of death , he declined to answer , saying that would mean giving specifics on the conditions of the bodies when they were found .

He said only that he believes he can do `` better than years '' in trying to pinpoint a time of death for each victim .

`` This is a singular situation that I hope is once in a lifetime , '' he said of the Sowell case . `` This is something , for the sake of our society , I hope I never have to do again . ''
