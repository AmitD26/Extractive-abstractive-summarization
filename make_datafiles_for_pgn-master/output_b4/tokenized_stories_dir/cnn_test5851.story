-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Afraid that her husband will leave her for a younger woman , a 107-year-old Malaysian woman is looking to marry again -- for the 23rd time .

Wok Kundor : `` I am an aged woman . I do n't have the body nor am I a young woman who can attract anyone . ''

Wok Kundor has been happily married for four years to her husband , a man 70 years her junior .

But since he left their village in northern Terengganu state for a drug rehabilitation program in the capital , Kuala Lumpur , Wok has had a gnawing feeling .

`` She said that she has been feeling insecure lately and she needs to find out whether he still loves her or not , '' said R.S.N. Murali , a reporter for The Star . The English-language Malaysian daily was among several local media outlets reporting on the lifelong romantic .

`` She is worried he might not come back after his program and find himself a younger wife , '' Murali said .

If so , Wok has her eyes set on a 50-year-old man , but hopes it does not come to that .

`` I realize that I am an aged woman . I do n't have the body nor am I a young woman who can attract anyone , '' she told the newspaper .

`` My intention to remarry is to fill my forlornness , '' particularly during the Muslim month of fasting , Ramadan , she said .

Malaysian media , which has previously reported on the woman , said Wok has been married 22 times . That would make her marriages last an average of four years .

Wok would not discuss past relationships , Murali said .

`` Some of her better halves have passed away or have divorced , but she does n't want to talk about them or her children , '' he said .

Wok and her current husband , Mohammed Boor Che Musa , hail from the same village and met there .

Muhammad , 37 , was quoted in an earlier report as saying the couple fell for each other because it was `` God 's will . ''

On Monday , he told The Star that he is still very much in love with his wife and can not dream of life with someone else .

But Wok wants to hear him say it , Murali said .

Soon , the centenarian plans to make the journey to Kuala Lumpur -- if she can find a neighbor to drive her there .
