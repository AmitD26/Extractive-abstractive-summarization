LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the man in the Dodgers jersey walked quickly around the perimeter of the infield , fans poured down from the bleachers begging for autographs .

Pitbull says he learns from setbacks : `` Usually the negatives turned out to be the most positive for me . ''

No , it was n't home run king Manny Ramirez . It was Armando Christian Perez , the Cuban-American rapper better known as Pitbull .

In five years , he 's gone from a mouthy Miami street hustler to a chart-topping hip-hop star whose infectious Caribbean beats have enticed crossover audiences to swing their hips and sing along -- even taking on some of the words in Spanish . His fourth studio album , `` Rebelution , '' debuted in the Top 10 on the mainstream Billboard chart .

But Pitbull 's growing profile means nada as he takes the mound to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the game . `` I 'm the only Cuban who never picked up a baseball in his life , '' he said , preparing . He awkwardly winds up and releases the pitch . It falls short , bouncing on the ground before reaching the plate .

`` One more try ! '' he signals . The second attempt is closer to the mark .

It 's symbolic of Pit 's career . `` It 's not how you start . It 's how you finish it , '' he likes to say . Watch how Pitbull leads his `` Rebelution '' ''

Tommy Lasorda , the legendary Dodgers manager , is waiting to bust his chops as he leaves the infield . Later , we get the scoop on the conversation . -LRB- By the way , the Dodgers won that game . -RRB-

CNN : Tommy Lasorda was out there giving you a little bit of grief .

Pitbull : Tommy Lasorda told me , `` It was the worst throw I 've ever seen in my life ! '' I said , `` Well , I 'll throw you in the studio . You rap , I 'll play baseball . '' He goes , `` I 'll rap a whole lot better than that throw ! '' -LRB- Laughs -RRB-

CNN : How much do you deflect things with humor ?

Pitbull : -LSB- Humor is -RSB- everything . Everything . Usually the negatives turned out to be the most positive for me . In the music industry , any other artist would have looked at the situation I was in and thought , `` Oh man , this is not for me . '' I looked at it more like -LSB- Darwin exploring -RSB- the Galápagos Islands . You know -- survival of the fittest .

CNN : Were you a troublemaker growing up ?

Pitbull : Not a troublemaker . I 'm sharp . Slick , if you want to call it . What the street taught me how to do is how to hustle . How to make something out of nothing .

CNN : In the music industry , street cred may help an artist .

Pitbull : Anybody who 's made it out of the street -- they want to do this -LRB- places index finger over his lips -RRB- . Shh .

CNN : Even though some of the struggles are similar , there does n't seem to be a lot of crossover between African-American hip-hop artists and Latin-American hip-hop artists .

Pitbull : You ca n't get a Diddy or Jay-Z to speak to the Latins . It 's not gon na happen . There 's a force field where they said , `` OK , we 're going to let you here -- but that 's it . '' Diddy got the closest . Why ? Because he had J. Lo . The only reason my grandmother knows Puff Daddy is because of J. Lo . But he could n't cross that barrier . So as far as myself -- I guess I 'm their role model .

CNN : How much do you want to cross over ?

Pitbull : I have respect for Jay-Z and Diddy for what they did in the hip-hop game . But I want to be Celia Cruz . I want to be Gloria Estefan -LSB- both were born in Cuba -RSB- . I want to enterprise -- open clubs and restaurants . They 've done it also -- but those are who I look up to .

CNN : Your parents were both born in Cuba .

Pitbull : They did n't want to leave Cuba ! They would have stayed in Cuba . They did n't want to get out of there . There were forced out of that country .

CNN : How did they come to Miami ?

Pitbull : My grandmother fought in the -LSB- Cuban -RSB- revolutionary war actually with Castro , because everybody thought that Batista was corrupt . I 'm not saying that he was n't , but it 's almost like the lesser of two evils . -LSB- When she became disillusioned with the Castro government -RSB- , my mother and my aunt got sent off in an operation called Peter Pan without their parents . She did n't see her mother for seven years . As far as my father -- he came over also . He did n't come in the Peter Pan , but they fled the country .

CNN : Would you ever go to Cuba and play a concert there ?

Pitbull : No way . I 'd never go to Cuba and play a concert . -LSB- I 'd consider playing there -RSB- as soon as I know that it 's confirmed that Castro 's out of there . I mean , if you ask me , I think Castro 's been dead for years . He handed power to Raúl , and he slips pictures here and there . He keeps giving these pictures to the media with the same shirt on -- same jacket , same everything .

CNN : How do you feel about other artists of your generation who feel compelled to go and perform in Cuba as kind of an olive branch ?

Pitbull : Juanes just did it . Papa , you ca n't change Cuba . History will tell you that you ca n't change Cuba . I respect him as an artist -- he 's like U2 , the Bono of Spanish . I do n't respect his decision . Maybe he does n't really understand it at the end of the day because he 's not Cuban . -LSB- Juanes is Colombian . -RSB-

But to each his own . There 's too much suffering , too much pain from people who left that island , that have come over here and tried to change their life .

CNN : Even though you were born in America , how much are you influenced by your Cuban roots ?

Pitbull : My mother , she 's like , `` Look , you 're American , son . You were born here in the States . '' My father ? My father said , `` You 're Cuban-American . '' My mother would call me Chris , because my middle name 's Christian . My father would say , `` No , your name 's Armando . '' But in my blood , what it tells me is , `` You 're Cuban-American . '' The music is what makes you , the food is what makes you , the way you 've been taught mentally .
