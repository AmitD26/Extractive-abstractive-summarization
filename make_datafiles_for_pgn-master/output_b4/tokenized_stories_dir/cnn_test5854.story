Newark , New Jersey -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Transportation Security Administration officer has been reassigned after Sunday 's security breach at Newark 's Liberty International Airport , according to the TSA .

`` The TSA is reviewing the circumstances surrounding the incident , and we are making an assessment as to what disciplinary action will be taken against -LSB- the -RSB- officer posted at the exit in question , '' TSA spokeswoman Ann Davis said . `` For now , that officer is performing non-screening duties while we look at what happened . ''

Davis confirmed Monday that the TSA had not been able to locate the individual who breached security , but there was no indication that the individual presented a serious threat , she said .

`` We were able to eliminate that he was a risk to the airport by rescreening everyone and re-combing the airport to make sure he did n't introduce anything to the environment or hand anything off to anyone , '' she said .

The incident Sunday evening forced the closure of a terminal for hours while authorities rescreened thousands of passengers .

The security breach happened about 5:20 p.m. at Terminal C when a man walked through an exit on the public side to the secure `` sterile '' side for passengers who had cleared screening , according to the TSA .

All passengers had been rescreened by early Monday , according to the TSA . Flights from Terminal C were grounded until the process was completed .

Authorities reviewed video from airport cameras but were not sure whether the man was once on the sterile side and went back or whether he never went through screening , Davis said .

The incident caused arrival delays and mainly affected Continental Airlines , which is the airport 's largest tenant .

CNN 's Alina Cho , who arrived at the airport Sunday night on a flight from Fort Lauderdale , Florida , described a hectic scene , saying many passengers who had boarded outgoing flights had to get off planes to be rescreened .

`` I just saw one woman pleading with a gate agent , saying that she had two small children and a heart condition -- that she simply could not take this , '' Cho said . `` But of course , there will be no exceptions . ''

Newark Liberty International Airport , about 15 miles from Manhattan , is the second-largest hub for Continental .

The airport handles approximately 35 million passengers a year .
