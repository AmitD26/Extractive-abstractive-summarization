MOSCOW , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russian and British ships repelled a pirate attack on a Danish ship in the Gulf of Aden , the Russian navy said Wednesday .

Pirates have caused havoc off the coast of Somalia , hijacking 33 ships this year .

Elsewhere , pirates hijacked a Turkish-flagged ship carrying 4,500 tons of chemicals and 14 crew off Yemen 's coast .

The pirates hijacked the ship , Karagol , near Yemen as it traveled to Mumbai , India , semi-official news agency Anadolu Ajansi reported , citing a written statement from the Turkish Maritime Agency .

Russian navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said the Russian patrol ship Neustrashimy and a British frigate , HMS Cumberland , successfully rebuffed pirate attempts to seize the Danish ship Powerful off Somalia .

The British and Russians used helicopters to counter-attack the pirates , who had opened machine gun fire on Powerful and twice tried to seize it , Dygalo said .

It was not immediately clear when the incident occurred .

When asked about the incident , the British Ministry of Defense said a crew from the Cumberland had boarded a small boat on Tuesday that `` they ... believe had been involved in an attack on the Danish-registered MV Powerful earlier in the day . ''

Ahead of boarding the small boat , or dhow , the British crew members tried several ways to stop it , `` but they were unsuccessful , '' the Ministry of Defense 's statement said .

The Cumberland then launched boats to circle the dhow , in another attempt to halt it . People aboard the dhow opened fire at these boats , and the Cumberland 's crew members returned fire , the statement said .

Two alleged pirates were killed during the shooting . A third person , a Yemeni national , died later from injuries , despite care from the Cumberland 's doctor , the Ministry said .

`` It is unclear whether his injuries were as a result of the firefight or a previous incident . ''

The Gulf of Aden , which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea , has become a treacherous stretch for ships , particularly along the Somali coast . There have been 84 attacks and 33 successful hijackings off Somalia 's coast this year .

Meanwhile , the Karagol is owned by Istanbul-based Y.D.C. Denizcilik , A.S. . The company confirmed its ship had been hijacked , but could not provide any details .

The Karagol is the second Turkish ship in two weeks to be hijacked . On October 29 , pirates in the same area off Yemen commandeered the Neslihan , a Turkish-owned freighter , carrying 77,000 tons of iron ore from from Canada to China , the ship 's owner , Ya-Sa Shipping Industry and Trading , S.A. , said .
