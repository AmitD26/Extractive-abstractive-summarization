-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The pilot of a Boeing 737 was in the cockpit , preparing to take off with 101 passengers , when police arrested him for flying with a fake pilot 's license , investigators said .

The 41-year-old Swedish man was poised to fly on Tuesday night from Amsterdam , in the Netherlands , to Ankara , Turkey , when investigators `` caught the pilot red-handed during his flight preparation , '' according to a statement from the Dutch National Police Services Agency .

Authorities charged him with forgery and flying without a valid license , the statement said .

It 's apparently not the first time the man , whose identity was not divulged , has tried to fly without a license .

Investigators in Sweden charged the man several years ago with flying with a fake license , but they did not pursue the case because they could n't find him , said Anders Lundblad , a spokesman for the Swedish Transport Agency .

The Swedes got a tip recently that the man was flying for a Turkish company and that he would soon be in the Netherlands , Lundblad said . They passed that information to Dutch police , which led to the pilot 's arrest at the Schiphol airport in Amsterdam .

The man said he had flown for 13 years for companies in Belgium , Great Britain and Italy , the Dutch police said , though it was unclear whether he had a license for all or part of that time .

He recently had a valid license to fly small commercial airplanes , but that license had expired and would not have allowed him to fly passenger aircraft , the Dutch statement said .

Lundblad also said the man once had a valid pilot 's license .

`` Why he never renewed it I guess only he knows , '' he said .
