-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The H1N1 virus has now become the dominant influenza virus around the globe , with high levels and an increase of activity in many regions , the World Health Organization said Thursday .

In a weekly update , the WHO 's point person on the H1N1 virus , Dr. Keiji Fukuda , also warned the public not to treat the virus like just another flu .

Like seasonal flu , H1N1 is more active in the winter than in the summer , and a majority of infected people get better on their own , Fukuda said . H1N1 also is as transmissible and infectious as seasonal flu , he said .

But unusually for influenza , Fukuda said , H1N1 continues at high levels over the summer months , and many of the serious illnesses and deaths are concentrated in people younger than 65 .

Seven months into the pandemic , the virus commonly known as swine flu remains at high levels and continues to increase in North America , Fukuda said . Mexico , for example , has seen more cases from September to November than they saw in the preceding months from April , when the virus emerged , he said .

The virus is also becoming more active in Europe and Central and Western Asia , Fukuda said .

Health officials this week reported an outbreak of cases in Ukraine , which now has more than 250,000 cases of influenza-like illness , with 235 patients requiring intensive care , the WHO said .

Activity is picking up in East Asia , Fukuda said . Mongolia reported `` a number '' of cases over the past week , he said .

`` East Asia is one of the parts of the world where seasonal influenza viruses have remained in reasonably high circulation , '' Fukuda said . `` But even in that part of the world , the pandemic virus is becoming dominant . ''

More cases are being reported from a number of Caribbean countries such as Cuba and Haiti , he said .

In Central America and the Southern Hemisphere , however , activity levels have dropped as those regions enter the summer season , Fukuda said .

`` There are several regions in the world -- North America , Europe , Northern and Central Asia -- where we are clearly seeing pandemic influenza activity increase , '' he said , but `` there is no one single place in the world where we are focused on . ''

Disease activity has been difficult to predict , Fukuda said .

`` We really are not going to know what the future is going to bring , and so the main focus of our effort here is ... what steps are needed to make sure countries are as prepared as possible to deal with disease levels , '' he said .

H1N1 poses different challenges in different countries , but it does seem to be affecting indigenous groups more heavily than nonindigenous groups , he said .

In Australia , for example , `` aboriginal groups are disproportionately represented in people who end up in hospitals from diseases related to the pandemic , '' Fukuda said .

The WHO still does n't know whether the effect on indigenous groups is because of the pandemic itself or because of underlying factors .

Because most people infected with swine flu tend to recover on their own and do n't suffer major problems afterwards , some people are tempted to dismiss the infection and think it 's not serious . But Fukuda said that 's a dangerous mind-set .

`` At WHO , we remain quite concerned about the patterns we are seeing , particularly because a sizable number of people develop complications -LSB- that lead to death -RSB- , '' he said . `` We do see that the serious complications are concentrated in the younger age groups rather than the older age groups . ''

While the complications are most often seen in people who have chronic , underlying health conditions and in pregnant women , they also can develop in people `` who are currently healthy and young . ''

But contrary to some reports , Fukuda said , the WHO has not seen big mutations in the virus since it first emerged . He said viruses being isolated now are `` generally similar '' to those isolated over the past several months , indicating they have n't changed much .

The WHO also has no evidence of widespread resistance to antiviral medication , Fukuda said . There have been sporadic instances of resistance to oseltamivir -- the generic name for Tamiflu , one of the main drugs used against influenza -- but such cases are still `` isolated and infrequent , '' he said .

`` Antivirals are quite useful against these infections , '' he said .

Fukuda praised as `` innovative '' the decision by Norway to distribute antiviral medication over the counter for a limited period of time . The move can help take stress off the primary health system and allow patients to get the medicine more quickly , he said .

Other useful protections against H1N1 are vaccines , which the WHO recommends against pandemic infections , Fukuda said .

`` These vaccines now have been used in a significant number of countries ... and based on this experience , in which millions of people have now received vaccine , we in fact see that these vaccines are very safe , '' he said .

The only side effects are swelling and pain at the injection site , but `` these are occurring at rates that are expected and usually seen with seasonal influenza vaccine , '' Fukuda said .

`` WHO , along with other public health authorities , believes that these vaccines are very useful against pandemic infections and -LSB- we -RSB- do support their use , '' he said .
