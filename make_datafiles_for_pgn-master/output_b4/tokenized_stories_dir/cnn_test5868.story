LONDON -LRB- England -RRB- CNN -- Could the era of spend , spend , spend be about to end ?

What is the biggest personal problem ordinary people face ? The answer increasingly , is debt .

In the last 15 years countries such as the U.S. , UK , Australia and Canada have enjoyed an economic golden age .

For many consumers it seems there is no product or experience that is out of reach as long as you have a few credit cards in your wallet .

It 's been the era of `` because I 'm worth it , '' $ 1,000 `` It '' handbags , celebrity worship , four credit cards apiece and vacations abroad .

But a flip side is emerging from this era of excess , with potent signs in the last week that the party is coming to a close . There have been warnings signs in the U.S. this week that the economy is slowing .

Rising U.S. home foreclosures and a persistent housing slump have triggered a U.S. credit crunch which has unsettled global markets and raised concerns about a possible economic slowdown .

The International Monetary Fund 's chief economist Simon Johnson said on Wednesday : `` We 've seen a shock that has spread to other industrialized countries faster than expected . It 's an important wake-up call for all of us . ''

On Friday the financial world was rocked when one of the biggest UK mortgage lenders Northern Rock received emergency support from the Bank of England . According to UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph , `` it 's further proof that the contagion of the credit crisis is spreading through the economy . ''

If the U.S. housing slump , IMF warnings and Northern Rock crisis are part of the economic big picture , then it 's also important to heed the calls from the coalface . What is the biggest personal problem ordinary people face ? The answer increasingly , is debt .

Drowning in debt

This week UK charity Citizens Advice Bureau -LRB- CAB -RRB- said the number of people seeking assistance on how to manage their debts reached record levels . It is now the most common problem the advice service handles . The advice service recorded 1.7 million cases last year -- a rise of 20 percent of callers with debt-related problems .

Credit card bills and other loans were 40 percent of all inquiries , while there was a `` worrying '' rise of people struggling to pay the basics such as utilities bills .

The organization said the surge in calls for help was evidence that the lengthy consumer boom was taking its toll . They singled out the proliferation of debt consolidation companies for blame .

Economist Andrew Charlton from the London School of Economics believes the U.S. housing slump and high levels of personal debt are part of the same problem : People on low incomes getting in over their heads with either housing stock or personal debt they can not afford .

The house of cards comes down when it is time to collect : a slight upward movement in interest rates , a drop in house prices or job losses -LRB- 4,000 in the U.S. in the last month , a four-year high -RRB- means payments can not be made and the lenders foreclose .

The chickens coming home to roost

For Phillip Hodson , Fellow of the British Association for Counseling and Psychotherapy , high levels of callers distressed by debt are no surprise .

`` The chickens have come home to roost . At the personal level people have to face some very difficult decisions . It 's difficult to break the -LRB- credit card -RRB- habit and people whose habit is going to the mall will find it very hard , '' he said .

And what habits we have : More than 4.2 million Britons have no qualms about taking their next holiday before actually paying for the last , according to statistics from UK bank Alliance & Leicester .

Research from Scottish Widows shows one in three adults in the UK refuse to plan their finances at all , and those who do find the time to review them set aside just five minutes a week .

Reliance on credit is a problem to be tackled not only by consumers but also governments , with our addiction to credit having a serious ripple effect on the economy .

In the U.S. an increase in credit card debt again pushed up outstanding U.S. consumer debt in July by $ 7.5 billion , the Federal Reserve reported last Monday . Consumer credit outstanding rose to $ 2.46 trillion in July , up from a revised $ 2.45 trillion in June , the Federal Reserve said .

U.S. consumers are defaulting on credit card payments at a significantly higher rate than last year , `` raising the prospect of problems in the stricken U.S. subprime mortgage market spreading to other types of consumer debt , '' according to the Financial Times this week .

Credit card companies were forced to write off 4.58 percent of payments as uncollectable in the first half of 2007 , almost 30 percent higher than last year . Late payments also rose , and the quarterly payment rate -- a measure of cardholders ' willingness and ability to repay their debt -- fell for the first time in over four years .

Simply put , we have developed a habit for credit cards that we ca n't afford , with people becoming adrift from old notions of delayed gratification : You save first before you purchase . Hodson told CNN about his grandmother using both sides of an envelope before she 'd throw it out and keeping pieces of string that could later be reused .

This World War II austerity is now folklore although some pundits say panic over the environment and resource use , as well an increase in personal debt may bring the war generation 's frugal habits back into vogue .

Why are we hooked on credit ?

Philip Hodson sees a few factors responsible for our credit binge : `` We 've developed retail therapy -- it 's a drug -- but it 's a very fragile plant and to build an economy based on it is ridiculous . ''

He also says the government has encouraged a people to be reckless with money through their own bad example : `` The government must take much of the blame for encouraging a debt culture and saddling students early on with loans . ''

The availability of credit lines also contributes to the debt trap .

In the U.S. , 80 percent of households have at least one credit card . Yet that is not enough for many credit providers . Five billion credit card solicitations are mailed each year nationwide , with each cardholder owning an average of seven credit cards -- three bank credit cards and four store or gas credit cards . Average household or individual debt -LRB- or both -RRB- is about $ 9,300 per household holding at least one credit card .

According to the advocacy group Demos , the average balance among lower - and middle-income households is $ 8,650 . We use credit cards for computers , the latest gadgets such as iPods , holidays and fashion , all the things many of us now deem as essential .

This readjustment of our needs -- perceiving that we now need more rather than the same or less also fuels our credit addiction .

Economist Andrew Charlton believes our reliance on credit is symptomatic of prosperity : `` It 's the by-product of the boom . In for example , Australia almost 30 percent of the population have never lived through a recession -- young people believe you can always take on debt because it 's always easy to pay off . Prosperity is the cause of our credit addiction . ''

According to Hodson , celebrity culture has a lot to answer for : `` The credit problem is exacerbated by celebrity culture . It 's the ubiquity of television -- you are taught by the electronic media to envy people 's lives who are richer . ''

`` With celebrity culture 150 years ago your horizon would be your parish . Today anybody living on benefits can watch the plutocrats of the world having fun -- I 'm not surprised they are envious . ''

His advise to minimize envy ? `` Always compare yourself to poorer people . ''

The bulk of callers ringing the Citizens Advice Bureau are juggling debts but in the future Hodson thinks it will be harder to borrow money , due to the difficulty we 'll have in repaying it . When lines of credit tighten or dry up , we 'll have to readjust our spending habits and tastes .

Luxury items will once again be out of reach for most except the super-rich .

`` What 's the answer to borrowing ? '' asked Hodson . `` It 's borrow more . But it 's musical chairs and what 's going to happen when you ca n't sit down ? ''

Hodson answers the question himself : `` I think a lot of people are going to be forced out of the credit economy because they ca n't borrow and they have a black mark against their name -- similarly if you default . Banks will start to discriminate more carefully . ''

As for our insatiable appetite to have the latest things and have them now : well it may be that if we ca n't afford them and no longer have a seemingly endless source of credit , we may have to go without . This in turn will tighten the screws on the retail industry .

In UK newspaper The Independent , the `` spending squeeze '' was forecast with `` retailers reporting falling sales as debt-laden consumers tighten their belts . ''

Some experts believe it 's not spiraling debt which will be the wake up call but the environmental costs of conspicuous consumption , while Charlton believes `` a recession will trigger a change in behavior . The next recession wo n't be like the last one , it will cut deeper . '' E-mail to a friend
