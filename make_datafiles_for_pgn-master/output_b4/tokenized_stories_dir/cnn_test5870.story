WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Marine Lance Cpl. Joshua Bleill lost both his legs above the knees when a bomb exploded under his Humvee while on patrol in Iraq on October 15 , 2006 . He has 32 pins in his hip and a 6-inch screw holding his pelvis together .

Joshua Bleill , pictured here with his girlfriend , is walking again with the aid of prosthetics outfitted with Bluetooth .

Now , he 's starting to walk again with the help of prosthetic legs outfitted with Bluetooth technology more commonly associated with hands-free cell phones .

`` They 're the latest and greatest , '' Bleill said , referring to his groundbreaking artificial legs .

Bleill , 30 , is one of two Iraq war veterans , both double leg amputees , to use the Bluetooth prosthetics . Computer chips in each leg send signals to motors in the artificial joints so the knees and ankles move in a coordinated fashion .

Bleill 's set of prosthetics have Bluetooth receivers strapped to the ankle area . The Bluetooth device on each leg tells the other leg what it 's doing , how it 's moving , whether walking , standing or climbing steps , for example .

`` They mimic each other , so for stride length , for amount of force coming up , going uphill , downhill and such , they can vary speed and then to stop them again , '' Bleill told CNN from Walter Reed Army Medical Center , where he 's undergoing rehab .

`` I will put resistance with my own thigh muscles to slow them down , so I can stop walking , which is always nice . '' Watch Bleill demonstrate his legs ''

Bluetooth is the name for short-range wireless technology that can connect computers to printers , MP3 players to speakers and -- perhaps the most well-known use -- cell phones to ear pieces .

Older models of computer-controlled legs have to be `` programmed '' via wire by laptop computers before the amputee can use them . Those legs required more movement from the amputee 's remaining thigh muscle to generate motion in the prosthetic leg .

Because of built-in motors , the Bluetooth legs allow Bleill to walk longer before he tires .

`` We 've compared walking several laps in both sets of legs and one , your legs come out burning and tired and these , you know , you sometimes are not even breaking a sweat yet . ''

Bleill says the technology also means he spends less time in a wheelchair . The Marine uses canes to walk with them . He 's hoping to get to the point where he can use one cane regularly , and eventually lose the cane altogether .

`` I can walk without canes , but it 's not real pretty , '' he said .

This new generation of prosthetic technology was originally conceived to help amputees who had lost only one leg . But it 's working for Bleill and Army Lt.Col . Gregory Gadson , who is also using the Bluetooth devices in his legs .

What they are experiencing will help future amputees .

`` We are the first ever to try this , so it 's learning day-to-day . The -LSB- prosthetics -RSB- company comes down on a regular basis and checks in with us , '' Bleill said .

Gadson , a former linebacker at West Point , said they are breaking new ground for amputees . `` I think we are kind of pioneering and hopefully blazing a trail for others to try the technology also , '' he said .

But the technology is not without some problems .

`` It 's only going to react to how I move , '' Bleill said . `` Unfortunately , sometimes I do n't know those reactions , I do n't know what I 'm doing to make it react . So sometimes the leg kicks harder than I want it to , or farther , and then I start perpetuating , and I start moving faster than I really want to . ''

Aside from the Bluetooth technology , Bleill 's legs have one other thing in common with a cell phone . They need to be charged overnight . Currently , there are no spare batteries available .

What are his long-range plans ?

He just wants to make it back to his home state of Indiana and work for a charity or even help the NFL 's Indianapolis Colts .

`` They do a lot for the community , '' he said .

He added he simply wants `` to give back . ''

`` To , you know , just carry on a normal life . Go home , see my girlfriend , see my family . '' E-mail to a friend
