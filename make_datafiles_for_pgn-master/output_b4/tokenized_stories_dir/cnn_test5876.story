-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Bertrand Piccard came up with his audacious plan to fly around the world in an aircraft powered only by the sun , he found that airplane manufacturers were skeptical such a plane could be built .

So who built the first model of `` Solar Impulse , '' Piccard 's $ 72-million solar-powered craft ? A company that makes ships .

Piccard , who won the first transatlantic balloon race and commanded the first balloon flight around the world , told CNN , `` Each time we asked the aeronautical industry to build that airplane , they told us it 's impossible . We can not make an airplane so light and so big . So who did we ask for some help ? A boat manufacturer . They had no idea it was impossible , so they built the pieces in carbon fiber and now we have an airplane . ''

The plane is made by the Swiss company Decision SA , which made the America 's Cup-winning Alinghi .

`` People put limitations on their creativity , believing they have to rely on what they know and what they have done , '' Piccard says . He sees the Solar Impulse venture as a way to dramatically demonstrate that it 's possible to make a sharp break with the past -- in this case , by showing that renewable energy can replace fossil fuel .

`` A lot of industries say we have a society based on oil dependency , so let 's continue . ... We know how to deal with oil . The result is General Motors and Chrysler going bankrupt . It 's a typical example of people who did not make the turnaround early enough . If GM made engines with much lower fuel consumption , they would not have gone bankrupt . ''

`` We have to get rid of certainties , habits , paradigms , common assumptions , '' Piccard says . `` These are the limits to creativity . ''

Piccard , who is 51 , spoke about his new venture at the TED Global conference in July 2009 and elaborated on it in a recent interview with CNN.com .

CNN : Why are you interested in attempting to fly around the world in a solar airplane ?

Bertrand Piccard : My life and the life of my family has to do with exploration , with adventure . My grandfather was the first man in the stratosphere , and my father was the first to touch the deepest point in the ocean . ... For me adventure and exploration is something in the blood . So that 's why I flew around the world in a balloon in 1999 . ... It was considered to be impossible , I said , `` Let 's try it . ''

I succeeded after two failures , and I came to the middle of my life , thinking now that adventure has to go on , and a pioneering sprit has to go on , but how can the adventure be useful -- not a personal dream like flying around the world in a balloon -- but really useful ?

I came up with idea of a solar airplane flying around the world with no fuel -- that would be a beautiful message in terms of technology , the energy of the future and the environment .

CNN : So what is the status of the effort right now ?

Piccard : So the airplane is built . The first flight was achieved on the third of December and in the spring and summer this year , we 're going to make the high-altitude flights and the cycle of -LSB- flying -RSB- one day , one night and one day .

We take off in the morning . We climb to 27,000 feet , and at the same time we load the batteries and run the engines on solar power only . Then we fly through the night on the batteries in order to reach the next sunrise and continue the following day . So this makes a complete cycle , with no fuel . When this will be achieved , we will build a second airplane that will be able to cross the Atlantic and fly around the world .

The first airplane has to prove that it 's possible to fly a complete cycle , one day , one night , one day . ... This little airplane is not a Piper or Cessna with a couple of solar cells . It 's a really high-tech carbon fiber airplane which is 200 feet in wingspan . It weighs 1.6 tons .

So it has basically the wingspan of a jumbo jet 747 , it has the weight of a little car , and on average it can fly with the energy of a little motorcycle -- which is only provided by the sun . ...

If an airplane like this can fly day and night with no fuel , then nobody can say in the future that it is impossible to use the same technology for cars , for heating systems , for air conditioning , for electronics and so on .

CNN : How fast will the plane travel ?

Piccard : The plane will travel very slowly . Otherwise it would take too much energy . The average speed will be 40 knots , roughly 55 miles per hour .

CNN : And so a flight around the world will take how long ?

Piccard : It would take around 20 days and because there is only one pilot at a time in the cockpit , we 're going to land every five days and change the pilot . ... When Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic in 1927 , he was alone on board , and the airplane was full of gasoline and nobody thought than an airplane could take passengers over the Atlantic . And 30 years later , airplanes were taking 200 passengers across the Atlantic . So now we start the same thing over again , but with no fuel .

We need an airplane that is very big , that is very light , and full of batteries , lithium polymer batteries , and it can take only one person . We have to see afterward if the technology can improve -- and transport people .

But our goal is more to bring about a revolution in behavior than to bring a revolution in aviation . The goal is really to have people on ground who will follow this adventure and will start to use the same technologies , to save energy and to rely on renewable energy .

CNN : What is the biggest technical challenge in building this airplane ?

Piccard : There are several challenges . One challenge is to have this airplane light enough despite its huge wingspan . The construction has to be done with carbon fiber with completely new technologies . The structure of Solar Impulse ... is 10 times lighter than the normal glider . It 's a breakthrough in construction technologies .

The second challenge is energy . It has to fly through the night with a battery that has been loaded the previous day . So it has to be extremely energy efficient .

Another challenge is that it 's difficult to ... control such a huge airplane that flies so slowly and is so light .

CNN : Do you intend to be one of the pilots ?

Piccard : I will be one of the pilots , and Andre Borschberg will also be a pilot .

CNN : What 's the greatest risk on the flight ?

Piccard : The greatest risk is bad weather . If we can not remain in sunny areas , we may have to land somewhere or ditch in the ocean . But we have very , very good weathermen , and I 'm confident that it will work .

CNN : So you will not be flying above the cloud cover ?

Piccard : We will be flying above the cloud cover , but during the night we have to fly lower because the efficiency of the batteries on the market is not yet sufficient for us to stay at high altitudes .

So during the day we climb to 27,000 feet and then during the night , we go down to 10,000 feet to save energy . When we have sunlight , we go up again . Which means that in the morning we absolutely have to be clear of clouds , otherwise we can not go up again .

CNN : Why ca n't you go up through clouds ?

Piccard : Because we will have almost empty batteries every morning ... so if we have clouds in morning , we can not load the batteries to go back up . ... This will be the big weather challenge for the team .

CNN : Where will you land the plane ?

Piccard : We need an airport with a large runway . We do n't need a long runway . We 'll have one stop in the U.S. ... We have not yet decided where it will be .

We 'll have five legs , and each leg will be five days and five nights on average . So we 'll stop in China , Hawaii , the U.S. mainland , Europe and one stop probably in the Arab Emirates and then back in China .

CNN : What 's your projected date for takeoff ?

Piccard : The schedule is like this : In 2010 , we fly day and night . In 2011 , we 'll make international flights , several days and nights . In 2012 , we 'll cross the Atlantic , and in 2012 or 2013 , we 'll go around the world .

CNN : How much does this project cost and who 's paying for it ?

Piccard : The entire budget is 100 million U.S. dollars , coming from private sponsors .

CNN : Do you have children ?

Piccard : Yes I have three kids .

CNN : And are they adventurous ?

Piccard : Well , they fly with me with hang gliders , with balloons , paragliders , micro-lights . They like it very much . But I 'd say they 're a little too young to show really what they 're going to do , they 're 15 , 17 and 19 . ...

CNN : Are you hoping your children will take on adventures the way you have ?

Piccard : No , I hope they will take on the challenge of improving the quality of life , bringing a pioneering spirit and new ways to think about political issues , environmental issues , technological issues , charity issues .

In the 20th century , the heroes were the ones who went to the North Pole , the South Pole , Everest , the bottom of the ocean , space and the moon .

In the 21st century I think the heroes will be the people who will improve the quality of life , fight poverty and introduce more sustainability .
