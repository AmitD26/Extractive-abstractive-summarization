Last year 's Aurora Borealis -LRB- Northern Lights -RRB- show was n't bad but the greatest natural light display in a decade is coming this December , according to NASA .

Solar activity will hit the peak of an 11-year cycle at the end of the year -- and the more intense the solar flares , the more magnificent the aurora display .

`` The vast majority of auroras occur in a band known as the Auroral Zone , '' says Alistair McLean , founder of a similarly named tour agency -- the Aurora Zone -- that specializes in Northern Lights trips .

`` This band can expand when solar activity is high . ''

The best chance to see the Northern Lights will be somewhere between 66 to 69 degrees north -- a sliver of the world that includes northern Alaska and Canada and bits of Greenland , northern Scandinavia and northern Russia .

Before venturing into any of these freezing wildernesses , it 's worth checking out the kp index , a measure of electromagnetic activity in the atmosphere . A reading of two or higher is considered good for Northern Lights spotting .

You can also head south , for the Aurora Australis -LRB- Southern Lights -RRB- , lighting up from around March 2014 onwards .

Here are some of the places the auroras will be showing up .

Jokulsarlon , Iceland

Best spot : By the Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon .

`` You can see the Aurora everywhere in Iceland , '' says Moyan Brenn , who 's spent the past year photographing the Northern Lights .

`` You just need to stay within the boundaries of the Arctic circle , find a clear sky and check for electromagnetic activity on the kp index . ''

For him , the Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon , on the southeast coast of Iceland about 250 kilometers from Reykjavik , makes for a perfect shot .

The iceberg-filled lagoon reflects the lights , making the experience all the more awesome .

On a boat tour of the lagoon -LRB- $ 31 per person -RRB- you can concentrate on looking upwards and marveling .

Brenn recommends checking the weather forecast before setting off . Rain or snow -- both common in Iceland -- tend to dampen the experience .

Fairbanks , Alaska , United States

Best spot : In a hot spring .

Two major challenges when hunting the Northern Lights are the cold and fatigue . Watching them in a hot spring asolleviates both .

The city of Fairbanks , in Alaska , is often cited as the best place to see the Northern Lights in the United States . It 's home to the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska , Fairbanks , which issues forecasts on Aurora viewing conditions .

If you fancy soaking while you watch , Geophysical Institute researchers recommend Chena Resort and Manley Springs .

Chena is better equipped and better connected with Fairbanks 's airport .

The resort also provides an aurora alarm service , alerting guests if the lights `` switch on '' in the middle of night .

Chena Resort , Chena Hot Springs Road , Fairbanks ; +1 907 451 8104 ; rooms from $ 189 per night ; return bus tickets from the airport to the resort cost $ 150 .

The resort in the tiny village of Manley Hot Springs went bust but you can watch the lights for a small fee from spring-fed hot tubs provided by a local couple . More information from the Fairbanks-Alaska.com website .

Paatsjoki , Finnish Lapland

Best spot : From the Paatsjoki Bridge , Nellim , near the Finnish-Russian border .

`` Paatsjoki Bridge provides unparalleled Aurora sightings , '' says McLean .

`` The chances of success here are at least 90 % , '' writes Markku Inkila , an Aurora photographer and guide , on the Aurora Zone blog .

Aurora Zone 's four-night Nellim Aurora Quest tour runs from December to the end of March ; from $ 2,700 for two people .

Muonio and Kilpisjarvi , Finnish Lapland

Best spot : A cabin in the Lapland wilderness .

Aurora viewing is so good around these two Finnish towns that one of the best aurora photographers and guides in the world -- by McLean 's estimation -- Antti Pietikainen , is based here .

Aurora Zone runs a trip between the two towns , following the lights .

Adventurous options on the tour include a snowmobile safari to the shared border of Sweden , Finland and Norway , husky-sledding with a stay in a cabin in the wilderness , snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing .

`` Sometimes , the dogs start howling when the aurora appears here , '' Mclean says .

`` It 's so primeval , it sends shivers down your spine . ''

The seven-night Muonio to Kilpisjarvi tour is available in 2014 from Feb 23 , March 2 and March 23 ; prices from $ 3,540 for two people .

For families , McLean suggests tours around the reindeer-herding village of Menesjarvi and the ski resort of Luosto , both run by the company Activities Abroad .

Kangerlussuaq , Greenland

Best spot : On a dog-sledding expedition .

With the only international airport in Greenland , Kangerlussuaq is the gateway to the rest of the country .

With an average 300 clear-sky days per year , it 's also another top location for aurora hunters .

World of Greenland -- Arctic Circle -LRB- Wogac -RRB- offers short Northern Lights tours from October to April , but from February to April it also has a three-day dog-sledding expedition to the west coast town of Sisimiut .

Hotel Kangerlussuaq -LRB- rooms from $ 290 -RRB- , at the airport , is a convenient place to stay . Keep your curtains open and you may even see the Northern Lights from your room .

The hotel also organizes an ice cap tour nearby .

Wogac 's short Northern Lights tour costs $ 65 per person , the dog-sledding expedition $ 1,445 .

Yellowknife , Canada

Best spot : On a heated viewing chair .

Not only do you have a great chance of seeing the Northern Lights around the city of Yellowknife , but the surroundings -- and seating -- are especially congenial .

A 25-minute drive from the city center , Aurora Village is a teepee campground where you lounge in specially designed , heated viewing chairs , with guides offering background in various languages on the lights .

You 'll need your warm seat -- it can hit 40 C below zero here .

Aurora Village also has daytime activities such as dogsled riding and snowmobiling .

Tromsø , Norway

Best spot : On the deck of a traditional steamer ship .

Sometimes called the `` Paris of the North , '' the city of Tromsø is a beautiful and accessible location for catching the Northern Lights .

The Norwegian tourism board recommends a voyage on the Norwegian Coastal Steamer Hurtigruten to see the lights along a fjord .

An Astronomy Voyage runs from September to March , following the Aurora Borealis , with astronomy lectures on board . The trip also includes a visit to the Northern Lights Planetarium , in Tromsø .

Another option is the village of Ersfjorden , 40 minutes from Tromsø , in the countryside between towering snow mountains and a fjord . A bus service between Tromsø and Ersfjorden runs until midnight .

Or you could join a Northern Lights chase with knowledgeable bus drivers .

The Astronomy Voyage costs from $ 1,900 per person . More information about Northern Lights viewing can be found on Tromsø 's official site .

Abisko , Sweden

Best spot : While tucking into a four-course Swedish dinner .

Cloud cover -- the aurora hunter 's arch enemy -- should n't trouble you around the village of Abisko , in northern Sweden .

`` Mountains and favorable prevailing winds combine to create some of northern Scandinavia 's most cloud-free skies , '' McLean says .

Aurora Zone 's tour there includes a night 's stay at an Ice Hotel .

Travelers can also spend a night at the Aurora Sky Station , arriving by chair-lift and having a four-course dinner before stepping out to view the Aurora .

The Abisko Aurora and IceHotel four-night tour , running from December to March , costs $ 2,811 for two people .

A night visit to Aurora Sky Station costs $ 95 or from $ 260 including dinner .

Southern hemisphere

Best spot : At the end of a continent .

Antarctica 's the best spot to view the Aurora Australis -- the Southern Lights -- but it 's also the most inaccessible , unless you 're a scientist or a supporting person -LRB- cook , doctor , pilot , etc -RRB- on a research expedition .

However , you can still see the lights from the southern tips of South America , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa .

New Zealand 's Stewart Island -LRB- `` Rakiura '' in Maori , meaning the land of glowing skies -RRB- is a good option . It has only 400 inhabitants and is covered with great wildlife and natural scenery .
