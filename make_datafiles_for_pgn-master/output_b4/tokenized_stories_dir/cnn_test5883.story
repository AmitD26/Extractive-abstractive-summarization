Authorities seized a gun from the scene where the body was found . Cumbria Police Deputy Constable Stuart Hyde said investigators believe Bird committed suicide .

`` I 've never known anything like this , where somebody would want to walk out and kill so many people in such a beautiful place in such a short space of time , '' Hyde said .

Police were working 30 separate crime scenes and are still attempting to determine the motive , Hyde said . Investigators are looking at Bird 's history and his access to firearms , he said .

Police named Bird as a suspect following reports of the first shooting mid-morning on Wednesday in the Irish Sea port town of Whitehaven .

Armed police patrols and dog squads were dispatched in the hunt for the gunman after the first shots were fired at 10:35 a.m. -LRB- 5:35 a.m. ET -RRB- in Whitehaven .

Police issued a photo of the Bird and urged members of the public to stay indoors until further notice .

More shots were fired in the small towns of Seascale and Egremont , with officers attempting to track the suspect on land and by air while ambulance crews attended the victims . Footage from one of the shooting scenes showed a covered body lying on a street .

`` Police are working to identify the individuals and inform relatives , '' Cumbria police said . `` Ambulance crews are in attendance across the area . ''

Peter Leder , who said he was a friend of Bird 's , told CNN he spoke to Bird last night and was told : `` You wo n't see me again . ''

Bird was initially driving a dark gray or silver Citroen Picasso , but police later said he had abandoned his car in the area of Boot , in the Lake District , and was traveling on foot .

Soon afterwards police said they had found a body in a wooded area .

The Lake District is a scenic rural retreat in northern England which is popular with walkers , hikers and tourists .

Leder said Bird has been an independent taxi driver in Whitehaven for more than 20 years and described him as `` an outgoing , well-known guy , who everyone liked . ''

Bird was divorced several years ago and has two children , both boys , who have moved away from home , he said . Bird is very close to his mother , who is very ill in a local nursing home , Leder said .

He said his friend enjoyed scuba diving , went on several diving trips abroad and practised regularly at the Whitehaven swimming baths .

The vehicle police said Bird was driving at the time of the shootings was his regular taxi cab , Leder said .

A police hotline was set up for concerned relatives of those involved .

John Bevir , a reporter for CNN affiliate ITV , described nearby Whitehaven as a sleepy seaside town . `` Things like this just do n't happen here , '' he said . `` Well , they did n't , until this morning . ''
