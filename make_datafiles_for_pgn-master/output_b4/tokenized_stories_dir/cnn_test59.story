-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In an instance of truth being stranger than fiction , American author Herman Melville turned to a horrifying ordeal as inspiration for his 19th-century classic `` Moby-Dick . ''

In 1820 , the Nantucket , Massachusetts , whaling vessel Essex was rammed and sunk in the South Pacific by a sperm whale .

George Pollard Jr. and his surviving crew , initially using three small boats that were aboard the Essex , resorted to cannibalism while they drifted in the open ocean for more than two months before being picked up by other vessels .

The sea truly must have been Pollard 's mistress , for he took command of another whaler . The captain and Two Brothers were off Hawaii on February 11 , 1823 , when the ship hit a shallow reef . The terrified crew , clinging to small boats , was rescued the next day by a fellow whaler .

Some 188 years later , maritime heritage archaeologists , working with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , found the Two Brothers shipwreck nearly 600 miles northwest of Honolulu , the agency said in a statement Friday .

`` This rare archaeological discovery is the first discovery of a wrecked whaling ship from Nantucket , Mass. , the birthplace of America 's whaling industry , '' the agency said .

Whaling ships , part of America 's expansion into the Pacific Ocean , explored portions of the Indian Ocean and the polar regions .

Expeditions from 2008 to 2010 yielded a large anchor of Two Brothers , cast-iron pots for melting whale blubber , bricks , whaling lances , harpoon tips , glass , ceramics and remains of the ship 's rigging , NOAA said . Research and accounts from crew members helped verify the find .

The shipwreck lies off French Frigate Shoals in the blue waters of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in Hawaii .

Melville completed `` Moby-Dick '' in 1851 , drawing on an Essex crew member 's account of the remarkable event .

The twice-cursed Pollard retired from whaling , became a watchman and lived to be almost 80 . Melville met him in Nantucket shortly after completing `` Moby-Dick . ''

Author Nathaniel Philbrick wrote about Two Brothers and the Essex in `` In the Heart of the Sea . ''

While the Essex story is linked to `` Moby-Dick , '' Pollard must not have been the inspiration for its mercurial Captain Ahab .

`` To the islanders he was a nobody , '' Melville said of Pollard , according to the Nantucket Historical Association . `` To me , the most impressive man , tho ' wholly unassuming , even humble -- that I ever encountered . ''
