Port-au-Prince , Haiti -- Horror has given way to acceptance ; it can be seen on people 's faces . But desperation surfaces everywhere :

In the rubble still strewn about the streets , in the steadily rising piles of garbage , in the 1,300 makeshift camps that still house so many people .

Four months on , the tragedy of the massive January 12 earthquake is fresh .

Relief operations thwarted widespread hunger here and so far , there have been no reports of killer disease outbreaks . But Port-au-Prince is very much running in emergency mode . Still .

No humanitarian worker will argue with that sad fact .

Despite the efforts and good intentions of a host of foreigners and a government that got a wake-up call , progress has been timidly slow .

The future has a different meaning now for Haitians such as Edline Pierre , who worries not about where to enroll her three daughters in school but how to get them up off the floor fast enough when the rains start falling .

Haiti earthquake special

She poured cement around her shack in the city 's central Champs de Mars plaza . But that does n't keep the water out or her girls safe at night .

The future means getting through the night and when the sun comes back out , scrounging together a meal .

On the streets , a bright spot : the sight of schoolchildren in uniforms . But only 700 of the 5,000 or so schools around the Haitian capital have opened . Some were destroyed ; others are occupied by the displaced .

Another welcomed sight : Hundreds of street vendors , many of whom are women , sit under a rainbow of umbrellas to sell mangoes , plantains and coconuts . Or they display a collision of goods in one basket -- shoe polish , spaghetti , shampoo , cigarettes and molasses .

These are snippets of life as it was once , before that fatal day .

Give us work -- not handouts

In the aftermath of what most Haitians refer to as `` the catastrophe , '' people asked for food . They patiently lined up for hours to receive a sack of rice , a quart of oil .

The lines are gone , along with the massive aid drops . International agencies are wary that too much help could stymie the local economy .

Now the two million Haitians living in squalid makeshift camps -- and countless others living in the homes of generous family and friends -- need jobs .

They do n't want handouts ; they just want money so they can feed themselves . `` We are willing to work -- work hard -- for money , but we need jobs , '' said Joseph Cangas , a coordinator at a new camp in Corail .

Some earn a few dollars here and there through work-for-cash programs . They clear debris off the streets or clean latrines in the camps . These are hardly high-quality jobs , but being employed anywhere will earn you envy .

More than 100,000 Haitians found work this way . But that 's only a sliver of the population . Almost four million people live in Port-au-Prince , a city designed for 250,000 . Haitians lived in congested neighborhoods and shanties before the quake .

Imagine those conditions compounded -- a family of six eating , sitting and sleeping in a space that 's hardly bigger than the sofa in your den .

When home is a place of last resort

To shield people from the potential danger of the rainy season , aid agencies have started building transitional homes and have relocated thousands to new camps on the city 's perimeter .

Almost 5,000 went to Corail , a stark place that evokes images of a military base in the Iraqi desert . Void of trees , the tropical sun beats down hard , and soaring temperatures make furnaces of the tents .

It 's not a place residents say they would choose . But this is where the government had access to land , so this is where people were brought to ride out the rains . Here , at least , they are not at risk of being washed away by torrents of water or in mudslides down steep , denuded hills .

Corail has its own problems . It 's far from the city , and it can cost a camp resident an astronomical $ 1.25 to take tap-taps , the colorful shared taxis , to central Port-au-Prince .

No one at Corail could afford that journey . But they said they had to figure out a way to go where the jobs were . `` We help each other . We share food , '' said Cangas , the camp coordinator . `` But the situation is getting more tense . People have nothing so they resort to stealing sometimes . ''

He complained about the lack of services and schools at Corail . But aid agencies do n't want people to get too comfortable here . Eventually , people have to try and regain their livelihoods in the neighborhoods where they were established .

`` You want people to go home , '' said Mark Turner , spokesman for the International Organization for Migration . `` The last resort is a place like Corail . ''

Turner said camp managers have been asking Haiti 's homeless this question : What will it take for you to move out of a camp ?

The answers are varied , and the problems are n't easily resolved .

Not even the safe places feel safe

All over the city , buildings are being marked green , yellow and red . Some already say : `` To demolish . ''

But even after an engineer has marked a home green for `` safe , '' people are reluctant to return . The United Nations estimates only 9 percent of those with green houses have gone back .

What if there is another earthquake ?

Gerald-Emile Brun , an architect working with the government on relocation , said incentives for people to go home -- $ 50 and a few provisions -- are being created . But so far , nothing has been doled out .

For many , Brun recognized , it 's impossible to go back to the spot where their house once stood because there is no place to dispose of the rubble . In this city of renters , landlords are refusing to accept people who can not pay the back rent for the four months they have been gone . Many of the displaced can no longer even afford the monthly amount they were paying before .

And as time marches on , many landowners want to evict displaced people so the buildings can be used as intended . What if your child could not go to school because the classrooms were occupied by the homeless ? What if you were homeless and had no place to shelter your children except at the neighborhood school ?

It 's a tough call , especially for humanitarian workers who do n't believe in forced evictions . But at the same time , Turner said , `` we recognize the landowners have legitimate concerns . ''

These are municipal issues that will have to be dealt with by the local government , Turner said .

But it wo n't be easy .

Ask Jacques Pablito Chardavoire , who helps manage a camp in front of the city 's main cathedral . Chardavoire 's response was simple but to the point :

Why would you leave an encampment that offers you a toilet , a shower , emergency food rations and , yes , even an outdoor movie screen when you have no place to go and no money in your pockets ?

He said almost 2,000 people were resettled in February from Champs de Mars to the cathedral . But within days , that many more people from elsewhere had flocked to Champ de Mars .

`` Every time we move people , more come because they need services , '' he said .

Much is shattered , but not hope

Haitians , who have lived through political turmoil , extreme violence and grinding poverty , will tell you the earthquake was the worst experience of their lives .

Whether a new city can rise from the rubble of Port-au-Prince remains in question , though Haitians are hopeful something good must come out of an event this tragic . They have to be . They have nothing left but hope . And faith .

That 's why if you peek down lanes on a steamy afternoon , you 'll see a gathering of people under a tent , their arms stretched skyward , their eyes closed . And you 'll hear the Lord 's Prayer .

You 'll hear it , too , every Sunday morning , before the sun gets hot , at Notre Dame , the main cathedral in Port-au-Prince . The building is shattered , but not the congregation 's faith . They still come to the place where , every week , they are re-energized by their belief in Christ .

Several Haitians said they feared the world 's goodwill would quickly fade now that the throngs of media have left and the spotlight has turned elsewhere . Edna Dunrod was one of them .

She worried she was forgotten , lying on a smelly mattress under three tattered bed sheets that serve as a roof in the Champs de Mars tent city . Last month , she gave birth to Marvins , asleep in a plastic tub under a foldable umbrella .

Life with a newborn in this congested camp , she said , was unbearable .

`` I want to go somewhere else , '' she said . But where , she worried . And who would help her reclaim her life ?
