NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With strong sales and equally powerful praise , the July issue of Italian Vogue can be judged a resounding success .

Chanel Iman is one of several models of color featured in the `` Black Issue '' of Italian Vogue .

Dubbed the `` Black Issue , '' the magazine celebrates models of color from the past and present , including Donyale Luna , Liya Kebede , Naomi Campbell , Iman and Chanel Iman .

Within 72 hours , the magazine sold out in the United States and Great Britain . Blog posts and e-mails about the beauty and historical significance of the issue began to flow -- and industry insiders were equally pleased .

Praising renowned photographer Steven Meisel , who shot most of the issue 's fashion pictures , The New York Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn gushed , `` I think they are some of the best he 's done . ... They are crazily , softly beautiful , plainly the work of someone who knows women and fashion . '' See what all the fuss is about ''

Another 40,000 copies of the `` Black Issue '' were recently reprinted to meet the still strong demand .

But will the all the hoopla translate into tangible change for black models in the fashion industry ? Will more color be seen on the runway and in magazines ? Many observers have their fingers crossed .

`` All the agents were happy about the issue because it gives us hope that other people will catch on and decide that it 's OK to use more black girls , '' said Carlos Ojeda , an agent at New York Models . `` It 's OK to have more than just one , and she does n't have to always be Naomi . ''

`` Italian Vogue is very influential around the world on an artistic level , '' said Constance White , style director at eBay . `` That is the book that all the art directors , the photographers , any fashion editor looking for inspiration turns to ... and always has . It has always been the trendsetter , so hopefully people will look at it and say using black models is both relevant and right and will start doing it too . ''

Bethann Hardison , a legendary model agent-manager , said she has noticed a shift in the industry since she began holding town hall meetings last September to address the lack of diversity in fashion . The packed-to-the-rafters events quickly became the talk of the industry , and Hardison is widely credited with sparking the current movement .

`` I started seeing more black models on the runway back in February , '' she said , pointing to the shows of designers like Diane Von Furstenberg and Michael Kors as examples . `` I have already seen change , and I know that I will continue to see change . ''

Not all are nearly as optimistic , and fear the diversity issue will become as passe as the skinny-model debate of a few years ago .

`` I hate to sound cynical , but by January , I feel like it will be back to business as usual , '' Ojeda said . `` I want to be hopeful and positive , but a part of me does not want to get my hopes up . ''

`` Let 's see if Italian Vogue is going to be able to live up to the standards that they 've now set , '' added one prominent New York-based stylist . `` You ca n't have an issue with all black girls , pat yourself on the back and say ` that 's it for the year . ' ''

Hardison is working hard to make sure that does n't happen . She 's already scheduled another town hall meeting for September , and she 's also planning a mixer to introduce fledgling models of color to industry players .

`` We just have to keep the bar high , '' Hardison said , `` and keep showing beautiful women and pictures . ''
