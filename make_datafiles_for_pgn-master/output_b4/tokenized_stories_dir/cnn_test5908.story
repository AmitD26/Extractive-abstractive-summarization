-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Liverpool 's Spain striker Fernando Torres may miss the struggling English Premier League club 's derby clash with city rivals Everton later this month after suffering another injury setback .

Torres was forced off the pitch inside the first 10 minutes of Sunday 's defeat by Blackpool with a groin injury , and the 26-year-old could now face two weeks on the sidelines .

He has already been ruled out of Spain 's Euro 2012 qualifiers at home to Lithuania on Friday and away to Scotland on Tuesday .

`` Fernando was assessed at Melwood and underwent a scan this afternoon , '' Liverpool 's head of sports medicine and sports science , Dr Peter Brukner , told the club 's official website on Monday .

`` He will have intensive treatment over the next couple of weeks , but it is too early to say if he will be fit for the game against Everton . ''

The former Atletico Madrid star has endured a frustrating year , battling for both form and fitness .

Despite picking up a World Cup winners ' medal with Spain in July , Torres ' summer ended in disappointing fashion , as he exited the final against Netherlands early through injury after failing to score during the tournament .

He has also struggled to find the net at the start of the 2010-11 Premier League season , scoring just one goal in six matches .

Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson will be eager to include the forward in his team for the Merseyside derby on October 17 , with his side in desperate need of a result .

After their latest defeat , the five-time European champions have picked up only one win from seven league matches , dropping into the relegation zone below Everton on goal difference .

Meanwhile , Brazil defender Alex will miss the international friendlies against Iran on Thursday and Ukraine on Monday after injuring his thigh in Chelsea 's win over Arsenal on Sunday .

He suffered the problem late in the match , having scored the second goal in the Premier League leaders ' 2-0 triumph , and is now expected to be out for three weeks , the club 's website reported .

Alex may then also miss Chelsea 's trip to Aston Villa and the Champions League clash with Russian side Spartak Moscow .
