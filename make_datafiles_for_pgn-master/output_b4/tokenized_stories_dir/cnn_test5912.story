Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Despite a high-profile push from pop star Lady Gaga and other gay rights supporters , the outcome of a key Senate vote Tuesday on whether to begin debate on legislation that includes a repeal of the military 's `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy remains too close to call .

Republicans appear united against the measure , including some GOP senators who favor lifting the Pentagon 's requirement that gays and lesbians keep their sexuality a secret . The Republican opponents are upset that Democratic leaders so far refuse to allow GOP amendments to the broader National Defense Authorization Act that includes the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' provision .

Lady Gaga spoke at an afternoon rally in Maine to pressure the state 's two Republican senators -- Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins -- to join Democrats in overcoming an expected filibuster attempt . To loud cheers from the crowd , Gaga said she was proposing a new law titled , `` If you do n't like it , go home , '' which would remove homophobic straight soldiers from the military instead of gay soldiers .

`` If you are not honorable enough to fight without prejudice , go home , '' she shouted .

Without the support of the Maine senators , Democrats are unlikely to muster the 60 votes needed to proceed with debate on the defense authorization plan . Both oppose the policy , and Collins was the sole Republican vote in the Senate Armed Services Committee in support of getting rid of it .

But in a statement issued Monday night , Collins said she would side with the rest of the GOP because the Democratic leadership of the Senate `` intends to shut Republicans out of the debate . ''

Collins said she agreed with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm. Mike Mullen , that the law is `` simply not fair . '' But she said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , should give Republicans and Democrats `` an equal opportunity '' to offer amendments to the defense bill .

`` Now is not the time to play politics , and I again call on the majority leader to work with Republican leaders to negotiate an agreement so that the Senate can debate the defense bill this week , '' Collins said .

In a separate statement , Snowe also indicated she would support a Republican filibuster , saying the chamber should be allowed a full debate on the measure . Snowe also questioned why the Senate would vote on repeal before the military has completed its review .

`` We should all have the opportunity to review that report which is to be completed on December 1 , as we reevaluate this policy and the implementation of any new changes , '' Snowe 's statement said .

The defense authorization act , which is a broad defense policy bill , would not rescind `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' until after the Pentagon completes a review of the repeal 's impact on the military . The review is due in December and would serve as the basis for necessary certification by the president , defense secretary and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the military could handle repealing the policy .

Many Republicans complain that Congress should not step in until after that military review is completed .

Sen. John McCain of Arizona , the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee , said approving a repeal provision before finishing the review process would amount to an insult to military personnel .

McCain also is unhappy that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , opted to include in the defense bill a controversial immigration provision that offers a path to citizenship for students who are children of illegal immigrants .

Reid `` is turning legislation on our national defense into a political football , '' McCain said last week . `` Politically controversial amendments are crowding out our limited time to debate actual military and defense-related legislation . ''

A GOP leadership aide criticized Reid for planning to debate the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' and immigration amendments before the Senate breaks for mid-term elections , even though Reid has said a final vote on the bill would not happen until a post-election session .

`` The vote tomorrow is not to get on the defense bill , it 's to set up a series of votes on a political wish list , '' the aide said .

Reid denied last week that his scheduling was motivated by politics .

Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen , the Joint Chiefs chairman , have said publicly they support repealing `` do n't ask , do n't tell . ''

The military already has working groups looking at how it would implement the change if ordered . The groups are looking at everything from housing to entitlements , and even personal displays of affection .
