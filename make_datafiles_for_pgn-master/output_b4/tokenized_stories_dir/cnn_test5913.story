-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Borussia Dortmund are back on top of the German Bundesliga table after a 2-0 victory at title rivals Mainz on Sunday .

Teenager Mario Goetze opened the scoring for the visitors in the 26th minute when he punished a mistake from Niko Bungert before firing home .

Mainz then wasted a golden opportunity to level matters when midfielder Eugen Polanski 's 47th-minute penalty was well saved by Dortmund captain Roman Weidenfeller .

And Dortmund made the home side pay for missing that spot-kick when they added a second goal midway through the second half , Paraguayan striker Lucas Barrios netting his fifth of the season from a tight angle .

The result means Dortmund overtake Mainz by a point at the top of the table with 25 points from their 10 matches .

Despite the defeat , Mainz remain six points clear of Hoffenheim , who moved up to third on Sunday , ahead of Bayer Leverkusen on goal difference , with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Hanover .

Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson scored twice for Hoffenheim with Demba Ba and Peniel Mlapa also on target .

Meanwhile , in Spain 's Primera Liga , third-placed Villarreal lost ground on Real Madrid and Barcelona at the top of the table after a 1-1 draw at Sporting Gijon on Sunday .

Diego Castro opened the scoring for the home side in the 68th minute and Villarreal needed a last-gasp penalty from Italian forward Giuseppe Rossi -- his sixth goal of the season -- to salvage a point .

The result extends Villarreal 's unbeaten league run to eight matches , but they are now three points behind Real Madrid at the top of the table .

Elsewhere , Atletico Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw at home to strugglers Almeria and go into next weekend 's Madrid derby against Real down in seventh place in the table .

Sergio Aguero put Atletico ahead but Pablo Piatti levelled for the visitors on the stroke of half-time .

Earlier on Sunday , Deportivo La Coruna finally recorded their first win of the season with a 3-0 home victory over Espanyol at the Riazor Stadium .
