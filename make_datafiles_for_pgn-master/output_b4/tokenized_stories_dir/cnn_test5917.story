-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jeff Peterson and his 30 volunteer comrades with the Community Fire Department in suburban Charlotte , North Carolina , were enjoying an early Christmas dinner Sunday afternoon when someone looked out a window and saw smoke , thinking it might be a car fire .

A few donned gear as others rushed outside the North Belmont station house to find it was an SUV that had struck a tree . Video taken at the scene showed flames shooting out of the engine compartment and the driver 's white door blackened from the fire .

Local resident Kathy Lamberth apparently had lost control of the Suburban , CNN affiliate WSOC reported .

`` You could n't see in the vehicle , '' which was about 35 yards from the station , Peterson , 36 , told HLN on Wednesday .

Within moments , Peterson and fellow paramedic Neil Jones , along with firefighter/EMT Jake Beatty , found the doors were jammed . They opened the rear swinging doors of the vehicle and saw Lamberth , whose seat had been pushed back by the impact , trying to reach her 3-week-old son , Landen .

`` We knew while it was an urgent situation we could make the rescue without harming ourselves , '' said Peterson , who provided aid to the mother and son after Jones and Beatty brought them out of the burning vehicle .

`` I thought as long as he made it I was happy , '' Lamberth said , referring to her son .

Landen did not suffer injuries , WSOC said . Lamberth , 23 , who was treated at a hospital and released , had gratitude for the firefighters .

`` They were our guardian angels , '' she said .

Officials credit part of the quick response to the fact they had gathered for the meal .

`` We were miraculously all there for dinner , '' Peterson said .
