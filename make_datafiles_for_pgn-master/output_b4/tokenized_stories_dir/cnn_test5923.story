-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Top seeds Serbia have been forced to withdraw from Saturday 's Hopman Cup final because of an injury to former world number one Ana Ivanovic .

The 2008 French Open champion tore a stomach muscle during her straight sets loss to Justine Henin of Belgium at the annual team event in Perth , Australia on Thursday .

Ivanovic went on to partner Novak Djokovic in a three-set mixed doubles loss to Henin and partner Reuben Benelmans , but after practicing on Friday morning made the decision to withdraw from the tournament .

`` This morning , I was playing some points and on one serve I felt a sharp pain and I could n't even hit or move after that , '' Ivanovic told reporters .

Ivanovic and world number three Djokovic -- whose singles win over Benelmans on Thursday secured Serbia 's final berth -- will be replaced in the weekend 's title-clash by Belgium who finished in second place in group A.

Henin and Bemelmans will now face the United States team of Bethanie Mattek-Sands and John Isner in the final , after Mattek-Sands 's straight sets defeat of British teenager Laura Robson on Friday was enough for the American 's to secure their place at the top of group B .

The injury is an early-season blow for Ivanovic , who recently made a comeback to the WTA tour following a string of fitness problems .

But the 23-year-old said she can recover in time for the first grand slam of the year , the Australian Open , which begins in Melbourne on January 17 .

`` It 's definitely a scare , '' the current world number 17 told reporters . `` At this moment in time my chances are still very good because I stopped in time . I 'm positive I will be fit .

`` It 's very frustrating because this has been the case for a long time now . But I have to stay positive . ''

Reigning French Open champion Francesca Schiavone was also forced to retire from her Hopman Cup singles match against France 's Kristina Mladenovic on Friday , however , it is not thought her injury is serious .

Elsewhere , at the Brisbane International top seed Robin Soderling of Sweden progressed to the semifinal of the Australian Open warm-up event on Friday .

The 26-year-old brushed aside Aussie qualifier Matthew Ebden in straight sets and will now face Czech Radek Stepanek in the semifinal , after the former world number eight and two-time finalist of the Brisbane event put out seventh seed Florian Mayer 6-3 6-3 .

Saturday 's other last-four clash will see American second seed and world number eight Andy Roddick take on Kevin Anderson of South Africa , after the pair had respective quarterfinal wins over Marcos Baghdatis and Santiago Giraldo on Thursday .

In the women 's singles draw Germany 's Andrea Petkovic caused an upset by knocking out the tournament 's fourth seed , Marion Bartoli of France in straight sets .

The world number 32 will now face fellow unseeded player Petra Kvitova in Saturday 's final after the Czech defeated fifth seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-4 4-6 6-2 .

Meanwhile at the Auckland Classic in New Zealand Maria Sharapova 's quarter final conqueror Greta Arn continued her winning streak with a straight sets victory over German fourth seed Julia Georges .

Hungary 's Arn will meet second seed Yanina Wickmayer of Belgium in the final of the event , after the world number 23 overcame the challenge of Chinese qualifier Peng Shuai 3-6 7-6 6-3 .

In the Hong Kong exhibition tournament , Venus Williams suffered a second straight defeat in her preparations for the Australian Open after a lengthy injury layoff .
