-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than 1 billion people all over the globe will observe the 40th anniversary of Earth Day today , which promises to be the largest since that first event in 1970 . In 2010 , the environmental challenges we face are global and call for new solutions .

Forty years ago we were reactive . In 1969 , the year before the first Earth Day , two environmental disasters grabbed the country 's attention : a massive oil spill coated the coast of Santa Barbara , California , and the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland , Ohio , grew so polluted that it actually caught fire .

Forty years later , with climate change looming and no strong international agreement in place despite the Copenhagen Climate conference , environmental activists are taking a proactive stance . They are arming themselves with the internet and social media to create another grass-roots movement for change , even larger than the first .

How countries like India and China solve their future energy needs has an impact on people everywhere -- many developing countries are now pulling ahead of the United States on renewable energy -- and how the United States addresses its key issues will have an equal impact .

Americans of all political stripes can agree on certain essential goals , such as how we must preserve the world 's natural wonders for generations to come and how we must live in harmony with this world of finite natural resources .

But not everyone sees the bigger picture -- that the global economy will improve by moving away from dependence on fossil fuel , that investments in renewable energy can create jobs and that a new revolution is needed to replace the outdated Industrial Revolution .

It took 150 years to transform our agrarian society to an industrial one . But today , we do n't have the luxury of time . Climate solutions are urgently needed .

The challenge is to move from carbon-based energy and industrial systems into a post-carbon , or green , economy . A green economy relies on renewable energy and the creation of green jobs to prevent further pollution and resource depletion and sustain economic growth .

Economic growth , quality jobs and energy independence are not mutually exclusive . According to studies gathered by the Environmental and Energy Study Group , a Washington energy think tank , energy efficiency employs 8 million and renewable energy employs 450,000 in the United States .

The Earth Day Network and its partners are orchestrating large events in New York ; Rabat , Morocco ; Kolkata , India ; Buenos Aires , Argentina , and Tokyo , Japan . A massive climate rally is planned for Washington on April 25 .

Earth Day Network is backed by more than 20,000 organizations spanning 190 countries . All these organizations have a stake in climate change , development and growth , national security and energy policy -- geopolitical issues that must be addressed .

Earth Day has become a year-round imperative . From public meetings to civic action , Earth Day 's influence has created a green generation of activists , business leaders , and government leaders who are creating a new global green future worthy of the aspirations of the first Earth Day .
