-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Serie A champions Inter Milan have completed the signing of striker Goran Pandev on a deal until 2014 .

Pandev was a free agent after winning his legal battle against Lazio to be released from his contract .

A return to Inter -- where he spent three years without making a senior appearance earlier in his career -- always appeared likely to be his next move and the Nerazzurri confirmed the deal on Monday .

The Macedonia international has penned a four-and-a-half-year deal and is excited about linking up with Jose Mourinho 's side .

He told the club 's official Web site : `` I am really very happy . My dream was always to remain at Inter , but things have gone well nevertheless . I grew , I became a man , a real player and today I am happy to be here . ''

Pandev joins an Inter squad eight points clear at the top in Italy , although closest challengers AC Milan have a game in hand .

He added : `` The year has started very well for me . Now we need to win the Scudetto and do well in the Champions League so we can all be happy .

`` I hope to contribute a lot , but it is especially important to win , then who gets the goals is a side issue . ''

Lazio were ordered to release Pandev from his contract by the Lega Calcio just before Christmas . He had been at Lazio since 2004 and quickly became a fans ' favourite at the Stadio Olimpico .

However , matters turned sour last summer when Lazio revealed they would not accept a bid of less than 19 million euros for Pandev after he filed a transfer request .

The 26-year-old was branded a `` rebel '' by club president Claudio Lotito and frozen out of the squad , as well as being forced to train separately from his former team-mates .

He was linked with several clubs across Europe , including Liverpool , but opted to remain in Italy .
