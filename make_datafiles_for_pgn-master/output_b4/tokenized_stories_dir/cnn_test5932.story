-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World-record signing Cristiano Ronaldo scored on his debut as Real Madrid kicked off the Spanish football season with a shaky 3-2 victory at home to Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday night .

Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after paying off a small chunk of his record transfer fee with a goal on his Real debut .

Real 's new generation of `` Galacticos '' were preceded onto the pitch by the world 's fastest man Usain Bolt , with the Jamaican sprint star dribbling a ball to the delight of a packed Bernabeu crowd .

Coach Manuel Pellegrini fielded seven new signings against a team who stunned Real 2-1 on the opening day last season to foreshadow a season of massive upheaval for the underachieving capital club .

The first goal took just 26 minutes in coming as $ 92 million signing Kaka fed the ball to $ 50 million capture Karim Benzema , whose shot rebounded off the post and fell welcomingly to Real captain Raul to score .

Ronaldo , who cost $ 130 million when he left Manchester United , then rose highest to meet a free-kick from $ 50 million midfielder Xavi Alonso but headed over the bar .

Deportivo stunned the home crowd in the 30th minute when former Real striker Riki was allowed a free header to equalize in the type of defensive lapse that typified Madrid 's performances last season .

But while Pellegrini has obvious problems to sort out at the back , where he fielded debutants Ezequiel Garay and Raul Albiol in the absence of the suspended Pepe , he has volumes of attacking resources at the other end of the pitch .

His team took the lead again in the 34th minute through Ronaldo , who coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after Raul went down under goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia 's challenge following a clever pass from midfielder Lassana Diarra .

However , Real could not hold onto the lead , with veteran Juan Carlos Valeron firing a leveler from the edge of the area just 43 seconds into the second half following a cross by Andres Guardado .

Valeron should have made it 3-2 with an even easier chance 12 minutes later , but he sidefooted another pass from Guardado wide of the Real goal .

Real continued to pile forward in numbers , peppering the Deportivo goal , but it was the unexpected figure of Diarra who netted the eventual winner in the 60th minute with a low drive from outside the box .

Benzema should have doubled the lead soon after following a mistake by Aranzubia , but saw his chip over the keeper rebound off the bar .

The Frenchman made way for last season 's top scorer Higuain in the 72nd minute , with the Argentine lucky to avoid being booked for a blatant dive in the penalty area .

Real 's rivals Barcelona start the defense of their title on Monday at home to Sporting Gijon , having already won a trophy this season by beating Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0 in the European Super Cup on Friday .
