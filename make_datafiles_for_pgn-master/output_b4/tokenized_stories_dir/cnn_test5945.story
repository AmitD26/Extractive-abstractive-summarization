Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning , suspected of leaking classified information to the WikiLeaks website , is being moved to the Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , defense officials said Tuesday .

`` At this juncture of the case , given the likely continued period of pre-trial confinement , we have determined that the new pre-trial facility at Fort Leavenworth is the most appropriate one for Private Manning going forward , '' Defense Department General Counsel Jeh Johnson told reporters .

A defense official initially told CNN Manning was moving to the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth , but later corrected that information .

Manning , 23 , a military intelligence analyst from Oklahoma , was being held in the brig at Quantico Marine Base south of Washington . There had been a push by friends and supporters to have his confinement conditions eased . Supporters said he was confined in a one-man cell with only one hour a day outside of the cell for exercise .

Defense officials said at a briefing that an evaluation aimed at determining whether Manning is competent has been completed , and there was no need for him to remain in the Washington area .

Among those arrested at a demonstration protesting Manning 's conditions last month were Daniel Ellsberg , who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971 to the New York Times and retired U.S. Army Col. Ann Wright who resigned to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq .

Johnson told reporters that the decision to move Manning is not meant as a criticism of the Quantico facility and congratulated the military personnel there for the job they did `` in difficult circumstances . ''

`` We remain satisfied that Private Manning 's pre-trial confinement at Quantico was in compliance with legal and regulatory standards in all respects , '' he said .

Manning 's case -- and the details of his detention -- drew attention last month in the aftermath of comments by former State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley and Crowley 's sudden resignation .

Amidst reports that Manning had been forced to sleep without clothing and was confined to his cell 23 hours a day , Crowley had criticized how Manning was held at Quantico , calling it `` ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid , '' according to news reports . He later stepped down from his post .

The Pentagon has maintained that Manning is held in accordance with rules governing all maximum-custody detainees at Quantico , for his protection and the safety of others , and that Manning is on `` POI '' status , for `` prevention of injury . ''

Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , released a statement Tuesday after news of Manning 's pending transfer broke , promising to demand written assurances from Defense Department officials that Manning 's rights will be protected .

`` Any move of Pfc. Manning does not change the underlying fact , which has not been disputed by the Department of Defense , that he has been held under conditions which may in fact constitute ` cruel and unusual punishment ' in violation of the 8th amendment , '' he wrote .

U.S. military officials have told CNN that Manning is the prime suspect in the leak of hundreds of thousands of classified documents that ended up on the WikiLeaks website . He is awaiting a decision on whether he will face a court martial .

Last month , the Army notified Manning that he faces 22 more charges in connection with the alleged downloading of secret information from computers in Iraq , bringing to 34 the total charges in the case . The most serious new charge alleges he aided the enemy by making the information public ; that charge is punishable by death .

A statement from the Army said the prosecution team `` has notified the defense that the prosecution will not recommend the death penalty , '' but technically it is up to the commander overseeing the case to make the final decision .
