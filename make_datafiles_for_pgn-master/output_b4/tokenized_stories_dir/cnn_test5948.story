Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The National Transportation Safety Board hopes air traffic controllers may soon benefit from long-standing research into worker fatigue by implementing strategies that include intentional sleeping on the job , the use of caffeine and other methods shown by science to deal with the overnight shift .

`` A controlled nap can boost performance significantly , '' said NTSB board member Mark Rosekind at a briefing with reporters Monday at agency headquarters . Citing a 1995 study from NASA that has been backed by other research , he said , `` A 26-minute nap improved performance 34 % and alertness 54 % . ''

The study prompted an advisory that has been adopted by some international air carriers to keep pilots more alert in the cockpit . The measures were not moved forward by the Federal Aviation Administration .

Congressional lawmakers may soon consider legislation reauthorizing the FAA that includes provisions addressing the problem of fatigue . The NTSB 's recommendations Monday followed a listening tour of air traffic controllers around the country . The board 's advice is issued to federal and other agencies .

Inside an air traffic controller 's life

Referring to a variety of transportation workers who unintentionally fall asleep on the job , the NTSB official said , `` We have many circumstances of documented , uncontrolled spontaneous sleep episodes , '' including incidents among air traffic control , long-haul trucking and railroads .

According to the research , `` A short nap can boost performance , a long nap can make you groggy , '' Rosekind explained , saying the tactic of catching a few winks is but one element in a comprehensive plan .

Although U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood directed the FAA to increase overnight staffing in air traffic control towers in response to unplanned sleeping on the job , Rosekind says that alone wo n't solve the problem of fatigued controllers .

What 's going on with air traffic controllers ?

`` If you do n't have a fatigue management plan , and you just throw more people at it , then you 've got more tired people on , '' he said . `` However many people you throw at the problem , you 're still gon na have the fatigue risk . ''

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also hopes the FAA will implement scientifically validated improvements to fight fatigue in the control tower .

In a written statement , NACTA President Paul Rinaldi said , `` There is nothing groundbreaking about these recommendations . They are common-sense solutions to a problem NATCA and fatigue experts have consistently raised for years while past administrations turned a blind eye . ''

Rosekind says the NTSB identified the problem of fatigue among air traffic controllers 30 years ago , but only within the past 15 years or so has the research revealed what fights the problem . He used the example of sleepy drivers who turn up the radio and roll down a window to try to stay awake on the road .

`` They only work for 10 minutes or so , '' he said , saying the research suggests greater benefits from pulling over for a short nap .

`` Napping , caffeine , light physical activity , light levels , engagement -- social engagement -- can work , '' Rosekind said .

And addressing the economic issues of improved staffing and the cost of scheduling people more in line with their sleep clocks , Rosekind said , `` Most people focus on the cost of the fatigue risk when an accident happens .

`` What people do n't quantify is what they 're losing in productivity and performance before that , '' he added .
