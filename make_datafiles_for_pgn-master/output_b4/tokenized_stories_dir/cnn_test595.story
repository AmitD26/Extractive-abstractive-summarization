-LRB- CNN -RRB- In a line-up of the world 's financial heavyweights , Christine Lagarde commands attention . At almost 6ft tall , with a head of silver hair and year-long tan , the first female to lead the International Monetary Fund instantly stands out in the notoriously masculine world of finance .

When the fifth most powerful woman in the world according to Forbes takes to the stage , journalists make sure their pens are poised . And in a time of economic austerity -- not to mention scandal allegations regarding the IMF 's former managing director -- the media spotlight on Lagarde is fierce .

But away from the camera lens , what personal events shaped the 59-year-old financial leader we know today ?

Here are five things you might not know about Lagarde .

`` Clearly the death of my father when I was 16 was a pivotal moment because you suddenly realize the hardship , the pain , '' Lagarde told CNN 's Gabriella Frias .

`` It certainly provided me with a better understanding of how tough it can be for a single mother to raise kids . ''

Lagarde won a bronze medal in the French National Championship when she was just 15-years-old .

Synchronized swimming might also have more in common with politics than you think . `` It was synchronized swimming that taught me : ` Grit your teeth and smile , ' '' Lagarde told the Guardian .

`` It was when I applied to the biggest law firm in Paris and I was told that I would be a great recruit and that I would be given good work to do -- but that I should never expect to make partnership because I was a woman , '' Lagarde told CNN .

`` I thought to myself : ` You do n't deserve me , I 'm going . ' And I had that sense of extraordinary freedom , walking down the staircase and thinking to myself : ` What would I do in this firm ? Why would I work with that kind of attitude ? ''

`` For a while I felt sort of held back and I decided : ` No , no , no , no , no , no you have to get over it , ' '' Lagarde told CNN .

`` You need to try to take the learnings from that failure and ask yourself : ` Why did I fail ? ' Then you learn about it and you move on . ''

It 's perhaps fitting that the IMF boss -- who oversees the world 's finances -- was born on such a neat date .

The eldest sister to three brothers , Lagarde was raised in Normandy to an English professor father and Latin teacher mother .
