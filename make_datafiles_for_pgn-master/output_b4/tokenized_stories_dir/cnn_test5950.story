Riverside , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A conservative county supervisor in Southern California wants to form the 51st state by seceding the region from California , saying the state 's problems require `` radical '' solutions .

`` Listen , I knew I 'd be criticized . I learned in my tenure of being a politician for 19 years , sometimes you have to do radical things to get people 's attention , '' Riverside County Supervisor Jeff Stone said on CNN Thursday .

`` We have hit a nerve with citizens who are just fed up with business as usual in the state , '' Stone said . `` I 'm talking about a secession plan from the state of California . ''

This week , the Riverside County Board of Supervisors gave the OK to Stone to hold a summit of California 's local leaders to discuss remedies for the state 's long list of woes -- including secession .

But the county board stopped short of endorsing Stone 's secessionist plan by insisting no taxpayer money be used for the conference .

Stone has come up with a name for the new state : South California . It would be composed of 13 largely Republican counties , most of which are inland along the Nevada and Arizona state lines . The plan would exclude Los Angeles County , but would include Orange and San Diego Counties , both on the coast .

Stone has a long list of grievances against the state and its legislators : high taxes and fees , inability to reform welfare programs , high unemployment and excessive regulations .

`` What the state has done is they 've been balancing their budgets on the backs of our local coffers . They 've been stealing our sales tax , property tax , '' Stone said . `` The bottom line for me and my constituents is jobs . We are sending jobs out of the state of California by the train load . ''

Riverside County is among the hardest hit communities by the recession and mortgage meltdown , leaving many communities pockmarked with vacant homes , Stone said .

`` We are the foreclosure capital of the world , '' Stone asserted . `` We have some areas of the county that have 25 % unemployment . The average in Riverside County is about 15 % . ''

Stone 's plan seems a long shot , one analyst said . There have been at least 27 efforts for secession within parts of California since the 1800s , and none has been successful .

Robert Melsh , a political science instructor at Mount San Jacinto College in San Jacinto , California , which is in Riverside County , said Stone 's plan stunned him , largely because of the high cost of putting a secessionist plan before voters . He called it a `` scare tactic . ''

`` Insanity , '' Melsh said . `` I mean this is major surgery where we need a Band-Aid .

`` It takes millions of dollars to get the signatures necessary to put up an initiative , '' Melsh added .

Melsh also raised the question of getting a 51st state 's government up and running .

`` Where is he going to put the capitol ? Disneyland ? '' Melsh said .

Stone , a pharmacist and owner of an innovative compounding pharmacy , said he drew the lines for a new state by picking 13 counties that were contiguous and fiscally conservative or moderate .

A date for the summit of local leaders has yet to be scheduled , he said .
