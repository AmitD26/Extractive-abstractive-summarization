-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In an exclusive interview with CNN 's Matthew Chance , Citibank CEO Vikram Pandit has said the beleaguered bank , which has received $ 45 billion in bailout money from the U.S. government , is on its way to financial recovery .

Pandit : `` We 've made a lot of progress in a very short period of time . ''

MC : Vikrim Pandit , you 've been named as one of the worst CEOs in America . There are calls for your resignation from Citi Group . Have you considered stepping down ?

VP : I have a job to do and I have n't finished it . I 'm going to keep doing the job . You know , we 've gone through enormous change at Citi . The management team was brought in during the crisis to clean up what happened with the crisis . And , the leadership team , our people have done a wonderful job , we 've made a lot of progress in a very short period of time . We have restored financial strength , we have restructured Citi , there 's still more work to do but we have a clear strategy , and a clear focus on the future . I keep going back to how much we 've accomplished in a very short period of time but really , all the credit goes to our people .

MC : But there have been such massive investor losses at Citi bank , losses which you did not anticipate . Should n't you be held ultimately accountable for that ?

VP : I came into the job and from day one I 've held myself accountable for restoring Citi to its right place . I 've held myself accountable for getting Citi through this economy , through the crisis that we 're in . Unfortunately , a lot of us inherited a lot of things . The new management team ... came in with a lot of assets particularly focused on the U.S. consumer . And these are losses that we 've had to take but we 've also made a lot of progress . We 've cut our cost structure by twenty-five percent , we 've reduced our balance sheet also by about twenty-five percent . Our riskiest assets have been sold for a lot more than that . We 've sold businesses , refocused the company and in the first quarter we did show a modest profit .

MC : But there 's already word that federal authorities in the United States are putting out their feelers , looking for possible successors to your position . Do you believe that you still have the full confidence of the U.S. government , which after all , is now a major shareholder in Citi Group ?

VP : You know speculation is only natural when we 've had the kind of losses that you 've talked about and until we 've had sustainable profitability , that does n't make it right . The most important part is that this management team and leadership team was brought in to address the issues at Citi and our people have done a wonderful job . What really counts is the confidence our people , our clients and our regulators around the world , including our primary regulators , have in the leadership of the company ... and the strategy that 's being laid out in order to restore Citi to its pre-eminence .

MC : Let 's talk a little about that strategy and for instance , the money for the past year or so that Citi Group has taken -- billions of dollars , tens of billions of dollars in tax payer 's money as a bail out . When will that money be given back ? Can it ever be repaid ?

VP : The government invested $ 45 billion in Citi . It has invested that amount in at least one other bank , it 's invested a lot of money into a lot of banks . All due to what happened in the financial markets , post-Lehman brothers disappearing , and the lack of confidence that created . We , and I 'm sure others are , thankful for the help we received and our goal is very clear , our goal is to repay every dollar as fast as we can with a great rate of return .

MC : What about the fact the government holds such a high percentage of stock ? Do you see that as a long term situation or do you think that sometime in the future , very near , when the government will cease to become the major shareholder ?

VP : A lot of extraordinary things have happened in this extraordinary market . Nobody , nobody believes that we 've gone through something that is normal , by any means . The government ownership stake is a result of our converting preferred stock , investment of the government and the common stock . The goal is very straightforward , the goal is to manage the company , to sustain profitability , create a rate of return , so that we can repay the government with a great rate of return and thank the taxpayer for the support that we receive .

MC : As a result of this crisis there have been calls for greater regulation in the financial services industry . Do you think it is now inevitable ?

VP : There is no question this has been an issue for governments through this entire crisis . And it is about the fact there was a large shadow banking system in the U.S. that was mostly not regulated , as an example , although that 's not the only example . I do think for capital markets to work well we need good governance and good governance is not always about good regulation . Good governance goes up and down every organization . It 's really about how countries come together to work together , so actually I 'm looking forward to an environment where the governance structure is stronger than the ones we 've gone through .

MC : Is there a fundamental problem with the ethics in this business ? Has the pursuit of profit gone too far ?

VP : It 's all back to governance is n't it ? And standards are part of governance as well and so when you think about the overall aspects of the government structure for the future , the market architecture for the national system for the future , you 've got to keep coming back . You have to take a look at all of it . You have to look at it right from the fact that certain central banks did n't think financial stability was part of its mandate all the way through . What are the right incentives ? And how do you think about compensating people ? We have to look at all of that -- and we are . I must say that we 've weathered the debate that we 've seen . We are getting at the answers , but most importantly we are making sure that all the right questions are getting asked .

MC : So what specific measures would you suggest to try and fix some of these problems that have occurred in the financial industry ?

VP : There are a lot of suggestions that have already been made . As a matter of fact we were the ones talking about how transparency is important . You have to attack market structure correctly , clearing houses , exchanges , have to have level playing fields on capital , accounting around the world . It 's important to understand that I 'm happy to have my 136 regulators around the world but we also need one overarching regulator , a systemic regulator that can actually help us and help the system aggregate what 's going on . There are suggestions that are not original necessarily . We may have been one of the first ones to talk about them but those are generally the sort of answers people are looking at and more importantly I think we need to debate this a little more .

MC : When will this crisis be over ? Do you see any signs , at this point , of a recovery ?

VP : What you have to understand is that , this is a significant shock to the world economy . Just think about it , when you look at the last 5 , 10 years there were two engines of growth . There was the U.S. consumer and credit creation . None of those are likely to be the engines of growth going forward . The world 's looking for a new business model . It 's about new engines of growth and it 's not only about creating stability and saying that we 're out of the crisis mode . But we all have work to do as we search for what the new business model is for the world . I am optimistic about the signs that we 're seeing , suggesting that stability is arriving .

We still have more to look at , to see that it 's here for sure , but I 'm optimistic that we might start seeing stability in the financial markets , which I think is good , but that 's stage one . Stage two is about what kind of world we want to have going forward , what 's the new business model ? And that 's what we 're really focused on at Citi . We are a global bank , and by the way , we have a very significant merging business heritage . Two things I 'm sure of : the merging markets growth and globalization of trade and finance . We 're squarely positioned against both of those . We 've taken the harder steps ... a lot of the world needs to do the same .
