UTTAR PRADESH , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On World Population Day this year India 's new health and welfare minister came out with an idea on how to tackle the population issue : Bring electricity to every Indian village so that people would watch television until late at night and therefore be too tired to make babies .

Could the remote control be a birth control method ?

That statement raised eyebrows across this vast country -- but what are the realities and reactions from families who make up the second largest population in the world ?

At 80-plus years old Omar Mohammed has never heard of population control .

He lives in India 's most populous state Uttar Pradesh and has certainly done his part in contributing to India 's burgeoning population .

`` Now you see I have 24 children , 13 boys and 11 girls , '' Omar says .

Omar believes only God can decide how many children you should have . He lifts his hands to the sky and says : `` This is His command . It 's not my doing , it 's His doing . ''

On the other hand there 's the Arora family in the capital city of Delhi . They have two children .

`` You ca n't even get enough water or electricity now . So its advisable that people have only two children and then they should stop having more kids . '' mother Anjana Arora says .

The Aroras know a little something about population issues ; their daughter was given the official title of India 's one billionth citizen when she was born in 2000 .

With family planning and free contraceptive programs the Indian government has long tried to encourage families to have only two children .

Overall government statistics show the birth rate is coming down . The numbers show 14 of India 's 35 states have reached the two child per family target .

But the push is failing in other states , especially in villages and among the poor and illiterate where the fertility rate is as high as 3.5 children per woman .

There are all kinds of reasons -- from the desire to continue having children until a son is born to lack of access to contraceptives .

The government 's concern is that a booming population will further test already scarce resources , greatly impact the environment , and make life even harder for the poor .

According to the United Nations , India is home to 50 percent of the world 's poor and on current projections , India will become the most populous country on earth sometime in the next 50 years , overtaking China .

Upon hearing about the latest idea to use electricity and television to give people something else to do besides procreate , mom Anjana Arora scoffed .

`` That 's a stupid thing '' she said in English then switched to Hindi `` The only way to change people 's mentality is through education . ''

But not everyone is writing the idea off . `` It 's an idea that can really work . '' says A.R. Nanda .

Years ago Nanda helped draft some of India 's population stabilization policies and he now runs the Population Foundation of India .

He says while education and access to health care is paramount , electrifying villages is not a bad idea .

`` It gives a message loud and clear that we need to do something for the people which is people-friendly and which in a way will keep their minds from taking irrational decisions about producing more babies , '' Nanda says .

He says there are studies that prove it . One such survey done in 2006 by an Italian sexologist reveals couples with televisions in their bedrooms had sex half as much as those without it .

That being said Omar Mohammed , the man with 24 children had a different take .

`` After watching TV , '' he says , `` when we look at scintillating things we will probably want to make more children . ''
