New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson is a gastronomic tour de force .

The Ethiopian-born chef has won three coveted James Beard Awards , an accolade described as `` like winning the Olympic gold medal for chefs , '' and has been celebrated as one of `` The Great Chefs of America '' by the Culinary Institute of America .

With three restaurants and cookbooks to his name , Samuelsson , 39 , is firmly established in the world of haute cuisine , so it was no surprise that he was chosen to cook for President Barack Obama 's first White House state dinner .

The dinner featured a seasonal menu reflecting American and Indian flavors in honor of the visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .

Samuelsson worked with first lady Michelle Obama to create a menu that included potato and eggplant salad , roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney , chickpeas and okra , green curry prawns and caramelized salsify with smoked collard greens .

It 's been a whirlwind rise to the top for the chef who says he developed an interest in cooking at just six years old .

But life has not always been easy for him or his family . Born Kassahun Tsegie in a small village north of Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , Samuelsson was three years old when he , his older sister and mother contracted tuberculosis during an epidemic in Ethiopia .

Admitted to hospital , Samuelsson and his sister Linda survived , but his mother was killed by the disease . After their mother 's death , a nurse took pity on the young siblings and found an adoption agency to register them , Samuelsson told CNN . Blog : Meeting Marcus Samuelsson

Months later , Swedish couple Anne Marie and Lennart Samuelsson adopted the children and they left Ethiopia for a life in Europe , which at times proved radically different for them .

Looking back on his upbringing , Samuelsson said : `` My mother was white , my father was white , we were mixed kids , mixed family . It was the norm , you know . Not until maybe you 're in your teens do you really start reflecting on that maybe that 's not the norm . ''

It was only later in life when his sister started to dig into the family history that Samuelsson discovered his biological father in Ethiopia was still alive .

Samuelsson told CNN : `` We found him and my step brothers and sisters . This is one of my biggest gifts to have met my birth father and my sisters and brothers and I feel extremely connected to them .

`` My father knew we were adopted . He knew that we were in Sweden but he just did n't know where , '' he added .

It was in his adoptive home that Samuelsson 's love of cooking was shaped and developed by his grandmother . He would spend hours in the kitchen with her and by the age of 16 had decided to become a world-class chef .

He attended the Culinary Institute in Gothenburg , and then worked in Switzerland , Austria and France before moving to the United States in 1991 where he was employed as an apprentice at acclaimed Scandinavian restaurant `` Aquavit '' in New York .

This was to be his launch pad to culinary fame . After four years at `` Aquavit , '' at the age of just 24 , Samuelsson was promoted to Executive Chef and his career skyrocketed .

Fifteen years on , Samuelsson has created his own brand , with three restaurants and a collection of cooking books and classes to his name . It 's been hard work but Samuelsson credits his success to his origins .

He told CNN : `` I always feel like the biggest luxury I have is that I am connected to poverty . I come from a clay house in the country in Addis . No water , no electricity , no nothing ... I think it is my responsibility to represent poverty . Talk about it and also show there 's lots of happy togetherness , family and love . ''
