-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Barcelona head coach Josep Guardiola hit back at his Real Madrid counterpart Jose Mourinho ahead of the European Champions League semifinal first leg between the two teams on Wednesday .

The tie at Madrid 's Santiago Bernabeu will be the third of four matches between the arch rivals , clashes which are known as `` El Clasico '' , in 18 days across three competitions .

Real recently defeated Spanish first division leaders Barca 1-0 in the Copa del Rey final on April 20 and it is comments made by Mourinho in the wake of that match which aggravated Guardiola .

`` Since he has chosen to to talk about me , I 'll do the same , '' former club captain Guardiola said on Barcelona 's official web site .

Is Jose Mourinho the master of mind games ?

'' -LSB- Wednesday -RSB- we 'll face each other on the pitch . He 's won his games off the pitch and I 'll give him his personal Champions -LSB- League -RSB- for that -- just take it home and enjoy it . ''

Portuguese boss Mourinho used his press conference ahead of the match to accuse Guardiola , 40 , of criticizing referees when they make correct decisions .

The former Inter Milan coach 's comments related to the Copa del Rey final , in which Barca had a goal from Spain forward Pedro correctly disallowed for offside .

`` There have been two groups of managers up until now , '' the one-time Chelsea coach Mourinho told Real 's official web site .

`` A quiet one who does n't talk about referees and a louder one , such as myself , that criticizes the referees when they make significant mistakes .

`` We have entered a new era following the statements made by Guardiola and there is now a third group . He is the only one in it as he criticizes the right calls made by referees . I had never seen anything like it before . ''

According to British newspaper The Guardian , Guardiola responded in strong fashion and said : `` In this room -LSB- Real 's press room -RSB- , he is the chief , the f ***** g man . In here he is the f ***** g man and I ca n't compete with him .

`` If Barcelona want someone who competes with that , then they should look for another manager . But we , as a person and an institution , do n't do that . ''

Guardiola , who was a Barca player when Mourinho was part of the club 's coaching staff between 1996 and 2000 , was unhappy with his opponent alleging he had targeted match officials .

`` I simply congratulated Madrid after the -LSB- Copa del Rey -RSB- final . If you think that his allegation that I always complain about the referees is true after you 've all heard me over the last three years , well there 's nothing I can do .

`` Off the pitch , against his media supporters , there 's nothing we can do to fight that . I 've seen it before with Mourinho , he did it at Chelsea and now he 's doing it here . ''

The Catalan club , who are three-time European champions , will be without Spain midfielder Andres Iniesta for the first match of the last-four tie .

The 26-year-old , who scored the winner for his country in the 2010 World Cup final against Netherlands , is out with an injury to his right calf , but club captain Carles Puyol should be fit for the match .

Real have won Europe 's premier club competition on nine occasions , but will be without Sami Khedira for Wednesday 's clash after the Germany international suffered a leg injury .

Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho will also miss the match through suspension .

The return leg is in Barcelona on May 3 , with the winner advancing to face Manchester United or Schalke in the final at Wembley Stadium , London on May 28 .
