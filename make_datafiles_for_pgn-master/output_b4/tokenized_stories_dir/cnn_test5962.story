-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A federal grand jury indicted four more people on charges involving the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai , India , that left more than 160 people dead .

The case is linked to David Headley , who pleaded guilty last year to all 12 charges against him in connection with the four-day siege on India 's financial capital and a plot to attack a Danish newspaper .

Headley was not charged in the new indictment , but his role is spelled out in detail throughout the charges that describe an extended plot involving years of surveillance , setting up a front organization to hide activities , getting money to pay for planning , and communications between some of the suspects and the Mumbai attackers as the siege took place .

The new indictment included charges of aiding and abetting the murder of U.S. citizens in India and conspiracy to bomb public places in India . Both carry a maximum penalty of life in prison or death .

In addition , some or all of the suspects in the new indictment were charged with conspiracy to murder and maim in India , conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism in India , conspiracy to murder and maim in Denmark and others that carry a maximum penalty of life in prison .

Named in the new indictment were Ilyas Kahmiri , Tahawwur Hussain Rana , Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed , Sajid Mir , Abu Qahafa , Mazhar Iqbal and an unidentified man referred to by the alias of Major Iqbal .

Rana , a Canadian citizen and Chicago resident , is the only suspect in U.S. custody . Rana , Kahmiri and Syed were named in previous indictments that charged Headley , who also lived in Chicago . The other suspects were all believed to live in Pakistan .

Kahmiri is a leader of the Pakistani terrorist group Harakat ul Jihad al Islami , or the Islamic Struggle Movement , and has close contact with a known al Qaeda leader , according to the indictment .

The four new suspects named in Monday 's indictment were Mir , Qahafa , Iqbal and the unidentified man referred to by his alias .

Headley , the son of an American mother and Pakistani father , was accused of extensive involvement in planning the devastating attacks on hotels in Mumbai , which the Indian government says were carried out by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba . At least six Americans were among the dead .

Headley initially pleaded not guilty to the charges , then changed his plea as part of a deal with the government to cooperate with investigators in exchange for a maximum possible sentence of life in prison . By pleading guilty , he also gave up his right to appeal . Headley 's actual sentence will depend on how much he cooperates with authorities .

The new indictment Monday charged that Headley , working in connection with the other suspects , scouted targets in Mumbai for more than two years to set up the November 2008 attacks . It included details of what happened that day , saying that `` during the course of attacks in Mumbai , the attackers were in telephonic contact with defendants Sajid Mir , Abu Qahafa and Mazhar Iqbal , all of whom were then located in Pakistan . ''

`` More specifically , during the course of the attacks , the attackers were advised to , among other actions , kill hostages , set fires and throw grenades , '' the indictment said . `` Sajid Mir also sought to arrange the release of a hostage in exchange for the release of a captured attacker . ''

It also accused Mir of working with Headley to plan a terrorist attack on a Danish newspaper , which was never carried out . The newspaper became the target of Muslim fury in 2005 after it published cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in a manner offensive to Muslims .
