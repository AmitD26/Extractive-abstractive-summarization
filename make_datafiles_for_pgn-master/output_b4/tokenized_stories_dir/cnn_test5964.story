CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Fridays are awesome ! Thank you for wrapping up your week with CNN Student News . I 'm Carl Azuz .

First Up : West Bank Settlements

AZUZ : First up , a White House meeting between President Obama and the head of the Palestinian Authority . President Mahmoud Abbas sat down with Obama yesterday , just as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did last week . They 're all discussing the same topic : possibilities for a Middle East peace plan . One of the big issues : Israeli settlements in the Palestinian-controlled West Bank . Obama and Abbas want Israel to stop settlement activity , but Netanyahu has pledged to expand it . Ben Wedeman is in the region , and reports on the situation there .

BEN WEDEMAN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : We 're right next to Ma'ale Adumim , which is the biggest Jewish settlement in the West Bank . Now , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said , he 's insisted , that he wants natural expansion , or growth , to occur in those settlements Which means that settlements like Ma'ale Adumim are going to get bigger and bigger . And that 's something the Palestinians are completely opposed to .

Now , what you see on the other side of this valley is the town , the Palestinian town of Eizariya , known from the Bible as Bethany . Now , this town is right up against Jerusalem , in fact many people consider it part of Jerusalem , but it 's separated from Jerusalem by the Israeli so-called security barrier , what the Palestinians call the apartheid separation wall . It can not expand . It can not have growth in the direction of Jerusalem because of the wall , and because of Ma'ale Adumim , it ca n't expand in that direction .

I 'm Ben Wedeman , CNN , reporting from East of Jerusalem on the occupied West Bank .

International Highlights

AZUZ : Catching up on a couple other international headlines , beginning with a series of deadly explosions in Pakistan . This took place last night in and around the city of Peshawar . At least eight people were killed in the violence and dozens of others were wounded . The attacks came one day after a suicide bombing in the Pakistani city of Lahore .

And parts of Honduras are recovering from a deadly earthquake . Reports yesterday evening indicated that five people had been killed and 17 others injured by the tremor . Officials say the quake , which struck early Thursday morning , registered a magnitude of 7.1 . It was followed 30 minutes later by a 4.8-magnitude aftershock .

Money Word

GEORGE RAMSAY , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Here 's the deal : Today 's Money Word is budget . It 's a financial plan that estimates income and expenses . Put that in your word bank !

Education Budget Cuts ?

AZUZ : The state of California is facing a budget crisis . The state is struggling with a multi-billion dollar deficit . In a recent special election , voters cast their ballots against some plans that Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger designed to help the state 's budget . Now , he says California has to make some severe cuts . Dan Simon explores how one might have a big impact on students .

DAN SIMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT , SAN FRANCISCO : Romell Moore grew up on the rough-and-tumble streets of Oakland , California . He says a strong grandmother kept him out of trouble .

DOROTHY MOORE , ROMELL MOORE 'S GRANDMOTHER : I 'm strict with him .

SIMON : When he graduates from high school next month -- he 's number three in his class -- Rommel would be the first person in his family to go to college . He 's been accepted at U.C. Santa Cruz .

ROMELL MOORE , HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR : It makes me feel good that I was doing all the right stuff and doing all the hard work to go , and maybe I can be a guidance to my young cousins and nephews that maybe they 'll want to go to college , too .

SIMON : He wants to become a lawyer , but that dream could be shattered because of California 's budget woes . The state facing an unprecedented deficit is looking at ways to save billions , and Governor Schwarzenegger has proposed slashing what are called Cal Grants , money that helps pay tuition for students from low income families . 200,000 students statewide could lose all or part of the Cal Grants they were counting on to pay for college this fall .

ROMELL MOORE : The whole way through school , the teachers and all that tell you as long as you get good grades and all that , the state and the system will find a way to send you to school .

SIMON : A promise that would have to be taken back if the proposed cuts happen . Without Cal Grants , Romell would lose nearly a third of the money for his $ 27,000 a year tuition and other expenses . Nancy Roman is the college counselor at Romell 's school . She says the ripple effects would be enormous .

NANCY ROMAN , COLLEGE COUNSELOR : Our main problem is just getting students to even look at college , because in their head , already , its been ingrained that it 's too expensive as well as with parents ; they do n't want students to apply , because , `` Oh , it 's too expensive , '' so we always talk about about Cal Grants .

SIMON : Romell has this message for lawmakers making the touch choices .

ROMELL MOORE : By helping me go to school they wo n't have another person on welfare just taking state money to survive . They 'll have another person working , making money for the state .

Shoutout

RAMSAY : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Koczot 's Social Studies classes at Broad Creek Middle School in Newport , North Carolina ! How are tropical depressions identified ? Is it by : A -RRB- Female names , B -RRB- Male names , C -RRB- Numbers or D -RRB- Letters ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Tropical depressions are assigned numbers ; they do n't get names until they become tropical storms . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout !

Hurricane Readiness

AZUZ : We already have our first of the year . Tropical Depression One formed off the eastern U.S. coast yesterday . Forecasters do n't expect it to be much of a threat . Of course , when these storms increase in intensity , they can become hurricanes , and as we 've seen in recent years , some can cause serious damage . John Zarrella looks at how prepared we are as hurricane season begins .

-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB-

JOHN ZARRELLA , CNN MIAMI BUREAU CHIEF AND CORRESPONDENT : Galveston : Rebuilding the seawall continues after Hurricane Ike . New Orleans : The fortified levees are inspected . Alabama : Rehearsal for a massive coastal evacuation . Days before the start of hurricane season , preseason drills and preparations are nearly complete . You 've been paying attention , right ? Surely , you 've heard the chorus of warnings . The U.S. Commerce Secretary .

GARY LOCKE , U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY : Public awareness and public preparedness are the best defenses against a hurricane . And that defense is more important than ever .

ZARRELLA : The New Orleans mayor .

MAYOR RAY NAGIN , -LRB- D -RRB- NEW ORLEANS : Each citizen must have a personal evacuation and recovery plan that accounts for your entire family .

ZARRELLA : The Hurricane Specialist .

JACK BEVIN , NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER : Plan now . Know what to do , so you 'll be ready when the storm threatens .

ZARRELLA : With so much drums beating , everyone living in hurricane-prone communities is ready , right ? Well , no . Not hardly . A new Mason-Dixon poll sponsored by the National Hurricane Survival Initiative found most people surveyed from Maine to Texas have done little to get ready , despite recent big ones : Katrina , Rita and , last year , Ike . 83 % of the 1,100 people surveyed have taken no steps to make their homes stronger . 66 % have no hurricane survival kits ; basics like food and water for three days . 53 % do n't know if their insurance policy covers hurricane damage . Every year , surveys find hurricane apathy pretty much unchanged , no matter how bad the season was . Sociologists chalk it up to human nature : procrastinate . Emergency managers say the `` uh oh '' factor will kick in when .

CHUCK LANZA , BROWARD COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGER : I saw people really do when the big ones are coming , they get prepared .

ZARRELLA : But this year , emergency managers fear because of the economy , many people ca n't afford to stock up .

LANZA : We 'd like people to set aside a little bit of money and buy a little bit of the supplies that they need now , and a little bit more every week as they get the money .

ZARRELLA : If they just ca n't , experts say now 's the time to come up with a plan to evacuate .

Off the Beaten Path

AZUZ : And finally today , we 're taking a look at some stories from the lighter side of news . So , prepare your taste buds for a tempting trip off the beaten path .

-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB-

AZUZ : He definitely ai n't the world 's fastest coffee server .

MIKE KEEN , BARISTA : You better never be a hurry when you 're in here .

AZUZ : But if you do n't need your espresso express-o , impress your senses with a picture-perfect latte ! Mike Keen is an artist and a barista at the same time . And if you 're into image and taste , you wo n't mind if this takes a latt-e time . For a different flavor ...

ALISON GROS , TEACHER : I made the deal , and I 'm just gon na have to accept the consequences .

AZUZ : But for most of us , this would be a deal breaker : worms for lunch . The New Orleans fourth grade teacher promised her students that she 'd have grubs for grub if they grubbed up good grades . They did their part , so bon appetit ! On the menu :

ELISE RONE , ENTOMOLOGIST : The mealworms are grubs that turn into beatles .

AZUZ : Well , they would have , if they could 've wormed their way out of this . Some students even stepped up to the table ! But if the worms ' woes seem in bad taste , they still make for one good segment . And who can argue with a fudge dessert ? At least , until you find out it 's filled with crickets . I guess there 'll be no chirping on this trip Off the Beaten Path .

AZUZ : From earthworm entrees to an insect ending ? That whole meal sounds like one big gag . Time to bug out for the weekend . Hope you have a great one .
