WASILLA , Alaska -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For more than two decades , vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin was a practicing Pentecostal .

She belonged to the Wasilla Assembly of God church in her hometown of Wasilla , Alaska . But though she attended the church from her teenage years to 2002 , the Alaska governor has n't talked much about her religion since joining the Republican ticket .

Palin 's former pastor , Tim McGraw , says that like many Pentecostal churches , some members speak in tongues , although he says he 's never seen Palin do so . Church member Caroline Spangler told CNN , `` When the spirit comes on you , you utter things that nobody else can understand ... only God can understand what is coming out of our mouths . ''

Some Pentecostals from Assembly of God also believe in `` faith healing '' and the `` end times '' -- a violent upheaval that they believe will deliver Jesus Christ 's second coming .

`` Our basic belief is that God is God and he knows where history is going and he has a purposeful plan and within the middle of that plan we live in an environment in our world where certain events would take place , '' says McGraw . `` Sarah was n't taught to look for one particular sign -- a cataclysmic sign . She knew as every Christian does ... that God is sovereign and he is in control . ''

McGraw says Palin 's Pentecostal roots may be being downplayed for a reason : `` I think there may be issues of belief that could be misunderstood or played upon by people that do n't know . ''

When asked by CNN about Palin 's beliefs , campaign spokeswoman Meghan Stapleton would only say the Republican vice presidential candidate has `` deep religious convictions . '' Watch how Palin 's religious roots formed ''

But how might her religious beliefs impact policy in Washington if the Republican ticket is successful ?

Palin 's former pastor says he has no doubt her religious beliefs will influence her decision making when it comes to government policy . Regarding her desire to build an Alaskan pipeline and explore for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , McGraw told CNN , `` Sarah knows that in Genesis , God creates the world and it 's very good and that we 're supposed to be caretakers in terms of not destroying the environment , so there 's no way that Sarah is going to exploit or damage the Alaska tundra in the name of getting gas if she does n't have to . '' Palin 's neighbors react to her swift rise

Six years ago , Palin left Assembly of God to join the non-denominational Wasilla Bible Church . But the Assembly of God says she still returns for special conferences and events , such as the graduation of ministry students in June . Video of a speech she gave at the church just two months before joining the Republican ticket is making the rounds on the Internet .

Speaking of the troops in Iraq , Palin says on the video , `` Pray for our military men and women who are striving do to what is right . Also for this country , that our leaders , our national leaders , are sending them out on a task that is from God . That 's what we have to make sure that we 're praying for -- that there is a plan , and that plan is God 's plan . '' Watch Palin speak at her former church ''

Her campaign says she does n't mix her faith with government business . But Palin did ask her audience to pray for a $ 30 billion natural gas pipeline she is on a mission to build in Alaska . In the video Palin says , `` I think God 's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas pipeline built . So pray for that ... I can do my job there in developing my natural resources . But all of that does n't do any good if the people of Alaska 's heart is not good with God . ''

McGraw , who was her pastor until 1998 and while she was mayor of Wasilla , says that Palin attended discipleship classes to strengthen her Pentecostal faith and that he counseled her on how to become a better leader .

`` Everyone has a way of viewing the world and Sarah does too and hers would be shaped by the common-sense practicality of how she 's been shaped by the Bible -- which is basically the world view that says God loves people , people can access him and he 's given us wisdom for living , '' McGraw says .

He says Alaska has seen Palin 's faith play out . As governor she passed ethics reform and took on what she 's referred to as a `` good-ol ' - boys network . '' However , she has said she would not seek to impose her religious views on others . iReport.com : Share your thoughts on Sarah Palin

`` I think one of the most obvious ways it plays out is what you 've seen -- is being courageous enough to deal with deception and corruption , '' McGraw says .

Palin now attends the Wasilla Bible Church . She was there on August 17 , just days before entering the national spotlight . David Brickner , the founder of Jews for Jesus , was a speaker . He told congregants that terrorist attacks on Israel were God 's `` judgment '' of Jews who have n't embraced Christianity . Brickner said , `` Judgment is very real and we see it played out on the pages of the newspapers and on the television . When a Palestinian from East Jerusalem took a bulldozer and went plowing through a score of cars , killing numbers of people . Judgment -- you ca n't miss it . ''

The McCain campaign says Brickner 's comments do not reflect her religious views . Palin 's spokeswoman says she is pro-Israel .

Pastor Ed Kalnin , the senior pastor of Palin 's former Pentecostal church , has also come under fire for his comments . In 2004 , he told church members if they voted for John Kerry for president , they would n't get into heaven . He told them , `` I question your salvation . ''

The Assembly of God issued a statement online in response , which said Kalnin was `` joking '' when he suggested `` Kerry supporters would go to hell . '' The statement went on to say : `` We do acknowledge in hindsight that it was careless , and we do apologize for that . This statement is not written as a defense , but as a clarification . ''

Palin has done little while in office to advance a social conservative agenda . She told The Associated Press in an interview in 2006 that she would not allow her personal beliefs to dictate public policy .

`` I 've honestly answered the questions on what my personal views are on things like abortion and a lot of controversial issues , '' Palin told AP . `` I wo n't hesitate to answer those questions about what my personal views are , but I am not one to be out there preaching and forcing my views on anyone else . '' But in the last week , her religious background and outlook has certainly spurred debate far beyond Alaska .
