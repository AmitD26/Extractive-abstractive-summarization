San Francisco -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Intel , which dominates the PC market but has struggled to break into smartphones , is getting a hand from Google .

Upcoming versions of Android , the No. 1 smartphone operating system from Google , will be compatible with Intel processors , the companies announced at Intel 's developer conference on Tuesday .

`` We want to make Intel architecture the platform of choice for smartphones , '' Intel CEO Paul Otellini said onstage . `` Every time we have collaborated with Google , good things have come out of it . ''

The partnership will aid Intel in delivering on its promise to finally release smartphones with its technologies by the middle of 2012 .

Google may benefit from accommodating a company that has significant influence in computers , which is the market Google is struggling to break into with its Chromebook project . The two companies already collaborate on that laptop operating system .

`` The partnership has been great , '' said Andy Rubin , Google 's executive for mobile development , who took the stage at Intel 's conference to announce the deal .

In his keynote , Otellini touted Intel 's Ultrabook concept , which the company has been reportedly nudging partners to embrace . The laptop concept facilitates very thin , light and affordable computers with batteries that can last for about a full day on a single charge . They look similar to Apple 's MacBook Air , which uses Intel 's Core processor .

Otellini also discussed a new processor , slated for 2013 , called Haswell . Devices with the chip can remain connected to the Internet in standby mode for 10 days before the battery depletes , he said . Haswell will be tailored to Ultrabooks and tablets running Windows 8 , the new operating system Microsoft was showing at the same time at its own conference in Anaheim , California .

`` Computing means a lot more than just computers , '' Otellini said . `` Just as computing has evolved , so too has Intel 's architecture . ''

Intel 's recent focus on reducing energy consumption , thereby improving battery life , should bolster its efforts in smartphones , analysts say . The company is also working on more compact chips , which it is calling `` 3-D transistors '' because of the unique way the microscopic parts are situated .

Google and Intel did not say which chip will power upcoming Android phones or which manufacturers have agreed to make devices for it . Most smartphones and tablets use chips designed by ARM Holdings , which are popular for their efficiency . The next version of Android for phones and tablets , called Ice-Cream Sandwich , will debut next month or in November , Google has said .
