-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The terrorist group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has confirmed the death of U.S.-born militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki , calling him a martyr , according to a statement posted Sunday on jihadi internet forums .

Al-Awlaki was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen on September 30 , but American officials said internet postings following his death indicated many who share his ideas did not believe he had been killed and were seeking confirmation . Another American named Samir Khan and two other people also died , officials said . Khan was the co-editor of the terrorist network 's English-language online propaganda and recruiting magazine , Inspire .

The AQAP `` eulogy '' states that while the United States killed al-Awlaki , it `` can not kill his ideas , '' according to an English translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group , which monitors jihadi forums .

The statement also picks up on a theme being discussed in the United States : whether the United States had the right to target and kill al-Awlaki without a legal trial and guilty verdict . The controversy is complicated by the fact al-Awlaki was a U.S. citizen .

The message said the United States killed al-Awlaki and Khan but `` did not prove the accusation against them , and did not present evidence against them . '' The statement claims such actions go against the values the U.S. espouses .

The New York Times reported Sunday that the Justice Department prepared legal guidance in the summer of 2010 which said the United States could kill al-Awlaki if it was not possible to capture him .

In Sunday 's message , AQAP also promised to `` retaliate soon '' for the deaths of al-Awlaki and the three others . The U.S. issued a worldwide alert earlier this month warning of `` the potential for retaliation against U.S. citizens and interests '' following al-Awlaki 's killing .

Born in Las Cruces , New Mexico , al-Awlaki lived in the United States until the age of 7 , when his family returned to Yemen . He returned to the United States in 1991 for college and remained until 2002 .

During his stay in the United States , he served as an imam in California and Virginia , and interacted with three of the men who went on to become September 11 , 2001 , hijackers , according to the 9/11 Commission report . He publicly condemned the attack afterward .

U.S. officials say he recruited Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab , the Nigerian man known as the underwear bomber , who was charged with trying to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight as it landed in Detroit on December 25 , 2009 .

The militant cleric is also said to have exchanged e-mails with accused Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan , who is accused of killing a dozen fellow soldiers in Texas .
