Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Los Angeles elementary school teacher allegedly took bondage photos of more than two dozen students in his classroom , including some with suspected semen-filled spoons at their mouths , investigators said Tuesday .

The young students `` did n't realize they were victimized , '' Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Sgt. Dan Scott told CNN Tuesday .

`` They thought they were being blindfolded and gagged as a game , '' he said . `` And they were rewarded with cookies or spoons full of sugar -LRB- but -RRB- they did not realize the spoon contained semen . ''

The photographs also showed `` a large 3-inch cockroach that would crawl on their face , '' Scott said .

Mark Berndt , 61 , was arrested on child molestation charges at his Torrance , California , home Monday and is being held pending $ 2.3 million bond in a Los Angeles County jail , according to Sheriff 's Lt. Carlos Marquez .

He is scheduled to make a first appearance before a judge Wednesday morning on 23 counts of lewd acts on a child , according to the county 's district attorney .

CNN was not able to immediately identify or reach Berndt 's lawyer .

While the investigation began more than a year ago , the arrest came soon after lab testing matched Berndt 's DNA with semen found on a spoon recovered from his classroom , Scott said . Investigators persuaded the suspect to voluntarily give them a DNA sample just two months ago , he said .

The 30-year teaching veteran was removed from his job at Miramonte Elementary School in south Los Angeles on January 7 , 2011 , the day the sheriff 's department told the school district about the investigation , Los Angeles School Superintendent John Deasy said .

`` I am sickened and horrified by the behavior of Mark Berndt . This individual and his conduct do not reflect on the quality of the teachers who work so hard on behalf of the students in the Los Angeles Unified School District , '' Deasy said in a written statement .

The probe started when a film processor gave investigators `` over 40 photographs depicting children in a school classroom , with their eyes blindfolded and mouths covered with tape , '' the sheriff 's statement said .

`` Investigators learned that some of the photos depicted suspect Mark Berndt with his arm around the children , or with his hand over their mouths , '' it said .

Some photos show female students with `` what appeared to be a blue plastic spoon , filled with an unknown clear/white liquid substance , up to their mouths as if they were going to ingest the substance , '' the statement said .

Other photos showed `` children with large live Madagascar-type cockroaches on their faces and mouths , '' it said .

Investigators , who interviewed more than 80 current and former students and school employees , identified 23 boys and girls then between the ages of 7 and 10 years old as victims in crimes that are believed to have been committed between 2005 and 2010 , it said .

A search of Berndt 's home found more than 100 more similar photographs depicting children and a video depicting adult sexual `` bondage '' activity `` which mirrored the bondage-type photos of the children , '' investigators said .

The film processor later gave investigators an additional 250 photographs , it said .

About 10 children seen in the more than 400 images have not yet been identified , it said .

`` Early in the investigation , Special Victims Bureau detectives recovered a blue plastic spoon and an empty container from the trash within the suspect 's classroom , '' the sheriff 's statement said . `` The recovered items tested positive for semen . Through further investigation , the suspect 's DNA was obtained and tested , and -LRB- investigators -RRB- determined that it matched that of the DNA profile found on the spoon and container . ''

Investigators did not reveal the contents of the fluid to the children or tell them that the case involved child molestation allegations , Scott said .
