TBILISI , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The leaders of a former Eastern Bloc nation and four former Soviet republics showed support for Georgia in its conflict with Russia at a massive rally in Georgia 's capital Tuesday night .

The leaders of five nations stand on stage with Georgia 's president during a rally in Tbilisi .

The presidents ' appearances came shortly before France 's leader announced that Georgia had accepted a Russian-French plan to end the conflict .

Thousands cheered as the presidents of Poland , Ukraine , Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia stood with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili at a rally in Tbilisi , Georgia , late Tuesday .

Like the latter four , Georgia is a former Soviet republic . At the rally , Saakashvili said the countries represented `` the new Europe , '' and said Russia was trying to occupy `` a real European country '' when fighting started last week .

The European Union and the United States have accused Russia of infringing on Georgia 's sovereignty . At the rally , Estonia 's president , Toomas Ilves , said that `` if you do not believe in freedom and democracy , you do n't belong in Europe . ''

`` It 's only you people who believe in democracy and freedom that belong in Europe , '' Ilves said .

Russia 's ambassador to the United Nations , Vitaly Churkin , dismissed the presidents ' appearance at the rally as `` rhetoric . ''

Churkin offered harsh words for Saakashvili , calling him an `` inadequate '' leader .

`` I think Georgian authorities must put an end to the rhetoric and get back to serious business , '' Churkin told CNN , referring to a six-point plan announced by the Russian and French presidents earlier in the day that aims to settle the conflict over Georgia 's separatist territories .

Later , French President Nikolas Sarkozy said Saakashvili had agreed to the plan , in which Russia would agree to conclude military operations , return its armed forces to the line preceding last week 's start of the conflict and not use force again in Georgia .

The plan stops short of specifically addressing the issue of Georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .

Asked on CNN 's `` Situation Room '' whether Moscow wants Saakashvili removed from Georgia , Churkin replied , `` It is our recommendation . ''

`` He has performed some horrific acts toward the people of South Ossetia , some major crimes against humanity have been committed which have been qualified as genocide and ethnic cleansing . It would be good for everybody -- him , his country and the international community -- for him to go . ''

But , Churkin added , `` We are not going to deal with him directly . ''

Violence has raged since Thursday , when Georgia launched a crackdown on separatist fighters in autonomous South Ossetia , where most people have long supported independence .

Russia , which supports the separatists , responded Friday , sending tanks across its border into South Ossetia . The conflict quickly spread to parts of Georgia and to Abkhazia , another separatist region .

Saakashvili accused Russia of provoking the war to justify a full-scale invasion of the former Soviet state . The Russians said Saakashvili attacked first in an attempt to gain control of South Ossetia .

Hours before appearing with the five presidents Tuesday , Saakashvili made a separate address to the tens of thousands of people rallying in front of the parliament building in Tbilisi .

Waving above the crowd during the rally were dozens of flags : red-and-white Georgian ones ; a few red , blue and-orange striped banners of Armenia ; and at least two American flags .

Banners reading `` Stop Russia ! '' were seen in the crowd as well as others showing a picture of a tank with a red X through it that said , `` Free us from Russian war . '' Watch President Saakashvili 's address ''

Another said , `` Soldiers ! The whole Georgia is with you ! '' One person held a poster of the Russian flag with a Nazi swastika imposed on it . Watch Georgians rally in the capital ''

`` This is the nation of Georgia and , you , all Europeans see that we do n't surrender . ... If you want to learn something about freedom , come to Georgia . Long live Georgia , '' one speaker said .
