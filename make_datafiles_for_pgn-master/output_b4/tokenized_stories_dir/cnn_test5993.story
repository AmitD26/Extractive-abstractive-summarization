London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Energy giant Total was trying Wednesday to contain a gas leak that forced the evacuation of a platform off the coast of Scotland .

A union representing workers on the rig warned there was an `` urgent need '' to stop the leak , which began Sunday .

`` If the gas cloud somehow finds an ignition source , we could be looking at complete destruction , '' said Jake Molloy , an official with the National Union of Rail , Maritime and Transport Workers .

`` This is an unprecedented situation and we really are in the realms of the unknown , '' Molloy said of the leak from the Elgin platform in the North Sea , about 150 miles -LRB- 240 km -RRB- east of the Scottish city of Aberdeen .

But oceanographer Simon Boxall said the risk of explosion may not be as high as initially feared .

`` Initially the risk of explosion was seen as being very high . There were reports coming through of a large gas cloud enveloping the whole rig , '' he told CNN .

But the fact that there has been no blast when the flare on the gas rig is still burning `` obviously contradicts the idea that there was a very high risk of explosion , '' he said .

`` Perhaps the quantity of gas is not that great as first thought , '' he said .

For the moment , the wind seems to be blowing the gas cloud away from the flare on the Elgin rig .

Nearly 240 workers were taken off the rig as the problem developed Sunday , Total said in a statement .

`` Investigations are ongoing to analyze the causes and to determine the remediation of the gas leak , '' the company said .

Total confirmed there was a `` sheen on the water in the vicinity of the platform , '' but said there was no indication of environmental damage . There have been no injuries , the company said .

Steve Todd , national shipping secretary for the National Union of Rail , Maritime and Transport Workers , said that while the workers were safely evacuated , they are being kept in the dark about what happened .

More information is needed on what measures are being taken to prevent such a leak occurring again , he told CNN , speaking from Brussels , Belgium .

`` We really need reassurances before anyone is put back out there that the danger has been cleared up altogether , '' he said .

Shell partially evacuated two of its nearby platforms , Shearwater and Hans Deul , as a `` purely precautionary '' measure , it said .

The Shearwater crew was reduced from 90 to 38 , and the Hans Deul crew is in the process of being reduced from 106 to 38 . Drilling was suspended on the Hans Deul rig , Shell UK said .

The Elgin leak has echoes of the BP Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico , but there are significant differences . The Elgin is in significantly shallower water , which could make problems easier to fix , but it is leaking gas , rather than oil . Gas catches fire much more easily .

`` This is nothing on the scale of the Gulf spill two years ago , '' Boxall said . `` This is a relatively light spill . The gas itself is dispersing quite rapidly . ''

But there is one parallel , he pointed out .

`` Ironically , it sounds as if , just like with the Deepwater Horizon , they were closing off a well and somewhere along the line something went wrong , '' he said .

`` The hope is that there is so little gas pressure in there that it will just blow itself out , '' he said of the Elgin spill . Failing that , Total may have to dig a bypass well to close off the leak from another angle , as BP did with the Gulf spill , he said .

Any effect on the environment is likely to be strictly local , he predicted .

Total 's share price fell 7 % Tuesday on news of the leak , but market analyst firm Jeffries International said Wednesday that it thought the market had overreacted .

The company 's value continued to fall on Wednesday , but not as sharply . It was down about 1 % from the day before as of Wednesday afternoon in France , where it is traded .

The North Sea was the scene of the world 's worst offshore rig disaster , the Piper Alpha explosion , which killed 167 people in 1988 .
