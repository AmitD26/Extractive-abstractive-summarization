BEIJING , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If 63-year-old Chinese scholar Zhou Duo had his way , he would be on hunger strike on June 4 , sitting quietly through the day at Purple Bamboo Park , 20 minutes ' taxi ride from Beijing 's Tiananmen Square .

Zhou Duo wants to mark the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown with a hunger strike .

His aim : to mark the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown and to dramatize his defiant call for answers from Chinese authorities .

`` What is the truth ? '' he pressed rhetorically , as he discussed his plans with CNN a week earlier . `` How many people were in fact robbed of their lives ? The truth remains unknown , because the Chinese government has suppressed information about the truth on June 4th . ''

On that day 20 years ago , Chinese troops in armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled toward Tiananmen Square . That was where Zhou , along with three other intellectuals , including Taiwanese singer-composer Hou Dejian , were on the second day of a hunger strike to show solidarity with student protesters . The soldiers , on strict orders to clear Tiananmen Square of demonstrators , had forced their way through the city 's main thoroughfare . Along the way , they met fierce resistance from students and city residents who barricaded the streets , so they fired at them . When the firing stopped , hundreds if not thousands of people lay maimed or dead .

A few hours past midnight on June 4 , Zhou and the protesters on the square found themselves surrounded by troops and tanks , and yet several holdouts wanted to `` resist till death . '' Sensing a sure bloodbath , Zhou and Hou appeased the hotheads and took control of their ranks . Gingerly , the two approached army officers and negotiated an agreement that allowed the demonstrators to withdraw peacefully . After they dispersed , some stayed home , some were arrested , and others became fugitives .

Three days later , Zhou went into hiding after he learned that the computer company he worked for as a policy planner had become the target of a witch hunt . Weeks later , police caught the bespectacled sociologist . He was detained but was not formally charged or tried . He was released months later .

Any regrets ?

`` None at all , '' Zhou said firmly . `` I would regret enormously if I had n't done what I did and if had n't saved the lives of so many people -LRB- on the square -RRB- . This single reason is enough . Had I not done that , I would be hitting my head against the wall every day . ''

Despite the painful memories , Zhou said , he remains cautiously optimistic about how grassroots activism has grown in China .

`` There is a huge difference now compared with 20 years ago , '' Zhou told CNN two weeks before the June 4 anniversary . `` I think the citizens are becoming more aware of their rights . It 's especially shown in the ranks of the NGOs -LRB- nongovernment organizations -RRB- , lawyers and intellectuals . This is an important sign that the citizens ' consciousness has waken up in China . ''

Accordingly , Zhou has sought to abide by laws and regulations . A week before the June 4 anniversary , Zhou prepared to drive to a police station to apply for a permit to conduct his day-long hunger strike . He wrote an application , even detailing that he would simply sit quietly in the park , carrying a banner that would read : `` Publicize the truth of June 4 -- reach the goal of reconciliation of society ! ''

But Zhou did not even make it to the station . Police showed up at his home and talked him and his wife into going along with them for a `` vacation '' at a government-owned hostel . Reached by phone on June 3 , Zhou 's wife said good-naturedly : `` We are both fine . We are having a good time teaching the police about democracy . ''

She said they expected to return to the city a week later , after the June 4 anniversary jitters had subsided .
