-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- AC Milan withstood a brave comeback from Arsenal to advance to the quarterfinals of the Champions League Tuesday despite a 3-0 defeat in the second leg at the Emirates .

The Italian champions had led 4-0 from the first leg last month and few bar the most optimistic of Arsenal fans gave Arsene Wenger 's men any hope of retrieving the deficit .

But first-half goals from Laurent Koscielny , Tomas Rosicky and captain Robin van Persie gave the English Premier League side the perfect platform to complete a remarkable recovery .

Koscielny headed home from a corner , Rosicky took advantage of a defensive mistake after a Theo Walcott run and van Persie slotted home a penalty after the excellent Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain was fouled .

Milan were all at sea , but regrouped strongly after the break and blunted the Arsenal onslaught .

Van Persie uncharacteristically fluffed the best chance for the home side to make it 4-4 on aggregate , but after fine work by Gervinho his effort was saved by Christian Abbiati .

`` I felt he wanted to chip the keeper because he was down but Abbiati got up very quickly but he reacted well and unfortunately we could n't score , Wenger told Sky Sports .

`` I hoped in the final 10 or 15 minutes to create some more goal chances , but it did n't happen . ''

At the other end , Zlatan Ibrahimovic came to life and twice came close to scoring the Milan goal which would have completely killed off the tie .

But at the finish it was the Milan players who were celebrating , while Arsenal will be boosted in their challenge for a Champions League spot in the EPL and remain in the FA Cup .

In Tuesday 's other last 16 tie , Benfica overturned a 3-2 deficit from their first leg against Zenit St Petersburg to win 2-0 in Lisbon and go through 4-3 on aggregate .

Maxi Pereira 's goal in first-half injury-time set them on their way with Nelson Oliveira secured the outright win in the second minute of added time .
