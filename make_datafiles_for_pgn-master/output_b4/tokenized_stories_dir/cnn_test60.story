Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi went on the attack Tuesday , pushing opposition fighters back to the outskirts of a key oil town , rebels said .

Also Tuesday , world diplomats met in London to discuss the future of the North African nation .

Opposition fighters in Bin Jawad battled Gadhafi forces and came under a hail of artillery and rocket attacks , a rebel source said . CNN saw rebel fighters streaming back out of the city , beating what looked to be a hasty retreat . One said the barrage was too much for the opposition to withstand , and that Gadhafi loyalists had infiltrated Bin Jawad .

Rebel forces regrouped in the nearby city of Ras Lanuf , a key oil town that they said they seized on Sunday . They came under heavy fire on the western edge of that city , said the rebels , who responded in kind , firing back with whatever weapons were available .

Tuesday 's fighting marked a reversal of the momentum of the opposition , which until recently had faced relatively little resistance in its westward march .

Elsewhere in Libya , three loud explosions were heard in Tripoli . The blasts came within about a 20-minute span and were the first time since the uprising began that such blasts were heard during daylight in the Libyan capitol .

On state television , a bulletin attributed to a `` military source '' said that military and civilian locations were bombed in Tripoli `` by the crusader colonial aggression . ''

It was not immediately clear where the explosions actually took place .

To the east , Libyan forces continued to pound parts of the city of Misrata Tuesday , with tanks firing mortar shells and troops using heavy artillery in an effort to retake control of the city , a witness told CNN .

Coalition planes circled overhead but did not strike the tanks , he said .

The day after Gadhafi 's regime tried to convince journalists that it was in control of Misrata by taking them on a trip to part of the city -- but not allowing them into the city center -- his troops were killing and wounding civilians and evicting thousands of people from their homes , the witness told CNN .

`` The carnage and the destruction and the human suffering from both the evictions and ... terrorizing the city -- it 's beyond imagination , '' said the witness , an opposition councilman in Misrata , in western Libya . `` It 's incredible . ''

CNN could not independently verify the witness ' descriptions .

Fierce battles on the ground raged in Libya as diplomats from around the world met in London to decide next steps . More than 40 foreign ministers and representatives attended the Tuesday conference , including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Chairman of the African Union Jean Ping .

`` The purpose of this conference is to broaden and deepen the coalition effort , '' said British Foreign Secretary William Hague . `` We all want to see that cease-fire . We all want to see Gadhafi go . Those things are clear . But once we have that cease-fire , we have something to work with . ''

Gadhafi has showed no sign of letting up his effort to crush the rebellion , which seeks an end to his nearly 42 years in power .

Organizers of the conference said it will look for ways to strengthen the U.N. Security Council resolution approved on March 17 that created a no-fly zone above Libya and mandated the protection of civilians . It will also search for urgent ways to get humanitarian aid to war-torn cities like Misrata .

Opposition fighters have credited coalition airstrikes with helping them advance in their rebellion , but say more are needed .

The witness in Misrata on Tuesday pleaded for coalition forces to strike Gadhafi 's forces in that city to `` save Misrata from a massacre . ''

Off the coast of Misrata , U.S. military planes fired at three Libyan boats , destroying one and damaging the other two , military officials said in a statement Tuesday . The Libyan ships were targeted because of reports that they were firing indiscriminately at merchant vessels in the port of Misrata on Monday , the statement said .

Libyan state TV had a banner Tuesday saying , `` Civilian and military locations in Misrata , Tripoli , Zaltin , Mazda and al-Watiyaare being bombed by the crusaders and colonial enemies . ''

The central group representing the opposition in Libya and working to plan a new government if Gadhafi were to fall issued a statement Tuesday describing its `` vision of a democratic Libya . ''

`` We have learned from the struggles of our past during the dark days of dictatorship that there is no alternative to building a free and democratic society and ensuring the supremacy of international humanitarian law and human rights declarations , '' the statement from the Interim National Council said .

The group , representing numerous areas throughout Libya , has been meeting in Benghazi .

In the statement , the council vowed to draft a constitution , guarantee key rights to every Libyan citizen , respect freedom of expression and establish `` a state that draws strength from our strong religious beliefs in peace , truth , justice , and equality . ''

Much of the statement focused on promises to build a better economy that would eradicate poverty . About a third of Libyans live at or below the national poverty line . The declaration makes no reference to religious freedom .

Mahmoud Shammam , a spokesman for the council , said the future government would try members of the Gadhafi regime , not `` hang people in the street . ''

`` We are going to establish law and order , '' he said in London . `` We are not going to take revenge on the streets of Tripoli and Benghazi . ''

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of the council Tuesday at the meeting , part of a U.S. effort to expand ties with rebel leaders fighting to oust Gadhafi . It was the second meeting in less than two weeks between Clinton and the Libyan Interim National Council 's Mahmoud Jabril , a former head of Libya 's economic planning council .

Clinton warned that military action against Gadhafi would continue until he `` ceases his attacks on civilians , pulls his troops back from places they have forcibly entered , and allows key services and humanitarian assistance to reach all Libyans . ''

President Barack Obama gave interviews to all three major U.S. television networks Tuesday , in which he made it clear he would be open to arming the rebel fighters .

`` I 'm not ruling it out , but I 'm also not ruling it in , '' Obama told NBC in one of the separate interviews he gave the day after a nationally televised speech on the Libya situation .

`` I think it 's fair to say that if we wanted to get weapons into Libya , we probably could , '' Obama told ABC . `` We 're looking at all our options at this point . ''

The United States will also send a liaison to Benghazi to open up a more direct line of communication with members of the opposition , a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday . The official did not say when .

The U.S. government has spent about $ 550 million on the Libya effort , the Pentagon said Tuesday , adding that about 60 % of that went for munitions . Another $ 40 million is expected to be spent over the next three weeks . After that , costs are expected to be about $ 40 million per month , said Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Kathleen Kesler .
