-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Anyone who has been deceived by a punchbowl at a party , or a diet-busting cake , will recognize the value of knowing exactly what you are eating . A new pocket scanner promises to deliver that power by giving the user an instant breakdown of alcohol , sugar , or calorie content before they consume .

The USB-shaped ` SCiO ' device was launched through a Kickstarter campaign earlier in the week and reached its target within 24 hours , with devices available for as little as $ 149 .

The product of Israeli start-up Consumer Physics , it uses spectrometry to read the `` molecular fingerprint '' of an object , shining near Infra-Red light on it which stimulates the molecules and then records their reactions .

An accompanying app then displays the nutrient values on a smart phone , measuring fat , protein and carbohydrate levels to the milligram , as well as overall quality .

This underlying technology has been industry standard for decades in quality control of oil , sewage or chemicals . But SCiO is the first portable spectrometer for consumers , and offers far greater versatility of application . The product , developed by engineers from leading institutions such as MIT and Harvard , has been tested in live demonstrations with high accuracy . The final product will be sent to backers this year .

`` The first application is for consumers interested to know the nutritional value of what they 're eating '' , Dror Sharon , CEO of Consumer Physics , told CNN . `` I often meet people who do n't know what 's in cheese , fruit and vegetables and have a hard time discerning what they should eat .

`` I think this can be empowering if people want to change their intake , whether for medical reasons or training , and can be educational in teaching us to make better nutritional choices . ''

Uses do not end with food . Apps are available to analyze medicine or the health of houseplants . SCiO could be a protective tool for clubbers keen to check if their drink has been spiked , or patients to see if their pills are as advertised .

The device could be applied to the environment as well as consumed objects -- an athlete could scan their track or field in order to optimize its playability .

Sharon acknowledges the device has limitations , suggesting it can identify elements between `` 0.1 % to 1 % '' of the overall chemical makeup , and that it would need to be more robust to be an effective guide for allergy sufferers . The sensor can also be disrupted by interference such as packaging .

Yet hand held spectrometry still represents a long sought-after breakthrough for the industry . `` The challenge has always been calibration that works for different materials '' , says Dr Bryan Curtiss , molecular scientist and head of technology at spectrometry firm ASDI .

`` What they 've done is quite an ingenious approach as the device only measures the spectrum , and then applies calibration -LRB- in the algorithm cloud -RRB- and sends results , so the lab system and software have been centralized . ''

The success of the Kickstarter campaign indicates a substantial market , and addresses a genuine need says Quantified Self technologist Maarten Van Braaben : `` This is answering a question as food checking has never been automated well , and this offers a less tedious process . ''

SCiO will have rivals in this new marketplace . Canadian company TellSpec will launch their own hand held spectrometer this year , focused on food , while calorie sensing wristbands such as the HealBeGoBe are also close to market .

Van Brabben foresees further innovation with the technology . `` If you could have the same spectrometry analysis through the camera on your phone that would be a popular concept , and I think it 's not far off , perhaps two or three years . ''

Consumer Physics are providing a ` maker kit ' for developers to use their technology in any form they wish , and Sharon hopes they can become as ubiquitous as smart phones with billions in circulation .
