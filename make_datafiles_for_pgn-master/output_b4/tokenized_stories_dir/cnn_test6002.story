-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Agnieszka Radwanska has beaten Maria Sharapova in the final of the Miami Masters to claim her second title of the year .

The Pole 's straight sets 7-5 6-4 victory over the world No. 2 on Saturday is the biggest of her career to date and moves her up to fourth in the world rankings .

The 23-year-old , who did n't drop a set throughout the tournament , now joins world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka as the only woman to have won multiple titles on the WTA Tour in 2012 .

`` I got a lot of good wins this year against top players . I was trying from the beginning to focus on my serve , put my first serve in and go for it . I think I did a really good job today and the serve was the key . '' Radwanska said afterwards .

Radwanska needed 57 minutes to clinch a first set marked by few winners and a string of unforced errors .

Sharapova 's tally of 26 compared with Radwanska 's eight eventually told as the Pole broke the Russian 's serve in the 12th game .

Despite being less error-strewn the second set took a similar course with Sharapova -- who has now lost four finals in Miami -- losing her serve in the 10th game to hand Radwanska the title .

`` I thought she played extremely well , was very consistent , got that extra ball back and I made that extra mistake . She did n't give me many errors , '' Sharapova said .

The victory is the Pole 's second victory over Sharapova in nine meetings -- the only other triumph came at the U.S. Open in 2007 .

The win adds to the title she won in Dubai last month where she defeated Germany 's Julia Goerges in the final .
