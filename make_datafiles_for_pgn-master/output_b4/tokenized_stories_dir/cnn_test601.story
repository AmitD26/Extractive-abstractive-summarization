-LRB- CNN -RRB- A video file posted online Tuesday purports to relay a new message from Japanese ISIS hostage Kenji Goto : He and a captive Jordanian military pilot will be killed in the next 24 hours if Jordan does n't release a convicted would-be suicide bomber .

It is the second purported message from Goto in four days . If authentic , it is the first time ISIS is publicly linking the fates of Goto and the captive Jordanian pilot , Moaz al-Kassasbeh , whom ISIS captured after his jet crashed last month in Syria .

The latest file , posted to YouTube and distributed on social media by known ISIS supporters , appears to show a static image of Goto , alone , in handcuffs and wearing orange , holding a picture of who appears to be al-Kassasbeh .

Over the image , a voice purporting to be Goto 's restates Saturday 's apparent ISIS proposal : Goto would go free if Jordan releases longtime prisoner Sajida al-Rishawi .

This time , it 's still a one-for-one swap , but now both the lives of Goto and the Jordanian pilot are threatened if it does n't go through . CNN can not independently verify the authenticity of Tuesday 's message .

`` I 've been told this is my last message , and I 've also been told that the barrier obstructing my freedom is now just the Jordanian government delaying the handover of Sajida , '' the voice says in English in Tuesday 's post . `` Tell the Japanese government to put all the political pressure on Jordan . ''

`` Her for me -- a straight exchange , '' the voice says . `` Any more delays by the Jordanian government will mean they are responsible for the death of their pilot , which will then be followed by mine .

`` I only have 24 hours left to live , and the pilot has even less . ''

The nearly two-minute video , posted Tuesday morning ET , makes no mention of releasing pilot al-Kassasbeh , even if al-Rishawi is released .

The video is similar to a post from Saturday , which alleged that ISIS had killed a different Japanese hostage , Haruna Yukawa .

Saturday 's post shows a static image of Goto , holding what appears to be a photo of beheaded compatriot Yukaka . A voice , purporting to be Goto 's , says that Yukawa was killed because Japan had n't answered a previous ISIS demand of $ 200 million for the Japanese captives ' freedom .

Saturday 's voice also said that the captors no longer demanded money , but rather a Goto-for-al-Rishawi swap .

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Sunday that experts were analyzing Saturday 's video , but that it seemed `` highly credible . '' U.S. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity .

Abe on Wednesday morning told reporters in Tokyo that he was angry about the ongoing situation .

`` Under very severe circumstances , I instructed yet again that the government work together as one towards the immediate release of Mr. Goto , '' he said .

Al-Rishawi is an Iraqi woman facing the death penalty in Jordan for her role in a series of bombings that killed dozens of people at hotels in the Arab kingdom in 2005 . Authorities said she tried to take part in the massacre , but her explosives failed .

Militants say they captured al-Kassasbeh , the Jordanian pilot , after he ejected from his crashing F-16 last month , having taken part in U.S.-led coalition airstrikes near ISIS ' de-facto capital , Raqqa , Syria .

Jordan is participating in an American-led mission against ISIS , an organization seeking to establish a caliphate , or Islamic State , and has wrested territory spanning from central Syria to about 100 kilometers -LRB- 62 miles -RRB- north of Baghdad .

Goto , 47 , and Yukawa , 42 , had gone to the Middle East for different reasons , the former is an experienced freelance journalist covering the conflict in Iraq and Syria , and the latter an aspiring security contractor who felt at home in the war-torn region . They ended up in the hands of ISIS in recent months .

CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq , Junko Ogura and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report .
