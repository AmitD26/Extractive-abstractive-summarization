-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- You do n't need to look very hard to find Neil Patrick Harris these days .

The actor-slash-singer-slash-magician has hosted the Emmys , performed at the Oscars , and even headlined the World Magic Awards , which apparently are an actual thing . But despite his menagerie of ceremonial credits , the consummate entertainer admits that it 's the Tony Awards -- which Harris is hosting for the third time on Sunday , June 10 , on CBS -- that hold the dearest spot in his heart .

`` I think the celebratory tone of it makes it my favorite show to host , '' says Harris , who previously celebrated Broadway 's biggest night with successful hosting gigs in 2009 and 2011 . `` In the Emmys and in observing the Oscars , it 's a bunch of individuals that hardly know each other that all work in their own business bubbles , and I think the opposite is true on Broadway . Most everyone is a -RRB- thrilled to be there , b -RRB- even more thrilled to be nominated but c -RRB- and I think most importantly , they all know and are supportive of each other , so you end up with this great evening where it 's not a lot of sour grapes . ''

With last year 's `` Book of Mormon '' - dominated telecast dabbling in irreverence , this year 's ceremony should be noticeably more family-oriented , thanks in no small part to the heavy presence of a solid handful of mainstream plays representing one of the medium 's best seasons in recent memory . Despite powerful performances , plays typically tend to get short shrift at the musical-focused Tonys â € '' a foregone conclusion of the ceremony that Harris hopes to change this year .

`` I 'm really trying this year to figure out a way to get performances by plays somehow in the show , '' Harris tells EW . `` Every year you focus mostly on the musicals , because that 's what 's easier to put on the stage , like a three-and-a-half-minute number from ` Anything Goes . ' But with so many amazing James Earl Joneses and Stockard Channings , we 've got some amazing , monologue-talented people that I want to showcase the plays in a legitimate way . ''

Does that mean we 'll be treated to a brief glimpse of Darth Vader and Rizzo in a monologue mash-up ? -LRB- Most likely not , as that 's an awful idea on my part . -RRB- But what we can expect on June 10 is a high-energy telecast that commemorates the best of the year on Broadway and cements Harris as a master master of ceremonies .

`` The more content I end up doing , then the less time everyone gets to spend watching performances , and really , in addition to doling out awards , that 's the reason you watch , '' says Harris , who last year sang a duet with Hugh Jackman , a group performance with the New York Philharmonic cast of `` Company '' and a full opening and closing number . `` Not to say I wo n't be around . I 'm hoping for the watercooler-y moments when you have to pause and go back and rewatch . There will be a couple surprises ! ''

As we count down the days until we can see what NPH has up his sleeve at the Tony Awards , we 'll just have to make do with his opening number from last year .
