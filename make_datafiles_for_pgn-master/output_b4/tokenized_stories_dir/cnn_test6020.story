-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Montreal teacher has been suspended for showing his 10th grade students the killing and dismemberment video allegedly filmed by Canadian gay porn actor Luka Magnotta , the school board said on Wednesday

The class viewing allegedly took place on the morning of June 4 , the same day German authorities captured Magnotta in a Berlin Internet cafÃ © , ending an international manhunt for the suspected killer . Jun Lin , a 33-year-old student at Montreal 's Concordia University , was killed in late May in one of the city 's grisliest crimes in years .

Police say they believe Magnotta killed and dismembered Lin and posted a 10-minute video of the slaying online . Montreal police Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and included evidence of cannibalism .

`` At the beginning of class each day , history teachers from the school talk about actuality , what happens around Montreal , and that was part of the actuality that day , so he wanted to talk about it , and kids said that they wanted to watch it , so basically he just did what the kids wanted to do , '' student Carole-Anne Bouchard-Giroux told CNN affiliate CTV .

One of the vice principals at Cavelier-De LaSalle High School in Montreal overheard two students speaking between classes shortly after the incident , school board representative Jean-Michel Nahas said . The vice principal spoke to several students and decided during lunch to immediately suspend the teacher and launch an investigation . Around 20 students viewed the video , and at least six students sought help from a crisis team of psychologists and counselors that was made available to students after the incident , Nahas said .

The 29-year-old suspended teacher wrote the vice principal an e-mail later in the day apologizing for his actions and was `` sorry for all the damages that could have been caused by the video , '' Nahas said . Nahas said the school board is not releasing the teacher 's name because of the ongoing investigation .

Nahas said he still was n't sure how the teacher was technically capable of showing the video . `` There are many filters on the computers at the school and when we tried to view it ourselves , we were not able to , '' he said . `` It was impossible to view it -LSB- over the school Internet connection -RSB- so we do n't know how he was even able to . ''

Additional psychologists and counselors were made available to students again Wednesday because of the sudden media attention .

The suspended teacher met with the school board Wednesday afternoon in Montreal . The board wants to know `` why he did it , if he has any justification of it , and what he has to say about it , '' Nahas said while the meeting was in progress .

A statement released after the meeting said the board met with the teacher , who presented his version of events . The school board will investigate further before deciding the fate of the teacher , the release said . The school and the board `` reiterate that this is an unconscionable act for which all consequences are considered , up to dismissal of the teacher , '' the release said .

The teacher is suspended with pay pending completion of the board 's investigation .
