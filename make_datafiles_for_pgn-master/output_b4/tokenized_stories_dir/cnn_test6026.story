-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If you 're traveling abroad , your laptop could be attacked . That much , is certain , according to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation , which warned this week that hackers are `` targeting travelers abroad through pop-up windows while establishing an internet connection in their hotel rooms . ''

The warning comes from the FBI 's Internet Crime Complaint Center , or the IC3 . But it lacks so many key details that security experts wonder if it 's of any use . It does n't say where these attacks have occurred , how prevalent they are , or how exactly they work .

Graham Cluely , a blogger with antivirus vendor Sophos , found the lack of details peculiar . `` What 's fascinating about the advisory is what it does n't say , '' he wrote on his blog Thursday . `` And without more information it 's hard to know how computer users are supposed to take meaningful action to protect themselves . ''

Bloomberg reported late last year of a widespread hacking effort that hit ISPs , including at least one hotel network service provider . Networks were hit in `` more than a dozen countries , including Canada , Switzerland , Bangladesh , Venezuela and Russia , '' Bloomberg said .

The IC3 report comes months after the Bloomberg story , but then the FBI is n't exactly known for being ahead of the curve when it comes to security warnings .

Here 's the key passage :

Recently , there have been instances of travelers ' laptops being infected with malicious software while using hotel internet connections . In these instances , the traveler was attempting to setup the hotel room internet connection and was presented with a pop-up window notifying the user to update a widely-used software product . If the user clicked to accept and install the update , malicious software was installed on the laptop . The pop-up window appeared to be offering a routine update to a legitimate software product for which updates are frequently available .

But pop-up windows that instruct users to do bad things -- installing adware or fake antivirus products or malicious Trojan horse programs , for example -- have been around for years . They happen everywhere in the internet , not just in untrustworthy hotel and public Wi-Fi networks .

`` Nobody has cited evidence specifically tying this to hotel rooms , '' says Robert Graham , CEO of security consultancy Errata Security . `` My advice for travelers is that there is nothing you need to do for traveling that you should n't already be doing anyway . ''

Reached Thursday , FBI spokeswoman Jenny Shearer could n't cite any public reports detailing these attacks . `` We do n't ' have much more guidance to offer the public beyond what was shared in the alert , '' she said .

Security experts generally acknowledge that hotel networks â € '' especially open Wi-Fi networks â € '' are untrustworthy minefields .

Jonathan Kine , a technology consultant based in Jakarta , says he 's seen this type of attack described in the IC3 report in hotel and public Wi-Fi networks in China , Malaysia , and Indonesia . `` The user gets a pop up or a browser window that states in order to login please allow us to update your browser , then they download the payload and are infected , '' he says . In some cases , the update looks like it 's from Adobe Systems , Kine says . It is n't .

For corporate users , or those who are technically savvy , a virtual private network is often the best way to boost security .

Another option : use your mobile carrier 's network . That 's what Searl Tate did recently on a trip to Las Vegas . Instead of paying for a hotel network , he simply grabbed his iPad and connected to his carrier 's 4G network . `` There are other performance reasons too , '' he says , `` but security drives a portion of my concern . ''

For Graham , that means full disk encryption , to make your laptop unreadable in case it gets stolen . He also says that travelers should be up-to-date with their software patches and use secure SSL connections whenever they 're on the Web . `` And stop clicking on Trojans , '' he adds `` If you do n't do this already , then there 's really no hope for you anyway .
