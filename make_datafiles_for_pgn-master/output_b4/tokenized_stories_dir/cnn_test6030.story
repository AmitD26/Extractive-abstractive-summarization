-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This week the Democratic National Convention is n't running away from the abortion issue . Almost all of Tuesday night 's speakers made some reference to reproductive freedom , from Nancy Keenan of NARAL to Michelle Obama .

So confidently and constantly was it mentioned that it became something of a litany . Deval Patrick is for it , Martin O'Malley wants it passionately , Julian Castro sees it as a fundamental right . In case you missed it , the Democrats really , really believe in reproductive freedom .

The electoral message is that Mitt Romney and the Republicans are waging a war on women , or at least a concerted effort to limit access to contraception and abortion . The goal is to expand the gender voting gap to the Democratic Party 's advantage . And also to turn out the base -- reviving the liberal coalition that put Barack Obama in office in 2008

By contrast , Romney seems to be avoiding abortion talk as much as possible . He mentioned it only once in his convention speech , and the ticket has been beset by rumors of flipping and U-turning on the issue . No one doubts that the GOP is as anti-abortion as ever , but it seems to regard the matter as a distraction from this election 's central issue -- jobs .

Historically , this finds us in a very unusual situation . It used to be Republicans who used abortion as a wedge issue against Democrats . Now it 's the other way around .

For more than 30 years , Republicans used abortion partly from conviction , partly to win religious voters and partly just to keep the Democrats on a back foot , forcing them constantly to equivocate in a manner that made them seem muddled or the prisoner of the feminist lobby . When they ran for the White House in 1992 , Bill Clinton and Al Gore had both `` evolved '' on the issue so dramatically or cynically that even the spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee described the position as `` pretty slippery . ''

In office , Clinton stuck to a formula of `` safe , legal and rare '' that seemed to acknowledge that abortion was something troubling that ought to be reduced . His wife went further . When she was setting herself up for a presidential run , Hillary Clinton described abortion as a `` sad , even tragic choice '' that she hoped would `` not ever have to be exercised . '' Yet neither Bill nor Hillary Clinton lobbied for legal limits that would reduce the number of procedures significantly .

Until recently the Democratic message has been that abortion is almost too complex for a definitive stance . Recall the painful contortions that John Kerry went through in 2004 , trying to explain how a faithful Catholic could regard abortion as a matter of private conscience . The electoral problem was less Kerry 's thoughtful attempt to resolve a painful conundrum than it was George W. Bush 's comparative clarity .

All that changed under Obama . Evidence suggests that this is not a man who has ever doubted that the abortion rights position is both constitutional and ethical . As a state senator he voted `` present '' on a bill that would have compelled doctors to provide life support to fetuses that survived a termination procedure and were not expected to live . Obama argued that the language of the bill extended the legal protection to a `` pre-viable '' infant and so would not be constitutional . -LRB- PolitiFact notes that Illinois `` already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus -- meaning able to survive outside of the mother 's body -- then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion . '' -RRB-

As a presidential candidate , he trumpeted his support for Planned Parenthood and abortion rights . As president , he reopened the flow of tax dollars via U.S. foreign aid to groups that provide abortion overseas , and he refused to use his authority to support a bill that banned gender-selective terminations . The White House said that bill would `` subject doctors to criminal prosecution if they fail to determine the motivations '' behind abortions , according to news reports .

The Democratic Party 's platform theoretically contains no limit on access to abortion . In another historical switch , the Democratic platform is now the more radical .

The political meaning of the president 's approach to reproductive rights is hard to fathom . Conservatives insist that the so-called war on women is a cynical distraction from the poor performance of the economy . But it 's hard to imagine that working . Pollsters repeatedly say that abortion rights ranks low on voters ' list of priorities , and with unemployment seemingly stuck at higher than 8 percent , some may resent the attempted obfuscation . Pollsters also report that the `` pro-choice '' position is at a record low . If the Democrats wanted a moral issue to beat the Republicans with , they 'd probably be better off focusing on same-sex marriage .

But maybe it all comes back to likability -- something that Obama easily outranks Romney on . Todd Akin 's appalling comments on sexual assault , Paul Ryan 's attempt to distinguish between legal varieties of rape , and the conversation among conservatives about abortion in cases of rape and incest -- all of these have communicated the sense that the Republican attitudes toward women are old-fashioned , bordering on medieval . It smacks of precisely what conservatism promises not to be : the state telling people what to do with their lives .

And the language is far removed from the experience of most people , for whom all rape is rape and contraception is a reality , not a theological challenge . Perhaps Obama is using abortion less as a specific issue to wedge between Republicans and women than as a way of accentuating the infamous Romney `` weirdo factor . '' The narrative throughout Tuesday 's proceedings has been that the Democrats are as diverse and ordinary as the rest of America , contrasted with the wealth and social Old World attitudes of the Republicans .

The president 's approach is a big gamble . It is true that likability matters , and there 's no doubt that the news cycle on moral issues currently favors the president -LRB- thanks largely to Akin -RRB- . But the constant reference to abortion rights Tuesday night was at risk of coming off too strong . Abortion is a complex , painful issue that touches upon faith , gender and class .

It is not a matter that lends itself well to electioneering . More importantly , there 's a danger that in pushing the `` war on women , '' Obama may seem distracted from the real challenges facing America . Jobs , debt and health care are what matter most to voters in 2012 . It 's still the economy , Mr. President .
