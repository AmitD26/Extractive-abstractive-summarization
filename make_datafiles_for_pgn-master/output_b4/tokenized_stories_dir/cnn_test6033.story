-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While I was raised with conservative values , I grew up in a progressive town , Washington , D.C. , where openly gay teachers were normal and a pregnancy did n't mean you had to visit a cousin in Europe for nine months .

I 'm fiscally conservative and socially liberal . As I wait for the final presidential wrestling match Monday night , I 'm three debates down , drowning in attack ads , and I still do n't know who to vote for .

Debates are great fodder for Jon Stewart and SNL 's `` Weekend Update '' -LRB- who does n't love a good babbling-Biden joke ? -RRB- , but for me , the debates have n't changed anything .

President Obama is less of a rock star than he was four years ago . Still , in comparison to Mitt Romney , he 's Aerosmith . I get the feeling that Obama has thought about the future of American youth and has made a clear effort to bring them into his cause .

Let 's face it , it 's cool to vote for Obama . This is why any young celebrity supporting Romney will make headlines a la Lindsay Lohan and Stacey Dash . -LRB- Who is Stacey Dash ? Here comes a joke in itself : She 's best known for her role as `` Dee '' in the movie Clueless . -RRB-

Ignoring the crash-and-burn and B-list celebrities on his side , I 'm wondering : Why has n't Romney made any effort for the youth vote ?

Romney reminds me of everyone 's embarrassing Grandpa Eddie , who thinks gays can be `` turned '' and does n't understand why you ca n't roll down your windows on an airplane . His ultra-conservative lifestyle -- his adherence to his faith 's ban on drinking , his tendency to say `` shoot '' and `` darn it '' -- tells us he 's from another generation .

Opinion : Does Romney ` get ' women who work ?

His now infamous `` 47 % '' confession did n't help . True , 47 % of the nation was n't going to vote for him anyway , but I do n't want a president who thinks , `` Half of you are worthless -- but choose me ! '' It 's probably not the smartest political strategy to tell people they are incapable and then ask them for their vote .

I 'm the demographic Romney needs to win over : Young , female , undecided . My conservative side wants to like Mitt , but he 's not making it easy . Do n't tell me you 're out of work and understand unemployment when you are worth $ 200 million and post-grads like me ca n't find a job . Do n't say , `` Planned Parenthood , we 're going to get rid of that , '' like you 're throwing out an old sofa . Planned Parenthood is not a `` that . ''

Give me something , anything , to work with . A recent `` Saturday Night Live '' skit had Jay Pharoah portraying Obama . He said , `` There 's your choice , America : Stick with what 's been barely working , or take your chances '' with Romney .

Unfortunately , that 's the best summary I 've heard of the 2012 election .

Opinion : The speech every woman should hear

Obama , my socially liberal side supports you , but what about the national debt ? Hope and change were great slogans , but they are not plans . Fool me once , shame on you . Fool me twice ... Am I voting for you when I should know better ?

Romney , show me you are human . Inform me with reason but connect to me with emotion . Use that connection to get your point across . I know your hair looks like it came off a Lego man , but there has to be more there than plastic .

I may be young , but I 'm certainly not worthless , and I 'm not in the `` 47 % . ''

In fact , I 'm the most valuable American Romney could have : 100 % undecided .
