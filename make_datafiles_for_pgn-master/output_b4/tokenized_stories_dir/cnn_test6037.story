London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Armed with a silky-smooth voice and an uncompromising spirit , Nigerian singer/songwriter Ola Onabulé has won admirers around the world .

With a career spanning nearly two decades , the Nigerian singer has often been described as one of music 's best-kept secrets . Onabulé says that although he can hear `` the hidden compliment '' in that phrase , he works hard to do even better .

`` It 's not right that I should be a secret , I mean this is n't a profession in which to be kept a secret , '' he says . `` You stand on a stage and put it out there because you want as many people as possible to hear your song or your idea or your message . ''

His musical style blends his African roots with elements of jazz and soul , while his passionate singing moves between the heights and depths of emotion .

In tune with his wide-ranging vocal skills , Onabulé 's songs encompass a wide range of topics , from personal experiences to social-minded commentary .

`` I write songs about why in my dear continent we spend as much time as we do harking back to the things that were done to us in the past when , although they are incredibly valid these sentiments , there is also the argument for as much time to be put into finding our way out of this difficult situation , '' says Onabulé .

Born in London to Nigerian parents , the velvet-voiced singer moved to Nigeria at an early age . The vivid memories of pounding African drums and spicy Nigerian food followed him back to the United Kingdom where he returned just before he turned 17 .

That transition was n't without its challenges , says Onabulé , as he spent the first couple of years trying to figure out his place in the world while bridging his different cultures .

`` I spent a very long time working out where I fitted in the whole scheme of things , '' he says .

`` Subconsciously I think I very much wanted to be a Nigerian , wanted very much to be an African and I had to work out a way of negotiating how I could do that whilst knowing that for survival purposes also I had to assimilate as much as possible into where I found myself in amongst here . ''

Initially set for a career in law , Onabulé abandoned his studies to follow his passion for music and pursue a rather more uncertain career as a singer .

His talents did n't go unnoticed and in the early 1990s he was signed by record label Elektra . However , his encounter with the system of big record companies did n't last long .

`` I learned through bitter experience what I definitely , absolutely wanted and what I did n't , '' he says . '' -LRB- There was -RRB- a lot of kind pre-described , focus group-type artist development where you 'd bring a song in and people take their metaphorical scalpels out and shave bits -- ` the kids wo n't love that , the kids wo n't love that ' -- take bits off . ''

When the deal fell apart little more than a year later , Onabulé says he knew `` without a shadow of a doubt that I wanted as much autonomy as possible and that would mean walking my own path independently . ''

Onabulé 's perseverance saw him eventually building his own studio and setting up his own label . He has seven albums under his belt so far , and his latest offering , `` Seven Shades Darker , '' was released earlier in 2011 .

As in his previous works , Onabulé 's African roots are evident in his latest album and influence the message he is trying to convey .

He says : `` I 'm very keen for Africa to change its course , to find its way and really find a way of standing shoulder to shoulder with the league of nations .

`` If I switch on the news and I see another sad story about Africa , I wonder , I want to write a song that says how come we have n't managed to get across the fact that repeatedly on the United Nations ' happiest countries lists the top 10 counties are almost always African ? I mean how come we do n't get that story across ? How come it 's always the representations of poverty and corruption , brutality ? ''
