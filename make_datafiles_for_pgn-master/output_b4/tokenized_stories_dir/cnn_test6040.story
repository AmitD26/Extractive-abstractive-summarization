-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Justice Department prosecutors said Friday that they are closing a criminal investigation of champion cyclist Lance Armstrong without filing charges that he used performance-enhancing drugs .

A statement from the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles said the seven-time Tour de France winner will not be charged , but did not explain the reasons for the decision .

Armstrong has consistently denied doping . He was accused of using performance-enhancing drugs by other riders , but never failed a drug test .

Late Friday , he released a statement in which he said he was `` gratified '' to learn that prosecutors are closing their investigation .

`` It is the right decision and I commend them for reaching it . I look forward to continuing my life as a father , a competitor and an advocate in the fight against cancer without this distraction , '' Armstrong said .

Prosecutors called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles as they investigated the case , but they apparently determined that they lacked evidence to bring a charge .

In May 2011 , Armstrong once again denied claims from a former teammate that he used drugs during his cycling career .

Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drugs abuse in recent years with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year .

Armstrong came out fighting once again in May , in the face of fresh allegations made on the CBS News `` 60 Minutes '' show by another American Tyler Hamilton .

On his Twitter page , Armstrong said at the time : `` I have had a 20-year career , 500 drug controls worldwide , in and out of competition , and never a failed test . I rest my case . ''

In the CBS interview , Hamilton -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw Armstrong use blood boosting substance EPO in 1999 , the year of his first Tour de France victory .

`` I saw it in his refrigerator , '' Hamilton told the American news program . `` I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did , like I did many , many times . ''

Hamilton added : `` Armstrong took what we all took -- the majority of the peloton took . There was EPO , testosterone , blood transfusions . ''

Meanwhile , Armstrong 's lawyer Mark Fabiani blasted the `` 60 Minutes '' report , releasing a statement saying : `` Hamilton is actively seeking to make money by writing a book .

`` He has completely changed the story he has always told before so that he could get himself on `` 60 Minutes '' and increase his chances with publishers . ''

Fabiani continued : `` Greed and a hunger for publicity can not change the facts : Lance Armstrong is the most tested athlete in the history of sports : He has passed nearly 500 tests over 20 years of competition . ''
