Witnesses told police that Gotbaum was `` yelling and screaming '' and running through the terminal Friday . She was arrested for disorderly conduct .

While handcuffed , the New Yorker became `` disruptive '' and she was taken to a holding room , where she was left alone , Hill told CNN affiliate KTVK .
