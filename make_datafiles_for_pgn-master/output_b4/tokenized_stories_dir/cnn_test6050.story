-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 10-year-old Colorado girl reported missing one week ago is dead , police said Friday , spurring a manhunt for the person who killed her .

Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk told reporters that a body found earlier this week `` has been positively identified '' as that of Jessica Ridgeway .

`` Our focus has changed from a search for Jessica to a mission of justice for Jessica , '' Birk said .

Jessica was last seen by her mother as she left for school October 5 . Authorities then issued a statewide Amber Alert for the girl .

On Sunday , a man in a subdivision in Superior discovered Jessica 's backpack outside his house about 7 miles from the girl 's hometown of Westminster , said Westminster Police Investigator Trevor Materasso . Both towns are along the Denver-Boulder Turnpike .

A body -- which was `` not intact , '' according to police -- was found Wednesday at a park in Arvada , a Denver suburb just five miles from Westminster . The body was identified Friday as that of Jessica .

With that news , Birk acknowledged that authorities `` recognize that there is a predator at large in our community . ''

`` We are doing everything within our power to apprehend that individual , '' he said .

Hundreds of volunteers had searched fields and streets , posted fliers and canvassed neighborhoods since news broke of the girl 's disappearance . Hundreds of local , state and federal law enforcement officers have also been working the case , according to Birk .

As of Friday , authorities had searched more than 500 homes and 1,000 vehicles , responded to more than 1,500 tips and `` covered thoroughly more than 800 leads , '' said Jim Yacone , special agent in charge of the FBI 's Denver office .

`` Open space and water searches by both law enforcement , the Westminster Fire Department and many hundreds of volunteers have been extensive , and they will continue , '' Yacone told reporters Friday .
