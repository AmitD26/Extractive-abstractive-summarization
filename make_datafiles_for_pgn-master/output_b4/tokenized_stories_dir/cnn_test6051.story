-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole ensured the continuation of one of the most rancorous sagas in the history of the English game when labeling the country 's Football Association -LRB- FA -RRB- a `` bunch of twats '' on Friday .

The 31-year-old took to Twitter to refute the findings of an FA disciplinary panel which cast `` considerable doubt '' over evidence he gave in defense of former England captain John Terry , who was found guilty last month of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand .

Ferdinand is the brother of Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand , whose comments about former England colleague Cole and strained relations with onetime defensive partner Terry have contributed to what one leading football official has described as a '' ` mafia feud '' .

` Hahahahaa , well done #fa I lied did I , #BUNCHOFTWATS , ' Cole tweeted , so courting a possible misconduct charge himself from the very organization he was criticizing .

Cole , who is set to join up with the England squad after the weekend for two forthcoming World Cup qualifiers , has since deleted the tweet that was re-tweeted over 19,000 times and apologized for his remarks .

`` I had just finished training and saw the captions on the TV screens in the treatment rooms about what was said in the FA Commission ruling about me , '' a statement issued by the player declared .

`` I was really upset and tweeted my feelings in the heat of the moment . I apologize unreservedly for my comment about the FA . ''

Cole was responding to the FA 's publication on Friday of a 63-page report which questioned the truth of statements given by himself , Terry and Chelsea club secretary David Barnard about a Premier League game at QPR in October 2011 -- with the commission describing Terry 's defense as `` improbable , implausible and contrived . ''

Stripped of the England captaincy in February by the FA in relation to an incident which has since seen him retire from international football , Terry has until 18 October to decide whether to appeal his four-game suspension and US$ 350,000 fine .

During a game which Chelsea lost 1-0 , following the dismissal of two players from the current European champions , Terry has admitted to calling Ferdinand a `` f ****** black c *** '' in the closing moments .

The defense for his comments was based on the claim he was repeating words Ferdinand had said to him , with the Chelsea captain saying he was asking his fellow defender if he believed he had been on the end of racial abuse .

`` We are driven to conclude not just that it is ` highly unlikely ' that Mr. Ferdinand accused Mr. Terry on the pitch of calling him a ` black c *** ' , but that he did not , '' the FA commission wrote .

`` A much more plausible and likely explanation is that Mr. Terry was angry ; angry at Mr. Ferdinand 's taunting and provocation of him , angry at the way the match had gone , and angry at the way in which it seemed likely to end .

`` The much more likely explanation for what he said is that all of this provoked him into saying ` f *** ing black c *** ' as an insult , which is consistent with the fact that insults preceded and followed those words .

`` The Commission is entitled to use its collective experience of life and people to judge demeanor .

`` We have watched the film footage many times . In the critical phase , during which he uses the words ` f *** ing black c *** ' , Mr. Terry can be seen to be smiling initially , before his facial expression changes to disdainful and contemptuous .

`` At no point is his demeanor and facial expression that of someone who is imploring , injured , or even quizzical in the face of an unfounded allegation by Mr. Ferdinand that he -LRB- Mr. Terry -RRB- had just been racially abusive towards him -LRB- Mr. Ferdinand -RRB- . ''

Terry was cleared in a magistrates ' court in July of racially abusing Ferdinand but the FA found him guilty on 27 September , using the `` balance of probabilities '' as its standard of proof as opposed to the `` beyond reasonable doubt '' ruling used in a criminal trial .

The organization stressed that it does not believe `` Terry to be a racist '' , citing a large body of testimonial evidence -- `` including statements from black footballers '' -- to say that he is not , but that it did find the controversy-plagued 31-year-old guilty of making a racist insult .

The FA also stated that it had `` considerable doubt '' over Cole 's claims that he had heard Ferdinand use the word `` black '' when insulting Terry after the pair clashed late on .

The initial evidence given by Cole in the days after the game was amended in November 2011 when Chelsea secretary Barnard asked the FA to add the word `` black '' to the left back 's original statement .

Nearly one year on , the FA panel found Barnard 's evidence to be `` materially defective . ''

It went on : `` The Commission -LSB- has -RSB- considerable doubt as to whether the request to amend paragraph 4 of Mr. Cole 's statement , to include the word ` black ' , was based on Mr. Cole 's own personal recollections , or as a result of discussions that he had had with Mr. Barnard . ''

The document also found fault with Cole 's claims since it believes abusive comments made by Ferdinand himself towards Terry -- which the QPR defender says were in relation to a perceived marital affair by the Chelsea man with a former team mate 's ex-girlfriend -- were of a sexual rather than racial nature .

Some observers have queried the leniency of Terry 's ban , half that given to Liverpool 's Luis Suarez after he repeatedly racially abused Manchester United 's Patrice Evra last year , and the FA report states that the Chelsea captain 's punishment took light of the fact that his `` racist insult was issued only once '' .

Even should Terry decide against appealing his ban and fine , Cole 's outburst will means that an ongoing stain on the English game -- namely , the continuing focus on racism in the self-proclaimed `` best league in the world '' -- looks set to continue for some time .
