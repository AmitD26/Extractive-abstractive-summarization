-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A DNA link may signal a break in a 36-year-old investigation into the slaying of four children , the Oakland County , Michigan , prosecutor 's office announced Tuesday .

The so-called Oakland County Child Killer is believed to be responsible for the deaths of Mark Stebbins , 12 , Jill Robinson , 12 , Kristine Mihelich , 10 , and Timothy King , 11 , who were kidnapped and found dead between 1976 and 1977 .

Using technology unavailable to investigators at the time of the crimes , the FBI DNA unit at Quantico tested and analyzed human hairs found on the bodies of Stebbins and King , the prosecutor 's office said .

Investigators were able to establish a mitochondrial DNA , or mtDNA , profile link between the hairs , establishing they came from the same person , essentially proving the two crimes were connected .

`` This is the first piece of evidence that actually links any of the victims together . It was always believed that these two killings were linked to the same person , however that was an assumption based on the similarities in the crime , '' said Jessica R. Cooper , Oakland County Prosecutor .

Armed with proof the boys ' death was connected , authorities pulled up more evidence from the 1970s investigation . At the time , police had found a person of interest and were able to search his car . The car was a 1966 Pontiac Bonneville . The investigators took samples from the interior of the car and found small hairs , fibers and fur . They were placed in evidence where they remained for decades , until this material , too , was submitted to the FBI DNA unit for testing and analysis .

According to prosecutors , the testing revealed that the hairs recovered from the Bonneville had the same mtDNA profile as the hairs recovered from the boys ' bodies .

The owner of the car , 70-year-old Archibald `` Ed '' Sloan , is serving a life sentence for two counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree . Sloan was tested for a DNA match , but it was determined he did not share the same DNA profile : The hairs found on the boys and in the car were not his .

`` It is believed that Sloan would allow others to use his 1966 Bonneville , as well as the other described vehicles , so investigators are looking for information concerning any other people who may have used this car , or had access to any of these vehicles . Finding anyone like this who turns out to be the donor of the hair may be the key to solving these two murders , '' Cooper said .

The mtDNA results are not absolute .

According to prosecutors , the hairs recovered from the boys ' bodies were not suitable for autosomal DNA testing , or nuclear DNA testing , the testing most commonly referred to in movies and television . Investigators had to use mtDNA testing , which is less definitive than autosomal DNA testing .

`` With nuclear , autosomal DNA ... you 're dealing with absolute identification . It 's like a fingerprint , unique to each person except twins , '' said Dr. Lawrence Kobilinsky , forensic scientist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice , `` Mitochondrial DNA is completely different . If you have a hair from a person , that person 's siblings and all maternal relatives would share that mitochondrial profile . It 's not unique to a particular person . ''

On the other hand , Kobilinsky said an mtDNA link is still significant , and enough to cast suspicion on anyone who shares the mtDNA profile , `` People have been convicted on mtDNA evidence alone , '' he said .

Authorities are hopeful the new evidence will help them catch the killer .

`` We are excited about this new opportunity , '' said Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard , `` This haunts every police officer who was around then and is around today . ''

Authorities encourage anyone with information to call the tip line at 1-800-442-7766 .
