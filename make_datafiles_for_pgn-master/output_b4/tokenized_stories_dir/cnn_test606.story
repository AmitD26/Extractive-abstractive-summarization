First a meteor exploded over Russia , followed closely by an asteroid fly-by . Now , two comets are expected to put on a naked-eye spectacle for sky watchers in the Northern Hemisphere .

Up first is Comet Pan-STARRS , which gets its funky name from the telescope credited with discovering it in June 2001 : the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System in Hawaii .

The comet is already visible through telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere , and it should swing into view over the Northern Hemisphere beginning around March 8 .

It 's hard to predict exactly how bright Pan-STARRS will be , but you should be able to see it without binoculars or telescopes , said Don Yeomans of NASA 's Near-Earth Object Program . It should be about as bright as the stars in the Big Dipper .

`` There is a chance that it will be a little brighter than this , but likewise , it might not get quite that bright , '' said Karl Battams of the Naval Research Lab .

Part of the brightness will depend on how close Pan-STARRS gets to the sun . Comets are made up of water , ice , dust and other elements and minerals , all loosely packed together , Battams said . As a comet gets closer to the sun , the sun 's heat causes these elements to melt , spewing out dust and gas in a brilliant tail .

`` The closer it gets , the more intense the radiation and the more elements will be melted , '' he said .

Pan-STARRS is expected to get fairly close to the sun . That 's bad news for the comet , but it could be a boon for sky watchers if the comet is brighter and easier to see .

Pan-STARRS also could fall apart and fizzle . But if it survives its sunbath , we should be able to see it low on the horizon in the western sky for a couple of weeks , Battams said .

`` About half an hour after sunset would be a good time for people take a look , '' he said .

Here are some key dates :

March 5 : Pan-STARRS will be closest to Earth ;

March 10 : The comet will pass closest to the sun ;

March 12 and 13 : The best dates to look for Pan-STARRS ; it should emerge in the western sunset sky not far from the crescent moon .

Battams has these viewing tips :

1 -RRB- Safety first : Do n't try to look at the comet until the sun sets . Do not look at the sun using regular binoculars or telescopes . Ever ! You 'll burn up your eyes .

2 -RRB- Comet Pan-STARRS will stay close to the horizon , so you 'll need to get away from trees and buildings .

3 -RRB- Look carefully ! The sky will still be bright at dusk , which can make it hard to spot comets .

4 -RRB- If the skies are clear , and you are away from city light pollution , you may be able to see the comet with your bare eyes . If not , use binoculars .

5 -RRB- If you ca n't escape the city , try using binoculars .

Second chance to catch a comet

If your quest to see the first comet does n't pan out -- get it ? -LRB- OK , that 's bad -RRB- -- we might get to see a better comet later in 2013 : Comet ISON .

ISON was discovered by Russian astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok in September 2012 . It 's named after their night-sky survey program , the International Scientific Optical Network .

Some early comet prognosticators -- and reporters -- have tagged ISON `` the Comet of Century . '' But Yeomans is n't buying it just yet . He remembers being duped by another comet with that same moniker . In 1973 , Kohoutek was hyped , too , and it fizzled .

`` Predicting the behavior of comets is like predicting the behavior of cats -- ca n't really be done , '' he said .

So here is the hype on ISON : On November 28 , it is expected to dive into the sun 's atmosphere . If it survives , it might glow as brightly as the moon and be briefly visible in daylight . Its tail might stretch far across the night sky .

Battams is optimistic , but he said we wo n't know until late summer what to expect from ISON .

`` I 'll be surprised if we do n't have a bright comet this fall and/or winter , but it 's still just too early to speculate , '' he said .

So , like Pan-STARRS , ISON 's fate will be decided by the sun . It could burn brightly and earn that `` Comet of the Century '' title ; it could melt or it could just break apart .

Scientists say neither comet poses any threat to Earth , but if both comets hold together , sky watchers will get a rare treat : two comets , both bright enough to be seen with the naked eye , in one year .

Fingers crossed !
