Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the eve of the inauguration , President Barack Obama 's second term may also be America 's second chance .

The country , in the last four years , has been battered by an economic earthquake while trying to reconcile a debt load threatening to cripple the next generation .

It has been pulled apart by political extremism and the inability to compromise in Washington . The people have been divided -- by demographic shifts , cultural battles and clashes between the rich and the poor , the haves and the have-nots .

So , days before the president 's second inaugural , the nation , too , is set to regroup . What it does differently this time around and the decisions the people make , experts say , will speak to the kind of America that emerges during the next four years .

Second inaugural address puts Obama in select company

`` The enormous promise that everyone felt four years ago , it is n't completely gone but we have diminished our horizons , '' said Robert Schmuhl , an American studies professor at the University of Notre Dame . `` We have learned that we are now living in an era of limits . ''
Obama is perhaps more keenly aware of this than most .

Hope and hurdles

The 44th President was ushered into the Oval Office by a wave of seemingly limitless optimism and buoyed by the historic nature of his presidency as the first African American elected to the lead the free world .

But once in office , he found his efforts to right an economy hobbled by high unemployment -- 10 % at its worse in 2009 -- and home foreclosure rates -- one in 29 homes were in foreclosure between 2007 and 2012 -- were limited by the magnitude of the problem and the political realities of a partisan Congress .

His plan to reform the nation 's healthcare system further expanded political divides in Washington and helped lead to huge losses among his party 's moderates in the 2010 election .

His re-election this fall -- due in no small part to demographic shifts that included large numbers of minorities and women -- was quickly followed by a protracted and deeply partisan showdown over trimming the nation 's debt .

By the numbers : Presidential inaugurations

`` I think Obama has learned some things , '' said Curtis Gans , director of American University 's Center for the Study of the American Electorate . `` He 's going to be unlike most second term presidents in that he will be far more assertive than he was in his first term . He will be stronger on pushback against some of the most extreme elements in the Republican House . He 's willing to go to battle on the whole concept of getting the economy moving . ''

The public saw hints of that assertiveness on Monday during a surprise news conference , where he lashed out at Republicans in Congress for playing politics with the debt ceiling .

`` We are not a deadbeat nation , '' Obama said during a nearly hour-long briefing from the East Room of the White House . It a newly combative tone , he called it `` absurd '' for the federal government not to pay `` bills that have already been racked up '' and said he will not negotiate `` with a gun at the head of the American people . ''

From Obamacare to the economy to Sandy Hook

Over the next four years , the country will also get a chance to see whether the Affordable Care Act -- or `` Obamacare '' -- is a positive or negative step for the nation . In 2014 , many of the most controversial provisions , including requiring individuals to either participate in a health insurance program or pay a penalty , take effect .

`` We will see whether or not we have the strength within ourselves to figure out how we should deal with entitlement programs , '' Schmuhl said . `` In a way , it 's a period when the administration will be dealing with problems that are in process . ''

Obama 's ability -- or failure -- to navigate all of this while coming off as a strong , levelheaded leader could help set the nation 's tone for years to come .

`` If the economy becomes more robust you will have no doubt he will point back and say see that 's what I was doing , '' said Julian Zelizer , a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and CNN contributor .

Reagan , Clinton faced similar issues

It 's what happened when former President Ronald Reagan , who led the nation at a time when the country was reeling from a tough economy and just starting to get over the Vietnam War . In his second term `` there was a sense America was moving in the right direction in terms of how it was doing around the globe , '' Zelizer said .

When former President Bill Clinton took office the economy was n't doing well , but by the second term the economy was picking up , allowing him to deliver a balanced budget and ultimate surplus by the end of his presidency .

`` There was clearly a shift in the mood , '' Zelizer said . `` In both cases , the presidents were good at claiming credit for it . ''

Mood matters in the age of austerity

Everyday folks have learned to cut back and suck it up -- some after finding themselves underwater on mortgages they could not afford to pay ; others after losing jobs that their companies could no longer afford to keep .

So , Americans have been using their credit cards less and paying down debt more -- household debt as a percentage of disposable personal income is at its lowest rate in almost 30 years , according to the Federal Reserve and credit card balances had reached their lowest level in more than a decade .

And many expect the same discipline from their government .

`` Americans will be realistic , just as those in government need to be realistic , '' Schmuhl said of citizens ' likely approach to their own finances over the next four years .

But , as Obama enters his second term , both the housing and job markets have been on a slow and steady uptick . Housing sales were up 6 % in 2012 -- the biggest gain since 2005 , according to CoreLogic -- and the unemployment rate had dropped to 7.8 % in December , although there are still 4.8 million Americans -- or 39.1 % of the jobless -- classified as long-term unemployed , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .

`` Going into the second term , the fiscal situation will continue the agenda and the discussion , '' he said . `` It will say a lot about us and where not only the government but the nation might be going . If it is difficult and , shall we say , fractured and there 's a sense coming out of it that things are not working as they should my guess is that the public will begin saying : ` When will Washington work on our behalf ? ' ''

Governing on a deadline

That sentiment was foreshadowed in the frustration over the down-to-the-wire , partisan political maneuvering as the last Congress sought to avert the fiscal cliff 's steepest domestic spending cuts .

Obama appeared to prevail on that skirmish , delivering on a promise to raise tax rates on wealthy Americans -- although he shifted his definition of `` wealthy '' from those making $ 250,000 or more to those making $ 400,000 and up .

According to Pew Research Center and Gallup polls , Americans were none too impressed with how lawmakers handled the negotiations or the deal that was struck .

Some 41 % of those polled disapproved of the deal , according to Pew , and 52 % thought the deal would hurt people like them . In the Gallup poll , 67 % - disapproved of congressional Republicans ' handled the negotiations while 55 % disapproved of how Democrats performed .

Still , partly due to deliberate redistricting to protect -- or create -- more partisan congressional districts , American voters continued to elect or re-elect safe representatives to do their bidding in Congress . For instance , most of the 435 members of the House of Representatives -- Republicans and Democrats -- faced little real opposition on Election Day in 2012 .

Other battlegrounds : Sequester , gun control , immigration

But the next battle looms . Just weeks after Obama takes his oath of office , a new Congress will be tasked with addressing the automatic spending cuts , or sequester , that were kicked down the road in order to pass a smaller deal at the end of the year .

The new Congress will also consider raising the nation 's debt ceiling , or the ability of the U.S. Treasury to borrow money to pay America 's bills . Most agree that defaulting on the nation 's obligations would be disastrous for America and the global economy , but some Republicans in Congress are starting to hint that they may be prepared to let that happen anyway if large spending cuts are not secured .

And after that , the fight over gun control , a high priority for the White House in the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre , will pit the president against many members of the House and Senate from safe districts with high ratings and big-dollar donations from gun rights advocates .

The president and vice president unveiled a major plan on Wednesday that included 23 executive actions the president has ordered on his own , while urging the new Congress to take on the meaty issues of an assault weapons ban , limits on the number of bullets a gun magazine can hold , and other sweeping reforms the gun lobby and others say would gut the constitutional right to bear arms .

Immigration reform , another White House priority , will also stoke ideological differences and test the demographic shifts in Congress . For the first time , the House Democratic caucus is dominated by women and racial minorities , while the Republican caucus in that chamber is largely composed of white men . In the Senate , 20 women -- the largest number in history -- currently hold office .

But women and minorities are far outnumbered and outranked by white males on some of the most powerful congressional committees . And despite several high-ranking exceptions , Obama 's Cabinet -- so far -- is shaping up to be largely male and white .

`` The first thing we learned is that we 're not post-race . That was a lot of willful imagining in '08 that his election would allow us to transcend these questions of race , '' said Mark Anthony Neal , a cultural and Black studies professor at Duke University . `` The American electorate is looking different in terms of race and ethnicity and young folks being engaged . In 2016 our political realities will look more like our demographic realities . ''

And that 's where the nation 's shift over the next four years may be most visible .

But look first to the 2014 midterms and then the 2016 presidential election to see if the people signal continued frustration with the current regime -- in Congress and in the White House -- or demonstrate through the power of their vote that they feel the nation has finally turned the corner .
