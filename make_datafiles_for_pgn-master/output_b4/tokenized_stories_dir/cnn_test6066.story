Sanaa , Yemen -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Yemen formed a new unity government , the latest step in the implementing of the pact leading to the controversial president 's departure from office , the state news agency said on Wednesday

Yemeni Vice President Abdu Rabo Mansour Hadi issued a decree forming the government and 35 ministers were named . The prime minister is Mohammed Basindwa and Abu Bakr Al-Qirbi remains the country 's foreign minister .

Youth revolution activists , who 've been leading the protests to remove President Ali Abdullah Saleh , greeted the move cynically .

It is part of a deal devised by the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council , comprising Gulf Arab states and signed on November 24 .

Saleh stepped down after he agreed to the plan , which calls for transferring power in exchange for immunity from prosecution . It allows Saleh to retain the title of president for three months , until elections are held , but it required him to hand over executive powers to Hadi .

Yemen has been greatly affected by the ferment across the Arab world this year . The government had been engulfed by nationwide protests against his regime and fighting between security forces and his foes . An ally in the Western fight against terror groups , the government has been battling an al Qaeda affiliate .

As for the GCC deal , many protesters , like Abdul Rabb al-Murthada , dislike it and regard it as illegal .

`` The government only represents itself and not the Yemeni people , '' he said . `` It will fail and the youth will continue until a complete revolution is seen in Yemen . ''

Another protester , Salem al-Shuaib , urged citizens to reject any deal that gives Saleh immunity .

`` No government or agreement can save the ruling family from the crimes they committed , '' said al-Shuaib

On Sunday , Hadi announced the formation of a military council of 14 members whose duties will be to stabilize the country and reform the military , a senior official in the vice president 's office told CNN . They are evenly divided between the ruling party and the opposition , with each side receiving seven seats in the council .

Tareq Shami , the media officer of the ruling General People Congress party , told CNN that all sides are optimistic that this council will help in solving the security situation in the country .

`` This is a good step and we support it . This will help in getting the gunmen out of the streets in Yemen and make the country safer , '' said Shami .

The power-transfer deal states that the military council should be formed within five days of the signing of that agreement while the new government was to be announced within 14 days .

But heavy clashes raged in northern Sanaa between government forces and opposition fighters loyal to the Ahmar clan in Hasaba district .

The clashes were the first in Sanaa since the vice president assumed presidential duties .

The Ahmar media office told CNN one civilian was killed and four others were injured as blasts reverberated across the city , stoking fear of persistent fighting .

Eyewitnesses told CNN that Republican Guards attacked the residential compounds of the Ahmars for more than six hours Wednesday morning and that resulted in clashes .

There has been `` escalating violence '' in the southwestern city of Taiz , the International Committee of the Red Cross said , and the group `` is deeply alarmed . ''

`` There are worrying reports of injured people being unable to reach medical facilities , and of facilities being attacked and damaged , '' said Eric Marclay , the ICRC 's head of delegation in Yemen . `` The violence has had a serious impact on basic services in recent weeks , with life-saving medical services especially hard hit . The escalating violence on the streets of Taiz has left dozens dead or wounded . ''

Yemen Red Crescent volunteers and others transporting casualties have been stopped from saving lives or have been injured , the ICRC said . ICRC surgeons and local doctors have been working to treat victims .

`` Trying to save a life can cost you your own these days , '' Marclay said . `` Anyone who is injured must be able to receive life-saving medical care without delay . Access to health care infrastructure must not be arbitrarily denied or limited . It is essential that medical staff , vehicles and facilities be protected and respected , '' he added . Hospitals must not be attacked .

Saleh became the fourth leader to leave office as a result of the Arab Spring unrest that has roiled much of the Middle East and North Africa this year . The others have been Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , and Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali .

The new Minister of Human Rights Hooria Mashhour said there 's a lot of work to be done to heal and stabilize the country .

`` Our youth are still in the square , '' she said . `` We told them this is the political track and we will achieve all our goals . ''
