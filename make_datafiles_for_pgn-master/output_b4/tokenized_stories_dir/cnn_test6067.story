-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's an illuminating idea which its creators hope will help drive up energy efficiency and bring down buildings ' carbon emissions .

Mixing the idea of Google 's Street View with multi-spectral thermal camera technology , Massachusetts-based startup Essess is building a giant database mapping residential and commercial properties in the U.S. .

The project is the idea of Sanjay Sarma , professor of mechanical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology -LRB- MIT -RRB- who wanted to create a way of identifying and remedying inefficiencies in buildings .

Essess currently has a fleet of five cars mounted with thermal cameras that take a matter of seconds to assess an individual building . The brighter the colors , the greater the `` heat leak . ''

Company CEO , Storm Duncan says they are capturing around two to three million buildings per month at the moment .

`` The purpose of the approach is to provide a snapshot of the energy efficiency . It answers about 20-30 % of the problems of your home . '' Duncan said .

`` I consider it a fabulous way to start a broader dialogue about the more comprehensive -LRB- energy -RRB- profile , '' he added .

Essess have also developed computer programs that generate energy reports highlighting specific areas of concern and calculating their cost -- financially and environmentally .

The beauty of the reporting system -LRB- see gallery -RRB- is its simplicity , says Duncan , with consumers immediately getting a sense of how efficient their homes really are .

The database will also create what he calls `` an eco-system around building efficiency '' becoming the cornerstone of a competitive hub where homeowners can link up with specialists who can remedy problems .

Buildings consume around 40 % of the U.S. 's total energy requirements annually , according to the Department of Energy , with over one third of that power going to waste .

The company is evolving a business model which Duncan hopes will mean customers wo n't pay a cent to view information about their home .

Instead , audits will potentially become part of the service provided by real estate databases like Zillow and Trulia , Duncan says .

Essess hope to have covered 10 % of the U.S. 's 125 million properties by the end of the year .

Thermal imaging surveys are nothing new , but widespread access to them is says Stewart Little , CEO of British thermal imaging company , IRT .

`` Back in the 1980s the cameras cost about Â £ 250,000 -LRB- $ 400,000 -RRB- . Now they cost around Â £ 5,000 -LRB- $ 8,000 -RRB- . So the technology 's moved on lots and lowered the barrier to entry for companies to go and do it . ''

IRT have surveyed around 200,000 UK homes since they were founded in 2002 , and also offer customers quantified thermal images showing the financial and carbon costs of energy leaks .

It 's a strategy that 's proved highly successful in motivating people to insulate their homes , Little says .

The UK 's Energy Saving Trust says online surveys and energy monitors can also help homeowners track their energy usage .

They estimate that savings could save up to $ 380 a year by improving insulation .

`` The challenge is to do something about it , '' says Rob Bell , a energy consultant and former business development with the Energy Saving Trust .

`` With gas and electricity prices only looking like they are going in one direction , the amount you can save is also upwards as well , '' he added .

`` The headline figures around how much you can save could be the catalyst to get you from being aware to doing something about it . ''
