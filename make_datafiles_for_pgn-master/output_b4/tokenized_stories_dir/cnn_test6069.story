-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Steve Reeder says it 's no secret among his Facebook friends : He 's a Republican .

But after he began posting news articles and political cartoons on his page that reflect his support for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney , his friend count began falling off . Today , it 's down by several dozen .

`` One day , they are there . The next day , they just disappear , '' said Reeder , 53 , of Roswell , Georgia . `` Most -LRB- people -RRB- do n't say anything to me about it . So I just say ` good riddance . ' ''

It 's a story that 's been playing out on Facebook and Twitter with growing frequency among friends , family members , colleagues and acquaintances as an already contentious presidential campaign between Romney and President Barack Obama enters its final , frenzied weeks . Your close friends may share your political views , but that eccentric uncle , former co-worker or high school classmate may not .

Nearly one-fifth of people admit to blocking , unfriending or hiding someone on social media over political postings , according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center 's Internet & American Life Project . The biggest gripes : The offending person posted too often about politics , disagreed with others ' updates , or bothered mutual friends with partisan political postings .

`` In the real world , we navigate these issues all the time . We know not to bring up politics around certain friends or family members . We try to avoid people who are constantly looking for an argument or trying to sell us on their pet ideas , '' said Aaron Smith , a Pew research associate .

`` Since blocking , unfriending , hiding people is the closest social analogue to those real-world examples , it 's not necessarily surprising to see people taking these steps in the virtual space . ''

Muting the rhetoric

It 's the hateful tone of the political conversation that is particularly disturbing to Luis Stevens , who has temporarily muted the Twitter voices of roughly 150 people and blocked more than 400 others until after the November 6 election .

More than one person has threatened to show up on Stevens ' doorstep after he disagreed with them on Twitter . A few more have called him names . And at least one stepped across a political `` red line , '' endorsing a pundit that Stevens finds offensive .

`` This is a pretty mercurial campaign on both sides . People on both sides tend to get heated pretty fast , '' said Stevens , 37 , of Ruidoso , New Mexico . As a result , he said , `` there are way too many people on Twitter who are a little scary . ''

Stevens tweets under the pseudonym @pettybooshwah . He does n't post pictures of himself , nor does he release details about his whereabouts .

But he 's not shying away from political debate .

`` When you do n't follow people with the opposing viewpoint , Facebook and Twitter can become an echo chamber where everybody agrees , '' Stevens said .

` Facebook is not a democracy '

But that 's just fine with Andre Kelly , who took to Facebook in recent weeks with a posting decrying political opposition on his page .

Simply put : For Kelly , Facebook is not a democracy .

`` This is not about platforms and political theory , from this point forward , to me , it 's about people simply picking a side , '' Kelly , an Obama supporter from Los Angeles , said in a Facebook post shortly after the Republican National Convention in late August .

He warned off supporters of Romney from posting on his page , writing that he was `` simply NOT having it . ''

Since then , Kelly 's post has been repeatedly shared , finding a home on pages across Facebook 's political and not-so-political discussions .

`` This was amazing and I loved every second . I 'm glad he took the time to think and word this the way he did . I believe and agree with this 100 % , '' wrote one admirer .

Kelly , who works as a touring comedian , has n't defriended anybody on his Facebook page , though he believes he has probably lost a few social-media followers .

Tricky politics of political discourse in the workplace

Battling allegations

The political divide on social media has become so wide that some people have been trying to silence one another .

On Twitter , conservatives have accusing liberals of trying to squelch their voices by falsely reporting them for spam , a violation of Twitter rules that can result in the suspension of an account .

Liberal groups , meanwhile , have accused conservatives of using #block / report to shut them down .

The battling allegations have led to competing blog posts that offer some of the same advice .

Liberty Chick , a columnist for conservative site Breitbart.com , encouraged users to report suspected abusers , while Charles Johnson of left-leaning blog Little Green Footballs said he would continue to tell his followers `` to block and report '' those who harass them .

However it 's used , Twitter has clearly become a key destination in the national discussion . Twitter said a record 10.3 million tweets were sent during the first presidential debate last week , making it he most tweeted-about event in U.S. politics .

And for people sick of politics poisoning their feeds , there are Facebook pages such as `` Nobody Cares About Your Political Posts . Really , '' where users can vent their frustrations .

The page promises to be `` Open to all conservatives , liberals and moderates who are tired of the constant stream of political posts on FB . Does n't mean that your views are not important -- just means that it is n't important to us to hear you blather on . P.S. . You do realize that you really are n't changing anyone 's opinion , right ? ''

Repairing relationships

It started out as friendly barbs on Facebook , childhood friends sparring over differences in the presidential election .

Sarah Mirocha supported Obama ; her friend supported Romney . But by the time the conversation was over , the two were no longer friends -- on social media or otherwise .

`` One less hateful troll = more peace on my page , '' Mirocha , 43 , wrote in a Facebook post .

The Iowa-based writer made no apologies : `` It 's my page , is n't it ? ''

Yes and no , says etiquette blogger Thomas P. Farley of What Manners Most .

`` The beauty of social media is that it does allow us to be commentators on the news . But you have to be aware of your audience , '' Farley said . `` You know these people would never say anything to your face . But it is sort of an unfortunate consequence of anonymity online . ''

For many people , the hardest part of the 2012 political debate may be restoring friendships that have been damaged .

`` I think that for friends , real friends , it will get better , '' said Stevens , who after the election plans to restore a number of Twitter voices he has muted . `` I think for people that are partisan acquaintances , it will probably calm down a little . ''

But Farley believes repairing friendships damaged by political differences will probably take a little work .

`` If it 's somebody you see regularly , '' he said , `` I would have the conversation in person . ''
