-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of the world 's largest private superyachts is the latest to set sail on an expedition to uncover the secrets of a British battle cruiser lost during World War II .

Octopus -- a 414 foot megayacht -- was donated to the British Navy by Paul Allen , co-founder of Microsoft . Allen will fund the recovery and research expedition , sparing the British government any cost .

A previous expedition by Blue Water Recoveries , a deep sea shipwreck recovery company , located the wreck 11 years ago .

The enduring allure of tall ships

This week the recovery team will return to the wreck site with a two-fold mission : Retrieve the ship 's bell and document the remains of the battle cruiser in the hopes of later determining what happened in the Hood 's final moments .

David Mearns , director of Blue Water Recoveries , said the ship 's bell was `` lovingly looked after '' by the crew . Its recovery is seen by those who lost loved ones as a way to commemorate those who died .

The HMS Hood was sunk during a battle in the North Atlantic with German battleship Bismarck in 1941 . The Hood remains the largest Royal Navy vessel to have gone down , and resulted in the largest loss of life suffered by any single warship in British history .

The wreck of HMS Hood is designated under the Protection of the Military Remains Act , meaning the recovery team had to seek permission from the British Navy in order to retrieve the bell .

The mission was agreed to by the British Government , and the Ministry of Defence say the bell -- if recovered -- will form a tangible and fitting memorial to the ship and the 1,415 men who died when she sunk in the North Atlantic .

Mearns recalls the astonishment of the team when they located the ship 's bell , on their first dive , in 2001 .

`` There was just a miscellaneous pile of twisted and torn metal ... most of it was very angled steel but there was this curved shape , '' Mearns remembers . `` We pushed in on the camera and , lo and behold , there was the bell sitting basically unattached , not connected to the ship -LSB- and -RSB- all by itself on its side . ''

The team , Mearns recalls , `` were just stunned by it . ''

The 40,000 ton wreck is strewn over two and half kilometers of seabed , and uncovering the bell was a stroke of luck for the recovery team .

`` It 's a really iconic item and personal symbol of the ship , but we were there conducting this investigation on a ` do n't touch ' basis . It never occurred to us , even for a second , ` What if we recovered the bell ? Should we attempt to ? ' '' Mearns tells CNN .

By the time Mearns and his team had returned to land , news of the bell 's discovery had broken . A public debate had erupted over the ethics of disturbing a wreck where so many lives had been lost .

Mearns gained the support of the HMS Hood Association -- whose members include veterans and relatives of those who died -- before seeking financial support to return and recover the bell .

The association 's president , rear admiral Philip Wilcocks , said in statement on the mission : `` There is no headstone among the flowers for those who perish at sea . ''

Wilcocks added , `` future generations will be able to gaze upon -LSB- the Hood 's -RSB- bell and remember with gratitude and thanks the heroism , courage and personal sacrifice of Hood 's ship 's company who died in the service of their country . ''

If recovered , the bell will go on display in 2014 , at an exhibition at the Royal Navy Museum in the southern English port of Portsmouth -- where the Hood was based .

Mearns says : `` It 's been out there as a wish of the association to do this and I 've just been looking for the right sponsor to do it in the right way and to get the permission to do it .

`` I 'd been working with Vulcan , Paul Allen 's company , and it just so happened we could combine the availability of Octopus in the region at the right time , because you can only really work in this area two months of the year . ''

The Octopus , the world 's 13th largest megayacht , is a `` fantastically capable vessel , '' Mearns says .

Despite being classified as a yacht , the Octopus carries equipment including a deepwater diving ROV -LSB- remotely operated vehicle -RSB- and survey and navigation equipment . The Octopus , says Mearns , `` is very qualified '' for the job .

The British Royal Navy has asked the team to place an ensign on the site of the wreck , Mearns added .

The mission also hopes to shed light on the final moments of the battle cruiser , which broke in two during the attack . It was under sustained fire from the Bismarck , but its own ammunition also exploded . The cause of its sinking has never been clarified .

`` I think we are going to make a real improvement in the imagery and information that we bring back from the wreck to allow naval architects to look at and come to some firm conclusions about the damage , '' Mearns added .

`` This is n't just a trophy hunt to go get the bell . ''
