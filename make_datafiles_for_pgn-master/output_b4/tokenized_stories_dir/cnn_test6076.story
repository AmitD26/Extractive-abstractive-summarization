-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Nigerian militant group previously linked to the kidnapping of a French citizen claimed responsibility Monday for taking seven workers from a construction company 's offices in northeastern Nigeria .

In an e-mail sent to reporters , Ansaru said it had kidnapped the seven workers Saturday because of `` transgression and atrocities '' against Islam in Afghanistan , Mali and other locations .

Those kidnapped included workers from Italy , Greece and Lebanon , those governments confirmed . Nigerian police said a Briton was also kidnapped ; British authorities said they were aware of such reports and were making inquiries .

Opinion : Nigerians still waiting for their ` African Spring '

Gunmen took the workers from the offices of Setraco , a construction company in Jama'are , in Bauchi State , police said . The company is based in Abuja and is involved in many major road construction projects in northern Nigeria .

The gunmen first attacked a prison , burning two police trucks , public service broadcaster Voice of Nigeria reported , citing state police spokesman Hassan Muhammed .

They then killed a guard at the Setraco workers camp before kidnapping the workers , Muhammed told the broadcaster .

In December , the group claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of a French citizen near the border with Niger and for an attack on a prison in Abuja in November .

U.S. officials say Ansaru is an offshoot of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram , which Nigerian authorities say is behind a recent rash of killings and kidnappings in the country .

Boko Haram -- whose name means `` Western education is sacrilege '' -- has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria , according to Human Rights Watch .

Incidents have included the killings of three North Korean doctors in northern Yobe and the killings of nine people working for a government polio vaccination program in the northern city of Kano this month .

Nigeria launched a military crackdown on Boko Haram in January . Security forces have since captured one of the group 's leaders and killed 17 suspected Boko Haram members .

Opinion : Why are Nigerians numb to slaughter ?

In the past , the group attacked other Muslims who it said were on an immoral path . But it has increasingly targeted Christians with numerous attacks on churches , as well as striking police stations .

Boko Haram and other Muslim groups say the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the Nigerian government . But the U.S. State Department has accused the group 's leaders of having ties to the al Qaeda terrorist network and of hoping to drive a wedge between Nigeria 's Christian and Muslim communities .

CNN 's Vladimir Duthiers and journalist Hassan John contributed to this report .
