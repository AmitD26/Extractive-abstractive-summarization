Notre Dame , Indiana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Syria has resulted in at least 3,500 deaths . The United Nations Security Council should immediately request that all charges of crimes against humanity in Syria be referred to the International Criminal Court .

If the claims of gross misconduct by the Arab League and many national governments are correct , then something definitive would finally be done . And if the accusations prove to be wrong , as the Syrian government claims , then the court would confirm that .

The Security Council needs to act because the court lacks jurisdiction to investigate on its own , since Syria has refused to join the court . But with Security Council authorization , the legal door opens for a full-fledged investigation that could reach President Bashar al-Assad himself and , if warranted , indict those accused of responsibility for mass murder .

Russian and Chinese officials , who feel they were taken advantage of by NATO countries when they expanded the Security Council authorization of a no-fly zone for civilian protection in Libya into a military effort to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi 's government , have resisted taking strong action against Syria . To encourage them to support a council referral of atrocities to the court , a U.N. resolution could explicitly take international military action against Syria off the table . This would also reassure members of the Arab League who oppose external military intervention even though some want Assad to resign .

To obtain that reassurance , the Arab League simultaneously could ask the Security Council to refer alleged Syrian crimes to the court , while also underscoring its disapproval of the Syrian government 's violation of its agreement with the Arab League to stop atrocities .

An investigation by the international court could produce many benefits . It might deter heinous crimes , because Syrian officials would know that the world is now watching and ready to take legal action . If indictments resulted from the investigations , they would discredit any Syrian officials who refused to stand trial , even if arrests of indictees could not be made in the immediate future .

If Assad were indicted , this would add strength to the claim of those arguing that he should step down . Indictments would encourage and empower democratic forces within Syria , while also helping to keep protesters nonviolent , thereby discouraging the kind of civil war that occurred in Libya .

A Security Council referral might even put pressure on Damascus to accept a proposal being advanced by some in the Arab League to deploy 400 to 500 observers throughout Syria from a coalition of 16 Arab human rights organizations . Of course , Assad might refuse to allow them into Syria , fearing that they might find evidence useful for prosecutions . However , if he refused the Arab League offer to observe what is going on , that refusal would undermine his claim that officials are doing nothing illegal .

Finally , a swift Security Council referral would place the killings of several thousand people and the question of wrongful conduct precisely where they should be : in a legal framework where the conduct of officials and others is judged against well-established international laws that few dispute . Such a move , in tandem with European Union economic sanctions already taken to freeze the assets of 74 Syrians and an expanding oil and possibly arms embargo , would reduce the likelihood of violence among Syrians themselves , discourage external military intervention and enable the council to honor its charter obligation to take responsibility for preventing armed conflict .

An indictment could even produce a humanitarian consequence for an accused official . This is suggested by events surrounding Gadhafi 's son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , whom the court indicted because of suspected abuses of civilians in the Libyan revolution . He and any accused Syrian officials might prefer going to The Hague to face their legal fate rather than run the risks of a more violent destiny closer to home .
