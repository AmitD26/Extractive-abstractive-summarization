-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Facebook is adding new security features , which come after a pair of high-profile cracks in the site 's defenses that surfaced this week .

One new mechanism is called `` social authentication . '' To combat spam and prevent strangers from weaseling into your account , the system will sometimes show the user a friend 's headshot and ask to match a name to that face .

This multiple-choice photo quiz is a new take on a common Web system called Captcha .

The older method displays a picture of some squiggly letters and asks you to type those on the keyboard . It 's used for verifying that a site 's user is a person and not a computer program looking to exploit systems .

Facebook reduced spam from partners ' applications by 95 % last year , Bret Taylor , the company 's technology chief , said at a conference this week . The social networking giant currently employs Captcha technology , but this new method could supplant that .

Adding this human touch could not only combat robot intruders but also weirdos who try to thumb through your account after you forget to log out of the library computer .

`` The vast majority of people who have used Facebook have never experienced a security problem , '' Alex Rice , a Facebook security engineer , wrote on the company blog . `` However , if we detect suspicious activity on your account , like if you logged in from California in the morning and then from Australia a few hours later , we may ask you to verify your identity so we can be sure your account has n't been compromised . ''

Facebook also started rolling out the option to securely browse the social networking site using a secure connection .

Like the technology used by banking and some e-mail services like Gmail and Hotmail , this defense encrypts all information to and from Facebook so that it 's much harder for someone to eavesdrop on the Wi-Fi line .

`` With a little motivation and not much skill , it 's fairly trivial to sniff HTTP traffic , '' Alan Ross , the lead security analyst for Intel IT , told CNN in November . `` Maybe I want to see all Web traffic for Facebook because I want to see what the interesting person across the cafe is updating on Facebook . ''

Soon , Facebook account holders concerned about hackers can turn on the `` secure browsing '' option in their settings panel .

Two Facebook users in particular should be advised to opt in to the feature . Mark Zuckerberg , the company 's CEO , and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were both victims of intruders on their Facebook pages this week .
