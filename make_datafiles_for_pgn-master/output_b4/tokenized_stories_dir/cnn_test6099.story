-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A deadly attack Wednesday delivered the harshest blow yet to President Bashar al-Assad 's regime , taking the bloodshed into his inner circle .

Jordan 's king calls Syria attack ` a tremendous blow ' to al-Assad regime

Three top officials were killed and a number of others were wounded in an explosion at a national security building in Damascus , state TV reported .

The attack came after several days of violence in the capital . At least 189 people were killed across the country on Wednesday , including 37 in Damascus and 69 in its suburbs , the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said .

The officials killed were Defense Minister Dawood Rajiha ; Deputy Defense Minister Assef Shawkat -- al-Assad 's brother-in-law ; and Hasan Turkmani , al-Assad 's security adviser and assistant vice president , state TV reported .

Interior Minister Ibrahim al-Shaar was among those injured in the blast , state TV said , adding that he `` is in good health and that his condition is stable . ''

Getting to know Syria 's first family

The attack , which occurred during a meeting of ministers and security officials , was coordinated by rebel brigades in Damascus , said the deputy head of the opposition Free Syrian Army , Col. Malek al-Kurdi .

The government described it as a suicide bombing . But al-Kurdi said a remote control was used to detonate an explosive device that had been planted inside the meeting room .

Al-Assad quickly named Gen. Fahd Jassem al-Freij as defense minister , state-run news agency SANA said .

State-run SANA said the government has killed or captured a `` large number '' of terrorist infiltrators in Damascus and inflicted `` heavy losses '' on terrorists in Homs and Idlib .

Video from a Damascus suburb showed Syrians rejoicing after news spread of the bombing .

Soon after , the pro-government Shabiha militia took to the streets , attacking with knives , shooting and saying , `` This is retribution for what you have done , '' according to an opposition activist in Damascus , who is going by the name Lena to protect her identity .

There were bodies in the streets around the Yarmouk , a Palestinian refugee camp , and people were too afraid to collect them , Lena said .

`` The people are really scared , '' she said , adding that mosques were blaring the messages `` Stay in your homes '' and `` God is great . ''

A Damascus resident said shootings occurred in Baghdad Street , a major road that includes branch offices of state security agencies .

In the neighborhood of Medan , where violence has raged in recent days , Free Syrian Army fighters `` launched their biggest attack yet all over Damascus , in 17 points , '' said Abo Abdo , a rebel fighter . They were working to `` disperse the regime 's forces all over the capital , '' he said .

Syria , on the official Syrian Arab News Agency , said its armed forces `` chased down terrorists who infiltrated '' Medan , and `` killed and arrested a large number of them . The military units also chased down terrorists who terrorized some families in the neighborhoods of al-Qaboun and Tishreen and forced them to leave their homes . ''

With the Syrian government restricting foreign journalists from gaining access to the country , CNN can not independently confirm reports of violence or details about the attack .

The bombing took place in a building in Rawda Square , near al-Assad 's home and the U.S. Embassy , which suspended its operations in February . Security officials and government spies have had a heavy presence in the area .

The bombing 's repercussions spread from the capital of Syria to the capital of Egypt , where clashes erupted Wednesday between the Egyptian police and hundreds of protesters outside the Syrian Embassy . Some of them were chanting , `` Down , Down , Bashar al-Assad ! ''

`` We only wanted to remove the flag and replace it by the independence flag , but the Egyptian riot police started beating us so we pelted them with rocks , '' said Ahmed H. Aggour , an organizer of the protest in Cairo . `` Next thing you know they fired an incredible amount of tear gas , several canisters landed on the British Embassy nearby . ''

He added , `` We want people in Syria to see how we are supporting their cause here in Egypt . ''

Most of the protesters were Egyptian , Tarek Shalaby , an Egyptian activist and web designer at the scene .

Alla Mahmoud , a spokesman from the Interior Ministry , told CNN that 15 protesters were arrested . Some suffered minor injuries , from excessive inhalation of tear gas to bruises .

Meanwhile , U.S. President Obama called Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to discuss the Syrian situation , the White House said . `` They noted the differences our governments have had on Syria , but agreed to have their teams continue to work toward a solution , '' it said .

A planned Security Council vote on a draft resolution on Syria was delayed at the request of Kofi Annan , joint envoy to Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League , until 10 a.m. Thursday , diplomats said .

Annan , who met Tuesday with Putin in Moscow , earlier this year put forward a peace plan that has failed to stop the violence .

Western countries are pushing for a resolution that threatens sanctions against al-Assad 's regime if government forces do n't stop attacks . That draft also calls for renewing the 300-member U.N. observer mission for 45 days .

The observers ' work has been suspended because of violence .

Throughout Syria 's 16-month crisis , Russia has opposed any international effort that would blame , punish or change the leadership of the Syrian government . Russia -- along with China -- has vetoed two previous draft resolutions in the U.N. Security Council , leading to accusations that Russia is protecting the Syrian regime .

Russia , meanwhile , has put forth its own draft , which `` strongly urges all parties in Syria to cease immediately all armed violence in all its forms . '' The Russian draft also calls for renewing the U.N. observer mission for three months .

At the United Nations , German Ambassador Peter Wittig said Wednesday 's events in Damascus `` underline as clearly as never before that the Security Council now has to act . It has to send out a strong signal to the Syrian regime to stop the use of heavy weapons . We want to give the Annan plan , which we all support in the council , some teeth -- and that 's why we should adopt a resolution with the sanctions threat . ''

In Amman , Jordan , King Abdullah said the situation in Syria is nearing an all-out civil war . `` In other words , it 's getting very , very messy , '' he said . `` When you get full-out civil war , there is no coming back from the abyss . ''

Next for Syria : Showdown or stalemate ?

The attack represents `` a massive psychological blow to the regime '' and will accelerate al-Assad 's `` demise , '' predicted Anthony Skinner , an analyst with Maplecroft , a think tank that provides risk assessments on global business .

It could suggest that `` the regime itself is crumbling , '' said Rime Allaf , an analyst with Chatham House , a think tank focusing on international affairs .

Events in Syria show `` a real escalation in fighting , '' said U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta .

It `` tells us that this is a situation that is rapidly spinning out of control , and for that reason it 's extremely important that the international community , working with other countries that have concerns in that area , have to bring maximum pressure on Assad to do what 's right , and to step down and to allow for that peaceful transition , '' Panetta said .

The U.S. government announced Wednesday a new round of sanctions against members of the Syrian government .

Timeline : How the horror has unfolded

Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zubi , speaking on state TV , vowed that those behind the attack will be held accountable .

He insisted that those trying to divide the army are failing . `` This army has not been divided , '' he said .

But increasing numbers of officials in the Syrian military have defected in recent days . Two brigadier generals fled overnight to Turkey , bringing the number of Syrian generals in Turkey to 20 , a Turkish Foreign Ministry official said .

Rajiha , one of those killed Wednesday , was a member of the country 's minority Christian community . who was named by the U.S. Treasury in sanctions this year . U.S. citizens were prohibited from engaging in transactions with him and other officials amid what the U.S. government called Syria 's `` continued use of violence against its people . ''

In 2006 , the Treasury named Shawkat -- then Syria 's director of military intelligence -- in an executive order , freezing his assets and prohibiting U.S. citizens from engaging in transactions with him . At the time , the U.S. government called Shawkat `` a key architect of Syria 's domination of Lebanon , as well as a fundamental contributor to Syria 's long-standing policy to foment terrorism against Israel . ''

What we need to know about Syria

Days ago , Nawaf al-Fares , the former Syrian ambassador to Iraq who has become the country 's highest-level diplomatic defector , told CNN that Shawkat had run an al Qaeda in Iraq training camp .

A U.S. official said al-Fares ' claim was `` broadly consistent with our understanding '' of the Syrian regime 's cooperation with al Qaeda `` elements . ''

But the Syrian regime has repeatedly denied involvement in terrorist activities -- and has blamed the violence of the past 16 months on `` armed terrorist groups . ''

Since the crisis began in March 2011 , the United Nations estimates , more than 10,000 people have been killed in the violence ; the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria estimates that more than 16,000 have died .
