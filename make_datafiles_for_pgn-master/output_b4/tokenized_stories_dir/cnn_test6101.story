Rome , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man convicted of killing British student Meredith Kercher has given an interview from his Italian jail cell , insisting Amanda Knox is a `` sweet girl '' incapable of murder .

Raffaele Sollecito , who was sentenced to 25 years for his role in Kercher 's death , told an Italian newspaper that he was struggling to come to terms with the verdict and feared going `` insane '' in prison .

Asked if his former girlfriend Knox -- also convicted of Kercher 's murder and jailed for 26 years -- was capable of killing , Sollecito told Il Messagero : `` It is absurd and inadmissible . She is a very sweet girl . ''

Sollecito 's lawyer Luca Maori , who acted as an intermediary for the newspaper , confirmed to CNN that the interview had taken place and was reported accurately .

American student Knox and Italian Sollecito were convicted last week of murdering Kercher , who was found with her throat slit in the apartment she shared with Knox in the Italian town of Perugia . Both , and another suspect found guilty in a separate trial , are appealing .

Speaking from his cell in Terni prison in central Italy , Sollecito maintained his innocence and blamed his conviction on a `` media campaign . ''

`` I was certain that the verdict would put an end to a nightmare . Instead , it did n't , '' he said .

`` When the sentencing was read , I did n't understand what was happening and even now it seems impossible and still do n't understand why I was convicted . ''

Sollecito said he was no longer in love with Knox but still felt close to her . `` She is also in a nightmare and a harrowing situation like mine . ''

He also rejected claims he and Knox had acted inappropriately by shopping for underwear after Kercher 's murder -- an incident that was cited as an example of Knox 's lack of emotion following her roommate 's death .

`` We went shopping for underwear because Amanda had everything sequestered . All of which was said was wrong , '' he said .

Sollecito said his religious faith was sustaining him in prison , although he was struggling to cope .

`` If I did n't have faith , I would have ended my life , '' he said . `` I should be hopeful , but it is very difficult . The world has collapsed on top of me with this verdict . It collapsed on me and Amanda .
