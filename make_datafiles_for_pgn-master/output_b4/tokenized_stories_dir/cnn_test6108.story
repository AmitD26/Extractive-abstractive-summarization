Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Call it an amazing example of entrepreneurship or a daring play of deceit .

After a U.S.-based `` critical infrastructure '' company discovered in 2012 its computer systems were being accessed from China , its security personnel caught the culprit ultimately responsible : Not a hacker from the Middle Kingdom but one of the company 's own employees sitting right at his desk in the United States .

The software developer is simply referred to as `` Bob , '' according to a case study by the U.S. telecommunications firm Verizon Business .

Bob was an `` inoffensive and quiet '' programmer in his mid-40 's , according to his employee profile , with `` a relatively long tenure with the company '' and `` someone you would n't look at twice in an elevator . ''

Those innocuous traits led investigators to initially believe the computer access from China using Bob 's credentials was unauthorized -- and that some form of malware was sidestepping strong two-factor authentication that included a token RSA key fob under Bob 's name .

Investigators then discovered Bob had `` physically FedExed his RSA token to China so that the third-party contractor could log-in under his credentials during the workday , '' wrote Andrew Valentine , a senior forensic investigator for Verizon .

Bob had hired a programming firm in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang to do his work . His helpers half a world away worked overnight on a schedule imitating an average 9-to-5 workday in the United States . He paid them one-fifth of his six-figure salary , according to Verizon .

And over the past several years , Bob received excellent performance reviews of his `` clean , well written '' coding . He had even been noted as `` the best developer in the building . ''

A forensic image of Bob 's workstation revealed his true work habits and typical day :

9:00 a.m. -- Get to work , surf Reddit , watch cat videos

11:30 a.m. -- Lunch

1:00 p.m. -- Ebay

2:00 p.m or so -- Facebook and LinkedIn

4:30 p.m. -- Send end-of-day e-mail update to management

5:00 p.m. -- Go home

The Verizon investigation suggested Bob 's entrepreneurial outsourcing spirit stretched across several companies in his area -- netting him several hundred thousand dollars a year as he paid out about $ 50,000 a year to his China-based ghost writers , according to hundreds of PDF invoices also discovered on his work computer .

Verizon 's Valentine told CNN via e-mail that Bob `` was in fact terminated at the conclusion of the investigation . ''

Presumably Bob 's Chinese helpers were as well .
