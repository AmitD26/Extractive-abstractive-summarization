-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This story is about a U.S. senator 's alleged trips on a private plane to the Caribbean for sex parties with prostitutes .

If it proves to be true , it would most likely topple a powerful politician and affect President Barack Obama 's ability to pass legislation .

If it is false , it would raise questions about how government watchdog groups and the media handle anonymous tipsters and their information .

The senator is New Jersey 's Robert Menendez , a 59-year-old divorced father of two who is set to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . His Senate website calls Menendez `` a fighter for New Jersey families . ''

Menendez denied the story in a statement issued Wednesday by his Senate office : `` Any allegations of engaging with prostitutes are manufactured by a politically-motivated right-wing blog and are false . ''

The `` right-wing blog '' Menendez is accusing of manufacturing the allegations is The Daily Caller , an online publication founded by conservative commentator Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel , a former adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney .

The Daily Caller published its first reports on the allegations in early November just before the election . The stories were based on interviews with two women and a Dominican Republic official -- all unidentified . That prompted a denial then by the Democratic senator . He was easily re-elected .

But the latest allegations are based on documents published by a `` non-partisan '' Washington watchdog group -- Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , known as CREW .

It would be a stretch to call CREW `` right-wing , '' considering Executive Director Melanie Sloan served as minority counsel for the House Judiciary Committee under Rep. John Conyers , D-Michigan , before being hired by the Clinton Justice Department to be an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia . In fact , a quick online search finds blogs accusing CREW of being a `` left-wing '' group .

CREW published an e-mail this week it received last April from a man who identified himself as Peter Williams .

`` My duty as a U.S. citizen obligates me to report what I consider to be a grave violation of the most fundamental codes of conduct that a politician of my country must follow , '' the tipster wrote .

E-mails sent by Williams included statements from women detailing what they said were sex parties in a house and on a yacht in the Dominican Republic owned by Dr. Salomon Melgen , a south Florida ophthalmologist .

One e-mail purported to include a statement from a woman who said she was paid to have sex with the senator several times when she worked for `` the Doll Palace '' escort service in the spring of 2009 . Prostitution is legal in the Dominican Republic , but only if the prostitute is 18 or older .

Williams suggested that he and the women `` will be willing to testify '' about the allegations if their safety was guaranteed .

His e-mail to CREW said he became aware of the alleged behavior while traveling in the Dominican Republic for `` personal and business reasons '' starting in 2008 .

CREW said it passed the `` numerous '' Williams e-mail exchanges on to the Justice Department and the FBI in July 2012 , after the group was `` unable to independently verify the truth of the allegations . ''

But 10 months after the first contact with Williams , Sloan told CNN her group now has doubts about Williams ' identity , motives and veracity .

`` This unnamed source said he has had this information about Sen. Menendez as early as 2008 , yet he did n't come forward until four years later , right before Sen. Menendez was up for re-election , '' Sloan said . `` Further , this source refused to ever speak by phone to us , with other news organizations , or with the FBI , so , those two facts combined to seriously undermine his credibility . ''

CNN efforts to reach Williams through the e-mail address used to contact CREW have been unanswered .

It is not known whether the FBI succeeded in talking directly to Williams , but there was a very public indication this week that the agency is investigating Melgen . Agents were seen carrying boxes from his Palm Beach , Florida , office Wednesday .

An FBI spokesman in Florida confirmed there was `` law enforcement activity '' at the location where the search occurred but did not mention Melgen or anyone else and did not explain what agents were investigating . In 2011 , the Internal Revenue Service hit Melgen with an $ 11 million tax lien .

`` The government has not informed Dr. Melgen what concerns it may have , his lawyer Dean L. Willbur Jr. told CNN in an e-mail Thursday . `` We are confident that Dr. Melgen has acted appropriately at all times . Additionally , any issues concerning Dr. Melgen and the IRS have been fully resolved and satisfied . ''

Menendez calls Melgen a friend and political supporter . He acknowledged flying on the eye doctor 's plane three times to the Dominican Republic in 2010 , trips that he said were `` paid for and reported appropriately . ''

One of the trips involved official travel for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , which he chairs , while the other two were personal trips , Menendez 's spokeswoman Patricia Enright said . The senator is not required to publicly disclose information concerning personal travel , she said .

The senator made a payment of $ 58,500 from his personal funds to Melgen 's company on January 4 for the full operating costs of the two flights Menendez took in August and September 2010 to the Dominican Republic , Enright said . It was an `` oversight '' on the part of the senator not to have paid for the flights at the time he took them , she said .

New Jersey state Sen. Sam Thompson , a Republican , sent a complaint to the Senate Ethics Committee in November calling for an investigation , saying Menendez may have violated Senate ethics by `` repeatedly flying on a private jet to the Dominican Republic and other locations ... and soliciting prostitutes . '' Thompson said he did not hear back from the Ethics Committee .

At an event in Washington on Thursday night , when asked by CNN whether be violated Senate finance rules , Menendez said , `` These are nameless , faceless , anonymous allegations . You should find out from them . ''

The Senate Ethics Committee said it could not comment . Enright said the senator assumes the committee is reviewing the matter , but he has not been contacted .

CNN asked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday whether he thought Menendez was handling the controversy properly .

`` First of all , Bob Menendez is my friend , '' Sen. Reid said . `` He is an outstanding senator . He is now the new chair of the Foreign Relations Committee . Any questions in this regard direct to him . I do n't know anything about it . ''

`` I think the issue of the trips alone are probably not enough to suggest that he does n't have the right to assume the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee , '' Sloan said . `` I think if all the allegations together prove to be true , that would certainly suggest questions about Sen. Menendez 's fitness for the chairmanship and perhaps even his position in the Senate . ''

The executive director for CREW , which sent the Williams e-mails to the FBI , said people should `` withhold judgment given the many questions about the source of these allegations and the timing of these allegations . I think the best thing is to wait for the FBI to investigate and figure out what really happened here , if Sen. Menendez did something wrong and if not , who 's really behind this effort to smear him . ''

If this story evolves into a scandal and Menendez is forced to resign , the Democrats ' majority in the Senate would likely get one vote thinner . New Jersey law allows Gov. Chris Christie , a Republican , to appoint an interim senator until a special election , which would be no sooner than November .
