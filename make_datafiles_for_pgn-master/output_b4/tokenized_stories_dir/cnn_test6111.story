-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A mysterious blast ripped through a busy Turkish customs gate on the border with Syria on Monday , killing at least 13 people and wounding dozens , the Turkish government said .

Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc , chief spokesman for the government , said a minivan traveling from Syria to Turkey exploded . He declined to call it a terrorist attack , saying the investigation was still ongoing .

`` The type of explosive could not be determined as of this time , '' Arinc said .

`` In situations like this all possibilities are considered . ''

There is no question , however , that this was one of the deadliest blasts to hit Turkey in years .

`` It 's like hell . People are injured , '' said a Turkish smuggler who asked to use only the name Gokmen because of the illicit nature of his work . He said he was on the Syrian side of the sprawling border terminal when he heard the blast .

Amateur video of the explosion aftermath showed bystanders running amid scattered shrapnel , burned-out cars and ambulances , screaming in panic and pain .

Bystanders carried a bleeding man from smoking wreckage near the traffic booths where Turkish border officials normally processed transiting cars and cargo trucks .

`` My house is two kilometers -LRB- about a mile and a quarter -RRB- away from the border ... but the blast was powerful enough that we heard it , '' Mahmut Iri , the mayor of the Turkish border town of Cilvegozu , said in a phone call with CNN .

Iri said the explosion hit the last Turkish border gate before Syrian territory .

`` I know for a fact that two of the people who died were Turks , '' Iri added .

Syrian rebels first overran the Syrian border gate at Bab el Hawa last summer , flushing out government forces after days of fighting .

Within several months , Turkey was allowing vehicles through the border gate to rebel-controlled Syria .

Turkish officials have not yet commented on the cause of the deadly blast .

Over the past 22 months , fighting has frequently spilled over Turkey 's 900-kilometer -LRB- 560-mile -RRB- border with Syria .

In October , five Turkish civilians were killed when Syrian troops shelled the Turkish border town of Akcakale . And in June , Syrian anti-aircraft fire brought down a Turkish military reconnaissance jet over the Mediterranean Sea .

When fighting erupts across the border , Turkish authorities periodically close schools that are close to Turkish territory .

In recent months , the NATO military alliance has responded to a Turkish government request for assistance by deploying Patriot missile batteries around major cities close to the Syrian border . Hundreds of American , German and Dutch troops have been sent to Turkey to operate the Patriots , which the Turkish government says are designed to protect Turkey from the threat of Syrian ballistic missiles .

On February 1 , a suicide bomber attacked the entrance to the U.S. Embassy in Turkey 's capital , Ankara , killing a Turkish guard and seriously wounding a Turkish journalist . A violent leftist group called the Revolutionary People 's Liberation Party-Front , or DHKP-C , claimed responsibility for the attack .

In a rambling online manifesto , the group said one of the reasons the U.S. Embassy was targeted was to stop what it called American imperialist plans to colonize Syria and Turkey .

Fighting inside Syria

Meanwhile , Syrian rebels claimed to have captured Syria 's largest man-made dam on Monday .

`` The Free Army took control of the city of Tabqa and the Euphrates -LRB- Tabqa -RRB- Dam , '' the opposition Media Center in Tabqa announced in an online posting .

`` If clashes will happen , this will cause big damage and the whole area will drown and many places will lose electricity . ''

CNN could not independently confirm claims that the dam had been captured . The Syrian government did not respond to opposition claims that its forces had lost control of the dam .

The Tabqa Dam was completed in the 1970s with the help of thousands of Syrian and Soviet workers . It houses a hydroelectric power station .

The dam sits at the end Assad Lake , a man-made reservoir on the Euphrates River named after the father and son who have ruled Syria for the past four decades .

Opposition groups distributed videos of Syrian rebels seizing caches of weapons and ammunition from positions once held by Syrian security forces .

They also showed video of what appeared to be the dam itself , towering over the surrounding countryside .
