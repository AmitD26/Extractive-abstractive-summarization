-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Military brass at Fort Hood , Texas , on Tuesday announced tightened security procedures and the availability of a range of mental health services in the wake of the November 5 shooting spree that killed 13 people on the post .

Steps have been taken to tighten restrictions on who gets onto the post , to position armed guards in key locations including behavioral health facilities , and to carry out random inspections of containers , said Col. Bill Hill , garrison commander .

`` Relaxed entry will cease , '' he told post personnel in a televised town hall meeting .

All vehicles entering the post will be required to display a Department of Defense sticker or a secure pass , and some buildings will require badge access , he said .

Security at both the fort 's airfields also will be tightened , with guards and patrols on site , he said .

Soldiers assigned to Fort Hood will have to register their personal firearms with the director of emergency services , he added . Fort Hood is home to some 50,000 active-duty soldiers and 18,000 of the soldiers ' family members .

The suspect in the shootings , Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan , 39 , has been charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder . Hasan , who was wounded by two civilian officers , is being treated at a hospital .

Additional charges are under consideration , Col. Jeff Harris said .

Many of the security changes have already been implemented , including additional searches at the gates and greater restrictions on who can get onto the post , said Lt. Gen. Bob Cone , Fort Hood 's commanding general .

But , Cone said , had the changes been in place on November 5 , they might not have been enough .

`` I do n't think necessarily they would have had an effect on this event , '' he said .

Among Fort Hood 's resources for treating mental health problems -- including post-traumatic stress disorder -- are a 12-bed inpatient psychiatric ward , an outpatient clinic , a combat stress reset program , social services and substance abuse treatment , said Dr. Steve Braverman , commander of Fort Hood 's Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center .

After the attack , the post 's mental health staff was augmented by 75 to 80 mental health workers , though some have gone back to other assignments , he said .

Soldiers affected by the attack were screened for mental health problems afterward and will be rescreened 90 days after the event `` to ensure that any previously unidentified issues are addressed , '' Braverman said .

A 24-hour `` behavioral health hot line '' is available , and a surveillance program `` to identify and monitor areas of concern '' will be started soon , he said .

`` These findings may lead to targeted interventions for certain populations as we address these issues , '' Braverman said .

Plans call for construction of an 82,000-square-foot facility in which behavioral health facilities would be consolidated , Braverman said .

Soldiers in need of care can also make appointments with their primary care providers , he said .

The objective , Braverman said , is `` to restore trust and confidence in Army medicine . ''

Despite the availability of resources , many soldiers have expressed reluctance to seek mental health care , fearing that doing so would adversely affect their careers .

`` There is a perception of stigma , '' Cone said .

But Braverman said treatment need not hinder anyone 's career .

`` If you are seen in our system , while there 's information in the medical records , that 's not allowed to be used for any determination of security levels or future assignments , '' he said .

`` This is really all about us regaining the trust in our community , in our soldiers , in our security , in our installation , '' Cone said . `` That was taken from us , and what we have to do is take it back , and that is done one person at a time . ''

He added : `` If there is someone out there who is hurting , I assure you there are resources in place and we can take care of them . ''
