-LRB- Mashable -RRB- -- Google has quietly launched its own full-length online magazine , a quarterly publication whose aim is to create a `` breathing space in a busy world . ''

The first edition of Think Quarterly , based out of the UK , is a 68-page dive into the world of data and its impact on business .

The first thing most people will notice is that it 's a visually stunning piece of work . It 's a rich Flash app with Google 's quirky sensibilities and the in-depth writing you might find in BusinessWeek or Salon .

Google 's quarterly magazine is edited and designed by creative agency The Church of London .

The articles themselves are thought pieces about major business and technology topics from a variety of freelancers and contributors . Google was able to snag Simon Rogers -LRB- editor of The Guardian 's Datablog -RRB- , Ulrike Reinhard -LRB- editor of WE Magazine -RRB- , and other journalists for the project .

Many of Think Quarterly 's articles feature interviews with Google executives and technology leaders . Some of the people featured include Vodafone UK CEO Guy Laurence , Google Chief Economist Hal Varian and famed psychologist Peter Kruse .

`` At Google , we often think that speed is the forgotten ` killer application ' -- the ingredient that can differentiate winners from the rest , '' Matt Brittin , Google 's managing director of UK & Ireland operations , said in Think Quarterly 's introduction . `` We know that the faster we deliver results , the more useful people find our service . ''

`` But in a world of accelerating change , we all need time to reflect . Think Quarterly is a breathing space in a busy world . It 's a place to take time out and consider what 's happening and why it matters . ''

It 's unclear whether the new online magazine is another sign that Google is entering the media business or whether it 's just a project to feed the company 's intellectual curiosity .

Google does n't describe its newest project as a magazine or a publication . Instead , Google calls it a book on its website and a `` unique communications tool '' on its Twitter account .

Regardless of what you call it , Think Quarterly is an interesting and informative experiment by the search giant .
