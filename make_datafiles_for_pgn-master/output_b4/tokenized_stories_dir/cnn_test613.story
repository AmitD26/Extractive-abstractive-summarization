Few laws can drive political discourse and posturing like the Affordable Care Act , otherwise known as Obamacare . The individual mandate was one of its most contentious aspects . Today , though , it 's another mandate -- the employer penalty -- that is garnering headlines .

The Obama administration announced it would delay the implementation of the employer penalty for a year , until 2015 . This move is sure to please businesses that employ a large number of lower-wage employees who do n't receive comprehensive health insurance . But it 's also been met with other cries of dismay .

Some have declared the delay another bit of evidence that Obamacare is fatally flawed and that it should be repealed immediately . Others have declared that this delay bodes poorly for the individual mandate , which should not be attacked . And still more have taken it as a larger indication of the state of the administration , that it spells doom for immigration overhaul , that it 's a sign of a tyrannical administration , or that it 's just one more illustration of incompetence in getting Obamacare off the ground .

For the most part , these are all political posturing . The employer penalty , like the individual mandate , is just one small part of a very large law . It serves a specific purpose , and although Obamacare will not perform as efficiently without it , it will still function .

The employer penalty is complicated . The first thing to know is that it only applies to businesses with more than 50 full-time-equivalent employees . Any `` small business '' with 50 or fewer employees does n't have to provide insurance at all .

If you have more than 50 workers , you have to provide comprehensive insurance to your employees that covers a core set of benefits , and the premiums ca n't cost workers more than 9.5 % of their income . If you do n't , you pay a penalty of $ 2,000 for each full-time worker -- your total of employees minus 30 .

Alternatively , you can provide them with much less comprehensive plans that meet `` minimum essential coverage . '' But employees can refuse this coverage and instead go to an exchange in their state to obtain health insurance . If they do , businesses will pay a penalty of $ 3,000 for each employee who goes to an exchange and qualifies for a subsidy from the federal government .

These penalties can add up to millions for large employers . So companies are taking them seriously . But it 's important to put things in perspective . It 's likely that more than 95 % of businesses are smaller than the 50-employee limit , so few need concern themselves with the penalty at all .

Moreover , of the 4 % of employers who are large enough to have the penalty affect them , about 95 % already offer coverage . When all is said and done , the employer penalty will likely apply to about 10,000 companies out of about 6 million in the United States . Those companies employ about 1 % of American workers . But the penalty will still be real to these companies . They will be thrilled to see it delayed , and they will certainly fight to see it pushed back even further , or repealed .

There are some reasons to cheer them on . The employer penalty , as designed , has a lot of flaws . It encourages employers to push people into part-time jobs to have fewer full-time employees to count . It also is an incentive to get people to hire more well-off employees as opposed to poorer employees , because they ca n't get subsidies in the exchanges and wo n't incur a penalty for the employer if insurance is n't offered .

So why have an employer penalty at all ? The simple reason is that it lowers the cost of Obamacare .

Helping people buy insurance is expensive . When people get their insurance in the exchange with a subsidy , it costs the federal government money . When they get their insurance at their job , it costs the federal government much less . So pushing the uninsured to their employers , through the penalty , lowers the cost of Obamacare overall .

If we get rid of the employer penalty , the likely effect is that the number of uninsured will not drop as much , and the cost of the law will go up . It 's really that simple . Supporters of the law do n't like the former , and opponents do n't like the latter . So everyone will have something about which to complain . But still , the law will function , albeit less efficiently .

As for me , I 've never had a huge problem with the employer penalty . For better or for worse , we have an employer-based insurance system in the United States . The majority of people living here get their insurance through a job . Partly that 's historical , because of wage freezes in World War II , and partly that 's because the tax deduction for employer-sponsored insurance makes it all the more enticing to get insurance instead of wage increases . So if we want to continue this type of system , it makes sense to have employers either provide insurance to their workers or pay some sort of tax , or penalty , to help the government do it for them .

That does n't mean there are n't better ways to do this . First of all , we could uncouple insurance from jobs entirely . There 's really no good reason to have the system function this way . Past proposals , such as the Wyden-Bennett plan , would reduce employer-based insurance substantially . Sen. John McCain proposed eliminating the employer-sponsored insurance deduction in his 2008 presidential campaign . Even a single-payer plan , such as Medicare for all , would accomplish this task .

Short of that , if you want to keep this system intact , other mechanisms such as an overall payroll tax instead of this employer penalty would have removed the various bad incentives to favor wealthy or part-time employees . It 's a fixable problem .

But fixing it would require a functioning government . It would need Congress to pass a bill replacing or eliminating the employer mandate , and then the president to sign it . That 's not going to happen .

Opponents of Obamacare do n't appear eager to fix the law in ways that would make it less unpopular or repeal less likely . Supporters do n't appear eager to spend political capital to tinker with a law that cost them so much to pass in the first place . So we 'll get administrative fixes such as this one , which wind up pleasing few , other than those who enjoy political theater .
