-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of the mysteries of this administration is that President Obama is a great orator , but not always a great communicator , and we saw that dichotomy in effect again last night in Charlotte .

In a season of platitudes , his convention speech was admirably strong on policy specifics but weak on memorable themes .

He made a values-driven case for continuing on a difficult path toward rebuilding the great American middle class , but did not offer new details on just how we would achieve those goals in the next four years .

He successfully deconstructed the Republican plans as simply being more of the failed same -- `` Take two tax cuts , roll back some regulations , and call us in the morning ! '' -- but did n't offer a strategy for how the two parties would work better together in a second term .

And where Bill Clinton 's speech was focused on centrist swing voters , President Obama 's address seemed aimed at the party 's base , rocking the convention hall , but losing something in translation over television into living rooms across the nation .

The speech contained some clear declarations of difference between the two parties . A close read showed Obama , as always , rhetorically refusing to accept old terms of debate : `` We do n't think government can solve all our problems . But we do n't think that government is the source of all our problems . '' Instead , Obama sees a country balanced between rights and responsibilities , the individual and the community working together to make life a little better for us all . He believes passionately in the ability of government to make a positive difference -- and that is not socialistic , but realistic .

Obama soared when talking about foreign policy , driving home the inexplicable failure of Mitt Romney to mention Afghanistan in his Tampa convention keynote . The paragraphs on Osama bin Laden and the rebuilding of ground zero achieved elevation .

The president ticked through a list of promises kept , offering data points on our decreased dependence on foreign oil over the past four years , and a goal of 1 million new manufacturing jobs by the end of his second term .

He also belatedly embraced the recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission as a starting point to reduce the deficit and the debt , something he notably failed to do in his first term .

But if this was a sober and serious address , it was also a refined version of his stump speech ; there was little new and no overarching narrative arc to make this high-stakes political speech truly stand out from the pack . The White House said this would not be a State of the Union-style address , but there was a telltale laundry-list quality at times . Both Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton -- and even possibly Joe Biden -LRB- ! -RRB- -- offered more seamless inspiration speeches . In contrast , this felt like a speech written by committee .

Perhaps best that can be said of the speech , and this is not a small thing , is that President Obama spoke to the American people as adults last nights . He did not promise miracles , but instead steady improvement if we continued to work together , taking the nation in a better direction , one ironically more rooted in mid-20th century values , but better suited to the inclusive reality of American life in the 21st century .

It 's too soon to tell if any individual lines of this speech will endure . President Obama sometimes seems allergic to sound-bites as a point of pride . Lines like `` Killed bin Laden ; Saved G.M '' roll off Biden 's tongue , ready for a bumper sticker , but they almost seem too easy for the president and so the pitch is never hit .

But the closing lines of the address achieved real momentum and encapsulated President Obama 's argument : `` America , I never said this journey would be easy , and I wo n't promise that now . Yes , our path is harder , but it leads to a better place . Yes our road is longer , but we travel it together . We do n't turn back . We leave no one behind . We pull each other up . We draw strength from our victories , and we learn from our mistakes , but we keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon , knowing that providence is with us , and that we are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on Earth . ''

Or , as the new Bruce Springsteen anthem that closed out the convention more concisely said : `` We Take Care of Our Own . ''
