Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Before dawn on Friday , a man wearing an Afghan uniform shot and killed three U.S. soldiers during a meeting to discuss local security issues in the southern province of Helmand .

It was one of an unprecedented series of five attacks by people in Afghan security forces uniforms in the past week against NATO forces .

If the trend over the past few months continues , NATO troops in Afghanistan face a rapidly growing threat . It is compounded by the strategy of withdrawing all combat troops by the end of 2014 , which will increasingly leave relatively isolated international military advisors embedded with Afghan soldiers .

Attacks believed to be connected to Afghan security forces have already killed 34 NATO service members this year , drawing close to the record 36 international soldiers killed in similar attacks in 2011 , according to data compiled by the New America Foundation .

Nineteen of the 34 NATO troops killed this year were U.S. soldiers , while 15 American service members were killed in such attacks in 2011 .

These attacks now constitute 8 % of the total number of U.S. soldiers killed in Afghanistan this year . In 2011 , this number was closer to 4 % .

The targeting of U.S. and other NATO soldiers by members of the Afghan security forces first spiked in 2009 , and the number of incidents has gone up each year since .

In Friday 's attack in Helmand , three U.S. Special Forces soldiers were killed . An Afghan official told reporters that a commander at a police checkpoint had invited them to a predawn meal and security discussion , where he opened fire on the Americans before fleeing to take refuge with Taliban militants .

`` Now , he is with us , '' a Taliban spokesman claimed , identifying the attacker as a police commander named Asadullah who had been helping U.S. forces train Afghan policemen .

If this version of events is correct , the attack was premeditated and carefully planned -- likely with the help of the Taliban , who have claimed a role in about half of such attacks -- known as `` green-on-blue '' incidents -- since the beginning of the war .

A NATO military official tells CNN that , in fact , only 11 % of such incidents can be definitively attributed to the Taliban .

The motivations of about half the attackers are difficult to classify because the perpetrator is either dead or has fled .

According to media accounts of such incidents , many of the `` green-on-blue '' attacks appear to have taken place after an argument between Afghan and international troops , or because of an Afghan soldier 's personal grievances .

A Department of Defense report in April explains `` investigations have determined that a large majority of green-on-blue attacks are not attributable to insurgent infiltration of the ANSF -LSB- Afghan National Security Forces -RSB- but are due to isolated personal grievances against coalition personnel . ''

In 2011 , U.S. military behavioral scientist Dr. Jeffrey Bordin interviewed more than 600 Afghan soldiers and policemen and found they held overwhelmingly negative perceptions of Western soldiers .

The Afghan security forces aired grievances ranging from NATO soldiers ' supposedly indiscriminate fire that killed civilians to the public searching of Afghan soldiers outside NATO bases , as well as U.S. soldiers urinating in public or cursing at their Afghan counterparts .

Another likely cause of the increase in the number of green-on-blue incidents is straightforward : In the past two years the size of the Afghan army and police force has almost doubled from around 200,000 to around 350,000 .

This may also have contributed to a recent spike in the number of Afghan security forces turning their guns on their own Afghan colleagues . According to the NATO military official who spoke with CNN , there were 39 such `` green-on-green '' incidents last year and already 31 this year .

To combat the green-on-blue problem , U.S. and Afghan officials have implemented tighter vetting for Afghan army and police recruits , and now designate one U.S. soldier -- known as a `` guardian angel '' -- in those U.S Army units working with Afghan security forces whose job is solely to guard against attacks while American forces eat , sleep or exercise , the Associated Press reported .

A senior NATO military official tells CNN that the coalition has also increased the number of counterintelligence officers in the field to ferret out Taliban double agents .

But once all NATO combat troops have left Afghanistan at the end of 2014 any advisors who will remain will rely entirely on Afghan forces for their security , leaving them acutely vulnerable to green-on-blue attacks .
