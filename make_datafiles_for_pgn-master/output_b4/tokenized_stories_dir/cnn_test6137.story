Grand Rapids , Michigan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Say what you will about the Republican Party 's politics , but one thing I think we all can agree on is that they know how to control the message .

Instead of `` educated , '' they say `` elitist . ''

Instead of `` the rich , '' they prefer `` job creators . ''

And in their latest linguistic sleight of hand , the modern-day Houdinis have managed to turn `` stimulus '' into a four-letter word .

Or at least a word President Barack Obama no longer feels comfortable saying . In 2009 , he could n't say it enough . Now ... well , I did n't hear it once during his jobs speech last week , even though $ 447 billion in tax cuts and government spending would certainly qualify as being one .

But the president and his administration can avoid whatever word they choose in describing the jobs bill ; that 's not going to change what Republicans say about it :

`` With the president traveling the country touting his Stimulus II plan , it is important to understand the lessons from his first stimulus , '' Republican National Committee Reince Priebus said .

`` I suspect I am not the only American asking , if a trillion dollars ' worth of stimulus did n't work , why will another $ 450 billion do the trick ? '' former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson asked .

`` He had $ 800 billion worth of stimulus in the first round of stimulus . It created zero jobs , $ 400-plus billion in this package . And I can do the math on that one . Half of zero jobs is going to be zero jobs , '' said Texas Gov. Rick Perry .

As usual , Republicans are dictating the conversation , this time massaging their response to the president 's jobs bill to support their assertion that his $ 787 billion stimulus package was a failure .

And each day Obama avoids saying the word , he inadvertently gives their claims credibility by appearing to distance himself from his initiative .

Instead of using equivocal language , the president just needs to reclaim the word `` stimulus . '' And he needs to do it now as he tries to sell his jobs bill to the public . After all , it 's not like anyone 's forgotten the word or the 2009 measure he pushed through Congress . Might as well talk about its successes and shortcomings while trying to help out-of-work Americans , as opposed to being forced to do so in the general election , where such talk will be interpreted as simply trying to help himself .

Besides , the truth is the administration 's projections were overly optimistic and failed to meet the president 's own mark of keeping the unemployment rate under 8 % . Not to mention by its very spending structure , the impact of the stimulus package was not even designed to be felt by the majority of Americans quickly , which may have been wise fiscally but not so politically .

However , even with all of that , for anyone to characterize the stimulus package as a complete failure means he or she either had no idea just how bad the country 's economy was or they 're just parroting partisan talking points . -LRB- Between May 1999 and May 2009 , private-sector jobs increased by just 1.1 % , the lowest 10-year period since the Depression . -RRB-

And I ca n't help but notice how the chatty Republicans ' tongues are tied when it comes to mentioning the 750,000 jobs that were lost on average in the first three months of 2009 , during which the stimulus took effect and how that number declined to 35,000 by the beginning of 2010 ?

And am I the only one who finds it strange that Republican leadership wants to deem the stimulus a failure but fails to mention the studies performed by economists across the political spectrum that credit the stimulus for staving off a depression .

And then there 's front-runner Perry calling the president 's stimulus package a failure during Monday 's debate while not mentioning how he used $ 6 billion from the first `` failed '' stimulus package to balance his state 's budget . Not sure what they call that in Texas , but in the Midwest we call that hypocrisy .

Maybe I 'm just being silly for letting the facts get in the way of a good campaign slogan . Perhaps I 'm a bit naive to think the GOP should actually point out the stimulus pros with the cons in hopes of finding a more perfect solution to the country 's economic woes .

In any case , it seems Obama 's strategy of trying to pass a jobs stimulus package without saying the word `` stimulus '' just makes talking about the bill more difficult than it has to be . And if he continues to let undecided voters believe the first stimulus package was unsuccessful , what 's their motivation for getting behind him and pressuring their representatives to pass the second ?

Or even vote for him ?
