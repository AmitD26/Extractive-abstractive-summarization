-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Abortion is banned in Ireland , a historically devout Catholic country . Come Wednesday , that may change a little .

Dublin lawmakers will vote on a bill that will permit a woman to terminate a pregnancy if it poses a threat to her own life , including if she is contemplating suicide .

It 's the last stipulation that has raised the ire of conservative lawmakers and religious citizens . Catholic leaders have called it a ` Trojan horse ' leading to easy abortion access .

But abortion rights proponents have said it will still be difficult for women to access the procedure , and passing the law will help stem the flow of Irish women traveling to Britain to terminate unwanted pregnancies .

Woman 's death in Ireland abortion case ruled ` medical misadventure '

It is about `` saving lives '' when pregnant women are in danger , Prime Minister Enda Kenny has said . He said it wo n't change Ireland 's general ban on abortion .

His government wants the legislation , the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill 2013 , to become law before the summer recess at the end of this month .

Members of parliament will discuss the bill , which has led to heated public debates , before taking a vote Wednesday .

They have allowed 12 hours for arguments before the mandatory voting deadline comes at 10 p.m. local time -LRB- 5 p.m. ET -RRB- .

Kenny has acknowledged how uncomfortable the proposal may be in the majority Roman Catholic country .

`` This is an issue that has been very divisive and contentious for over 30 years , '' he said . `` It 's also an issue that is complex and sensitive , about which many Irish people have sincere and strongly held views . ''

`` This is about women , it is about saving lives -- the life of the mother and the life of the unborn . ''

He is calling on the population and lawmakers to have compassion on both .
