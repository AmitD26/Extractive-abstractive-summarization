Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- As Bobbi Kristina Brown remains hospitalized , her father 's attorney said `` we are currently investigating the events that led to -LRB- her -RRB- hospitalization . ''

Attorney Christopher Brown also said Tuesday that the 21-year-old daughter of singers Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown `` is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon , '' contrary to some reports .

Bobbi Kristina Brown was found facedown in a bathtub over the weekend . Her family has been tight-lipped about her condition , but her R&B singer father issued a statement through his lawyer Tuesday night .

`` We continue to request privacy in this matter . Please allow for our family to deal with this matter and give Bobbi Kristina the love and support she needs at this time , '' Bobby Brown said in the statement .

After she was discovered unresponsive in her home in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell , Brown was rushed to a hospital , where doctors placed her in a medically induced coma . As of late Monday , she remained on a ventilator in the intensive care unit , a source close to the family said .

On Tuesday , she was moved to Atlanta 's Emory University Hospital , sources close to the family said .

The status of her brain function wo n't be known until sedatives are reduced , the source told CNN .

`` Bobbi Kristina is fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family . As her father already stated , we are asking you to honor our request for privacy during this difficult time , '' the Houston family said , thanking her supporters .

The source close to the family told CNN that Brown 's eyes opened and closed a few times Monday , but that doctors told family members not to read too much into that movement .

Doctors were trying to reduce the sedatives to check Brown 's brain function but decided to keep her in the coma for now , the source said .

The source added that Brown had seizures Monday .

It was not immediately clear what medical significance these reported events have in Brown 's case .

Bobbi Kristina , in her own words

She `` was not breathing '' when Nick Gordon and a friend , who 's been identified as Maxwell Lomas , found her Saturday morning inside her townhouse in the Atlanta suburb .

They called 911 and performed CPR until emergency crews arrived and took over , police spokeswoman Lisa Holland said .

The spokeswoman said when Brown was found , she was `` unresponsive , meaning not breathing , no heartbeat . ''

In scanner traffic , emergency services could be heard describing an `` ECHO-level response '' -- urgent and life-threatening -- with `` possible cardiac arrest . ''

`` Twenty-one-year-old female in the bathtub , facedown . PD 's -LRB- police department 's -RRB- en route . ''

On Monday , a source close to the family told CNN that Brown was in `` really bad shape . ''

Everyone is `` hoping for the best , preparing for the worst '' and `` praying for a miracle , '' the source said .

Nobody knows what caused Brown 's unresponsiveness , Holland said , but police consider it a medical incident at this time . She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug - or alcohol-related . The incident report referenced a drowning .

Police had been to Brown 's residence recently . Somebody reported a fight there on January 23 , but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation , Holland said .

Almost three years ago , Whitney Houston was found dead in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton hotel near Los Angeles , hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party .

A coroner ruled her February 11 , 2012 , death an accidental drowning , with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors .

Brown is her only child .

`` She encourages me and inspires me , '' Houston once said of her daughter . `` When I look at her eyes and I see myself , I go , ` OK . I can do this . I can do this . ' ''

Brown was born in 1993 during Houston 's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown , which ended in divorce in 2007 .

The daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the mid-2000s reality show `` Being Bobby Brown , '' in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front-row seat to their marital fireworks .

Mother and daughter performed together on national TV in 2009 , when the two sang `` My Love Is Your Love '' in Central Park on ABC 's `` Good Morning America . ''

Given the pair 's close relationship , it 's no surprise that Houston 's death was a major blow .

Days after her mother 's body was found , a grieving Bobbi Kristina -- then 18 -- was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center because she was `` overwhelmed , '' family friend Kim Burrell said .

`` She loves hard , '' Burrell said then of Bobbi Kristina . `` She 's going to be OK , and we 're going to see to it . ''

After Houston 's death , Bobbi Kristina talked of pursuing a career in acting and music , just like her mother .

In 2012 , she reportedly lobbied for a role in a planned biopic of her mother 's life . Lifetime 's `` Whitney , '' which was directed by actress Angela Bassett , debuted in January 2015 , but the Houston family was not involved .

Brown did make her acting debut in 2012 on Tyler Perry 's show `` For Better or Worse . '' Her performance in the small role won praise from Perry .

`` She did a fantastic job , '' he said at the time . `` And that kid has such a future . She 's such an actor . ''

Even before her mother 's death , videos of Brown singing surfaced on YouTube and were quickly criticized by fans who felt her talent did not live up to Houston 's .

Concerns that she may have substance abuse issues , as her mother did , intensified in July 2014 after a picture was posted on her Instagram account showing a young woman who looked like Brown appearing to be smoking from a bong . The image had previously made the media rounds two years prior .

The caption read : `` This picture may be inappropriate but I want to make a connection with you all . Do n't worry this picture is n't recent just hear me out . Do you know what I feel ? I feel strange I ca n't feel any pain anymore . I do n't take any drugs as of recently . Things just happened . But then there is some situation that force me to do things and the impact I 'll feel pain . I did and I do . I was hurt . ''

Brown later denied that she posted the photo and tweeted that it was done by someone attempting to tarnish her image .

Brown appeared on episodes of Lifetime 's brief reality show `` The Houstons : On Our Own , '' which followed her life after Houston 's death .

One of the show 's story lines revolved around Brown 's relationship with Nick Gordon , who had lived with Houston and her daughter since he was 12 years old .

Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon , and in January 2014 , she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings along with the words , #HappilyMarried â€¢ SO #Inlove . '' However , Bobby Brown attorney Christopher Brown said Bobbi Kristina was never married to Gordon .

'' -LRB- Houston -RRB- made me promise several times to look after Krissy ... and , Mom , I will never , ever , ever break that promise , '' Gordon told the entertainment show `` Extra '' afterward , saying Houston `` just treated me like she gave birth to me . ''

It was unclear whether Gordon and Lomas came into the home Saturday morning to find Brown in the bathtub or if they had been in another part of the house overnight , said Holland , the police spokeswoman .

The whereabouts of another man who was in the house when Brown was found , Maxwell Lomas , are also unclear . But in response to several media outlets reporting Lomas ' lengthy rap sheet , attorney Philip Holloway issued a statement Tuesday saying his client is a cooperative witness and Lomas ' most recent arrest in January has nothing to do with Brown 's hospitalization .

Holloway also told CNN Wednesday that his client was the one who actually found Brown and called 911 . Holloway 's comments came after he met with Roswell police for two hours ; his client was not at the meeting , he said .

On January 15 , Lomas was booked on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute , possession of alprazolam -LRB- aka Xanax , an anti-anxiety drug -RRB- and possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of or the attempt to commit a felony , according to Fulton County Sheriff 's Office spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan .

CNN has also learned from Fulton and Dawson county authorities that Lomas was arrested at least three times in 2011 and 2012 and charged with a host of crimes , including battery and alcohol , weapons , drug and probation violations . Holloway did not mention the previous arrests in his statement .

`` Mr. Lomas ' widely reported recent arrest is completely unrelated to the incidents that occurred at Ms. Brown 's residence and there is absolutely no relationship between the events . He has pleaded not guilty to those charges , '' it said . `` Mr. Lomas has not been accused of anything in connection with Bobbi Kristina Brown 's injuries . ''

Police obtained a search warrant to look through Brown 's house , but that 's standard procedure , Holland said .

Concern for Brown came from many in the entertainment world .

Music director Michael Bearden sent along `` healing energy to the daughter of a late great friend . '' Songwriter Diane Warren tweeted , `` I hope Bobbi Kristina gets the help she needs . ''

`` Poor thing , '' Warren wrote . `` Almost 3 yrs to the day her mom passed and the same thing almost happened to her . ''
