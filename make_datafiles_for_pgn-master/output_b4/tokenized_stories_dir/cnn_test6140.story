Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. transportation security officials want to speed more travelers through airport security lines by expanding a voluntary program that requires a background check .

`` Let 's get away from the one size fits all and let 's focus on those that we can pre-screen , '' Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole told the Aspen Security Forum on Friday .

`` Those who are willing to share just a little bit of information and say let 's do that pre-screening so we can expedite your physical screen at the checkpoint because we have a high confidence that you are not a terrorist , '' he said .

For those who opt to become a five-year member of the PreCheck program for $ 85 , they can keep their shoes , belt and light jacket as they walk through a dedicated and expedited security line .

Additionally , they can keep a laptop and small water bottle in their bag .

The original initiative required travelers to opt in through an airline 's frequent flier program or first enroll in other programs like trusted traveler .

Starting later this year , U.S. citizens will be able to apply online and visit an enrollment site to provide identification and fingerprints . TSA will start the program at Washington Dulles and Indianapolis International with plans to expand later . It also requires a background check .

`` Then , within two to three weeks ... you will be issued a known travel number , '' Pistole said , to applause in Aspen .

TSA hopes to have 25 % of the traveling public enrolled in expedited screening by the end of 2013 . More than 650 million people fly U.S. airlines annually .

Airlines and TSA have for years sought to expedite passenger screening , especially for premium-paying business customers . But striking a balance between thorough security in a post 9/11 age and the desire of travelers to reduce the `` hassle factor '' of airport screening has been a political , logistical , and financial challenge .

The idea of removing low-risk , pre-screened people from the main security lines , will allow security resources to be concentrated more closely on potential threats and alleviate long lines at security checkpoints .

Homeland security officials are most concerned about long-standing terror interests in bringing down U.S. airliners . Currently , the focus has been on sharpening the ability of security personnel to detect explosives .

Since the TSA first announced the PreCheck program in March of 2012 , a total of 12 million travelers at 40 airports have taken advantage of expedited security lines .

When it was first released , the program was only available on Delta and American Airlines , but US Airways , United Airlines and Alaska Airlines were later included .

The latest expansion will include JetBlue and Southwest , the largest airline for domestic flights .
