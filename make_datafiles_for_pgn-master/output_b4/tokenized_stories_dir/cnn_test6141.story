-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- It 's official : The Duchess of Cambridge has given birth to the future monarch of the United Kingdom .

Of course , as I write this , mere moments after the blessed event , very little is known about the newest member of the House of Windsor .

Will the little prince have its mother 's good looks or its father 's good looks pre-baldness ? Where does it stand on the phone-hacking controversy ? Will he marry North West or Blue Ivy Carter ?

One thing 's for sure : The royal baby is going to have a wild life ahead of him . He 'll probably live for at least a century , if the genes are any indication . He will need to learn some valuable lessons .

And what better place to begin the Royal Baby 's education than Game of Thrones , a TV show about crisscrossing royal bloodlines and fancy accents ?

Like the George R. R. Martin books that inspired it , Thrones is set in Westeros , which is basically England in the Middle Ages with more dragons and fewer magical swords .

Here are ten lessons that 'll guarantee that King No-Name does n't lose his head , metaphorically speaking .

1 . Stay on good terms with your family members . All of your family members .

Siblings , parents , uncles , even embarrassing cousins . Seriously , you have to spend the rest of your life with these people , and if you are n't careful , one of them might send their illegitimate magical shadow-baby to stab you in the back .

2 . When traveling , it 's always better if you can speak the local language .

Daenerys Targaryen â € '' aka Daenerys Stormborn , aka Khaleesi , aka Dragon Lady â € '' spends most of her days traveling from foreign city to foreign city .

Local lords always think they can fool her . But she speaks the local language and studies the history of every spot she visits ; very often , she becomes more popular with the local citizens than their own government . -LRB- Sometimes , she becomes the local government . -RRB-

3 . Pay attention to your subjects in the outer provinces .

Because everyone on Game of Thrones is too busy with the palace intrigue in Game of Thrones , nobody ever pays any attention to the poor Night 's Watch , even though they keep sending increasingly-urgent messages about an army of attacking ice-zombies .

What I 'm saying is , do n't forget about Canada , okay ?

4 . Do n't trust eunuchs .

Although they make excellent bodyguards .

5 . Do n't trust your friends .

They will betray you .

6 . Do n't trust your enemies .

They do n't play fair .

7 . Actually , do n't trust anyone .

Especially not in Vegas .

8 . Winter is Coming .

Since you live in England , it 's pretty much always winter . Put on a coat !

9 . The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword .

Since you have no actual political power , the moral of this lesson is basically that you should carry a sword on you at all times .

You 're royalty , gosh darn it ! If you ca n't carry a sword , who can ? You think Prime Minister David Cameron can wield a sword ? Yeesh , speaking of eunuchs , amiright ? #BritishPoliticalHumour

10 . Do not have sex with anyone in your immediate family .

Because something like this could happen .
