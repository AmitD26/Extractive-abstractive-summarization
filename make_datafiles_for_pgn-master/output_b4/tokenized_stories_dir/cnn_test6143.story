-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The rise of Brazil as an economic force has brought with it a policy challenge familiar here in the United States : immigration .

Recently crowned the world 's sixth-largest economy , Brazil has become an immigration magnet , both to low-skilled workers -- some of whom enter illegally -- and high-skilled workers looking for opportunities in the country 's thriving sectors .

Brazil historically has been welcoming to immigrants , but the challenge now is more pronounced as the government seeks to accept foreigners while protecting its hard-won prosperity .

The country faces two simultaneous challenges : how to deal with recent illegal immigration , mostly from Haiti , and how to make it easier for highly educated immigrants to get work permits . A number of Brazilian ministries have either proposed or are deliberating policies as the country ushers in a new era of immigration .

`` You can not become the sixth economy in the world with impunity , '' Defense Minister Celso Amorim , a former foreign minister , said recently .

Before , people left Brazil to chase a better life , he said . Now , the tide has turned .

`` Naturally , we have to study how to act during this new situation . It 's not just Haitians , but Brazilians who are returning . We have to try to exercise the same humanitarian spirit that 's present in Haiti -LRB- where Brazil leads a U.N. mission -RRB- , and in a manner that compatible with our means , '' Amorim said .

In 2011 through September , Brazil processed 52,353 work permits to immigrants , a 32.8 % increase over 2010 .

Brazil 's needs and wants have created the situation where there are ideas to limit the entry of some immigrants and entice the entry of others .

In recent decades in Brazil , the education levels of the population have increased significantly , said Ernesto Amaral , a demographer and professor at the Federal University of Minas Gerais , Brazil .

In that period , an increase in the number of educated workers meant more competition for jobs and a negative impact on wages , he said .

`` But this negative impact is decreasing because we have the demand for skilled labor in Brazil , '' he said .

In other words , Brazil 's boom has created an environment where the demand for high-skilled jobs is now outpacing the growth of Brazil 's educated workforce .

To meet this challenge , Brazil will have to ramp up its education efforts even more .

`` Immigration is important in the short run . We need these workers in Brazil right now , '' he said .

At the same time , an opposite effect is happening for low-skilled work , Amaral said .

The percentage of low-educated Brazilians is decreasing , but the demand for low-skilled labor is decreasing faster , he said .

Amaral summed up the way that Brazilians , usually welcoming to immigrants , see this development : `` We want to help these low-skilled people , but there is a limit . ''

Facing with illegal immigration from Haiti , Brazil 's National Council on Immigration agreed this month to provide 1,200 work visas per year to Haitians affected by the 2010 earthquake who emigrate to Brazil .

The work permits will be good for five years , a period during which the immigrants will find jobs and apply for extensions , or will return home . Unlike other work visas in Brazil , applicants need not have a job contract in hand when they arrive .

Under the plan , those immigrants already in the country who entered illegally will be `` regularized . ''

Unlike the United States , where illegal entry by low-skilled workers is often viewed as a threat , Brazilians are extolling the positives such newly-legalized immigrants can bring .

`` For example , the Haitians speak French and could be useful in the cities where the World Cup games will be held , '' Labor Minister Paulo Roberto dos Santos Pinto said .

The country 's justice secretary , Paulo Abrao , is another immigration cheerleader .

`` Brazil can be an example to the world of an immigration policy that is open and democratic that reflects our historical welcoming tradition , '' he said on Twitter this week .

He continued : `` Immigrants add cultural value to Brazil and collaborate in the development of the nation . ''

In addition to providing visas for the Haitians , the health department offered 1.3 million reais -LRB- U.S. $ 745,000 -RRB- for healthcare for them .

But pleasantries aside , Brazil has an economy to protect , and the work visas might signify a closing of a door rather than an opening .

`` The attempt to grant visas is an attempt to limit and control the number that come , rather than being generous and open , '' said Albert Fishlow , professor emeritus at Columbia University and the author of `` Starting Over : Brazil Since 1985 . ''

The approach toward immigration by Brazil and the United States is n't that different after all , he said .

`` Both countries want to benefit from advances in technology and both countries want to attract people who are relatively skilled and have an opportunity to contribute to that , '' Fishlow said .

As for low-skilled immigration , there are other forces raising opposition to their entry .

The Haitian immigrants are arriving mostly to the western states of Amazonas and Acre , in the heart of the Amazon rain forest . A debate of great importance in Brazil currently is how to protect the Amazon . This is the larger issue behind the immigration debate , Fishlow said : will the Amazon be less protected with an influx of newcomers ?

Meanwhile , the country 's Secretary of Strategic Affairs has created a team that will propose a new national immigration policy wit emphasis on high-skilled workers .

One reported proposal would create two `` lines '' for foreigners applying for work visas in Brazil . One for highly-educated applicants , and one for everyone else .

The coordinator for the project , Ricardo Paes de Barros , declined to speak to CNN about the commission 's deliberations .
