Cairo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For a second day , Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy 's home was not spared from the wrath of protesters who remain unconvinced of his defense of recent controversial decisions .

Dozens of protesters threw rocks and glass bottles at the home in Sharkia province Friday and tried to push aside a police barrier , said Alaa Mahmoud , a spokesman for the Interior Ministry .

Two policemen and several protesters were injured , and four people were arrested .

Protesters also made their message clear at the presidential palace in Cairo , where thousands broke through a barricade and sprayed graffiti on the palace walls . Guards at the palace did not engage the protesters .

Crowds also gathered at Cairo 's Tahrir Square but were largely calm , unlike the night before .

In remarks Thursday night -- his latest since the bloodiest stretch in two weeks of political unrest -- Morsy refused to back off the controversial edict he issued or his nation 's upcoming constitutional referendum , saying he respects peaceful opposition to his decisions but wo n't stand for violence .

On Friday , Egyptian Vice President Mahmoud Mekki told CBC , a private Egyptian TV station , that Morsy would consider postponing the referendum , so long as there are no legal challenges to the postponement .

The president has agreed to delay the vote for expatriates until Wednesday , said chief of staff Refaa El-Tahtawy . That vote was previously set for Saturday .

During his Thursday speech , the president condemned those involved in the clashes -- referring specifically to those with weapons and who are backed by members of the `` corrupt ... ex-regime . '' He promised they 'd be held accountable .

Opinion : Morsy miscalculating Egyptians ' rage

'' -LRB- They -RRB- will not escape punishment , '' the president said in a televised speech .

Yet Morsy 's threat not only failed to mollify many protesters on the streets , it further enraged them . Activists camped in the square chanted `` Leave ! Leave ! Leave ! '' as the president talked .

And minutes after the speech ended , the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Cairo was `` ablaze , '' state TV reported , citing witnesses . The Islamist group said on its website and Twitter that the building had come under `` a terrorist attack , '' with hundreds surrounding it . By early Friday , there was no sign of a fire or significant damage .

The National Salvation Front , an umbrella group of opposition organizations , called for large-scale demonstrations against a government it says has `` lost legitimacy , '' said the group , as reported by the semiofficial al-Ahram newspaper .

Such a call for action -- and the sustained presence in Tahrir Square -- suggests activists are undaunted by threats from Morsy and members of the Muslim Brotherhood , the Islamist group tied to him . The group was banned under longtime President Hosni Mubarak but is now Egypt 's dominant political force .

On Twitter , the Brotherhood has said it will hold opposition figures `` fully responsible for escalation of violence & inciting their supporters . ''

Adel Saeed , a spokesman for Egypt 's newly appointed general prosecutor , said Friday morning that Hamdeen Sabahi , Mohamed ElBaradei and Amr Moussa are being investigated for allegedly `` conspiring to topple '' the government . All three are well-known internationally -- with ElBaradei being a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Moussa a onetime head of the Arab League -- and are now being probed for their role in the opposition against Morsy , who defeated all three in this year 's presidential election .

ElBaradei said on Twitter : `` I call upon all the national forces and figures not to participate in a dialogue that lacks all the basics of a truthful discourse . We support a dialogue that is not based on the policy of arm-twisting and forcing the status quo . ''

During an interview with Al-Arabiya , an Arabic news network , ElBaradei called on Morsy to postpone the referendum vote and to `` rescind the constitutional declaration . '' He added that `` only then will the opposition engage in dialogue . ''

Those taking part in the protests around the North African nation say the scenes are similar to those of the 2011 uprising that led to Mubarak 's ouster . This time , they say , dissent is being vigorously stamped out by Morsy 's backers in government and on the street .

Specifically , they spoke of thugs with knives and rocks chasing activists , presidential backers belittling opponents and pressure from various quarters to go home and be quiet .

`` It 's exactly the same battle , '' said Hasan Amin , a CNN iReporter .

A November 22 edict by Morsy , in which he made his decisions immune to judicial oversight until a new constitution is voted upon , set off the latest wave of political unrest . And it 's been growing -- and growing more violent -- in recent days .

Opposition leaders have been clear in saying what would mollify them : Morsy must roll back his edict granting himself expanded presidential powers and must postpone a December 15 referendum on a proposed constitution , which they say does n't adequately represent or protect all Egyptians .

Morsy previously said the edict was necessary to defend the revolution , and his administration has insisted the proposed constitution was drafted legally . If people vote it down , the president said Thursday night that he 'd form a new assembly to draft another constitution .

Yet opposition activists have n't shown any indication that they trust Morsy on that or other counts . They accuse him of consolidating power for himself and the Muslim Brotherhood , in part by having an Islamist-dominated group push through the draft constitution .

This internal strife has helped transform the area around the presidential palace in Cairo into a war zone . Streets littered with rubble and burned cars were defined by barbed-wire barricades , patrolling soldiers , parked tanks and armored personnel carriers .

Beyond the popular unrest , Morsy 's inner circle was shaken when Rafik Habib , the deputy head of the Freedom and Justice Party , resigned Thursday , party spokesman Ahmed Sobe said . Habib did not give a reason .

His resignation brings to five the number of presidential advisers who have left in the past two days . It is the first , however , from the Freedom and Justice Party .

Egyptian judges and media organizations also staged strikes to show their displeasure with the situation . And 11 organizations representing lawyers , journalists , writers , actors , musicians and tour guides said Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood were behind the violence , al-Ahram reported .

The group said it would call for Morsy 's ouster if the administration failed to protect protesters and `` fulfill the aspirations of the January 25 revolution , '' the newspaper said .

Vice President Mekki asked critics Wednesday to submit their proposals for improving the constitution , and Morsy invited political opponents to a meeting Saturday at the presidential palace .
