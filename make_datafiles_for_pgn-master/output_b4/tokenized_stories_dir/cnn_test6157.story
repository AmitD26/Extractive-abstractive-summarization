Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A post-mortem Sunday of the mid-term elections provided little evidence that Democrats and Republicans will work together to address major issues such as deficit reduction any better than they have in recent years .

Republicans interviewed on talk shows promised congressional investigations , an all-out effort to repeal health care reform , and steadfast opposition to any form of higher taxes .

Democrats , meanwhile , said the losses they suffered in the congressional elections reflected voter dissatisfaction with lingering high unemployment in the slow recovery from economic recession , rather than an outright repudiation of their policies .

Republicans won more than 60 seats formerly held by Democrats to take majority control of the House , and also narrowed the Democratic majority in the Senate , while winning the lion 's share of governors ' races around the country .

When asked what they would do with their greater power , GOP legislators offered a hard-line agenda that left little room for middle-ground compromise .

Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , considered a likely presidential contender in 2012 , told CNN 's `` State of the Union '' that he advocated repealing the health care bill and ensuring that government operates on the revenues available .

Voters want to see results on creating jobs , and if Republicans do n't produce , `` we 'll be thrown out in two years , '' Pawlenty said .

Republican Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia , who is expected to become the new House majority leader in January , questioned on `` Fox News Sunday '' whether there was any benefit to compromising with President Barack Obama .

The question was not whether Obama was willing to work with Republicans , as he stated last week , but , `` Are we willing to work with him ? '' Cantor asked .

`` I mean , first and foremost , we 're not going to be willing to work with him on the expansive liberal agenda he 's been about , '' Cantor said .

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , told the CBS program `` Face the Nation '' that agreement exists on some specific provisions , but he refused to signal any willingness to compromise .

`` We anticipate we 'll be able to do the people 's business in areas on which we agree , '' McConnell said .

In Mumbai , India , on Sunday , Obama told a student at a town hall-style meeting that the election results showed he needed to make adjustments after two years in office .

After explaining he must stick to core policies such as education and infrastructure investment and clean energy development , Obama said he also needs to `` make some mid-course corrections and adjustments . ''

`` How those play themselves out over the next several months will be a matter of me being in discussions with the Republican Party , '' the president said , adding : `` There are going to be areas where we disagree and hopefully there are going to be some areas where we agree . ''

However , beyond four items listed by McConnell -- nuclear energy and electric-car development , clean coal technology , and expanded free-trade agreements -- Republicans offered no other areas of agreement .

The first issue likely to come up when Congress reconvenes next week in a lame-duck session will be whether to extend Bush-era tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of the year .

Obama wants to extend the lower tax rates for income below $ 200,000 a year for individuals and $ 250,000 a year for families , saying that means 98 percent of Americans wo n't be subject to a de facto tax increase .

Republicans oppose higher tax rates for anyone , including the nation 's wealthiest 2 percent , arguing it would harm small business owners who traditionally bring about significant job creation .

In an interview to be broadcast Sunday night on the CBS program `` 60 Minutes , '' Obama expressed a willingness to compromise , perhaps by extending the lower tax rates for wealthy Americans for a two-year period as long as everyone else also maintains their current lower rates .

McConnell , however , made clear that Republicans believe no one should have their tax rates return to the higher levels of the 1990s .

`` We do n't have a revenue problem ; we have a spending problem , '' McConnell said , repeating a line parroted by Republicans on other shows . `` So the whole nomenclature surrounding this -- that somehow we 're doing people a favor by giving them their own money back -- I just do n't accept . The government is too big . It needs to be shrunk . ''

Other GOP positions spelled out Sunday included reducing non-military `` discretionary '' spending -- such as department and agency budgets , but not including entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security -- to 2008 levels , reducing federal wages and cutting the federal workforce .

A unanimous Republican policy is to try to get the health care reform bill repealed . While acknowledging Obama and the Democrats will almost certainly be able to stave off full repeal , Republican lawmakers including McConnell , Cantor and others advocated cutting funding and mounting legal challenges to hinder implementation of the measure until they can try to defeat Obama in 2012 .

Some of the Republican opponents of the bill also called for keeping popular provisions touted by Obama and Democrats , such as preventing insurance companies from dropping coverage when people get sick , or denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions .

`` We 're going to do everything we can to try and repeal and replace this thing , '' Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , expected to be the new chairman of the House Budget Committee , said on `` Fox News Sunday . ''

Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina told CBS that the Republicans were on the wrong side of history on the health care issue . Clyburn noted that similar calls for repeal followed landmark legislation in the past including the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that allowed African-Americans to vote .

`` The fact of the matter is what we did with health care is to make that a fundamental right of every citizen , '' Clyburn said .

Amid the legislative wrangling will be new investigations by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California , the expected new chairman of the panel in January , told the Fox program .

He cited White House attempts to influence candidates to drop out of primary elections , as occurred in the Pennsylvania Senate race , as one issue to be investigated . Issa 's committee also will support a Judiciary Committee probe of alleged voter intimidation by two members of the New Black Panther Party at a Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , voting station in 2008 , he said .

Issa later told reporters that he currently had no plans to issue subpoenas to members of the Obama administration .

`` There 's a history of corruption in American politics at the presidential level that goes back to Andrew Jackson , '' Issa said . `` I think what we have to do is look for the places where we can make changes , and make those changes , and try to get the administration to do what they need to do to comply . ''

Meanwhile , signs of friction within the Republican Party also appeared Sunday , with conservative lawmakers pushing plans not favored by some in the GOP congressional leadership .

Republican Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina , who supported Tea Party candidates across the country in toppling mainstream contenders in GOP primaries , called for a halt to all congressional earmarks as part of a conservative action plan against high spending .

McConnell , however , said the issue was more complex than just spending , involving whether the legislature has the authority to determine exactly how money gets spent . DeMint made clear that he and the new Tea Party conservatives rejected McConnell 's position .

`` I know there 's some senior members in Congress who think it 's their job to bring home the bacon , '' DeMint said on the NBC program `` Meet the Press . '' He called such thinking `` parochial politics '' against the national interest and said : `` We ca n't do that anymore . ''

One of those Tea Party-backed winners Tuesday , Senator-elect Rand Paul of Kentucky , offered a potential major concession on the ABC program `` This Week '' when he said military spending should be part of the cuts needed to balance the federal budget .

Republicans traditionally push for increased military spending and have generally made clear they favor cutting only non-military discretionary spending , and McConnell said Paul would have to persuade his new colleagues to support him .

`` Well , you know , he 's going to have an opportunity in the Senate to offer all of those ideas , '' McConnell said . `` We 'll get votes on them . ''
