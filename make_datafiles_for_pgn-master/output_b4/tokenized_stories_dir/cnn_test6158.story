-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Donny Moore watches at least part of every NFL game , every week , every year . After all , it 's part of his job .

You may not have heard of him . But while Moore is watching the best football players in the world , they 're watching him , too .

`` I get a lot of feedback from Twitter , '' said Moore , the so-called ratings czar for `` Madden NFL , '' the uber-popular video game franchise that rolled out its 25th annual edition on Tuesday . `` Guys like -LRB- Seahawks cornerback -RRB- Richard Sherman , -LRB- Cowboys wide receiver -RRB- Dez Bryant -- these guys all follow me and make sure to give me feedback .

`` They always want to know ahead of time : ` What have you got me at ? ' ''

That 's because it 's Moore 's job to come up with the numerical ratings -- from 1 to 100 -- that determine how skilled players , and by extension their teams , are at various facets of the game .

It 's a unique challenge . Although there are shooter games that emulate real-world weapons and military units , only sports games require their creators to assess , and then re-create , real-life humans as virtual avatars .

That 's bound to rankle some folks -- if not the NFL players themselves , then `` Madden '' gamers who are often their most rabid fans . By most accounts , though , Moore and his team at EA Sports , publisher of the `` Madden '' series , do a good job .

`` EA is not just pulling numbers from a hat , '' said T.J. Lauerman , host of That Sports Gamer Show . `` Gamers are uptight about their favorite team 's ratings because ... they see their team 's running back make one great spin move that completely fakes out a defender , and when they try it in a game , they fail . They look up the player attributes and realize he has a 64 Spin Move , then they get angry and tweet Donny Moore . ''

That 's all part of the job , says Moore .

`` If you 're a Falcons fan who was mad some Falcons were underrated , we 're probably doing our job , '' he said . `` Everybody ca n't be a 99 . ''

Moore has a lot of raw data to work with . In addition to on-field stats , there are 40-yard-dash times , scouting-combine scores for rookies , injury reports and the like . And a whole host of websites have sprung up to hyperanalyze performance , breaking down stats into super-specific categories , like `` downfield passing completion percentage . ''

But football is also a game of intangibles . Sometimes it takes watching a player accomplish things on the field that the raw data do n't show . Moore is thankful for Madden 's weekly online updates -LRB- a feature that earlier versions obviously did n't have -RRB- , which let him tweak player stats based on their performance throughout the season .

He cites Alfred Morris , the lightly regarded sixth-round pick out of Florida Atlantic University who ended up tallying 1,613 yards and 13 touchdowns last year for the Washington Redskins .

`` There was not a whole lot of buzz around him , really ; he ran a terribly slow time at the combo , '' Moore said . `` Then , he started blowing up . ''

Morris started the season on `` Madden '' with a 65 rating . By the end of the year , thanks to weekly updates , he 'd risen to an 89 .

`` We were wrong about him to begin with , but the whole league was , '' he said . '' -LRB- Redskins head coach -RRB- Mike Shanahan was probably surprised . Pleasantly surprised . ''

After actually watching on-field performance , Moore said , his best tool for adjusting player ratings may be those same fans who argue with him online . He adopted a stock response to fans who thought a player on their favorite team should have his numbers moved up .

He says '' ` OK , give me five up and five down , ' '' he said . `` When you made the fans give you the guys who should go down , that was some of the best feedback ever . ''

But it 's always more amusing when it 's the players themselves complaining , especially when it 's over something relatively ridiculous .

Every player gets a rating in every category , meaning kickers are rated for Trucking -- the ability to bull over defenders -- and 300-pound defensive linemen get Spectacular Catch scores .

But that did n't sit well when New York Jets defensive back Kerry Rhodes saw his Throwing Power rating of 21 and 23 for Throwing Accuracy -- a full 17 points behind Nick Mangold , a Jets offensive lineman . Rhodes played some quarterback in college and high school and posted a good-natured video titled `` WTF Madden ! ''

In it , he and Mangold go through a series of passing drills , in which he predictably beats his 307-pound teammate .

And it worked .

`` After that , I bumped up Kerry Rhodes ' power to way outdistance Mangold , '' Moore said . `` But it was still terrible . You 'd never play him at quarterback . ''

That 's a silly example , but illustrates a bigger point : There are a lot of eyeballs on the best-selling `` Madden '' game series .

Moore has worked at EA since 1999 , when he was hired for the `` Madden '' testing group after winning an `` NCAA '99 Football '' tournament . He says that , for him , making the game as close as possible to the real thing is serious business .

`` I treat it with a lot of pride , '' he said . `` I know what 's at stake here . I just want to get it right . ''
