-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He thought the bleeding was a hemorrhoid , brought on by a strenuous weightlifting session at the gym .

He thought the fatigue was due to his life on the road , performing coast-to-coast with the band Alabama 's lead singer , Randy Owen .

He thought at 42 , he was too young to get a colonoscopy .

Then the excruciating pain hit .

Wade Hayes , the country musician best known for his No. 1 hit `` Old Enough to Know Better , '' spent Thanksgiving in the hospital . His intestine had collapsed in on itself -- a condition called intussusception .

Intussusception blocks food and liquid from passing through the intestine and cuts off the blood supply to the rest of the digestive tract , according to the Mayo Clinic . Normally found in children , it 's rare in adults unless caused by an underlying condition .

For Hayes , that underlying condition was stage IV colon cancer . Doctors discovered a large tumor had caused the collapse . And that was n't the end of the bad news .

The cancer had metastasized , or spread . Surgeons removed approximately 70 % of Hayes ' liver and more than 20 inches of his large intestine .

`` You just do n't expect a man in his young 40s , who was perfectly healthy in every other way , to get this kind of diagnosis , '' says Hayes ' manager , Mike Robertson . `` There was a part of me that was going , ` Surely this ca n't be happening . ' ''

Colorectal cancer -- often referred to as colon cancer -- is the third leading cause of cancer death in both men and women , according to the American Cancer Society . It 's also the most preventable . Colorectal cancer usually develops slowly , over the course of 10 to 15 years , from noncancerous polyps .

Approximately 90 % of new cases occur in people over the age of 50 . The American Cancer Society recommends colonoscopies every 10 years for people beginning at that age , unless they have high risk factors such as a family history of colorectal cancer or another gastrointestinal disease . Colonoscopies can spot and remove polyps before they become malignant .

`` Oftentimes , -LSB- colorectal cancer -RSB- has no symptoms , '' says Dr. Paul Limburg , a gastrointestinal cancer prevention specialist at the Mayo Clinic who has not treated Hayes . `` The most important message is that people really should understand that screening should be done regularly . It could make a substantial difference in the number of lives saved . ''

Hayes had no family history of gastrointestinal disease , which is one of the reasons he ignored his symptoms for so long . In fact , when he walked into the hospital in November , he was in better shape than everyone in the waiting room , Robertson remembers .

Since then , Hayes has lost 50 pounds and is struggling to regain a sense of normalcy through multiple rounds of chemotherapy . He 's fighting an uphill battle -- a 2004 study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute estimated the five-year survival rate for stage IV colon cancer to be 8.1 % , and an institute study of cancer data put the survival rate at 6 % .

`` It hurts like hell , '' Hayes says of his recovery . `` I always thought of myself as a man 's man , but I just discovered what a wuss I am . ''

Thankfully , Hayes is anything but alone in Nashville . Willie Nelson called from Hawaii to wish him well . Kix Brooks helped him connect with the best doctors in the city . Jay DeMarcus from Rascal Flatts arranged for a private room at Vanderbilt hospital .

`` That part of it has been really shocking for me . I had no idea how many people cared about me or even knew I existed . ''

Robertson says that 's the kind of person Hayes is -- modest to a fault ; an introvert who enjoys reading detective dramas and has no desire to just sit around .

Hayes lives with his dog , Jack , a boxer he found as a stray , eating out of the garbage at a filling station 75 miles from Nashville . He loaded the starving , tick-covered dog into the back of his truck and took him home , where Jack proceeded to chew on everything in sight .

`` He 's very lovable but a pain the ass -- just like me , '' Hayes says with a laugh .

Hayes ' scans were clear of tumors in early March . But the musician still has four more months of chemotherapy to go .

Chemo has left his hands and mouth incredibly sensitive . Food tastes funny , and touching anything cold feels like `` being electrocuted . '' Some days , he has trouble gripping his guitar .

He performed at the Stars Go Blue benefit concert for Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month on March 6 but had trouble singing because of the chemo 's effects on his vocal cords .

He 's eager to get back to writing music , but the chemotherapy chemicals invading his body make it difficult to concentrate .

`` He 's seen something taken away that he 's very passionate to get back to , '' Robertson says of Hayes ' impatience . `` He 's always bounced back from everything . I think he thought he 'd have the surgery , and then . ... The recovery has taken longer than he expected . ''

Still , Hayes is doing his best to help the process along . Studies have shown that environmental and dietary factors can influence your risk of colorectal cancer , according to Limburg . A low-fat , high-fiber diet is good , as is regular exercise .

`` In general , things that are healthy overall , are healthy for your colon , '' Limburg says .

So Hayes is eating less red meat , more fruits and vegetables . He 's sold his house in the city and is hoping to buy a small farm in the country . Most importantly , he 's speaking out about getting screened early and often .

`` If I had caught it early , I would n't be where I am now . ''
