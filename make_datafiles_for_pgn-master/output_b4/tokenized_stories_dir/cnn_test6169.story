-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A San Francisco Giants fan who threw a banana that landed near Baltimore Orioles centerfielder Adam Jones during a weekend game said the incident was not racially motivated , but an act of frustration at his team 's poor performance .

Alexander Poulides told the San Jose Mercury News that he 's embarrassed and shocked , but most of all apologetic for his `` indiscretion . ''

Poulides said he was unaware of the uproar until Monday morning when he turned on the news . His heart sank when heard the outcry over an unidentified Giants fan who threw a banana at Jones , who is African-American .

`` Oh , my God , '' Poulides said . `` I threw a banana on my way out . ''

That 's when he contacted the newspaper to claim responsibility .

`` I 'm embarrassed and shocked by the outcome , '' he said . `` In hindsight , I wish I did n't do it and I apologize . I 'm very sorry . ''

Poulides grabbed the banana from a catering cart , tossing it on the field , he said . The fruit became a projectile of disgust during the ninth inning of a blowout loss on Sunday to the Orioles at AT&T Park .

The team 's front office said it 's continuing to investigate .

`` The Giants have a zero tolerance policy against this type of behavior , which results in immediate ejection from the ballpark , '' a statement from the team said . `` While we have been investigating the matter since we learned of the situation , unfortunately we have been unable to identify the person responsible .

`` We would like to extend our sincerest apologies to Adam and the entire Orioles organization for this unfortunate incident .

`` The inappropriate actions of this individual in no way reflect the values of our organization and our fans . ''

Jones took to his official Twitter account to express his displeasure .

`` I want to thank whatever -LRB- expletive -RRB- threw that banana towards my direction in CF in the last inning , '' he posted . `` Way to show ur class u jackass . ''

MLB senior vice president of public relations Patrick Courtney told CNN Sports on Monday : `` We are looking into this situation . ''

The Orioles overcame a two-run deficit to score 10 unanswered runs in the 10-2 victory over last season 's World Series champs .

Jones hit a three-run homer at the top of the ninth inning to help clinch the victory .
