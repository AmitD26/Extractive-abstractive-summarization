-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A British stuntman who parachuted dressed as James Bond during the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony has died , UK media reported .

Mark Sutton , whose performance was one of the highlights of the opening ceremony , was in Switzerland at the time of his death .

Police in Switzerland 's Valais Canton did not name him , saying formal identification is under way after the incident Wednesday morning in the Trient area .

The 42-year-old died after hitting a cliff while jumping in a `` wingsuit '' from a helicopter , a police statement said .

He and another man jumped from a height of about 3,300 meters in the Grandes-Otannes area in the Alps , near the border with France , the statement said .

`` They then flew remaining close to the mountain , with the intention of landing near Le Peuty , near Trient , in Switzerland , '' it said .

`` During this flight , one of the men suffered a fatal fall . According to a preliminary investigation , it appears that he fell after hitting a cliff . ''

The Briton was in Chamonix with 20 other professionals `` considered among the best in the world in this discipline , '' police said .

They had been gathered there by a company that specializes in extreme sports , with daredevil feats filmed and broadcast via the Internet .

The UK Foreign Office confirmed the death of a British citizen in Switzerland , and a spokesman said the office stood `` ready to provide consular assistance . ''

Sutton jumped from a helicopter above the Olympic stadium alongside a fellow stuntman dressed as Queen Elizabeth II in an opening ceremony show seen by millions .

Gary Connery , who played the queen , made an apparent reference to news of Sutton 's death on Twitter .

`` All you jumpers/flyers out there , stay safe , make wise choices and know your limits and your locations . Live to tell your stories . One love , '' he posted late Wednesday .

Wingsuit jumping is an extreme sport carried out by experienced skydivers who use a special suit -- which looks like a superhero 's cape -- to increase the surface area of the body . The large suit allows them to extend their time in free fall before deploying a parachute to land .

John Hitchen , national coach and safety officer for the British Parachute Association , said the organization was saddened to hear about the death of Sutton , who was a member .

He said jumpers need to be experienced to use wingsuits , which allow the user to slow their descent , to glide to a degree and move horizontally to the ground .

Although the details are unconfirmed as yet , Sutton may have been `` terrain flying , '' which involves flying very close to mountains or cliffs , Hitchen said .

`` You get a buzz from it but it 's potentially quite hazardous , '' he said .
