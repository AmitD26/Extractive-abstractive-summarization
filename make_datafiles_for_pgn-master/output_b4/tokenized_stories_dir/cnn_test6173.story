-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In Masrakh , an impoverished village in India 's northeastern Bihar state -- scenes of trauma , confusion , intense grief .

Here , at the site of the school meal poisoning incident that has claimed 23 young lives and imperiled 25 others , thousands of people mill around , stunned , hungry for information . They listen to the procession of politicians that streams into the village to pay respects and make promises . But they can not offer what these people want most : answers as to how the government-mandated free meals , meant to nourish the community 's children , could instead have cost them their lives .

India 's school program : Ambitious , but far from perfect

Four burnt out police vehicles fringe the side of the road , a sign of the simmering anger felt towards authorities over the tragedy . Investigators had previously flagged issues with food safety at schools in the state , with one report in April from India 's Ministry of Human Resource Development noting that school food `` was kept in open and dirty ground . ''

A fresh grave has been dug in front of the ramshackle , solitary classroom where 120 of the village 's children were enrolled -- an unambiguous sign of protest over the incident . There are many others buried nearby . Above all this , the wails of grieving families pierce the air .

Sarita Devi is inconsolable as she mourns the loss of her five-year-old daughter , Dipu . The wife of a migrant worker , Devi says her daughter had not wanted to go to school that day , and laments the fact she had even given her a paisa -- a sub-unit of India 's rupee -- to attend . `` Why is n't anyone bringing Dipu back ? '' she cries .

Mom anguishes over child poisoned by lunch : Why are n't you coming back ?

Like many here , she has words of anger for the school 's principal , who authorities say has absconded together with her husband , and whom they are seeking to interview . Devi 's grief eventually overpowers her , and her body goes limp .

This is a poor village , in one of India 's poorest states . Locals live in simple dwellings made of clay . The school is the heart of the community , meaning that scarcely a family here has not been affected . Even the school 's cook , Manju Devi , lost children to the tragedy ; her husband , Lal Babu Rai , told a reporter from CNN-IBN , CNN 's sister network , that two had died after eating the tainted food , while another remains in hospital .

The settlement 's solitary water pump is where locals say they were first alerted to the commotion following Tuesday 's regular midday school meal . School children had congregated there to wash their plates after the regular daily meal of rice and potatoes . On this occasion , however , they began vomiting and collapsing .

The children were rushed to the local medical facility , but they could do nothing for them . They were transferred on to a larger hospital at Patna , Bihar 's capital , some four hours ' drive away .

In Patna , despite the distance , the incident is being keenly felt . The city has been rocked by violent protests over the deaths , and at Patna state government school on Friday , many children said they had been instructed by their parents not to eat any school meals , due to fears of further contamination .

They need not worry . Many NGOs who deliver the meals to the schools have stopped providing them to some schools , out of fears of a backlash . While answers on the tragedy remain scant , one thing remains clear : it will be some time before any sense of normalcy returns to Bihar .
