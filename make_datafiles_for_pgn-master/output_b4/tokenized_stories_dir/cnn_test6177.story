Boston -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Portraying a star government witness as a mass murderer , a serial killer and a liar without remorse , defense lawyers for James `` Whitey '' Bulger tried Wednesday to undermine the testimony of that witness , former mob hitman John Martorano .

`` You lied to your friend John Callahan did n't you ? '' asked defense lawyer Hank Brennan , referring to a man Martorano shot dead .

`` That was a necessity , '' said the confessed killer . `` I told John I wanted to see him . I could n't tell him I wanted to shoot him . ''

Martorano wrapped three days of detailing murders he allegedly committed with Boston 's most feared former mob boss , Bulger , by confirming to prosecutors that together he and Bulger were involved in 11 murders . Bulger had admitted to others he 'd committed on his own , Martorano said .

Bulger is charged with 19 murders as well as racketeering and extortion . He was arrested in 2011 after living in hiding for 16 years and landing on the FBI 's most wanted list .

Martorano : ` Broke my heart ' to learn Bulger was informant

At times , Martorano seemed to parse his testimony during cross-examination . Asked about one murder , he said of the victim , `` I stabbed him . I did n't kill him . '' After a pause , he added , `` Not until later . ''

Martorano also testified that even though Bulger was older by a decade , `` He was n't my boss . '' Still , the former hitman acknowledged there were times he would do whatever was needed , no questions asked , because Bulger `` knew the right buttons to press . ''

Earlier Martorano alluded to Bulger as `` Judas , '' which he described as `` a person like an informant , a rat , a no-good guy . I was brought up that that was the worst thing in the world . ''

Although Bulger 's lawyers tried to highlight inconsistencies in Martorano 's testimony , he did n't waiver , declaring he had n't lied to prosecutors since cutting a deal that guaranteed his testimony in exchange for a 14-year sentence .

He said he knew if he lied , `` They 'd break the deal , '' and send him back to prison . Martorano was released from prison in 2007 after serving 12 years .

Defense attorney Brennan compared Martorano to another hitman , Joseph Barboza , who may have killed as many as 26 people beginning in the 1960s . Brennan told jurors Barboza was also a government informant and that he lied under oath .

`` The government protected him , '' said Brennan , referring to Barboza

Not missing a beat , Martorano quipped back , `` Not too good , '' referring to Barboza 's ultimate death once he was outed as a `` rat . ''

Martorano admitted in court Wednesday that he gave false statements during the time his deal with prosecutors was being drawn up , adding that only after deciding to cooperate with the government did he begin telling the `` whole truth '' about the criminal enterprise and his associates .

`` After I made an agreement with the government I never lied , '' Martorano said .
