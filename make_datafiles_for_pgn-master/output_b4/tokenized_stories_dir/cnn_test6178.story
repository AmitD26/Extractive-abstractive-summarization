ESTEROS DEL IBERA , Argentina -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Doug Tompkins wants to drop in on his neighbor , the best way to do so -- in fact , the only way to do so -- is to fire up his Cessna 206 and fly across the vast subtropical wetlands that he owns in this remote corner of northeastern Argentina .

Doug Tompkins and his wife Kris have dedicated their lives to land conservation in Argentina and Chile .

I 'm along for the ride with Tompkins , and I must admit , I 'm nervous . Not only is this six-seater the smallest airplane I 've ever been in , but it 's also windy outside -- and storm clouds are gathering . Not to worry , my pilot assures me .

`` I 've been a pilot longer than you 've been alive , '' says Tompkins , 66 . And it 's true .

During the flight we pass a thousand feet over the wetlands , and I watch the landscape change rapidly below : Long , thin lagoons slice through thick fields of brown marsh . Tiny floating islands sit engulfed by lush green prairies . With his keen eye , Tompkins spots a lone marsh deer , knee-deep in water , munching on grass . More than 350 bird species live in the wetlands , which is roughly the size of Belgium .

`` It 's a hotspot for biodiversity . It 's full of creatures . Aquatic creatures . Creatures flying in the air , and on the ground . So its conservation is important : To Argentina and to the world , '' he says .

I traveled to the Esteros del Ibera -- which means ` shining water ' in the Guarani language -- to profile Tompkins and his wife , Kris , for CNN International 's `` Going Green '' series . We are highlighting `` Green Pioneers '' from around the world , and Doug and Kris Tompkins certainly fit the bill .

For the past twenty years they have dedicated their lives to land conservation in Argentina and Chile . Their method is simple : Buy up huge swaths of land , restore their eco-systems , slow development , and then donate the land to governments as national parks . Wildlife philanthropy has existed in the United States for more than a century , but here in South America , this type of charity is not common -- and is even viewed with suspicion by some .

`` South America does n't have a long tradition of conservation philanthropy . There have n't been a lot of people from the private sector that have said ` Look , we 're willing to buy land and turn it back over to the government and make parklands ' -- but slowly it catches up , '' he says .

Tompkins made a fortune as the founder of The North Face and Esprit clothing companies . In 1990 , he cashed in his shares in Esprit , making millions in the process . Kris soon followed suit , ending her 18-year stint as CEO of the Patagonia outdoor clothing company .

`` The fashion business is not the business to be in if you 're trying to contribute to diminishing the impact on nature , '' Doug says .

Through their Conservation Land Trust and Conservacion Patagonica organizations , the Tompkins have purchased approximately 900,000 hectares in Argentina and Chile , spending $ 275 million dollars of their own money in the process . They have already helped establish two national parks in the wind-swept Patagonia region : Argentina 's Monte Leon National Park and Chile 's Corcovado National Park . They are hard at work on several other ambitious projects , including the Esteros del Ibera , which the Tompkins hope to one day turn into Argentina 's largest national park .

`` Buying land , conserving it and shepherding it towards national park status , yes , it is probably legitimate to call us pioneers , '' says Kris , 59 .

Still , the Tompkins ' conservation work is not applauded by all . There has been fierce opposition to their efforts in both Argentina and Chile by those weary of the growing presence of foreign landowners in South America . In addition to the Tompkins , clothing magnet Luciano Benetton , actor Sylvester Stallone and CNN founder Ted Turner also own huge areas of land in Argentina . As anti-American sentiment has grown here over the past decade , the Tompkins have been accused of many things .

`` There were really wild allegations that we were creating a Jewish state , though we do n't happen to be Jewish . That we were creating a nuclear waste dump for the U.S. . That we were creating a passage for Argentina to finally militarily overtake Chile . All these things are society 's ways of beginning to accommodate new ideas , '' says Kris .

Just getting to the Esteros del Ibera is a challenge . My journey started with a 10-hour , 700-km overnight bus ride from my home in Buenos Aires to the small town of Mercedes in Corrientes Province . From there , cameraman Eduardo Aragona and I drove two hours on a bumpy , red-dirt road to arrive at the Estancia Rincon del Socorro , the traditional Argentine ranch that the Tompkins operate , and where guests from around the globe come to get up-close looks at rare species of capybara , caiman , deer and scores of birds .

`` We are trying to restore the place and bring back the species that were already extinct , like the anteater . And we are working with the Pampas deer , which is a very endangered species . And perhaps in some years we will bring back the jaguar , that is our big dream , '' says Sofia Heinonen , a wildlife biologist who heads the Conservation Land Trust 's initiatives here .

While the Tompkins are heroes in most environmental circles , some activists and political leaders have labeled Doug as arrogant , eccentric and out-of-touch with the pressing needs of humans . He told me that he does what he does because he feels the need to `` pay rent '' for living on planet earth .

`` The reality is that nature does n't care about human economies , or social justice or whatever problems exists within the realms of human beings . It 's just responding to impacts -- and we have to deal with those impacts one way or another , '' he says .

Tompkins ' way is to use his deep pockets to drive his even deeper commitment to conservation -- one hectare and one animal at a time .
