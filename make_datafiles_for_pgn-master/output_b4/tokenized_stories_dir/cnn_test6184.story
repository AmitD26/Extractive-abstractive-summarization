China 's Bo Xilai : From rising star to scandal

During the politically sensitive trial , which took place over several days in August , Bo , 64 , denied the charges and strongly challenged the prosecution 's case against him , according to accounts published by the Jinan Intermediate People 's Court .

Bo 's glittering career , during which he drew both admirers and detractors for his populist policies , fell apart last year .

The son of a revolutionary veteran , Bo rose to power as a city mayor , provincial governor , minister of commerce and member of the Politburo , the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party .

He had been tipped to ascend farther up the party hierarchy .

A charismatic and urbane politician , Bo was credited with a spectacular , albeit brutal , crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing , a metropolis in southwestern China .

But when his deputy , Wang Lijun , walked into the U.S. Consulate in the city of Chengdu in February 2012 and told American diplomats that Bo 's wife , Gu Kailai , was involved in a murder case , Bo 's career began to unravel .
