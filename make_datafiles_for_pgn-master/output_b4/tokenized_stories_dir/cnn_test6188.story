-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- After nearly a week of high-heeled dancing , Vaseline-covered teeth , and skillfully concealed hostility , the glitter has finally settled over Atlantic City -- and 24-year-old Nina Davuluri of Syracuse , New York has been named the latest in a long line of all-American beauty queens . Davuluri is n't just the second consecutive pageant winner from the Empire State -- she 's also the first woman of Indian descent to snag the crown .

Obviously , congratulations are in order -- but Nina 's not the only one who deserves a little recognition . Check out my list of alternate-category winners , and feel free to add your own ... as long as you deliver them with a blindingly white smile .

Most Auspicious Name : Miss Alabama , a.k.a. Chandler Champion . Then again , maybe not ; she did n't even make it to the semi-finals .

Weirdest Intro Joke : `` Listening to your phone calls from the nation 's capital . Just kidding ! I 'm Miss District of Columbia , Bindhu Pamarthi . ''

Runner Up : `` From the home of fast horses and beautiful women -- better not get those two things confused . I am Jenna Day , Miss Kentucky ! ''

Best Sports : Misses Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , Nebraska , and Nevada . Other girls got to dance on Atlantic City 's boardwalk or the deck of a swanky boat ; this group had to pretend they were super pumped to deliver their intros inside the White House sub shop . -LRB- And not even the location that serves salads ! -RRB-

Most Shameless Plug : `` From the home of Nashville , the country music capital of the world and the hit ABC show , I 'm Shelby Thompson , Miss Tennessee . ''

Clumsiest Attempt at Cultural Literacy : `` I 'm not breaking bad , I 'm breaking through . Say my name ! Alexis Duprey , Miss New Mexico . ''

EW : Bikinis , tattoos , lobster high heels , and more style secrets from the Miss America pageant

Greatest Achievement in Passive Aggression : `` Our Utah Jazz sure are n't bringing home the championship . Guess It 's up to me ! Ciera Pekarcik , Miss Utah . ''

Most Anonymous Experts : The team of pros who judged the pageant 's preliminary rounds . Sorry , guys -- if the hosts had actually said your names on camera , Mario Cantone would have had barely any time to mug .

Loosest Definition of the Term `` Celebrity Judging Panel '' : Here 's our roll call : Lance Bass , who shot for the moon but landed in Atlantic City ; the aforementioned Mr. Cantone ; Dr. Deidre Downs Gunn , a.k.a. Miss America 2005 -LRB- so it really is a scholarship program ! -RRB- ; Barbara Corcoran of Shark Tank ; The Chew co-host and all-around great lady Carla Hall ; subway busker Joshua Bell ; and New York Knick Amar ' e Stoudemire . What , Heidi Montag was busy ?

Most Awkward Utterance : Pat Pruitt of Ernst & Young , proving why he usually does n't talk onstage : `` It 's very good , and we 're very proud of our relationship with MissAmorgOoverization . ''

Strangest Tradition : The Shoe Parade . Seriously , what 's the deal with the shoe parade ?

Best Personality : Miss Missouri Shelby Ringdahl , who said this after preparing for the swimsuit competition in about two minutes : `` I had time for hairspray and butt glue . That was it . '' Butt glue ! I 'd have given her the crown based on butt glue alone .

Runner Up : Miss Kansas Theresa Vail , a tattooed army sergeant who sings opera but prefers to play Katniss . `` My original talent was going to be archery , '' she explained . `` I 'm singing by default because there is a clause against projectile objects . '' There is no clause against stealing our hearts , though .

Best Accessory : Miss Florida Myrrhanda Jones 's bedazzled knee brace , a functional yet versatile piece that complements bikinis , eveningwear , and ghastly baton-twirling getups equally . -LRB- Maybe it was actually a good luck charm -- Florida absolutely killed it in Talent . -RRB-

EW : Miss America pageant returns to Atlantic City

Biggest Head-Scratcher : This fun fact , which flashed onscreen as Miss Georgia Carly Mathis sang `` On My Own '' : `` Her dog has met the President . '' Think they shook hands ?

Worst Judgment : ABC and the Miss America Organization determined that it was totally fair to ask the first finalist about Miley Cyrus , the second about scorned political wives ... and the third whether she thinks the U.S. should intervene in Syria . One of those things : not like the others ! Kudos to Miss California Crystal Lee for keeping her cool -- and actually delivering a coherent answer to that absurdly tough question .

Most Diplomatic : Miss Oklahoma Kelsey Griswold , who , for the record , believes that Miley 's antics have been `` a little bit not super tasteful '' -- but `` ha -LSB- s -RSB- to respect her creativity . ''

Most Skillful Non-Answer : As delivered by eventual winner Nina Davuluri , Miss New York . She was asked what message Julie Chen is sending by admitting that she 's had plastic surgery on her eyes . Full transcript : `` Unfortunately , I do n't agree with plastic surgery . However , I can understand that from a standpoint . But more importantly , I 've always viewed Miss America as the girl next door , and the girl next door is evolving as the diversity in America evolves . She 's not who she was 10 years ago , and she 's not going to be the same person come 10 years down the road . So I would n't want to change someone 's looks or appearance , but definitely be confident in who you are . ''

Clearest Foreshadowing : Miss New York and Miss California stood in front of a curtain decorated with the Miss America logo as they clutched hands , waiting to hear the panel 's final verdict . The logo includes a crown -- which appeared to be floating over NY 's head . Lesson learned for next year 's finalists : Try to stand stage left .

Best Consolation : Courtesy of Jason Derulo 's `` The Other Side , '' which played as Davuluri received her actual crown : `` Tonight we 'll just get drunk . '' Sound advice for a celebratory Davuluri -- as well as the pageant 's 52 losers .
