-LRB- CNN -RRB- It 's true that Bali 's beaches , rice paddies , volcanoes and temples lure the crowds .

Those seeking serenity , however , should n't be put off -- the island offers a smattering of under-the-radar destinations where life ambles along at a more sedate pace .

Here are a few places where travelers can escape the hustle but still find plenty to fill an itinerary .

Balian

West Bali 's Balian beach has long been popular with intrepid surfers , with the beach offering multiple breaks .

While they 're mostly suited to experienced surfers , beginners can probably have some fun in the wash .

The black-sand beach has a rugged , somewhat desolate feel thanks to the thundering surf .

While it 's not really swimmer-friendly , it 's great for long contemplative walks and rummaging for flotsam and jetsam .

There are yoga retreats at the low-key resorts along the beach , and rental motorbikes for exploring the side road around Balian , where rice paddies tumble down to meet the sea .

At nearby Soka , a temple plays host to a massive cave full of bats that emerge at sunset .

Accommodation at Balian is mostly targeted toward surfers but some family-friendly as well as upper-end places are available .

Expect a mix of surfer fare and local food at the guesthouses .

Sidemen

Sidemen is a small village located in a yawning valley about an hour 's drive inland from the mid-east coast .

Here you 'll enjoy paddy views from your guesthouse or along a rejuvenating ramble through terraces with occasional red hibiscus or pink frangipani trees that make for pretty photo opportunities .

Sidemen is a great spot to rent a pushbike or join a small group tour to coast downhill via a route with fantastic views .

Overnight visitors can wake up early to climb the summit of Gunung Agung , the island 's tallest and most revered volcano , in time for sunrise -- this is a challenging hike .

Accommodation at Sidemen is generally a great value and ranges from basic through to mid-range , with a few places offering pools .

Amed

Truth be told , Amed has long been on the map for tourists seeking to elude Bali 's crazy south , but the series of looping bays along the coast of east Bali retains a charming washed-out feel -- like a spot that enjoyed a long-passed heyday and now has a rather slightly sleepy European feel .

The appeal here is solid off-the-beach snorkeling and diving in several of the bays , including the Japanese wreck at Banyuning .

You can base yourself at Amed to snorkel the liberty wreck at Tulamben , too .

Otherwise , it 's a great place to just relax and watch the jukungs -LRB- traditional outrigger canoes -RRB- fan out with their colorful triangular sails onto the waters before dawn , returning in the early morning .

Or , hire a boatman to take you out to see the sunrise over Lombok 's highest peak , Gunung Rinjani .

Munduk

Bali is n't all beaches , cocktails and tropical weather .

After driving through the winding scenic roads in north Bali , through forest-clad mountains , you 'll reach the little out-of-the-way village of Munduk , where the air is so crisp you can forget about air-conditioning .

Offering mostly guesthouses and home stays , this is n't a place for luxury , but anywhere you pick should have fantastic views of forest , farmland and paddies studded with coconut palms to remind you that , yes , you 're still on a tropical island .

Maps available at hotels highlight an array of low-key walks , including several impressive waterfalls that are easy to reach on foot .

Munduk is mostly appealing for what is n't here : no crowds , no tourist shops and no hassles .

Nusa Penida

Bali does n't just include the main island itself .

A cluster of three islands lie about 20 kilometers to the east , easily reachable by public boat or speedboat : Nusa Lembongan , which is popular with expatriates , tiny Nusa Ceningan and the largest of them all , stunning Nusa Penida .

The island is geographically similar to Bali 's Bukit Peninsula and , thanks to its relative remoteness , was a prison during the early 18th century .

While the diving here is excellent -- manta rays and mola molas when conditions are right -- you 'll also be rewarded by renting a motorbike to go exploring on the relatively barren island , where you can skirt spectacular cliffs soaring hundreds of meters high .

Best to get here soon : a luxury Chedi hotel is slated to open at Crystal Bay in 2015 .

West Bali National Park

Northwest Bali is home to a national park with excellent snorkeling and diving at Menjangan Island , and is the last refuge of the endangered Bali starling .

In fact , Menjangan is arguably Bali 's best snorkeling and diving location : you can float over coral gardens of brilliant blues , greens and pinks and spot a vast array of marine life on an organized trip or rent a boat from the pier yourself -- you may see dolphins along the way , with Java 's volcanoes in the distance providing an impressive backdrop .

Travelers can base themselves at Pemuteran , located outside the park , though those on a larger budget can try the Menjangan Resort within the park .

Hotels can arrange hikes , where chances are good you 'll see Java Rusa and Indian muntjac -LRB- barking -RRB- deer .
