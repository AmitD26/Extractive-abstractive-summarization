-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former World No. 5 Anna Chakvetadze is making her latest comeback after a 2011 marred by illness and capped with an unsuccessful bid to win election to Russia 's Duma .

Chakvetadze 's problems began when she dramatically collapsed on court while leading World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in a second round match in Dubai .

`` When I got sick in Dubai I was in very good shape , '' Chakvetadze told the official WTA website .

`` I was finally enjoying the way I was playing . I was feeling the ball great . I had found my game again and was really ready to compete . But then I got sick . ''

She was to play only three main draw matches in the remainder of the year , slipping to 234 in the rankings , before the illness was diagnosed as an inflammation of the inner year which caused dizziness and effected her balance .

`` I 'm 100 per cent healthy now . It does n't bother me anymore . I 'm completely over it . ''

Former World No. 1 Safin elected to Russian federal parliament

While away from tennis , the 24-year-old dabbled in politics , standing for the Right Cause Party in December 's elections .

But with her party polling less than one per cent in the election , for now Chakvetadze 's political ambitions are on hold .

`` I met some new people and really enjoyed myself . It was great to try myself in a different world .

`` While I will do something if my party asks me to , right now my priority is sport . I spend my days on the tennis court . Tennis comes first for me , '' she said .

Chakvetadze will head to Hobart in Tasmania for the first tournament of 2012 ahead of a tilt at the Australian Open later in January .

She reached her career-high ranking in 2007 when she won four tournaments and made the semifinals of the U.S. Open .

But in December of that year she suffered a horrifying ordeal when her home was burgled and the intervening years have been marked by a series of injuries and loss of form .

In other tennis news Tuesday , Alex Corretja , former coach of British star Andy Murray , has been named captain of Spain 's Davis Cup team .

Corretja replaces Albert Costa , who quit earlier this month after leading Spain to triumph in the 2011 final against Argentina .

The 37-year-old Corretja will have to take charge of their title defense without Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer , who have decided not to take part in the 2012 Davis Cup .
