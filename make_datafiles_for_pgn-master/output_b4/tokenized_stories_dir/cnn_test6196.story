-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` The Killing '' was AMC 's real zombie show .

Netflix has struck a deal with Fox Television Studios to resurrect the rainy crime drama for a fourth season .

That 's right : `` The Killing , '' a show that 's been canceled twice , is coming back to life for a second time .

AMC axed `` The Killing '' after its second season last year , only to pick it up again after talks between the studio and Netflix sparked interest in another round . The third season aired this summer on AMC to fairly modest ratings -LRB- ending with 1.5 million viewers -RRB- . In September , AMC cancelled the increasingly ironically titled `` The Killing '' â € '' again .

But apparently those cable executives did n't execute a proper double-tap to the head .

Because Netflix is bringing `` The Killing '' back with a six-episode fourth and final season . Stars Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman are on board , and so is showrunner Veena Sud .

`` The rich , serialized storytelling in ` The Killing ' thrives on Netflix , and we believe that it is only fitting to give Sarah Linden -LRB- Enos -RRB- and Stephen Holder -LRB- Kinnaman -RRB- a proper send off , '' said Cindy Holland , vice president of original content for Netflix . `` We are looking forward to offering fans â € '' both existing and new â € '' a series that we know is perfectly suited for on-demand viewing . ''

Netflix previously revived Fox 's cult favorite `` Arrested Development '' for a 4th season , and is often a company that studios call when their shows are axed to see if there 's any interest . The move could be a smart play for Netflix since it gives the company an exclusive lock on the conclusion of the show without a big episode commitment -LRB- AMC is not part of the deal -RRB- . Whenever viewers stream `` The Killing '' for years to come , if they want to see how the series concludes , they 'll have to watch it on Netflix -LRB- or a company that makes a distribution deal with Netflix -RRB- .

Unless ... of course ... this is not REALLY the end of `` The Killing . '' A Netflix rep assures this order will conclude of the show , but unless the final shot of season 4 is Linden and Holder skewered on top of the Space Needle , there 's always going to be a few fans wondering if The Killing could rise again , rainier and more murderous than ever .
