-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pending final approval from the Centers for Disease Control , Princeton University is preparing to provide a vaccine targeting a strain of meningitis in the wake of a campus outbreak , the school said Monday .

The CDC was preparing to recommend that all Princeton undergraduates and graduate students living in dormitories receive the vaccine , the Ivy League school said in a statement .

Other members of the university community should be vaccinated if they have conditions where the spleen is compromised or immune system disorders , the statement said .

The recommendations are still pending the review of the CDC 's Independent Review Board , the CDC said Monday .

`` Pending final CDC approval , the university is prepared to accept these recommendations and make arrangements to provide access to this vaccine as soon as possible , '' the Princeton statement said .

Princeton has seen seven cases of meningitis , a potentially fatal illness , since March . Only one vaccine exists to target meningococcal bacteria known as type B , the strain that appears responsible for the outbreak .

This vaccine is called Bexsero and is made by Novartis . It has not been licensed for use in the United States , but it was approved this year in Europe and Australia . The Princeton situation is the first outbreak of this strain since the vaccine was licensed in those countries .

The necessary doses would need one to two months to get to Princeton , according to Novartis spokeswoman Julie Masow . Bexsero is manufactured in Italy , Masow said .

The university would cover the cost of the vaccine for all students who receive it .

Two doses are required to protect individuals against this rare disease . Princeton hopes to make the first two doses of the vaccine available in early December , and the second in February .

The meningococcal vaccines already available in the United States to college students would not protect them against this serogroup B bacteria .

The university , the New Jersey Department of Health and the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are discussing options to control the outbreak , CDC spokeswoman Sharon Hoskins said Monday .

Before the news of the possible CDC recommendation on Monday afternoon , Princeton 's board of trustees had met over the weekend to consider whether to offer students the vaccine on a voluntary basis .

Princeton sophomore Joshua Zuckerman , a politics major , said in an e-mail he has n't seen a lot of serious worry or obsessive hygiene among his classmates , but he has observed `` an abundance of caution when it comes to sharing drinks and food . ''

Since media coverage began , the meningitis outbreak has been a hot topic of conversation , said Lauren Morera , a junior majoring in operations research and financial engineering .

Morera and Zuckerman both said they would take the vaccine if it becomes available .

`` If the vaccine is offered , I see no reason not to take it , '' Zuckerman said . `` If the Europeans and Australians have claimed it is safe , I have no doubt it is so . ''

Steps to get the vaccine

More decisions must be made before vaccinations can begin , said Barbara Reynolds , a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

Last week , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told the CDC it would allow for the importation of the vaccine for this limited use , the center said .

`` We have been allowed to have the option to import the vaccine , but the decision to vaccinate has not been made , '' Reynolds said . `` We 're in discussions . ''

The final decision , which would come in concert with medical staff and university administrators , could be made sometime this week , Reynolds said .

If the university gives a nod to the vaccine , another set of decisions will need to be made about how and when vaccinations will take place , Reynolds said . Informed consent forms would also need to be approved before the vaccine could be offered to students , she said .

The CDC is asking the FDA how quickly the vaccine can be imported into the United States and whether it will require label changes , Reynolds said .

What is meningitis group B ?

There are two forms of meningitis : bacterial and viral . The bacterial form is rare in the United States , and the group B bacterial strains are even more rare .

Symptoms can include stiff neck , headache , fever , vomiting , rashes , sensitivity to light and confusion . Untreated , the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment , brain damage , limb amputations and death .

Antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis `` should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15 % , although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly , '' according to the CDC .

Meningitis is an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord , known as the meninges .

In 2012 , there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States , according to the CDC . Of those , 160 were group B.

`` Usually , when you see this kind of meningitis on the campus , it 's meningitis C , '' said Dr. William Schaffner , professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University , in a telephone interview with CNN . `` This is very , very unusual . ''

Schaffner added that , in the United States , group B meningitis typically strikes infants and only rarely adolescents and young adults .

Though the mechanism needed for health officials to administer an unapproved vaccine in the United States is `` very elaborate , '' it would be justified in this case , Schaffner said .

`` If I were around the table with the board of trustees , I would be gently encouraging them to do this . ''

No common link among cases

The first reported case at Princeton developed in a student who had returned to the campus after spring recess in March , according to the state health department .

Two months later , after several other students and one visitor had contracted the disease , an outbreak was declared . All have recovered except for the most recent case , a student who began experiencing symptoms November 8 and was taken to a hospital two days later , officials said .

No common link has been identified among the cases , New Jersey health officials said . But five cases have the same strain , according to the department , and a sixth case is similar . Test results on the seventh and most recent case were not yet available .

The disease is not wholly understood .

Cases of meningococcal disease , including Group B , have dropped in recent years to the lowest levels since the 1930s . `` Nobody knows why , '' Schaffner said . And cases sometimes occur more frequently in Oregon . `` We 've never understood that , either . ''

The New Jersey outbreak is also puzzling . `` Why this is occurring is not clear , but the trick everybody is working on is how to stop it , how to prevent further cases , '' he said .

If the Princeton board approves , as many as 8,000 undergraduate and graduate students at the school could be offered the vaccine .

Meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing , coughing , sharing drinks and living in close quarters , such as in dormitories , according to the health department .

The bacteria can reside for months in the back of the throat before causing symptoms , Schaffner said .

Princeton 's latest health advisory on the situation tells the university community that `` increasing hygienic practices , and not sharing drinking glasses , eating utensils , smoking materials and other items '' can help prevent the spread of the disease .

In the meantime , classes are continuing , and so are football games . Per a tradition dating back to the late 1800s , Princeton will celebrate this season 's football victories over Harvard and Yale with a bonfire .
