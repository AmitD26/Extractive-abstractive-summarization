-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It seems everyone knows a college degree is important but few have a plan to keep it affordable .

Just this past academic year , tuition went up twice as fast as inflation and the cost of textbooks rose faster than tuition . Meanwhile , The New York Times recently reported that `` wages have fallen to a record low as a share of America 's gross domestic product . `` Â

As a result , the average 2011 graduate left school with $ 26,600 in student loan debt , helping to push the country 's total student loan debt past $ 1 trillion .

Combine that with an unemployment rate for recent college graduates of 8.9 % , and you see the impetus behind the First World question du jour -- `` Is college really worth it ? '' That 's a question that is easily answered by the 23 % unemployment rate for folks without a bachelor 's .

Still , the threat of leaving school with crippling loan payments does bring up a more valid question : Should students continue to take out huge loans to pursue majors that do n't have a clear path to paying that loan back ? In other words , a job ?

In an ironic showing of big government , Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Texas Gov. Rick Perry , both conservatives , decided to introduce plans in which state institutions charge less for STEM degrees -LRB- science , technology , engineering and math -RRB- than liberal arts degrees .

`` We 're spending a lot of money on education , and when you look at the results , it 's not great , '' Scott told a crowd in Tallahassee in 2011 . `` Do you want to use your tax money to educate more people who ca n't get jobs in anthropology ? I do n't . ''

Â Â
That 's a pretty good zinger but it does n't pass the smell test .

First of all -- to borrow language from the GOP script -- I do n't think the government should be picking winners and losers . And state officials massaging tuition costs to lure students away from fields they do n't approve of does just that .

There is a difference between an education and training . Just because the vocational outcome between the two might be different does n't mean it 's government 's role to assign its value to society .

Not to mention the initial outcomes are not always black and white .

For example , recent college grads with a degree in architecture have a 13.9 % unemployment rate , while English literature majors had a 9.2 % rate , according to a study conducted by Georgetown 's Center on Education and the Workplace . The report also found that communication majors had a lower unemployment rate than mechanical engineers and computer science majors . Recent information technology majors had a nearly 12 % rate .

Instead of coercing students into certain fields by saddling liberal arts
with higher costs , Scott , Perry and others should concentrate on providing families with all the information they need to make informed decisions .

During his State of the Union Address , President Obama announced he was launching The College Scoreboard , a website that consolidates costs , student loan debt and other financial variables for each school to help families get `` the most bang for your educational buck . ''

The information is useful but far from complete , according to Pauline Abernathy , vice president of The Institute for College Access and Success .
`` They do n't tell you what percentage of the students at the school borrowed , '' Abernathy told me . `` So you can report a default rate at a particular school , but if you do n't put that rate in context , it can be misleading .

`` Also , the median debt number includes those that graduated and students that dropped out . So schools with high drop out rates and high borrowing rates come out looking far worse than what they actually may be . ''

Still , Abernathy credited the administration for giving parents a tool to help them make better decisions .

The next step should be incorporating research on which majors offer the best opportunities for jobs , so if someone 's daughter or son wants a degree that does n't train for a specific job , they can see what they are getting into in the long term .

Parents can joke about liberal art majors and kids coming back home after college , but it 's an infringement on civil liberties for government to strong arm students into technical degrees by artificially manipulating costs .

Any official who 's concerned about higher education in this country should address the skyrocketing costs , not demonize degrees they do n't appreciate .
That 's for parents like me to do .

I was standing in a long Starbucks line recently and decided to strike up a conversation with a college student who said something rather interesting .

`` What 's your major ? '' I asked .

`` TV , '' she said .

The student went on to tell me that part of her focus was studying the history of television programming . I kept smiling and nodding at the appropriate time all the while thinking `` I sure hope her parents are rich . ''

Normally I do n't believe anybody should be telling folks what to study . But even I must admit the thought of kids borrowing tens of thousands to get a degree in `` 30 Rock '' may require some intervention .
