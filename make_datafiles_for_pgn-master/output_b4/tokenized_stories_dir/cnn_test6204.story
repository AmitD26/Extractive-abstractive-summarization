-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Cleveland man was indicted Thursday in the killings of two women , cases that were resurrected after the discovery of three women held captive for years by Ariel Castro .

Elias Acevedo Sr. , 49 , was charged with 293 counts , including aggravated murder , rape and kidnapping , said Timothy McGinty , the Cuyahoga County prosecutor .

Acevedo is accused of strangling 30-year-old Pamela Pemberton on October , 24 , 1994 , and leaving her body in a vacant lot , according to the indictment and authorities .

Last week , the FBI 's Violent Crime Task Force linked Acevedo to the murder of Christina Adkins , who disappeared in 1995 at age 18 , McGinty said .

Remains believed to be those of Adkins were found this month in a utility vault near the intersection of interstates 71 , 90 and 490 , the prosecutor said . As a result of the finding , the grand jury indicted Acevedo on murder charges in that case , too .

Acevedo was indicted earlier this year in a 1993 rape , which occurred near where Pemberton 's body was found the next year , McGinty said .

Bret Jordan , Acevedo 's attorney in the 1993 case , declined to comment on the latest indictments .

Acevedo is expected to be arraigned on the new charges next week . Jordan said he will find out at the arraignment whether he has been assigned the new case .

Acevedo was arrested earlier this year in the same Cleveland neighborhood where authorities found Amanda Berry , Georgina `` Gina '' DeJesus and Michelle Knight in May at Castro 's two-story home .

Castro , who pleaded guilty to 937 counts , was found hanged with a bedsheet in his jail cell on September 3 .
