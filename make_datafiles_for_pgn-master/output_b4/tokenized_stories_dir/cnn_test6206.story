-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The eight airlines around the world that have the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in their fleets are set to resume commercial flights of the aircraft by early June .

Qatar Airways was the latest airline to confirm it would resume Dreamliner flights between Doha and Dubai this week and a longer service from Doha to London 's Heathrow starting May 15 .

Ethiopian Airlines was the first to recommence passenger flights with a service from Addis Ababa to Nairobi , Kenya , on Saturday .

Boeing Dreamliner back in skies in Ethiopia

This week , Japan authorized passenger airlines to resume flying the aircraft in the country starting Friday , officials said .

Dreamliner takes flight in Japan

All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines , which account for 24 of the 50 Dreamliners delivered by Boeing thus far , earlier announced they would resume commercial 787 flights on June 1 .

United Airlines -- the only U.S. airline to take delivery of the 787 -- has announced it would resume Dreamliner flights from May 31 , initially serving the domestic Houston-Denver route .

United plans 787 resumption

Polish carrier LOT is planning to resume services June 5 , while Air India has said in local reports it is planning to reintroduce its Dreamliners to the skies in May . Chilean airline LAN has announced it plans flights in June .

The resumption of services ends a worldwide grounding of the ultra modern Dreamliner of more than three months , after two incidents on jets operated by Japanese airlines called the battery systems into question .

Officials later pointed to faulty battery systems in recommending the planes be grounded .

Last week , the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cleared Boeing to make fixes to the problematic battery system . Boeing said it was deploying teams to help the airlines install the redesigned system .

In an online posting last Thursday , the FAA outlined the modifications necessary for the Dreamliner to fly again .

The Dreamliner 's use of lightweight composite materials to greatly improve fuel economy has made it a big seller in Asia and the Middle East , where long-haul flights account for much of an airline 's business .
