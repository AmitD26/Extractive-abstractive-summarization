London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pat Croce is a man on a mission -- a mission to find his all time favorite pirate .

The highly successful businessman , who rose from being a trainer in the locker room to president of one of the most storied franchises of the NBA , is on a quest to find the body of English explorer Sir Francis Drake , who was buried out at sea more than 400 years ago .

Sir Francis Drake was an adventurer and a true pirate of the 16th century . Drake is credited with being the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe . He led several voyages , many of them aimed at capturing Spanish territories and taking their treasure . While he made enemies with Spain , he enchanted Queen Elizabeth I , who is believed to have fondly called him `` my pirate '' .

But the Spanish got their revenge . Drake 's voyage to the West Indies was disastrous , with the Spanish fleets prepared for the English . The adventure was to be his last and in 1596 he fell ill with dysentery . Dressed in armor , Drake 's body was placed in a lead casket and thrown overboard off the coast of Panama . Days later two ships in the fleet were scuttled nearby , ensuring they would n't get into the hands of Drake 's enemy , the Spanish .

Now , centuries after he was laid to rest , Croce is on a quest to locate Drake 's coffin . `` I 'm a businessman with a passion for pirates and I 'm all about taking action on your passion , '' Croce enthuses .

Croce has invested a great deal of time and money -- somewhere in the region of hundreds of thousands of dollars according to some experts -- into finding Drake 's final resting place . Last month he had a major breakthrough .

Armed with high-tech equipment , a team of archeologists and divers and using the information given to him by a researcher he has hired -- Croce set about combing the seabed in an area off the Panama coast . What they came across Croce describes as a tremendous find .

They uncovered two ships that appeared to be burnt out , lying perpendicular to one another , in an area which Croce now likes to call ` Drake 's alcove ' . They did n't find a name on either ships , or the ships ' bells , yet Croce and experts are quite convinced the ships are the `` Delight '' and `` Elizabeth '' -- the two ships in Drake 's final voyage that were scuttled .

Croce 's passion for pirates is colossal . What started as a hobby as a child has exploded into a business empire , with books and a Hollywood movie project in the pipeline . The American businessman has even established ` The St Augustine Pirate and Treasure Museum ' to share all the treasures he 's collected over the years .

But it is Drake that he admires and relates to the most . `` He was an entrepreneur of his day , '' explains Croce . `` He talked investors into investing into his adventures and then brought back a return on the investment . ''

It 's not just Drake 's business brain that Croce has a high regard for , but also his rise from commoner to knighthood -- a journey not too distant from Croce 's own . `` I was a trainer who eventually owned a basketball team . That 's unheard of ! '' Croce , a physiotherapist by trade , made his fortune by building up , and eventually selling , a successful sports medicine business . His term as president of the Philadelphia 76ers will go down in folklore , with the side going from last place to first in NBA standings .

It is Croce 's dream to one day see Drake 's body eventually returned to Britain and buried in Plymouth with drums sounding and overseen by Queen Elizabeth II , the monarch who shares the same name as the royal who thought of Drake as her own private .

For the moment though , another mission will require a permit from the Panama government to continue diving off its coast . However Croce believes they ca n't be far off locating Drake 's coffin . While Drake would return to England with stolen Spanish treasure , for Croce he says his lost treasure is Drake 's coffin and the history behind it .

`` All I can say to my man Sir Francis Drake is : I 'll be back , '' he says .
