-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Google is a company focused on problem solving . It has untold amounts of computing power at its disposal working away to try and solve big problems .

But one issue requires a more analog approach : upping the number of female computer engineers .

During his keynote address at the Google I/O developers conference this month , co-founder Larry Page said that Google had been focused on recruiting more women `` forever '' to ensure that the company did n't end up all male .

`` The only answer is , we have to start early and make sure we get more women and girls excited in technology , '' said Page . `` There 's no question we will double the rate of progress . ''

The company has a number of year-round initiatives aimed at hiring and educating more women programmers , including scholarships and events . The annual developers ' conference offers a rare public , visual example of the industry 's gender gap and the company 's progress .

In the past , women attendees and speakers have been underrepresented in the conference halls and on its stages . Since the conference started in 2008 , Google has been working to shift the numbers . According to Google Vice President Megan Smith , the percentage of women at this year 's Google I/O was in the teens , up from a single-digit slice at last year 's conference .

Google has worked to shine a spotlight on the accomplshed women working in technology now , as well as the women who have done important work in the field throughout history . The Women Techmakers Fireside Chat featured some of Google 's high-ranking women , and the event was quickly filled to capacity with a mix of men and women .

`` Its been a priority from the beginning ... the visibly of technical women is something we really want to work on , '' said Smith , who works at Google -LSB- x -RSB- , Google 's semi-secretive experimental wing that works on futuristic projects and prototypes .

First Google made a concerted effort to find talented women in the field from around the world to invite to the conference .

`` We felt like there were incredible technical women who should be at I/O , who for whatever reason were n't there , '' said Smith . `` We did a lot of work to just make sure that we were increasing the presence of women leaders ... on the stage and in demos . ''

They also organized a social event for all the women attendees and offered on-site day care for all parents attending the conference . Kids were also welcome on the floor , and one dad wrote in to say it had been a great father-daughter event .

Another continuing part of Google 's approach is community building for women already in the field so that they feel less isolated . The company held a Women Techmakers social for female I/O attendees before the conference . Women were invited to meet their peers , enjoy some wine and food from the Google kitchen , and then break off into teams up to create unique projects using littleBits and arts and crafts supplies .

Developer Rony Rozen was at the event and came all the way from Israel to attend the conference after Google invited her . Rozen is the founder of poccaDot , an iOS and Android app development company in Tel Aviv . She started the company after serving as a programmer with the Israeli Air Force , and she is a mentor for mobile development at Google 's Israel campus .

`` I think Google can -LRB- and should -RRB- expand their efforts to be more visible to the general public and not just to the people who are already in the industry , '' said Rozen . `` Incorporate more women into their commercials , make sure to advertise women tech-makers events throughout the year and eventually also expand the relevant age groups to focus on younger girls . ''

Smith is influenced by the success of the Harvey Mudd school in southern California , headed up by president Maria Klawe . Its computer science department is now 44 % women , thanks to efforts by the school to figure out why more women were n't joining in the first place .

What it found was partially a PR problem . Some women did n't think the field sounded interesting due to a lack of understanding of what the work entailed . They also did n't think they 'd be good at it .

`` Young women are very interested in having an impact on the world , '' said Smith . `` We have n't connected the dots for them '' that coding can have a direct impact on issues that are important to them .

It 's not just a matter of reaching out to young people . Women are getting into computer science later in life as returning professionals . And going back to college is n't the only way to learn programming , according to Smith . Anyone can take classes on sites like Khan Academy , Codecademy and Coursera .

Female programmers are also spreading the word on their own . Rozen is doing her part by teaching her young nieces how to program .

`` We as a society need to make sure that more young boys and girls are exposed to this kind of education as early in possible in life , and I think that Google plays a major role in our achieving that goal . ''
