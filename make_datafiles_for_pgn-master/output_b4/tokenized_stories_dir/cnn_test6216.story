-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Can you imagine a world where the sun never sets ?

For scientists cruising Antarctica in a mammoth 94-meter ship , that 's exactly the surreal realm they encountered .

Now their remarkable two-month expedition has been condensed into a haunting time-lapse video , following the floating laboratory as it plowed its way through some of the most brutal conditions on the planet .

`` We arrived in summer , mid-February , when there was 24-hour sunlight , '' Stanford University Ph.D student , Cassandra Brooks , told CNN .

`` The sun would move from high in the sky to very low , but would never completely disappear . I did n't get tired until 1 . am -- it was very energizing . ''

` Touching infinity '

Brooks , who is studying international ocean policy , was one of 30 U.S. scientists monitoring Antarctica 's unique eco-system , as part of a National Science Foundation research cruise .

The ship wound its way along the stunning Ross Sea -- believed to be the last untouched marine eco-system on the planet -- providing scientists with an important insight into one of our few remaining healthy waterways .

During the summer months , Antarctica -- the southern most tip of the globe -- is transformed into a bewitching `` Land of the Midnight Sun , '' where the sun never dips below the horizon , instead continuously moving in circles .

After more than a week of this extraordinary phenomenon , the team finally saw their first sunset at 1 . am -- an experience Brooks described as `` like touching infinity . ''

`` Brilliant orange light streamed through the portholes on the starboard side of the ship . I peeled myself away from my microscope , dashed across the room and peered outside to catch the sun blazing down on the horizon , '' the 33-year-old said .

`` The sight took my breath away -- the sky was on fire , turning the ocean a deep purple red . Gusts of wind collided with the wide rolling swells , driving an arc of brilliant pink spray 10 feet into the air . ''

Life and death

Despite the breathtaking beauty of this icy underworld , conditions could also be brutal with winds of 110 kilometers per hour and temperatures plunging to -40 C.

On these extreme days , scientists were n't allowed outside on the deck covered in a slippery -- and dangerous -- layer of ice .

`` If you fell overboard you 'd be dead within minutes because the water is below freezing , '' said Brooks .

`` Yet it 's an environment that 's also teeming with animals such as emperor penguins and Weddell seals . ''

Sometimes tightly packed ice up to 10 ft deep threatened to trap the ship -- Brooks admitted on previous expeditions it had been stuck for weeks -- and it was forced to spend hours reversing and ramming its way through .

The adventure was caught on film after Brooks attached a video camera to the bow of the boat -- capturing everything from blazing sunshine to fierce storms .

` Forget Friday night '

For more than two months , the team cruised Antarctica 's wild Ross Sea -- more than 5,000 kilometers from the closest country ; New Zealand .

Their ship , the Nathaniel B Palmer , became a floating island in itself , equipped with a helicopter hanger , gym , industrial kitchen , library , conference room and laboratory .

Brooks was part of a team measuring plankton in the water and would usually start her experiments at 7 . am , working until 8 . pm .

During the summer months , Antarctica 's green plankton bloom grows so large it can be seen from outer space .

`` We were there to test what happens to all that phytoplankton , which provides a vital source of carbon -- or food -- to the system , '' Brooks explained .

`` Does it sink out to the bottom ? Get eaten over the summer ? Does it get transported out of the system ? Many think that this large source of phytoplankton is the reason why the Ross Sea has such large populations of predators .

`` Some people would still be up sampling water until 4 . am , '' she added . `` The idea of weekends and normal Friday nights completely disappears . ''

Spiritual science

For Brooks , the journey was more than just a science expedition -- it was a spiritual experience which gave her a renewed appreciation for mighty mother nature .

`` It just grabbed me in a very visceral way , '' said Brooks .

`` It 's such an obviously beautiful place but also surreal -- the conditions are so extreme so you 're seeing a whole other world you 've never seen before . ''

Many scientists now believe the Ross Sea is the last untouched marine ecosystem in the world .

If Brooks ' stunning video is anything to go by , it 's also one worth protecting .
