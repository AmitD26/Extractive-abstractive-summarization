-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Even as America reels from the horrific massacre in Newtown , Connecticut , the clock continues to count down toward the so-called `` fiscal cliff . ''

In the face of a legitimate crisis , it is harder to stomach manufactured ones . And that 's exactly what the so-called fiscal cliff is .

In fact , every time I hear the term , I want to slam my head on the table . Luckily , I 'm not alone . Today , December 19 , a collection of artists are coming together to expose the `` fiscal cliff '' as a `` fiscal bluff , '' and remind progressives of the power of culture in helping to win the long-term war of ideas .

My organization , Rebuild the Dream , is joining artist groups CultureStrike and 5D Stories on a special project : `` ARTSTRIKE : America 's Not Broke , America is Being Robbed . '' On Wednesday , with the help of Rebuild the Dream 's members and partners , millions of people will see works of art that convey what is at stake in the big budget fight .

Some of the artwork takes the form of arresting and powerful visuals with a fierce message . Other works explain what is happening in Washington , or graphically depict the choice our nation faces . There are songs and videos touching on issues from student debt to long-ignored poverty .

Not every piece frames the debate exactly as I would , and I may not share every artist 's exact view . But that 's not the point of a project like this . I believe this project conveys a message that policymakers need to hear . And it could n't come at a more urgent moment than now , as reports indicate President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner could be nearing a deal that slashes Social Security , cuts benefits for veterans and raises taxes on the poor and middle class to pay for the Bush wars , tax cuts and bailouts .

Our country is in the midst of a massive jobs crisis , the next generation is saddled in debt , the climate crisis is rapidly approaching a point of no return and now unspeakable gun violence shatters the heart of our nation . Instead of tackling these problems , some of our nation 's leaders are apparently contemplating putting Social Security , and maybe Medicare , on the chopping block in a panic move -- all to avoid an artificially contrived deadline .

We can make a huge dent in the rest of the deficit just by returning to the higher taxes and lower defense spending of the Clinton boom years , asking those who do well in America to do well by America . Washington should also deal with spending by cutting wasteful subsidies to oil companies , defense contractors and agribusinesses that do little but line CEOs ' pockets with our tax dollars .

The main part of the cliff that worries me is taxes going up on poor and middle-class Americans . The House of Representatives could fix that with one vote to extend the current low rates .

We need to spread the word , and I am glad that artists are leading the way . Artists have been at the forefront of all great modern social movements . They inspire people to dream bigger , force us to imagine a different world and confront people with new ideas . We must embrace the power of art to better protect the American Dream for generations to come .

We should never allow Washington politicians to stampede the American people into supporting cuts they otherwise would never accept .

They 're bluffing -- and hoping we fold . It 's not a fiscal cliff , it 's a fiscal bluff . And as our nation struggles to deal with real emergencies , I am glad that America 's artists are calling them on it .
