-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Imagine not being able to hear a siren during an emergency or to see a warning sign to evacuate . Imagine navigating knee-high mud in a wheelchair or trying to explain to a child with Down syndrome why he or she must seek higher ground . Those are just some of the challenges facing those with physical and cognitive disabilities -- people often least prepared to face a natural disaster .

A largely overlooked report issued this month by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction found that the crucial needs of about 1 billion people living with physical and mental disabilities around the world are not woven into the disaster planning and emergency response plans of governments and civil society groups .

The result is that a disproportionate number of disabled persons suffer and die in disasters because of a lack of attention to their needs . Emergency response systems and shelters are poorly designed to handle their requirements . According to the report , 70 % of those with disabilities who responded to the survey in over 100 countries said they did not know how to tap into any existing emergency response system in their communities . They become largely dependent on the good will of families and neighbors .

The report confirms the experience from recent catastrophes like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti -- where deaf victims were trapped underneath rubble , unable to hear the sounds of rescuers drilling above -- and the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan , where victims in wheelchairs could not board evacuation buses or get into temporary housing that had no ramps .

And we have seen in the U.S. during Hurricane Katrina and other major storms how those with disabilities suffer . In a post-Katrina study of survivors , reports found that people with physical or cognitive disabilities faced considerable barriers to transportation , evacuation , and housing . Dozens died in nursing homes and medical centers . Many of the disabled survivors did not have jobs , making post-crisis transition even more challenging .

It is tempting to presume that people with disabilities are small in number . The reality , however , is that roughly 15 % of people in the world live with a physical or cognitive disability -- many of them in developing countries that can not afford care and inclusion .

In the United States , 37.2 million Americans have some form of disability . Despite the success of programs like the Americans with Disabilities Act , there are millions of people left without meaningful employment , education , and services before , during , and after a crisis .

The United States has a global imperative to address the needs of the disabled today -- especially in difficult fiscal times . Leaving aside the moral obligation , there is an economic driver at work . Worldwide , people with disabilities have higher unemployment rates than those without disabilities . In developing countries , 80 % to 90 % of persons of working age with disabilities are unemployed , whereas in industrialized countries the figure is between 50 % and 70 % . Their exclusion from the workplace deprives societies of an estimated $ 1.4 trillion in gross domestic product .

As we plan for disaster relief , as well as routine development and assistance , it is vital that America lead with a sustained commitment to those with disabilities . The U.S. failure to ratify the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities -- a convention signed by 155 nations -- reinforces a perception that America does not care about the disabled .

Yet despite the failure to ratify the convention , America has a good story to tell on inclusive development and disabilities . The U.S. Agency for International Development has led the way on supporting principles of universal design that not only fund specific programs to address the targeted needs of disabled citizens , but integrate disabilities into generalized programs that improve job training , education , quality and accessibility of care .

Over 75 % of U.S. missions and USAID offices report activities and programs that specifically include people with disabilities . The U.S. State Department has a special adviser for international disability rights and has made enormous progress in expanding the range of U.S.-funded exchange programs to include more participants with disabilities and to convene international experts around the issue .

Recently , a major conference took place in Washington , with leaders on disability rights from Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Pakistan , the Philippines , Tajikistan , and Uganda and representatives from NGOs , universities , and government offices in the U.S. , to address challenges facing persons with disabilities in their home communities . The U.S. sent the first-ever official team of disabled sports envoys to China to promote inclusion and equality for persons with disabilities .

This month we celebrate the 25th anniversary of National Disability Employment Awareness Month to pay homage to our own citizens with disabilities . The October campaign theme is `` Because we are EQUAL to the task . '' This is a good time to think about those at home and overseas who are marginalized and excluded because of disabilities and make sure we are doing our part .
