Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Juanita Moore , the third African-American actress to ever get a supporting actress Oscar nomination , died of natural causes at her Los Angeles home Tuesday , her grandson said . She was 99 .

Moore worked right to the end , preparing for a stage reading of a new play and helping her actor grandson learn lines , Kirk Kellykhan said ,

`` I just got cursed out that morning about learning my lines , '' Kellykhan said . Moore was helping him prepare for the lead in the West Coast production of the Broadway play `` The Wedding Man , '' he said .

She was scheduled to take part in a January 17 reading of a play based on Michael St. John 's book `` Hollywood Through the Backdoor , '' her grandson said .

Moore was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar in 1960 for Douglas Sirk 's `` Imitation of Life . '' She played a housekeeper whose daughter passes for white .

A Los Angeles native , she began her entertainment career as a Cotton Club chorus girl and a film extra . At the same time , she worked on her acting skills on stage in the Ebony Showcase Theater .

Moore 's feature film debut came in 1949 when she played a nurse in `` Pinky . ''

Most of her roles in the 1950s were as domestics , until she was cast as Annie Johnson in `` Imitation of Life . '' The story was about Johnson 's light-skinned daughter denying her racial roots .

The lack of roles for African-American actresses in the early 1960s made it difficult for Moore to find big-screen jobs despite the accolades for her work . She acted in supporting roles in 1961 in `` Tammy , Tell Me True '' and in 1963 in `` Papa 's Delicate Condition . '' Moore did land a significant role as a nun in the 1966 hit `` The Singing Nun . ''

As more black-themed movies were made near the end of the decade , her career improved . She acted in `` Uptight '' in 1968 , `` The Mack '' in 1973 and `` Abby '' in 1974 .

While she cut back on acting work in the 1980s , she never retired . She played a wise grandmother in `` Disney 's The Kid '' in 2000 , while acting in television guest roles in `` ER '' and `` Judging Amy . ''
