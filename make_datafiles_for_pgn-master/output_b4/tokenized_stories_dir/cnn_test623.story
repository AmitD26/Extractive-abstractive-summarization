-LRB- CNN -RRB- Presumed dead by some , the actual fate of the aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un remains unconfirmed because of the secretive nature of that country .

Last year , a North Korean defector said that Kim Kyung Hee had died from a stroke while arguing on the phone with the North Korean leader about her husband 's execution .

The defector 's claims were widely reported , but doubts have persisted .

Lawmakers in neighboring South Korea told the news agency Yonhap Tuesday that the country 's National Intelligence Service reported there is no evidence that Kim Kyung Hee died .

It is believed that she is still alive , a South Korean government source told CNN .

CNN could not verify claims of Kim Kyung Hee 's fate .

Kim Kyung Hee is the sister of Kim Jong Il , the North Korean leader who died a little more than three years ago and left his son in power .

Her husband , Jang Song Thaek , was executed in December 2013 , shocking many observers around the world .

Before his execution , he was described as the second-most powerful figure in North Korea .

But the young leader turned his back on Jang in spectacular fashion , having him executed on charges that he tried to overthrow the government .

CNN 's Paula Hancocks and KJ Kwon contributed to this report .
