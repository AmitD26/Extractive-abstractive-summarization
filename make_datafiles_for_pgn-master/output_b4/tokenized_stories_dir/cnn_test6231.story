LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A British woman won a major legal victory Thursday in her fight to die with her husband by her side if she travels abroad for assisted suicide .

Debbie Purdy has said she wants to die next to her husband , Omar Puente .

Debbie Purdy , 46 , who has multiple sclerosis , has been waging a lengthy legal battle to clarify Britain 's ambiguous laws on assisted suicide .

The House of Lords , Britain 's highest court , ruled in her favor on Thursday , ordering the country 's director of public prosecutions to spell out the criteria under which it will seek to prosecute someone who helps another person commit suicide .

`` I 'm ecstatic , '' Purdy said in a statement issued by the campaign organization Dignity in Dying .

`` I want to live my life to the full , but I do n't want to suffer unnecessarily at the end of my life . This decision means that I can make an informed choice , with Omar -LRB- Puente , her husband -RRB- , about whether he travels abroad with me to end my life . '' Watch Purdy react to the ruling ''

Purdy had been suing to force the British authorities to specify exactly when someone would be prosecuted for helping another person commit suicide . What 's your view ? When is assisted suicide acceptable ?

Doing so is technically illegal under a 1961 law , and anyone found guilty faces up to 14 years in prison .

But the Director of Public Prosecutions has the discretion to choose whether or not to prosecute .

The law does n't make clear at what point a person has broken it -- whether it is illegal to sit with a person on the plane to the clinic , open the door of the car to the airport , or even help them arrange the trip . No one has ever been prosecuted for the crime in the United Kingdom .

Lord James Hope of Craighead , in his ruling on the case , emphasized that the verdict did not grant Purdy 's husband immunity from prosecution .

The court did not rule on the 1961 Suicide Act at all , he pointed out .

`` It is no part of our function to change the law in order to decriminalize assisted suicide , '' he wrote . `` If changes are to be made , as to which I express no opinion , this must be a matter for Parliament . ''

Purdy had spent more than two years fighting the case through Britain 's courts , arguing that the lack of clarity in the law violated her human rights .

The House of Lords ruled in her favor , in its final case as Britain 's highest court . A new Supreme Court will come into being in the fall , replacing the old system under which some members of the House of Lords , the Law Lords , rule on cases on behalf of the entire chamber .

Purdy has said she wants to die next to her husband .

Before the ruling in her favor , she had said she would travel abroad on her own to die if she lost the case , so her husband would be sure not to face prosecution .

That would have meant Purdy would die alone .

The courts ruled the other way in a similar case eight years ago .

British and European courts refused to guarantee that the husband of Diane Pretty would not be prosecuted for helping her to travel abroad to end her life . She died in England after motor neuron disease , an incurable degenerative disease , caused respiratory failure in May 2002 .
