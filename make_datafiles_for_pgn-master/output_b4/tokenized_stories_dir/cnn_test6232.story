London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Instagram is hoping to extract more value from photos uploaded in the past , co-founder Kevin Systrom said Tuesday .

Systrom , making one of his first public appearances since Facebook acquired his photo-sharing app in April for $ 1 billion , said he wants to expand the software to go beyond the `` 10-hour '' time frame viewed by most users .

`` We 're still really hard at work on our product ideas , '' he told attendees at Le Web London -- an offshoot of Europe 's biggest internet conference , usually held each December in Paris . `` We 're going to see Instagram evolve in really interesting ways , and I 'm really excited about it . ''

With the Facebook deal still under financial scrutiny in the United States , Systrom gave few other details about what changes its 50 million users can expect .

Systrom said Instagram 's success lay in its ability to help people communicate visually and express themselves to a wider audience in new , creative ways . `` If it 's an honest , genuine photo , it will go far , '' he said .

But he admitted there was considerable room for improvement . He said the company plans to introduce `` channels '' to organize the flow of images and help users find the best ones .

`` I think we need to do a better job of creating these channels and silos that allow people to learn new things about the world , '' he said . `` We have the content -- it 's about exploring it . ''

To escape the sense that Instagram 's feed is merely a snapshot of the past few hours , Systrom said his developers are working to find better ways to curate older content .

`` We are trying really hard to take all the data that you 've put into Instagram and let you see into the past , '' he said .

Systrom appeared alongside celebrity chef and British TV personality Jamie Oliver , an avid Instagram user . Oliver , who has led healthy-eating campaigns in the United Kingdom and the United States , spoke about the democratizing power of the Web , but was more blunt in his assessment of what images attracted the widest circulation : `` boobs , pretty girls and dogs . ''

Systrom offered his own inspiration to other startup companies looking to follow in his footsteps .

`` Entrepreneurs need to focus on solving problems , '' he said . `` If you try to solve big problems , there will always be funding . ''
