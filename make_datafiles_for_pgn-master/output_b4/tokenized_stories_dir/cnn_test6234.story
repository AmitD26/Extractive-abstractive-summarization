-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Jon Bohmer sat down with his two little girls for a simple project they could work on together , he did n't realize they 'd hit upon a solution to one of the world 's biggest problems for just $ 5 : A solar-powered oven .

Inventor Jon Bohmer with the oven he has made out of a cardboard box .

The ingeniously simple design uses two cardboard boxes , one inside the other , and an acrylic cover that lets in the sun 's rays and traps them .

Black paint on the inner box , and silver foil on the outer one , help concentrate the heat . The trapped rays make the inside hot enough to cook casseroles , bake bread and boil water .

What the box also does is eliminate the need in developing countries for rural residents to cut down trees for firewood . About 3 billion people around the world do so , adding to deforestation and , in turn , global warming .

By allowing users to boil water , the simple device could also potentially save the millions of children who die from drinking unclean water .

Bohmer 's invention on Thursday won the FT Climate Change Challenge , which sought to find and publicize the most innovative and practical solution to climate change .

`` A lot of scientists are working on ways to send people to Mars . I was looking for something a little more grassroots , a little simpler , '' Bohmer said Thursday .

Bohmer 's contest win notwithstanding , solar cooking with a cardboard oven is n't new . Two American women , Barbara Kerr and Sherry Cole , were the solar box cooker 's first serious promoters in the 1970s . They and others joined forces to create the non-profit Solar Cookers International -- originally called Solar Box Cookers International -- in 1987 .

Further , the organization 's executive director , Patrick Widner , said that the plans for a solar box cooker were found in a book published by the Peace Corps in the 1960s .

`` We are pleased that Mr. Bohmer has taken up the cause and interest of the 95 member organizations and 160 individuals of the Solar Cookers Worldwide Network , '' Widner said . `` It would be a pleasure to work with Mr. Bohmer in Kenya where we have been promoting the use of solar cookers for ten years . ''

Bohmer , a Norwegian-born entrepreneur based in Kenya , said he also had been looking at solutions `` way too complex , for way too long . ''

`` This took me about a weekend , and it worked on the first try , '' Bohmer said . `` It 's mind-boggling how simple it is . ''

The contest was organized by the Forum for the Future -- a sustainable development charity -- and the Financial Times newspaper . Among the judges were British business magnate Richard Branson and environmentalist Rajendra Pachauri . The public also voted on the finalists .

Bohmer 's invention beat about 300 other entries , including a machine that turns wood and other organic material into charcoal , wheel covers that make trucks more fuel efficient by reducing drag , and a feed supplement for livestock that reduces the methane they emit by 15 percent .

Bohmer named his invention the Kyoto Box , after the international environmental treaty to reduce global warming .

The box can be produced in existing cardboard factories . It has gone into production in a factory in Nairobi , Kenya , that can churn out about 2.5 million boxes a month .

Bohmer has also designed a more durable version , made from recycled plastic , which can be produced just as cheaply .

He envisions such cardboard ovens being distributed throughout rural Africa .

`` In the West , we cook with electricity , so it 's easy to ignore this problem , '' he said . `` But half the world 's population is still living in a stone age . The only way for them to cook is to make a fire .

`` I do n't want to see another 80-year-old woman carrying 20 kilos of firewood on her back . Maybe we do n't have to . ''
