-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In South Africa , Nelson Mandela 's 95th birthday is being marked by celebrations , good deeds , and an exhibition of stunning new posters of the country 's former president .

Mandela himself will be spending the day in hospital in Pretoria , where he is said to be in a critical but stable condition , battling a lung infection .

Since 2009 , Mandela 's birthday has been designated `` Nelson Mandela International Day . '' The celebration encourages people around the globe to partake in 67 minutes of public service : one minute per year of service that the former statesman , also known as Madiba , has given to his country .

It 's a day that many feared might not come , as Mandela has been receiving urgent medical care since June . Now breathing with the help of a machine , family and friends have been optimistic about his response to treatment , with former president Thabo Mbeki even suggesting he may soon be discharged .

Admirers worldwide are hoping for the Nobel Peace laureate 's recovery , with Mandela Day providing the perfect opportunity to celebrate his life and achievements . A survey released last week found that 89 % of South Africans planned to commemorate the day , with thousands of school children across the country singing `` happy birthday '' this morning .

Also marking the occasion , at the University of Pretoria the Mandela Poster Project is exhibiting images of Mandela from around the world .

Launched in May 2013 , the project asked designers to submit posters celebrating Mandela 's life . It received more than 700 entries from more than 70 countries , and is now displaying 95 posters that reflect Mandela 's international legacy .

`` He -LRB- Mandela -RRB- carries across this concept of humanity and selflessness , '' said Mohammed Jogie , co-founder of the project .

There are plans for an international traveling exhibition , and the posters will also be made into an online gallery . The team behind the project says it plans to donate any proceeds to the Nelson Mandela Children 's Hospital Trust , which aims to establish a pediatric hospital in Johannesburg .

It 's a fitting tribute to the iconic activist on a day that celebrates the sense of community and charity Mandela has dedicated his life to promoting .
