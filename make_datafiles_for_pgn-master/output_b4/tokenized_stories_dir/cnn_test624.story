-LRB- CNN -RRB- Football has faced plenty of problems over racist and homophobic chanting and now a British broadcaster wants action taken after fans allegedly sang songs which mocked people with disabilities .

Kevin Kilbane , a former Republic of Ireland international who played with Everton in the English Premier League , reported West Ham supporters to the English Football Association for derogatory chants against Tottenham 's Harry Kane during Sunday 's game .

The former winger , who now works for the BBC , was not at the game but was shocked to hear `` mong '' chants had been sung at the game .

Kilbane was told about the chants by Andy Merriman -- a Tottenham season-ticket holder whose daughter lives with Down 's syndrome . Kilbane 's daughter Elsie has the same condition and he is a patron of the Down 's Syndrome Association .

`` The club emailed every supporter who had bought a ticket to Sunday 's game to remind them that they were acting as ambassadors for West Ham United '' a West Ham spokesman said Monday .

`` If any individual is found to have behaved in an inappropriate way , the Club 's simple , zero-tolerance policy dictates that they will face the strongest possible action , including the option of a life ban from the Boleyn Ground .

`` If anyone has any information on such behavior we would urge them to report it to the Club , Kick It Out or the police so it can be investigated thoroughly . ''

Tottenham were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN .

`` I am sure they understand they are causing offence , '' Kilbane told the Guardian .

`` You can not sweep it under the carpet and label it as ignorance . It is visible and clear and , like racist or homophobic chanting , it is intended to cause offence . ''

The FA confirmed to CNN that Kilbane , among others , had reported the incident and has promised a thorough investigation into the allegations .

`` I want to be able to take my kids to football matches and when Elsie gets older she will understand about her condition and I would not want her to hear that kind of chanting , '' said Kilbane .

`` If her sister Isla heard it , she would be devastated too , as my friend 's sons were '' said Kilbane .

In another incident on Sunday a group of men -- thought to be West Ham fans -- were filmed chanting anti-Semitic abuse on a train in North London .

Both episodes follow the racism storm that engulfed Chelsea after its fans pushed a black man out of a Paris Metro carriage last week .
