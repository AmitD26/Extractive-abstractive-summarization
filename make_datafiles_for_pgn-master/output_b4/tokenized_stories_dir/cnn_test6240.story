-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On shaky , grainy video recordings , a group of men show off a stash of pills , pop open Budweiser tall boys and shoot dice for stacks of cash . One injects what appears to be heroin ; another displays a large-caliber pistol , ejecting four bullets from the chamber to show that it 's loaded .

Here 's the punchline : These guys are already in jail .

The scenes were captured in 2009 on a camera smuggled into the House of Detention in New Orleans , a decrepit lockup pressed back into service after Hurricane Katrina . The video 's release during a federal court hearing this week sparked a new demand by the city 's mayor for the federal government to take over the Orleans Parish prison system and a round of I-told-you-sos by advocates for the inmates held there .

In addition to the displays of contraband , the inmates in the now-shuttered facility show themselves dishing out soup from bins in grungy , overcrowded cells and sleeping on mattresses laid on floors . One holds up glue traps he says are used to catch nutria , a rat-like pest that has infested much of southern Louisiana and notes that the jail was supposed to have been closed .

`` Why 're we in here , then ? '' he asks . `` ACLU investigated , and they told them it 's closed down ... why 're we in here ? ''

This week 's hearings in U.S. District Court are part of a lawsuit filed against Orleans Parish Sheriff Marlin Gusman . Attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center say Gusman 's neglect led to `` brutal and inhumane conditions '' for inmates , many of whom are jailed for non-violent misdemeanor offenses .

`` Hearing some of the testimony and looking at some of the video of the jail itself , I can not imagine the conditions of any human being living in those conditions , '' James Hitzman , the father of an inmate who killed himself in the prison two years ago , told CNN affilliate WVUE .

In a statement issued Tuesday , Gusman said he closed the House of Detention in 2012 because of its `` state of disrepair and abhorrent lack of proper security measures . ''

`` Following Hurricane Katrina , we were forced to reopen the House of Detention to house inmates , because other inmate facilities were destroyed by the floods . It was never meant to be a long-term solution , '' Gusman said . `` In addition , we have been using eight temporary tents to house inmates . These facilities were never meant to be used this long for these purposes . ''

U.S. District Judge Lance Africk is weighing whether to approve a settlement with the sheriff 's office that would require the parish to provide appropriate housing , protection and medical care for inmates . But New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu called for a federal receiver to be put in control of the jail after the release of the video , which he said was turned up by the city 's lawyers .

`` It is now clearer than ever that the Orleans Parish Sheriff 's Office is not keeping the prison secure and our city safe , '' Landrieu said in a statement . `` The people of the city are investing over $ 226 million to build new prison facilities and over $ 30 million each year in the taxpayer money to operate the jail . I can not in good conscience cut vital services or raise taxes to put even more money into an office where waste , fraud , and abuse run rampant . ''
