Kiev , Ukraine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The mood around Independence Square in Ukraine 's capital was very somber Sunday as thousands gathered , mourning the dozens of people killed in demonstrations during the past week and wondering who will take charge of the politically divided nation .

They wondered where President Viktor Yanukovych , who reportedly tried to leave the country Saturday night , had gone .

No one in the government appeared to know .

There was a great uncertainty in the country after the rapidly moving events of the past 24 hours , which saw Parliament oust Yanukovych , free his political rival Yulia Tymoshenko from prison and schedule elections for May .

It appeared that two political forces were trying to establish control of the country : the opposition and Yanukovych , who maintains that he is still President and still in control despite fleeing to the eastern part of the country . Clearly , though , his power has been greatly diminished

Oleksandr Yefremov , parliamentary leader of Yanukovych 's Party of Regions , condemned the ousted President on Sunday in a video statement , blaming him for the `` robbery and deception '' of the nation .

The former ruling party blamed Yanukovych for illegal orders that led to casualties , financial debt and shame in the eyes of the world , Yefremov said .

It also remains to be seen how Russia -- Yanukovych 's ally -- will respond with the Winter Olympics in Sochi closing on Sunday .

Rapid changes to political scene

Tymoshenko , the former prime minister , was freed after 2Ã‚ 1/2 years in prison Saturday and returned to the capital in a development many could n't have imagined as dawn broke that day .

She went to Independence Square and had strong words for Yanukovych .

`` Today , Ukraine has finished with this terrible dictator , '' Tymoshenko told the cheering crowd .

She served as prime minister from 2007 until she was forced out of office in 2010 after losing the election to Yanukovych . A year later , she was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia .

The West considers her case politically motivated and has called her `` a political prisoner . ''

She is considered a hero of a 2004 revolution that forced the results of a presidential election won by Yanukovych to be thrown out .

Where is the Presdent ?

Last we heard , Yanukovych was in Kharkiv , a pro-Russian stronghold near Ukraine 's border with that nation .

He tried to leave the country by plane but was turned away , authorities said .

The country 's acting interior minister said Sunday that government officials in Kiev do n't know the whereabouts of Yanukovych and two of his top ministers .

On Saturday , the President and his entourage attempted to board a charter flight without proper documentation in the eastern city of Donetsk , according to the head of Ukraine 's Border Guard Service , Sergei Astakov .

He was on the tarmac when he was turned back by security forces , Astakov said .

But the President took to television airwaves , saying he 's still the legitimate leader . He said he was forced to leave Kiev because of `` vandalism , crime and a coup . ''

`` I do n't plan to leave the country . I do n't plan to resign . I am the legitimate President , '' he said from Kharkiv .

May elections

Parliament voted to oust the President and hold new elections on May 25 . It also appointed Oleksandr Turchinov , the speaker , to take on Yanukovych 's duties until then .

Lawmakers also fired several ministers , including the foreign and education chiefs .

But who will lead the nation is still a big question .

Tymoshenko announced Sunday that she does n't want to be considered for the nomination for prime minister , according to a statement posted on the Batkivshchyna party website .

The opposition coalition is a chaotic mix of voices , each working to assert dominance .

Former world champion boxer Vitali Klitschko has been the most well-known opposition figure during the crisis . He heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party . But the opposition bloc goes well beyond Klitschko and his party .

Then there 's Arseniy Yatsenyuk , another opposition figure and former foreign minister .

Last month , the President offered a package of concessions under which Yatsenyuk would have become the prime minister and Klitschko deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues . The opposition refused .

Russia 's influence

The series of concessions started Friday with Parliament overwhelmingly approving the return of the nation 's 2004 constitution . Reinstating it gives the President less power -- a key demand of protesters who 'd taken over Kiev City Hall for weeks -- and paves the way for lawmakers to appoint key ministers .

Close ally Russia has been busy hosting the Winter Olympics , which end Sunday .

But it 's closely linked to the crisis , which started in November , when Yanukovych scrapped a European Union trade deal and turned toward Russia .

Russia offered to lend money to Ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and lower its gas prices .

The deal sent protesters to the streets as Russia pressured Yanukovych to crack down on demonstrators .

On Saturday , Russia 's ambassador to the United Nations , Vitaly Churkin , condemned what he called Western attempts to influence the outcome of the tumult in Ukraine .

`` Either they do n't understand the consequences of what they 're doing , or they 're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing Ukraine and therefore Eastern Europe , '' Churkin said in a post on his official Twitter account .

Churkin has accused the opposition of wanting to take power by force .

`` If those so-called democratic opposition leaders come to power on the shoulders of thugs , that will not produce democracy in Ukraine , '' he said .

On Sunday , U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke about the situation in Ukraine . According to written statement from a senior State Department official , Washington strongly prodded Moscow to accept the results of the Parliament 's decisions .

Kerry also asked Russia to work with the United States and the European Union on enabling `` critically needed reforms '' and to not use military force in the country , which shares a border with western Russia .
