-LRB- CNN -RRB- The economy 's in the tank , the currency 's crumbling , and he 's risking diplomatic isolation for doubling down on Ukraine .

So how is it that Russian President Vladimir Putin 's popularity is at a whopping 86 % ?

That 's the conclusion of a poll conducted this month by the Levada Center . Last month , Putin 's approval rating was at 85 % .

The Levada-Center describes itself as an independent , non-governmental polling and sociological research organization .

And it has found that Putin 's approval ratings have been holding steady in the mid-80s since around May last year , which incidentally is when the Ukraine/Crimea conflict bubbled up .

What gives ?

The answer is simple , says Ben Judah , author of `` Fragile Empire : How Russia Fell In and Out of Love with Vladimir Putin . ''

`` That figure is made up , '' he told CNN last month .

`` An opinion poll can only be conducted in a democracy with a free press , '' he explained . `` In a country with no free press , where people are arrested for expressing their opinions , where the truth is hidden from them , where the media even online is almost all controlled by the government -- when a pollster phones people up and asks , ` Hello , do you approve of Vladimir Putin , ' the answer is overwhelmingly yes .

`` So what that opinion poll is , is not a poll of approval but it 's a poll of fear . ''

There 's another factor at play .

Putin has remained defiant in the face of Western sanctions and political pressure to stand down in Ukraine . And that defiance is earning him political points at home despite the impact on the Russian economy .

Henry Hale , an international affairs professor at The George Washington University specializing in Russian politics , said on the whole , the polls reflect the reality on the ground of popular support for Putin .

`` I do n't think Russians are really hiding their feelings , '' Hale told CNN in December , adding that the polls indicate support for Putin , but not necessarily the depth of that support .

Media propaganda plays a key role in bolstering Putin 's popularity , Hale said , especially in the portrayal of Ukraine 's popular revolt as a fascist takeover and in portraying the annexation of Crimea as , essentially , a rescue mission .

Nationalism 's OK , but families have mouths to feed .

And if Russia 's economic problems get worse , that could bode ill for Putin .

`` Even if he can keep strong popular support , Putin has to worry most of all about keeping happy the oligarchs , the wealthy Russians who back him in exchange for continued prosperity , '' says Frida Ghitis , a world affairs columnist for the Miami Herald , in a piece for CNN.com . `` Economic sanctions and a shrinking economy will not make them happy . ''
