-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Dominican Republic was the first country to give aid to Haiti in the aftermath of Tuesday 's devastating earthquake . Some of the first video images of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince came from a Dominican television crew .

On the face of it , the quick reaction from Haiti 's neighbor may not seem surprising given their proximity . But historically , a much wider gap in relations has existed between Haiti and the Dominican Republic since colonial times . The Dominican Republic 's outpouring of support to Haiti is a reminder of how the less-than-friendly legacy between the two nations has been buried even deeper .

Some tensions still exist between citizens of both countries . Dominicans recall how they were under Haitian rule for a period in the mid-1800s , and how they repeatedly fought Haitian aggressions . Today , Haitians provide cheap labor in the Dominican Republic , a trend that has caused resentment on both sides , not unlike the illegal immigration debate in the United States .

But as far as the countries themselves are officially concerned , `` relations are at a high point compared to 20 or 30 years ago , '' Ernesto Sagas , associate professor of ethnic studies at Colorado State University , told CNN . `` Relations between the countries at the presidential level are at high levels . ''

Dominican Public Works Minister Victor Diaz Rua surveyed the damage in Port-au-Prince Wednesday as his country planned the necessary logistics to provide international aid . Are you there ? Submit an iReport

`` The center of the city , where the presidential palace collapsed , is practically completely destroyed , '' Diaz Rua told CNN en Espa√±ol , noting he saw hotels , schools and hospitals that were damaged .

Diaz Rua also saw few emergency teams working .

`` We 're going to send teams from the Dominican Republic to help with the rescue . We 're going to send food , water and mobile clinics , '' he said .

Such cooperation was not historically the case .

Haiti , a former French colony , and the Dominican Republic , with roots as a Spanish colony , have tensions that go back to those days , Sagas said .

The Dominican Republic gained its independence from Haiti in 1844 , after Haiti had occupied it . The Dominicans spent the next 20 years fighting off Haitian invasion attempts .

By the early 20th century , Haitians had become a source of cheap labor in the neighboring country . Racism and security concerns resulted in a massacre in 1937 . Dominican leader Rafael Trujillo ordered the execution of Haitians living near the border between the countries , resulting in the killings of 20,000 to 30,000 Haitians , historians say .

The current tragedy appears to push those tensions further into the past .

`` This is the worst disaster in Haiti 's recorded history , '' Sagas said . `` The best role the DR can play is to open its border for other nations to funnel all the aid to Haiti . ''

The Dominican Republic appears to be following that path .

The government on Wednesday started sending food , medicine and rescue crews to Haiti , the El Nacional newspaper reported . Top Dominican leaders amassed at the border as a staging ground to begin transporting aid into the country . Are you looking for loved ones ?

Among the aid are 10 mobile cafeterias that can produce 100,000 meals a day , and heavy equipment to remove debris , Diaz Rua said .
