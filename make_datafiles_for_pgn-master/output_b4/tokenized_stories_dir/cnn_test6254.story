-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Roger Federer 's revival is gathering pace .

The 17-time grand slam champion will seek his fifth title at the Indian Wells Masters event on Sunday , having breezed past 28th seed Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3 6-1 in a semifinal lasting just over an hour .

`` It was one of my best serving days ever , '' Federer told reporters . `` When you are serving like that , everything seems easier . I was just going for it out there . ''

The Swiss veteran , who won his fourth title in the California desert tournament in 2012 , will return to the top five in the rankings next week -- up three places .

He will next face a tougher test of his abilities against world No. 2 Novak Djokovic , who he beat last month on the way to winning the Dubai title , also on an outdoor hardcourt surface .

Federer , who has yet to drop a set this week , is seeking the 79th title of his illustrious career , and victory over Djokovic will put him fourth in the rankings .

Dolgopolov had been trying to become the first player ranked outside the top 30 to beat both Federer and defending champion Rafael Nadal in the same tournament .

`` I was ready physically , mentally , '' said the Ukrainian . `` I was n't nervous much , but I was n't sharp enough .

`` My concentration was going away for maybe one , two points every game , and you ca n't afford to have that in these matches . ''

Djokovic , who won the tournament in 2008 and 2011 , had to work a bit harder than Federer to beat 2012 finalist John Isner on Saturday .

The Serbian avenged his defeat by the big-serving American at the same stage two years ago as he triumphed 7-5 6-7 -LRB- 2-7 -RRB- 6-1 in a match lasting two hours 23 minutes .

He trails Federer 15-17 in their career meetings , but defeated him three years ago on the way to winning the title in the Coachella Valley .
