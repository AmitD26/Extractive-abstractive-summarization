-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Note to self : When soliciting for drugs on Twitter , try a direct message .

Facing another boring day at work , a Toronto car repair shop worker decided some weed would be just the thing to make the day fly by .

Instead of reaching out by phone or walking to his friendly neighborhood drug dealer , the user , using the handle @Sunith_DB8R , tweeted that he needed a joint delivered to his workplace in Vaughan , just north of Toronto .

Opinions on marijuana reaching tipping point

The York Regional Police , @YRP , caught a whiff of the request and enthusiastically -- perhaps too enthusiastically -- responded with , `` Awesome ! Can we come too ? ''

You can imagine what happens next .

The police forwarded the tweet to an account for a man listed on the board of directors for the repair shop chain .

But it did n't end there .

When oversharing online can get you arrested

The exchange was retweeted thousands of times . At one point it was a top trend in Toronto that Tuesday .

The tweeter then tried a couple of different tactics .

First , defiance . `` Never knew weed smokers are more wanted in society than shooters & rapists . Big smh to all of y' all , '' said one tweet .

Then , retreat . `` People really think I 'm serious with my tweets ? MANNNNNNNN . ''

Finally , shame . `` Ca n't lie , stupid move but would y' all have noticed that tweet if YRP did n't retweet it ? ''

Since the tweeter named the company , Mr. Lube , and the intersection where his shop was , the chain got involved .

`` Thank you to the York Regional Police for your help and great work . The matter has now been handled , '' it said in a tweet .

Handled ?

`` Just got the call of termination , '' tweeted the worker later that afternoon . Make that , the ex-worker .

Canadian broadcaster CTV reached out to the manager of the repair shop , who said `` there was an employee here by that name ; he no longer works for us . ''

The York Regional Police explained in a later tweet , `` If you shouted on a busy street corner about illegal activity & we drove by , we 'd intervene . Think of Twitter as a virtual street corner . ''

And one final volley from the social media-savvy department .

`` At the end an interesting day , a reminder to our tweeps : the Internet is a public forum #tweetsafe #tweetclassy #imagineyourmamareadingit ''

Lesson learned ?

Probably .

The next day , the man deleted his account .
