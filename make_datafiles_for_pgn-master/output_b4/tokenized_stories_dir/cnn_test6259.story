-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The powerful but compact Hurricane Raymond drifted toward southern Mexico 's Pacific coast Monday evening as it dumped heavy rains north of Acapulco , forecasters reported .

At 8 p.m. -LRB- 11 p.m. ET -RRB- , Raymond was a Category 3 storm -- a major hurricane -- with top winds of 120 mph -LRB- 193 kph -RRB- . After sitting still for most of the day , it began moving slowly toward shore and was centered about 135 miles -LRB- 217 kilometers -RRB- west-southwest of Acapulco , the U.S.-based National Hurricane Center reported .

It had weakened slightly and its worst punch remained far out to sea , since hurricane-force winds extended just 25 miles from the eye . It was moving eastward at 2 mph , and its movement over the next day was expected to be `` slow and erratic , '' forecasters said .

The hurricane center predicts Raymond will lose steam Tuesday and turn westward into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday . But before then , it 's projected to dump 2 to 4 inches of rain on the coast , and there may be areas in Michoacan and Guerrero states that receive as much as 8 inches .

`` These rains could produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides , '' forecasters noted .

A hurricane warning was posted for about 140 miles of coast , from the city of Lazaro Cardenas to Tecpan de Galeana , about 65 miles north of Acapulco . The warning means winds of 74 mph or higher are expected in the next 36 hours , and the storm could produce produce `` significant coastal flooding '' and `` large and destructive waves , '' the hurricane center said .

A hurricane watch and tropical storm warning was posted from Acapulco to Tecpan de Galeana , meaning hurricane conditions are possible within two days , and winds of 39 mph or higher are expected within 36 hours .

Raymond quickly strengthened overnight off the south-central coast , which was was hit hard by another storm in September . That storm , Manuel , triggered deadly mudslides and left about 40,000 tourists stranded in Acapulco , a popular tourist destination .

On the other side of the continent , meanwhile , a tropical depression in the Atlantic Ocean has become Tropical Storm Lorenzo , the hurricane center said Monday . The storm was 635 miles east-southeast of Bermuda on Monday evening , moving into the deep Atlantic .

The storm had top winds of 40 mph , and it was moving north-northeast at 7 mph . Lorenzo was expected to start fading Wednesday without reaching hurricane strength , forecasters projected .
