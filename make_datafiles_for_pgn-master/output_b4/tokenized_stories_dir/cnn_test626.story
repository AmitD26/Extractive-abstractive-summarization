Walland , Tennessee -LRB- CNN -RRB- Jim Sanford and his dog Tom poked around the hazelnut grove on Blackberry Farm , a 9,200-acre luxury resort set in the foggy foothills of Tennessee , one Wednesday morning in December .

They were on the hunt again , though not for deer or waterfowl or the usual Tennessee fare .

The man and his curly-haired dog were searching for something fancier : Tuber melanosporum or black Périgord truffles .

Black truffles are one of the most sought after -LRB- and expensive -RRB- delicacies in the world . Often referred to as a `` black diamond , '' the subterranean fungus can retail for $ 1,000 a pound or cost a diner upward of $ 75 extra for a simple shaving on a dish of creamy pasta or slow-scrambled eggs .

Sanford and Tom 's morning hunt proved fruitless . But the pair has had better luck than most sniffing out truffles on American soil -- a relatively new and wholly unpredictable ground for cultivation .

`` This is not something where you just plant your trees and wait for your fortune to grow , '' Sanford said as Tom trotted behind him .

Truffles are a funny fungus ; they grow underground , typically among hazelnut and oak trees , and keep most of their secrets there with them . There is a primitive understanding of the climactic and soil conditions required for the fungus to flourish , but cultivation methods are far from foolproof . Stateside , those practices are in their infancy .

Chefs such as Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson of Frasca Food & Wine in Boulder , Colorado , certainly would n't mind sourcing truffles closer to home . He hosts an annual truffle dinner series and features them prominently in dishes when in season .

Every year , he buys domestic truffles from budding regions like the Pacific Northwest , but the quality is n't as reliable as he 'd like it to be .

`` We 're counting down the minutes , '' he said with a hopeful tone . `` Once it clicks , whether it 's Blackberry or someone else , once there 's a tipping point , it will really blow up . ''

Enthusiasts describe the truffle 's olfactory Siren song , which is part of its allure , as `` dank , '' `` earthy , '' `` musky , '' `` pungent '' -- the gist is its aroma and taste are unparalleled . `` It transforms an otherwise ordinary dish into something very extraordinary , '' Sanford said .

Different types of truffles are found all over the world , but the Périgord and white variety from Alba , Italy , are the top dogs of the gastronomic set .

The elusive truffle hunt is often romanticized : Man and beast wander into the woods of southwest France with a shovel and a calling . A bird chips , a breeze flows and the storybook closes with `` happily ever after . ''

If only it were that simple .

Until recently , the black truffle had been solely imported to the United States .

Less than 100 miles away from Blackberry Farm -- in Chuckey , Tennesee , of all places -- that began to change around 2007 .

It all started with another Tom . Tom Michaels , who grew up mushroom hunting and wrote his Ph.D. dissertation at Oregon State University on black truffle cultivation , set his eyes on eastern Tennessee to try out his fungal knowhow in 1999 .

As if the truffle business does n't sound risky enough , it takes about six to 10 years for a tree with roots that have been inoculated with truffle spores to potentially produce a truffle . The season for harvesting runs three months from December to February .

`` I 'll have done everything to two trees next to each other , and one will have truffles and one wo n't , '' Michaels said .

Luckily for Michaels , something clicked .

Soon , he showed up at the kitchen of Blackberry Farm 's restaurants with his basket of epicurean delights and a brochure for Tennessee truffles , though it was only his third sale .

The first question from proprietor Sam Beall : `` How come I did n't know about this ? ''

Beall and Michaels teamed up to seed and sniff out truffles locally .

Enter the four-legged Tom , who was sourced by local breeder Hilarie Gibbs-Sykes from Italy to simplify the hunt .

Sanford , a Blackberry employee for 14-plus years who had previously run the resort 's horse program , was recruited to handle the truffle-hunting canine .

At the height of Michaels 's truffle business , Tom helped haul in 200 pounds in one season .

`` It was a thousand dollars a pound so if you do the arithmetic , that 's a good dog , '' Sanford said .

In 2009 , Michaels and his product were written up in GQ magazine , where food writer Alan Richman called it the `` hillbilly truffle . '' Two years earlier , storied New York Times food writer Molly O'Neill devoted an entire column titled `` Coveted , French , and Now in Tennessee '' to his endeavors .

If we know anything about agriculture , though , it 's that Mother Nature holds the reins .

Michaels ' hazelnut trees were hit with blight after his initial success , and he had to start over with a new blight-resistant variety .

`` You have to have a temperament that can deal with a lot of anxiety for many years , '' Michaels , 67 , said .

Last year , Michaels yielded about 60 pounds on his land and sold the majority off to hyper-local ingredient-focused chefs such as Sean Brock in Charleston , South Carolina , and Linton Hopkins in Atlanta . This year , after a series of unseasonable cold snaps , and only a few days left in the season , he has n't unearthed any truffles of sellable quality .

`` Mother nature took its course , '' Michaels said with the matter-of-factness of someone who has been here before .

Back at Blackberry Farm , Sanford 's pin that read `` Truffle Dog Trainer '' reflected the sun as he crouched beneath a tree to dig up a truffle-scented practice tube that Tom found . On the days when there is n't any luck , training is a commitment to the cause .

Blackberry found only one Périgord truffle last winter on its property .

If it seems like a wild goose chase , that 's because it is . But Tom is a Lagotto Romagnolo ; he not only enjoys the chase -- it 's in his DNA . According to the American Kennel Club , Tom 's breed is the only one recognized as a `` specialized truffle searcher . ''

`` We would n't be talking about any of this if it was n't for Tom , '' Sanford said . `` He has really put everything we 're talking about in cultivating truffles in North America on the map . ''

Working like a dog at a Long Island vineyard

Now 13 years old , Tom is passing the baton through his bloodline by breeding and sharing his skills . He and Sanford travel around the country to help train other canines in areas like Oregon with an eye on the truffle prize .

At Blackberry and every where else , they 're hoping it 's not a matter of if , but when , a consistent yield will happen .

As they say , every dog will have its day .
