-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rooting for the Seahawks or rooting for the Broncos in the Super Bowl ? Heck , we were rooting for Bruno Mars .

The Grammy-winning artist had a tough act to follow this year with his halftime show , given that last year 's star performer was Beyonce . And let 's be honest -- no one wants to have to follow Beyonce .

But we have to admit , Mars rocked the house -LRB- or rather stadium -RRB- and his obvious joy at performing for what was basically almost the entire world was pretty infectious .

For those not familiar with Mars , he 's pretty awesome . Here are just a few things to love about the guy :

1 -RRB- He was a baby Elvis

As a child growing up in Hawaii , Mars performed with his family in a Vegas-style show . Born Peter Gene Hernandez , he was only 4 years old when his family heard him belting out some Motown tunes and added him to the act , which included his father , Pete , a percussionist , and his mother , Bernadette , a singer who passed away in 2013 .

According to Mars , when he was a baby his dad wanted to call him Elvis , so at age 6 the tiny singer became one of the youngest Elvis impersonators in the world . Baby Bruno said he loved everything about his idol , including `` his lip . '' Too cute .

2 -RRB- He 's a return to the singer-songwriter

Mars does n't just belt out the tunes , Mars also writes them . While struggling to be discovered as a singer , he got his start in the industry writing and producing hit songs for other artists , including Travie McCoy 's `` Billionaire , '' Flo Rida 's hit `` Right Round , '' and K'Naan 's `` Wavin ' Flag , '' which became the theme song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup .

3 -RRB- He 's really good at impressions

His turn on `` Saturday Night Live '' may not have gotten as much attention as , say , Justin Timberlake 's , but there was no denying Mars was out of this world when he portrayed an intern at Pandora who has to imitate several artists -- including Green Day , Michael Jackson , Steven Tyler and Justin Bieber -- when the power goes out .

Not only was it hilarious , but his version of Bieber 's `` Boyfriend '' was quite possibly better than the original .

4 -RRB- He represents for the vertically challenged guys

He 's a whole lot of talent packed into a little frame . Mars is reportedly 5-foot-5 .

5 -RRB- He can always find the bright spot -- even when being arrested

How can we forget that famous mug shot with him grinning when he was arrested for alleged drug possession ? Mars later explained the smile by laughingly saying `` I have no idea -LRB- why he smiled -RRB- . It was a picture . ''

6 -RRB- He really is as cute as a Monchhichi

We hooted when fans started pointing out the cropped-haired resemblance to the Monchhichi doll , made popular in the 1980s . But there is no denying either the similarity or the utter cuteness of both .

7 -RRB- He 's a supportive brother

While his star has ascended , there are others in his family who are waiting in the wings to find fame . Four of his sisters have formed a singing group called The Lylas , and last year they launched a reality show on the WE network . While he did n't appear in the first season , his sisters said he offers plenty of advice -- even though when he does , `` We pretty much ignore it , '' they have said .

They may want to start listening .
