-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It might be summer , but Bill Cosby has sweaters on his mind .

The comedian , best known for playing Dr. Cliff Huxtable in NBC 's groundbreaking hit , `` The Cosby Show , '' is asking fans to vote for their favorite eclectic sweater among those he wore .

As of Wednesday , an argyle sweater with track runners across the front leads the poll on BillCosby.com . Sweaters compete in categories including `` The Crew , `` The Sweat , '' and `` The Fleecy , '' each one vying to be `` The Champion Stitch . ''

Voting begins again on July 12 . After voting , fans will automatically be entered into a drawing to receive an autographed book by the 75-year-old comedian .

Cosby sweaters have become a cultural phenomenon since Cosby first began wearing them in the 1980s . Social media sites , ugly sweater parties , fashion designers and even pop indie artists have celebrated iconic Cosby-sweater look .

Several fans said on Twitter of the tournament , `` Easily the best thing I 've seen online today . ''

Cosby sweaters have been the source of controversy , too . In March , Kiley Kmiec , co-founder of the website Cosbysweaters.com , received a cease and desist from Cosby 's legal representatives , who alleged the site was a violation of his intellectual property , Gawker reported . The site did n't have anything to do with Cosby 's sweaters , it was just a funny name , said Kmiec , who complied and changed the name of the website to nextimpulsesports.com .

Representatives for Cosby did not respond to requests for comment .

Dutch designer Koos van den Akker , forever linked by his 1980s designs to the Cosby sweater phenomenon , told Fashionista.com that he created the sweaters by simply throwing fabrics together .

`` It is all pieces of fabric put together , collaged , totally free-form on a shape that is basically a huge T-shirt , and it was always different , '' he said . `` But he liked it , and it gave him a certain style . ''

If you ca n't get enough of the argyles , cashmere and cardigans , a separate Tumblr , The Cosby Sweater Project , features illustrations that break down all of Cosby 's wacky designs . Creator Kelly Tucker was drawn to the brightly colored patterns of the sweaters featured on the show .

Tucker is also ahead of the game in the voting polls .

`` I have been voting since the beginning , though , it 's been really hard for me to choose just one . ''
