Seoul , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Chinese passenger jet with more than 200 people on board flew through the trajectory of a North Korean rocket that had been fired minutes earlier , the South Korean government said .

North Korea fired the rocket Tuesday at 4:17 p.m. without giving any navigational warning , Kim Min-Seok , a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry , said Wednesday .

Seven minutes later , a China Southern Airlines plane carrying 220 passengers from Japan 's Narita airport to Shenyang in China passed through the rocket 's trajectory , he said .

`` It was a very dangerous situation , '' Kim said during a news briefing . `` North Korea 's provocative actions violate the international navigation laws and pose a great threat to the safety of civilians . ''

South Korea has informed Chinese authorities about what happened , the Defense Ministry said .

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman , Qin Gang , said Thursday that the plane flew through North Korean airspace `` normally on that day without incident . ''

`` When relevant countries conduct military training or exercises , they should abide by international custom to take measures that would ensure the safety of civil aircraft or ships passing through their airspace or territorial water , '' Qin said .

He said that China attaches a great deal of importance to the safety of its civil aircraft and would `` seek verification from relevant parties and express necessary concern from our side . ''

Officials from China Southern Airlines did n't respond to calls seeking comment Thursday .

The rocket in question was one of seven fired Tuesday by North Korea into the sea off its east coast , according to South Korean authorities .

Given the speeds the plane and rocket were traveling at , the seven-minute gap means there was still `` quite a big distance '' between them , said Greg Waldron , Asia managing editor at Flightglobal , an aviation and aerospace website .

`` Although the chances of hitting the aircraft were extremely low , akin to hitting a bullet with a bullet , there is absolutely no need to endanger civilians , however remote the danger may be , '' he said .

North Korea defends launches

North Korea on Wednesday defended the series of short-range missile and rocket launches it has carried out in recent weeks .

`` It is justifiable self-defense behavior for us to conduct these military exercises in order to preserve peace in the region and to protect the safety of our people and our country , '' the North 's Korean People 's Army said in a statement carried by state media .

The military 's statement did n't make any mention of South Korea 's comments about the Chinese plane , but it said its recent launches had n't affected `` international navigational order . ''

The North 's launches have taken place as U.S. and South Korean troops conduct annual military exercises in the region . The large-scale drills anger North Korea , which says it views them as a rehearsal for an invasion .

The North has fired missiles or rockets into the sea on several occasions between February 21 and Tuesday , according to the South Korean government . Seoul says some of the ballistic missiles are Scud class with a long enough range to cover the entire Korean Peninsula .

North Korea on Wednesday acknowledged that it had conducted `` rocket launch training '' over that period .

Who 's provoking whom ?

South Korea has said the launches -- short-range and aimed in a northeasterly direction out to sea -- are intentional provocations .

The U.S. State Department said Monday that launches of the Scuds violate U.N. Security Council resolutions .

`` We urge North Korea to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions , and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments , '' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said .

Those comments appeared to have irritated North Korea 's military .

`` The U.S. and its supporters are calling our actions provocation , but they should not talk about provocation when they do n't know what provocation is , '' the North 's military statement said . `` Provocation is when somebody has intent to hurt somebody else , but what we are doing is to protect ourselves , our country , our land , our people . ''

The U.S.-South Korean military exercises , on the other hand , are provocative , North Korea said : `` It 's a reckless American way of provocation and they 're doing all this on somebody else 's land . ''

It threatened the possibility of the launch of a more powerful rocket .

Pyongyang had previously called for the cancellation of the joint exercises , a request dismissed by Washington and Seoul .

North Korea launches missiles into sea

Calmer than last year

The North 's verbal attack Wednesday did n't reach the ominous levels of its saber rattling this time last year , which included threats of preemptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea .

`` Unannounced missile tests are not a good thing , but their political and military significance depends on context , '' Stephan Haggard , a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics , wrote in a blog post Tuesday .

North Korea conducted or threatened test launches during a similar period last year , soon after it had drawn international condemnation for launching a long-range rocket and carrying out its third nuclear test .

`` This year , the political setting is less confrontational , '' wrote Haggard , who is also a professor at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at the University of California , San Diego .

Despite the current military drills , ties between North and South Korea have improved slightly in recent months . Over several days last month , the two countries held reunions of families separated for decades by the Korean War -- the first such meetings since 2010 .

South Korea on Wednesday said it was proposing new talks between the two sides next week to discuss the possibility of further reunions . But North Korea rejected the proposal , the South Korean Unification Ministry said Thursday .

Compared with last year , North Korea is being `` remarkably quiet , '' said Andrei Lankov , a professor of history at Kookmin University in Seoul .

`` They had to do something because it would be politically impossible to do nothing during the joint exercises , especially after they made so much noise about it , '' Lankov said . `` But they act with remarkable restraint . ''
