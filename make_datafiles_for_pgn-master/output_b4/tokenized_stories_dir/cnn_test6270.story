-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A blast from the steam whistle on a cherry-red locomotive sends a gathering of locals on a platform scuttling with delight in the town of Durán , Ecuador .

It 's a sound many in this town on the tropical Pacific plain have n't heard in years .

Some never have .

A restored , century-old steam locomotive grinds slowly out from its rail shed .

Vapor from its smokestack hangs in the humid air surrounding Durán Station .

In a few days , that vapor will crystallize in the freezing temperatures of the Ecuadorian Andes as the throwback Tren Crucero threads its way past giant snow-capped peaks into the realm of condors , volcanoes and Andean legend .

Great steam train revived

Trains in Ecuador have been virtually moribund since the late 1990s .

`` Strong winter rains of El Niño in 1982 destroyed a stretch of the railroad between Huigra and Bucay , '' says Slav Ivanov of Ferrocariles del Ecuador , the train 's operators . `` Further damage occurred during El Niño floods during the 1990s . ''

By 2008 , only about 10 % of the Ecuadorian train network was operational .

Since then , the Ecuadorean government has spent some $ 280 million revamping the national railway .

The flagship of the railway 's renaissance is Tren Crucero , a revamped luxury steam train operating a new cross-Andean service between Guayaquil and the capital of Quito -LRB- at 2,849 meters the highest capital city in the world -RRB- .

Tren Crucero -- literally `` cruise train '' -- follows a 453-kilometer -LRB- 282 mile -RRB- narrow-gauge line originally constructed between 1897 and 1908 along Ecuador 's Andean spine .

The railway was built to connect Ecuador 's two major cities : Quito in the Andes and Guayaquil along the Pacific .

Now as then , it 's one of the most thrilling railway journeys in the world .

Today 's luxurious four-day , three-night journey targets foreign tourists and affluent Ecuadorians .

Tickets cost $ 1,200 for adults -LRB- $ 952 for children -RRB- and include all hotels and excursions en route .

The train 's newly purchased carriages , built in Madrid , are pulled by restored steam locomotives .

The oldest dates to 1900 and was engineered by American manufacturer Baldwin of Pennsylvania .

One of the locomotive 's engineers is 52-year-old Edgar Garces , a 28-year employee with Ecuador 's national railway company .

`` I did n't think I 'd see the cross-Andean train running again in my lifetime , '' he says .

Few others did .

Tourism revamps trains , communities

Ecuador 's government wants Tren Crucero to boost economically depressed communities along its route through tourism .

From Guayaquil into the Guayas coastal plain , abandoned settlements such as Casiguana testify to the economic malaise .

This former orange-growing village was deserted when the railway 's demise severed its trade link to Guayaquil .

Further up the line , in Yaguachi , 75-year-old Alejandro Diaz-Lopez waits track-side for Tren Crucero , plucking his guitar and singing ballads about the train .

`` I sing a song for the train ; for the president ; for the tourists who now bring our community money , '' he says .

Tren Crucero 's most exhilarating section is a series of precipitous switchbacks that enable the train to ascend 2,945 meters -LRB- 9,662 feet -RRB- in just 56 kilometers -LRB- 34 miles -RRB- around a mountainside called the Devil 's Nose .

By 1908 , this hazardous section had taken four years to build and contributed to more than 4,000 deaths among workers , including 2,730 Jamaican laborers .

At Alausi , a town of largely Quechua indigenous inhabitants , 30-year-old Rosita Logrono sells beautiful hand-knitted llama wool garments at the station 's newly created souvenir bazaar .

`` Before the railway returned I only had part-time work and could n't send my children to school , '' she says . `` Since the trains returned life is much better . ''

Avenue of the Volcanoes is highlight

The journey to Quito passes 10 volcanoes along the so-called Avenue of Volcanoes .

The highest point -LRB- 3,609 meters/11 ,480 feet -RRB- comes on day three at Urbina , where a new visitor 's center has been built .

Here , the last iceman of Chimborazo greets passengers .

Balthasar Uscha , 69 , has cut ice from Chimborazo volcano 's flanks for 50 years ; at 6,310 meters -LRB- 20,100 feet -RRB- Chimborazo is Ecuador 's highest mountain .

Taking into account the planet 's equatorial bulge , Chimborazo 's summit is further from the Earth 's core than Everest .

Uscha 's glacial ice once chilled the drinks of coastal dwellers .

But refrigeration has put the ice cutters out of business .

He says he represents the last survivor of his profession .

Last stop , but not the end of the line

Tren Crucero passengers disembark each night and stay in local hotels .

The final night 's accommodation is La Cienaga , a glorious Spanish hacienda built 1695 .

The great naturalist , Alexander von Humboldt , who stayed here 1802 , coined the term `` Avenue of Volcanoes . ''

The hacienda is located within view of snow-capped Cotopaxi ; at 5,879 meters -LRB- 19,300 feet -RRB- , it 's one of the highest active volcanoes in the world .

The final day begins at Latacunga .

The city has been destroyed on three occasions by eruptions from Cotopaxi , which historically erupts about every century .

Now overdue , the last eruption to destroy Latacunga was in 1904 .

Thoughts of such calamities , however , are far away .

As the train rumbles into its last stop at Quito , only the bright sun of restoration shines on the rails and the faces of disembarking passengers , thrilled to have completed one of the great -- and largely undiscovered -- journeys in the world .

The 280-mile journey from Quito to Guayaquil takes four days and three nights -LRB- with stops and hotels included -RRB- , crosses Ecuador 's Andes and passes from moorlands through cloud forests to tropical coastal landscapes ; $ 1,270 adults , $ 952 children .
