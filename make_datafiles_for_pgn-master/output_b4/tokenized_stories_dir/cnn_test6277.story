-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Qatari Sheikh Joann Al Thani has broken the world record paid for a yearling filly by splashing out $ 8.38 million for a daughter of 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo at the Tattersalls bloodstock auction in Newmarket , eastern England .

Galileo also sired the unbeaten Frankel , who retired last year as the world 's highest rated racehorse after 14 straight wins .

The mare , Alluring Park , is a half-sister of the 2008 Epsom Derby winner New Approach .

Sheikh Al Thani , the son of a former emir of Qatar , won Europe 's most prestigious race , the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe , Sunday with the filly Treve and will be hoping his new purchase can achieve similar success .

Nicolas de Watrigant , the agent who bought the filly on the Sheikh 's behalf , spelled out the reasons for the record breaking purchase , the most paid at auction in Europe for a horse of any age .

`` She is a magnificent specimen , '' he said . `` We bought her sister last year and we think she could be special .

`` We did n't want to miss this one -- let 's hope she is the next Treve . ''

Bidding on the filly , a sister of 2012 Epsom Oaks winner Was , was brisk with Irish owner John Magnier competing strongly for the purchase .

`` We did n't expect to pay that sort of price , but Al Shaqab Racing -LRB- Ali Thani 's operation -RRB- was keen to invest , said de Watrigant .

Treve is trained by Criquette Head-Maarek but the record breaking filly will be sent to French rival Andre Fabre for race preparation .

Trading at the famous Tattersalls October auction has been brisk all week and on the opening day Magnier purchased another Galileo sired offspring , a colt , for $ 6 million , briefly a European record for a yearling .

The prices paid fall well short of the record for a Thoroughbred horse , the $ 16 million paid for a two-year-old colt called Green Monkey at an auction in United States in 2006 .

The horse , a descendant of the famous sire Northern Dancer , suffered injuries and his racing career was limited to three starts without a victory .
