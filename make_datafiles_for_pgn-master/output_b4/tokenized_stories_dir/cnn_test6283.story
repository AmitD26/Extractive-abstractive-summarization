-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Venezuelan government detained 243 protesters in a swift , predawn operation targeting four campsites set up at public squares around Caracas , the capital .

Officials say the Thursday operation involved more than 900 members of the Venezuelan National Guard and police .

But anti-government demonstrators who witnessed the operation complained about the way it was carried out .

Pedro GÃ ³ mez , one of those staying at a campsite , told CNN en EspaÃ ± ol that `` the National Guard showed up and destroyed the campsite . They came against us in a totally violent way . ''

Venezuelan Peace and Justice Minister Miguel Rodriguez said he had no option but to deploy security forces to ensure public safety .

`` Beyond the protest movement they intended to maintain at the campsites , they had become generators of violence in those sectors of the city ; they had committed acts of terrorism , '' Rodriguez said .

In a televised conference , the minister also said security forces found illegal drugs , explosives , tear gas and weapons at the campsites belonging to many of the detained demonstrators .

Clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces have left more than 40 people dead and around 800 injured since February , according to officials . Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz said Thursday that 32 of the dead are civilians and the rest members of the National Guard and police .

The crisis is cause for concern beyond Venezuela . The United Nations human rights office is voicing concern about the way security forces cleared the protesters ' campsites at the four public squares .

Rupert Colville , spokesman for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva , called on the Venezuelan government to ensure the right of freedom of expression .

`` We unequivocally condemn all violence by all sides in Venezuela . We are particularly concerned at the reported excessive use of force by the authorities in response to protests , '' said Colville .

In Washington , senators introduced a bill to impose sanctions on Venezuelan government officials who , they claim , are guilty of human rights violations .

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio was one of those leading the charge , making serious accusations against top Venezuelan government officials .

`` There was a young man sodomized in Venezuela by government forces . There have been women that have been threatened , '' Rubio said .

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called the bill an act of aggression against Venezuela and promised a bold response , including shutting down Venezuelan consulates around the United States .

`` If we have to close down consulates , if we have to close down the embassy in order to defend Venezuela , who is going to be affected ? Huh ? Those -LSB- Venezuelans -RSB- who live in the United States , '' Maduro said at a public event broadcast live on national TV .

Venezuelan immigrants in Florida were not intimidated .

Natalia Tovar , a Venezuelan-born Miami resident , was getting ready to travel to Washington . She told CNN affiliate WSVN she was making the journey in support of the bill , which includes economic sanctions against specific Venezuelan officials .

`` Some of the other sanctions recognize Venezuela as a dictatorship , which it is , because right now we have high levels of censorship , we have scarcity , there 's a medical crisis , '' Tovar said .

Maduro says protesters are `` fascists and extreme right thugs '' who are trying to destabilize the government to promote a coup . Protesters call Maduro a dictator who has ruined the Venezuelan economy with failed socialist policies .

The attempted rape of a young student on a university campus in the southwestern city of San Cristobal galvanized students , who took to the streets to speak against crime , shortages , blackouts and a dire economic situation .
