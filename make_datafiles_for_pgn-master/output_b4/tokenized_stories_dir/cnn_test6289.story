-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With 56.4 million passengers , Frankfurt was the world 's ninth busiest airport in 2011 , according to airport trade organization , Airport Council International .

But when it comes to animal arrivals and departures , the German gateway takes top billing .

More than 100 million animals jetted in and out of Frankfurt 's Animal Lounge last year including 2000 horses , 14,000 cats and dogs , 80 million ornamental fish and 300 tons of worms .

Run by German carrier Lufthansa , animals range from domestic pets to more exotic specimens destined for zoos and animal reserves , explains Axel Heitman , director of the Animal Lounge .

`` A polar bear was on his way home from the Alps after doing some shooting for some advertising and was really gentle actually , '' Heitman said .

`` He had his owner next to him and he took the entire trailer ... and then we had him transported back to Canada . ''

The 3,750-square meter facility opened its doors in 2008 and is equipped with non-slip floors and climate-controlled chambers to help make an animal 's stay as comfortable as possible .

A team of 60 trained vets and qualified animal handlers are also on hand round the clock to monitor them when they arrive .

`` When they are in transit , for example , -LSB- the staff -RSB- would take them out of the kennels and feed them and if they are here overnight , they will walk them around the facility , '' Heitman says .

Most animals can travel in the belly of passenger planes , but Lufthansa also has a fleet of 18 freight aircraft which can accommodate all shapes and size of animal -- be it hippopotamuses en route to the Philippines from Israel or rhinos and even crocodiles .

There is no such thing as an average day , Heitman says .

`` Every day we learn new things because , as you can imagine , there is a huge variety of animals , '' he said .
