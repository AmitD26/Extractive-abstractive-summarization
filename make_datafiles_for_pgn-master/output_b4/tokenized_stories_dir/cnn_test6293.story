NEW DELHI , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A TV-size probe adorned with a painting of the Indian flag successfully rammed into the moon Friday evening as part of the country 's first unmanned lunar mission , Indian space officials said .

The spacecraft carrying India 's first lunar probe , Chandrayaan-1 , lifts off from Sriharikota .

The Moon Impact Probe detached from the unmanned lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 and made a hard landing on the lunar surface around 8:31 p.m. New Delhi time -LRB- 10:01 a.m. ET -RRB- , said the official , Srinivasa Murthy Satish .

Space official Shiv Kumar said the 34-kilogram probe hit the moon surface traveling at 1.6 kilometers per second , which is a speed of 5,760 kilometers per hour -LRB- 3,579 mph -RRB- .

Kumar said the probe transmitted sufficient signals to the mother craft before landing , but no more were expected after the impact .

A news release from the Indian Space Research Organization said , `` The probe had a hard landing on the lunar surface that terminated its functioning . '' Watch the launch of India 's first lunar mission ''

Ramachandra Rao Guruprasad , a spokesman for the Indian Space Research Organization , said the probe was not meant to be retrieved .

`` One of the objectives of this probe is to understand the moon for future soft landings , '' he said . He added that the Chandrayaan-1 was to transmit the data it recorded from the probe to the ISRO .

The Chandrayaan-1 -- Chandrayaan means `` moon craft '' in Sanskrit -- was successfully launched from southern India on October 22 and is now orbiting the moon . iReport.com : Feeling spacy ?

Its two-year mission is to take high-resolution , three-dimensional images of the moon 's surface , especially the permanently shadowed polar regions . It also will search for evidence of water or ice and attempt to identify the chemical composition of certain lunar rocks , the group said .

The craft is carrying payloads from the United States , the European Union and Bulgaria . India plans to share the data from the mission with other programs , including NASA .

The Indian space agency noted that the landing came on a historically significant day -- the birthday of late Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , who started the modern Indian space program in 1962 .

Two years ago , the European Space Agency sent the Smart-1 probe smashing into the lunar surface .
