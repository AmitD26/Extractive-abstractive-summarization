-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You can run , the saying goes .

Joseph Lewis Miller spent more than 33 years hiding , ducking police for a murder charge out of Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , according to a statement from U.S. Marshal Martin Pane .

Now 78 , Miller was arrested Monday in Mineola , Texas , where he was living under the alias Roy Eugene Eubanks and serving as a deacon at a church , the statement said . A 1981 arrest warrant charges Miller with murder , committing crimes with a firearm , being a convict in possession of a firearm and carrying a firearm without a license .

Harrisburg police accused Miller of killing Thomas Waller in a parking lot adjacent to a hotel in January 1981 .

`` The murder occurred more than three decades ago , and while this case presented us with a significant challenge it also exemplifies the dedication , thoroughness and diligence the fugitive task force has toward cold cases , '' Pane said .

This was n't the first time Miller was charged with murder .

Miller pleaded guilty to killing John H. Lumpkins in Harrisburg in 1960 , and throughout that decade , Pane said , Miller applied to have his sentence commuted , a request that was granted with lifetime state parole in 1971 .

Ten years later , Miller became a fugitive after Waller 's death . Recently , the U.S. Marshals Service developed information on a Roy Eugene Eubanks in East Texas , the Marshals Service said .

`` Working with photographs more than three decades old , Marshals believed the man named Roy Eugene Eubanks was indeed Joseph Lewis Miller , '' the statement said .

Authorities put an East Texas home under surveillance Monday and soon saw a man believed to be Miller . They arrested him without incident and recovered a firearm from the home , the statement said .

`` The individual admitted his true identity as Joseph Lewis Miller . He was married and a deacon in his local church , '' according to U.S. marshals .

Using his alias , Miller had been receiving Social Security disability benefits for more than two decades , the statement said .

He is now in custody in Wood County , Texas , where he awaits court proceedings .

`` It is my sincere hope that the victims ' family and the surviving victim can and will rest easier knowing the alleged perpetrator is now in custody , '' Pane said in the statement .
