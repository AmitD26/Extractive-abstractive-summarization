-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Polls finally closed in Egypt 's presidential election Wednesday , and workers have started to count the ballots , according to Egyptian state media .

An extra day of voting was added to boost turnout , but it may have done little , according to CNN crews who witnessed no lines at polling places throughout Cairo .

The election , initially scheduled for Monday and Tuesday , pit former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi against Hamdeen Sabahy .

The election commission extended the voting saying people living far from where they are registered need to return to vote , the state-run Middle East News Agency reported .

No numbers have been released , but the move came after TV hosts had openly criticized voters for not participating .

Both Candidates had criticized the extra day of voting and had filed complaints .

`` We strongly denounce the -LRB- election commission 's -RRB- decision to extend voting another day . Extending the voting period for no real plausible reason will open the door to possible vote violations and rigging , '' said Hussein Abdel Ghany , a top adviser to Sabahy .

Sabahy 's campaign announced Wednesday that it 's withdrawing its delegates who observe the polls because they have been arrested or assaulted :

`` In the past 48 hours we were subjected to a wide range of abuses , assaults and violations . These include preventing campaign delegates from entering the polling stations , and assaulting and arresting them , '' it said in a statement .

Egyptian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb had even declared Tuesday a public holiday `` in compliance to citizens ' wishes , '' state TV reported . The decision was thought to be a move to increase turnout .

Human Rights Watch said Egypt 's 10-month-long crackdown on the opposition undermined the fairness of the presidential elections .

`` The mass arrests of thousands of political dissidents , whether Islamist or secular , has all but shut down the political arena and stripped these elections of real meaning , '' the group 's Middle East director , Sarah Leah Whitson , said in a statement Wednesday .

The election was called because President Mohamed Morsy was removed from power in July in a popular military coup . Al-Sisi , who was army chief at the time , stepped down from his military post this year to run for president .
