NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A `` furious '' President Obama has ordered a review of the decision to fly a Boeing 747 frighteningly close to the lower Manhattan skyline , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday .

Witnesses reported seeing a plane circle over the Upper New York Bay near the Statue of Liberty .

The review will focus on `` why that decision was made and to ensure that it never happens again , '' Gibbs said . Jim Messina , a deputy chief of staff , will lead the effort .

On Tuesday , Obama told reporters , `` It was a mistake . It was something we found out about along with all of you . And it will not happen again . ''

Officials said that when Obama first found out about the incident , he was `` furious . ''

The incident has led to a large amount of criticism from New Yorkers and politicians .

After a YouTube video showed panicked New Yorkers scrambling as the plane flew frighteningly close to the lower Manhattan skyline , a former Homeland Security adviser questioned whether the man who approved the flyby should remain in his White House office .

Fran Townsend , who advised President George W. Bush for more than three years , called the move `` crass insensitivity '' in the wake of 9/11 .

`` I 'd call this felony stupidity . This is probably not the right job for Mr. Caldera to be in if he did n't understand the likely reaction of New Yorkers , of the mayor , '' Townsend said Tuesday on CNN 's `` American Morning . ''

Louis Caldera , director of the White House Military Office , quickly apologized for Monday 's incident after the planes prompted workers and residents to evacuate buildings in New York and New Jersey . Watch Townsend slam Caldera ''

`` Last week , I approved a mission over New York . I take responsibility for that decision , '' Caldera said . `` While federal authorities took the proper steps to notify state and local authorities in New York and New Jersey , it 's clear that the mission created confusion and disruption . ''

The Federal Aviation Administration said the aircraft , which functions as Air Force One when the president is aboard , was taking part in a classified , government-sanctioned photo shoot .

On Tuesday Sen. John McCain wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates saying he was `` profoundly disturbed '' by the flyover `` against the backdrop of September 11 . ''

`` The supposed mission represents a fundamentally unsound exercise in military judgment and may have constituted an inappropriate use of Department of Defense resources , '' McCain , a ranking member of the Senate 's Armed Services Committee , wrote in the letter .

He requested an investigation into the cost of the flyover .

Air Force officials estimate that the mission and the photo shoot for the 747 and an accompanying F-16 fighter jet cost $ 328,835 . But they said `` the hours would have been flown regardless , and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission . ''

An Air Force source told CNN on Tuesday that the White House Military Office planned a photo shoot over various Washington monuments next week , but the shoot has now been canceled .

An angry Mayor Michael Bloomberg said it `` defies the imagination '' that an agency would schedule the photo shoot so near the site of the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the World Trade Center .

Sen. Charles Schumer , D-New York , said the FAA 's decision to not announce the flyby `` borders on being either cruel or very , very stupid . ''

The YouTube video shows dozens of people standing in a parking lot , watching the plane approach . As it nears , they begin to run . Someone unleashes an expletive . `` Run , run ! '' says one person . `` Oh my God , '' cries another .

A 911 call released by the Hudson County Sheriff 's Department in New Jersey shows the panic caused by the plane .

`` There 's a plane falling , there is a big aircraft falling like 9/11 , '' a man says to the operator . `` Everybody is running and people are crying and panicking . ''

Two officials said the White House Military Office was trying to update its file photos of Air Force One .

Bloomberg said he was perturbed . Watch the White House apologize ''

`` I 'm annoyed -- furious is a better word -- that I was n't told , '' he said , calling the FAA 's decision to withhold details about the flight `` ridiculous '' and `` poor judgment . ''

`` Why the Defense Department wanted to do a photo op right around the site of the World Trade Center defies the imagination , '' he said . `` Had we known , I would have asked them not to . ''

Linda Garcia-Rose , a social worker who counsels post-traumatic stress disorder patients in an office three blocks from where the World Trade Center stood , called the flight an `` absolute travesty . '' Watch the White House respond to questions about the scare ''

`` There was no warning . It looked like the plane was about to come into us , '' she said . `` I 'm a therapist , and I actually had a panic attack . ''

Garcia-Rose , who works with nearly two dozen patients ages 15 to 47 , said she was inundated with phone calls from patients .

`` They 're traumatized . They 're asking ` How could this happen ? ' They 're nervous . Their anxiety levels are high , '' she said . iReport.com : Tell us what you think

Garcia-Rose said she is considering filing a class-action suit against the government for sanctioning the plane 's unannounced flight .

`` I believe the government has done something really wrong , '' she said .

Capt. Anna Carpenter of Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland said local law enforcement agencies and the FAA had been given notice of the exercise .

New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne said the department had been alerted about the flight `` with directives to local authorities not to disclose information about it . ''
