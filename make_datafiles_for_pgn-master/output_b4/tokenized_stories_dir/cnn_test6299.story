-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Health care experts recently gathered at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to discuss the public health crisis of hepatitis C , which is ravaging communities across America , and the budding hope that we may soon be able to eliminate it with a prescription medicine called Sovaldi .

Hepatitis C , a chronic , potentially fatal liver disease , afflicts more than 3 million Americans . Solving the hepatitis C epidemic is a goal we should all embrace , which is why health plans are hard at work identifying at-risk patients so they can be screened and receive necessary treatment .

Sovaldi , the brand name for sofosbuvir , holds remarkable promise . But the manufacturer of this drug , Gilead Sciences , has created an enormous obstacle that is straining our health care system : its eye-popping price .

At $ 1,000 per pill , Sovaldi costs $ 84,000 for a single course of treatment , and well over $ 100,000 when combined with other medications , as is generally the case . If every person with hepatitis C were treated with Sovaldi alone at this price , the cost would be more than $ 268 billion . For some perspective , consider that in 2012 , the United States spent $ 263 billion for all prescription drugs .

This pricing , which Gilead attempts to justify as the cost of medical advancement , will have a tsunami effect across our entire health care system . Because the cost of health insurance is fundamentally a reflection of the price of health care services , the excessive price of Sovaldi unavoidably puts upward pressure on premiums for everyone with private coverage . It will also strain state Medicaid and Department of Veterans Affairs programs .

A recent analysis found that senior citizens on Medicare Part D could see premiums as much as 8 % higher next year because of the price of this one drug . And it 's been projected that California 's Medicaid spending on Sovaldi and the accompanying drugs could potentially outpace what the state spends in a year on K-12 and secondary education combined .

High-priced drugs are not a new phenomenon . Drug makers have long used monopolies to inflate prices . But the trend with so-called specialty drugs is a game changer . Startling as the price of Sovaldi is , it 's just the canary in the coal mine .

More and more specialty drugs are coming on the market , with tremendous promise to save and improve lives but also with exorbitant price tags . Although these specialty drugs only account for 1 % of the prescription drugs in this country , they already represent 25 % of the total cost , on the way to 50 % .

Until now , policymakers and stakeholders have looked the other way as specialty drug prices have gone higher and higher . In fact , any discussion of price has been quashed as an assault on innovation .

But asking for a blank check in the name of innovation wo n't work anymore . Not when it stands in the way of solving a public health crisis . Not when it threatens state Medicaid budgets and the success of Medicare Part D , and not when the pricing threatens the very innovation that is giving so many hope .

Opinion : Hepatitis drugs save money in long run

We can not have sustainable medical innovation in America without prices that the health care system can sustain . Just think , could we have eradicated polio or smallpox if the treatments were priced like hepatitis C ?

Today 's public health challenge is to find a balance that rewards research and development and brings breakthroughs to patients , without upending family budgets , employer benefit systems and crucial public programs . That 's going to require an end to the sky 's - the-limit pricing that threatens the progress we all want .

Now is the time for stakeholders to begin the process of working together to meet this challenge .
