London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If there 's one thing you notice in the Financial Times ' sprawling office building on London 's Southwark Bridge it 's that there are newspapers ... everywhere . Piles upon piles of trademark salmon pink paper , the fruit of endless days of hard work that even the most seasoned journalists ca n't bring themselves to recycle .

They fill every gap between desks , there are stacks on the floor , and in corridors , next to the odd cursory pot plant . There 's a charm about it , that of a place with its priorities straight . Substance over style .

Editor Lionel Barber tells me that when he started the Financial Times , the newsroom was full of `` cigarette smoke and typewriters making a lot of noise . '' The typewriters are long gone and , with them , most of the noise . But , says Barber , `` there is still something special about a newsroom . ''

Twenty years ago the piles of newspapers may not have been so striking . Hard to believe now , but ft.com only launched in 1995 . This year -- 17 years later -- digital subscriptions overtook print for the first time . This has undoubtedly changed the way the operation runs .

Breaking news happens in real time , screens with 24 hour news channels hang in the newsroom , and the journalists have the concentration of greyhounds on the blocks .

Barber has an interesting view of this . `` Working for the print newspaper and for ft.com , '' he says , `` is a little like walking and chewing gum at the same time -- it is actually possible . ''

Possible , and profitable . In 2001 ft.com became one of the first online newspapers to introduce a paywall , and charge users for its content . Chief executive John Ridding says people thought they were `` a little strange , to put it politely '' , but they stuck with it , and it 's worked . The numbers are proof enough . Over 300,000 digital subscribers and sales up 7 % in the first half of this year .

And , Ridding says , there 's an `` accidental benefit '' that has transformed the business . They do n't just know how many people are reading , they know who they are and what they are reading . That `` enables us to do a much better job of developing products and services and being relevant to our readers , '' he added .

The Financial Times ' business is solid . The digital future , however , is not without collateral damage . CNN spent a day with the Financial Times in April , observing everything from the morning editorial meeting , to the evening frenzy at the east London print site .

In September , the owners of that print site , Newsfax , went into administration , and the Financial Times ' subsidiary St Clement 's Press had to step in to run the site .

Walking and chewing gum is possible , but not without risks .
