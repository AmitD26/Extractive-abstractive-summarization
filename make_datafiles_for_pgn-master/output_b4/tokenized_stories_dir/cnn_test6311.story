-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Day after day , men and women from Soweto , a township near Johannesburg , wake up at the crack of dawn to battle bumper-to-bumper traffic and cramped public transport to show up at work in time .

For Mxolishi Colossa , who works at a Johannesburg home furniture store , it 's no different . Every morning , he quietly slips out of his house at 6 a.m. and heads to the nearest main street . There , standing by a dusty road , he waits patiently for a minibus taxi to pass by and carry him to the local train station .

But it 's not just the waiting that tests Colossa 's early start to the day -- the high cost of the ride and the dangerous driving can be equally distressing .

`` All of them , same style , '' says Colossa , referring to the perilous way in which many of the taxi drivers navigate the area 's roads .

As the dawn fades away , Colossa jumps off the taxi to catch a train to Johannesburg . Fourteen stops later he pulls into the city but he still has to get another taxi to take him to the other side of Johannesburg , to Melrose Arch , the plush shopping area where he works .

He finally arrives at the store at 8.30 a.m. -- a full two-and-a-half hours after leaving his home .

`` It 's not acceptable for people to have to take multiple legs of a journey to get to work , '' says Rehana Moosajee of the Mayoral Committee for Transport in Johannesburg .

Despite some of the best roads on the continent and a number of high-profile infrastructure projects , including a high-speed train and a bus service built for the 2010 football World Cup , commuting in Johannesburg is often an arduous task for millions of people .

The slick new services often do n't connect with each other and older public transport systems , leaving poor and working-class people struggling to get to work . Last year , in IBM 's Commuter Pain Survey , Johannesburg was ranked fifth worst in terms of the amount of pain commuters suffer getting to and from work .

Moosajee admits that the current transit situation does n't cater well to the economic needs of Johannesburg , adding that the city is working to better integrate its transport system .

`` We are now trying to transform our cityscape to bring communities together , and the impact of the number of transfers that people have to do means that people are spending less quality time with their family , that they 're spending more and more time in transit , affecting productivity , affecting the economy , '' she says .

For Colossa , the grind of commuting means he has to dedicate five hours a day to travel to and from work . The fragmented journey also means that he has to spend a third of his salary on public transport , with the remainder spent on food , bills and rent .

Colossa 's story is echoed not only around Johannesburg but in many other economic hubs across Africa .

In Nairobi , home to three million people , citizens face the fourth most painful commute , according to IBM 's survey . Two out of three people in Kenya 's capital say that congestion has a negative impact on their work , family and health , IBM reports .

But besides nerves and frustration , traffic jams in Nairobi cost the economy over 50 million Kenyan shillings -LRB- $ 600,000 -RRB- per day in lost productivity , fuel consumption and pollution , according to official figures .

Andre Dzikus , of U.N. Habitat , says the organization is helping Kenya to tackle some of the challenges brought about by population growth , urbanization and a rapid increase in motor-vehicle ownership . Its `` Promoting Sustainable Transport Solutions for East African Cities '' project aims to reduce growth in private motor vehicles , thus reducing traffic congestion and greenhouse-gas emissions .

In Lagos , one of the world 's megacities , getting to work often requires strong nerves . Snail-paced traffic and high costs test commuters ' endurance as millions of people cram the streets of Nigeria 's economic nerve center on a daily basis .

Commuters often depend on a ragtag array of service providers , such as minibus operators , who can charge whatever prices they want .

`` They might charge $ 1 in the morning for one trip one way and by afternoon they can go to $ 3 , '' says Dayo Mobereola , managing director of the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority , noting that commuters spend on average 40 % of their income on transportation .

Mobereola says that in recent years the city has taken a series of steps to improve its public transportation offering , including the launch of a regulated bus rapid-transit system in 2008 .

More recently , it has begun work to develop a reliable and affordable urban rail system . Two railway lines are already under development as the ambitious project , which will eventually consist of seven lines , aims to relieve Lagos of chronic gridlock and unregulated services .

`` The people of Lagos are yearning for regulated means of transportation , '' says Mobereola .

Back in Johannesburg , Colossa is about to begin his journey back to Soweto . Two and a half hours later he 'll be home -- before doing it all again in the morning .
