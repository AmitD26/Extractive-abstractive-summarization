-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Some hobbies take talent , others do n't , but the real skill is turning your weird past-time into an international event . Whether one 's passion is to sculpt masterpieces out of sand or charge at Dapper Dans with an umbrella , somewhere , there 's a festival dedicated to honing those skills .

Few hobbies invite ridicule like air guitar . Yet the Air Guitar World Championships in Oulu , Finland , regularly attracts over 10,000 `` airheads '' -LRB- this year 's event , which took place last week , was no exception -RRB- . Though the judges seem to take the sport seriously , judging contestants on their technical skills , stage presence and `` airiness , '' the festival started as a bit of a lark .

`` We started out in 1996 to promote the Music Video Festival . It was a half joke , '' says Hanna Jakku , the event 's co-founder . Since those early days , however , the championship has matured . Contrary to popular opinion , says Jakku , air guitar takes talent .

`` When it comes to competitive playing , the standard is quite high . It 's a contest of showmanship . It 's very well timed and choreographed and there 's drama to each performance . Think of it as a combination of stand-up comedy and rock opera , '' she says .

True aficionados can even earn a little extra cash . Last year 's winner , Justin `` Nordic Thunder '' Howard , scored a contract with soft drink brand Dr. Pepper and , like many of his contemporaries , routinely works the festival circuit .

The strange hobby capital of the world , however , is Llanwrtyd Wells , Wales . The tiny town hosts the Man versus Horse Challenge , the Welsh Open Stoneskimming Championships and the ever-popular World Bogsnorkelling Championships , the latter of which was held on August 25 .

`` It came about through drunken discussion in a local pub with a man who was trying to bring in more business to the village , '' explains Bernice Benton , from Llanwrtyd Tourism , of the bogsnorkelling contest , which last year attracted 177 entrants . The event requires snorkeled and finned-participants to swim two laps in a 180-foot peat bog .

`` It 's muddy , so it 's dark and you ca n't see , and a lot of people are n't used to breathing through a snorkel . Generally , it 's pretty cold , and you also have to deal with the leeches and water scorpions , '' says Benton .

Contestants do n't do it for the money -LRB- all proceeds go to charity -RRB- , as much as the glory . According to Benton , some train quite hard for the event , and go as far as to snorkel blindfolded for practice .

Even those competitions that are today taken in earnest have some pretty arbitrary origins . In 1933 , Ohio-based photographer Myron Scott came across a group of boys racing in homemade vehicles , and decided to stage an impromptu race . The event has since morphed into one of most popular events on the DIY calendar , the All-American Soap Box Derby , in which kids and teenagers race homemade cars .

Despite its name , the event attracts an international crowd , and many of the pre-adult contestants have grown up to become famous racers and engineers .

`` Soap Box Derby racing teaches you not only the racing , but how to build a car , and what goes into making it fast , '' says Bobby Dinkins , the marketing director for the event .

Contestants range in age from 7 to 17 , and all have to qualify either by winning their local race , or racking up enough points in a rally race . As scholarships make up the winning booty , there 's a lot at stake for potential winners . As a result , Dinkins notes , many practice pretty hard .

`` These kids are racing all year long to qualify , '' he says .

In Baltimore , Maryland , children and adults alike take part in a more whimsical dash : the Kinetic Sculpture Race . The race is composed of human-powered works of art designed to travel over land , mud and water -LRB- Fred Flintstone 's car would qualify -RRB- . Sculptures resemble anything and everything , from flying pigs to fluffy pink dogs .

Prizes are awarded for conking out first , for maintaining middle ground , and for keeping all feet off the floor .

`` We give out almost as many awards as there are vehicles , '' explains Rebecca Alban Hoffberger , founder of the American Visionary Art Museum , which hosts the event .

The race incorporates 15 miles of downtown Baltimore and the harbor and , if not Baltimore 's biggest sporting event , it is certainly its wackiest . Volunteers dressed as chickens help guide vehicles along the right path , while bearded doctors in nursing uniforms are on standby should any injuries occur .

`` So much of art is self-involved , '' explains Hoffberger . `` This is a masterpiece of how to bring joy to an entire city . ''
