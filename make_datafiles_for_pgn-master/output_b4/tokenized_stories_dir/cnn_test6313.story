Kathmandu , Nepal -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An 80-year-old Japanese man on Thursday became the oldest person to reach the top of Mt. Everest , officials said .

Yuichiro Miura reached the top of Everest Thursday morning with his physician son Gota , mountaineering official Gyanendra Shrestha said from the base of Everest .

Miura 's achievement eclipses that of a Nepali man who climbed Everest at age 76 in 2008 .

The oldest woman to climb Everest is also a Japanese . She was 73 when she reached the top last year .

Miura broke his hip in an accident two years ago , and he underwent heart surgery in January .

`` I am still healthy and strong . I think I have a good chance to reach the summit of Everest , '' he said via phone earlier this month .

To prepare , Miura walked three times a week with loads of 25 to 30 kilograms -LRB- 55 to 66 lbs -RRB- on his back .

He reached the top of the 8,848-meter -LRB- 29,035-foot -RRB- peak twice before : in 2003 at age 70 , and in 2008 at age 75 .

`` I have a dream to climb Everest at this age , '' he said . `` If you have a dream , never give up . Dreams come true . ''

This year marks the 60th anniversary of the first expedition to reach the summit of Everest : Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay made it to the top of the mountain on May 29 , 1953 .

Earlier this month , a 27-year-old graphic designer has made history by becoming the first Saudi woman to conquer the mount .
