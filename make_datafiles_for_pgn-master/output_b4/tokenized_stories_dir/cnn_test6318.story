-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A year ago , Sony and Microsoft were kicking off their new next-generation video game consoles at the Electronic Entertainment Expo -LRB- E3 -RRB- in Los Angeles , California . This year , the event will be all about the games , as developers show what they can do with that new technology .

Some game companies have already shown glimpses of the power of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 with recent releases like `` InFamous : Second Son , '' `` Titanfall , '' and `` Watch _ Dogs . '' E3 2014 promises to showcase even more creativity , flair , and dynamic gameplay with a look at upcoming titles arriving in the next year and beyond .

Even Nintendo will be making a splash with its eye toward boosting sales of its own `` next-gen '' console , the Wii U . The company chose not to hold a traditional press conference in 2013 , and has opted again for a digital event and smaller , more intimate meetings .

But the real question for the expo is , how many of these games will people actually get to play ?

Sony

With Sony leading the sales pack with the introduction of its PlayStation 4 console , they will be looking to hold their lead and offer more titles to keep fans interested . They also will be showing off more about their latest hardware project , Morpheus -- a virtual reality headset that undoubtedly will be integrated into some of their own titles .

Expect to see more about popular titles like `` The Order : 1886 '' or `` Uncharted 4 , '' two games that have been teased quite a bit over the months . It is also likely that fans will get glimpses of games like `` Driveclub '' and a possible new title for the `` God of War '' franchise .

While Sony has n't pushed as much on the music and movie front as their competition , it would be a surprise if PlayStation Now , their new streaming service , did n't get prominently mentioned . With a new PS4 console/PS Vita handheld console bundle recently announced , cross-play and Vita titles will likely be part of every demonstration .

Microsoft

The Redmond , Washington , company has to feel like it has been playing catch-up for the past year . Fan reaction to some of its Xbox One policies and hardware forced Microsoft into backtracking on many of its E3 statements from last year .

Unbundling the Kinect hands-free controller from the console , along with a price cut , garnered mixed reaction from the public , so expect Microsoft to explain why it was a good idea and how it will influence the user experience .

A `` Halo 5 : Guardians '' presentation will surely get everyone 's blood pumping and a new title , `` Sunset Overdrive , '' should excite fans with its colorful and quirky gameplay .

Will there be more exclusive title announcements ? Likely , but how many will move consoles is the real question . Microsoft has been aggressive in pushing the Xbox One as an all-in-one entertainment center , so do n't be surprised by more content partnerships to be showcased .

Nintendo

Nintendo 's struggles with the Wii U have been well documented . The company just ca n't seem to explain to customers why the 2012 console offers a different entertainment experience and is feeling financial pressure to do something big .

The company is banking on new games to help get more Wii U 's into homes . `` Mario Kart 8 '' and a new `` Super Smash Bros. '' game will help . There are also rumors of a new `` Zelda '' game for the Wii U and a major new title for the handheld 3DS console .

Hopefully , they will also give more details about a series of figurine-based games , similar to `` Disney Infinity '' or `` Skylanders . '' Called the Nintendo Figurine Platform , a demonstration in May showed a Mario figurine being used with different games on the same platform . Can you imagine the demand for Mario-based figurines ?

PCs

Nearly every new game that comes out for the consoles also comes out for the home computer -LRB- well , except for Nintendo -RRB- . The popularity of `` World of Warcraft , '' `` Neverwinter , '' and other massive multiplayer online games has opened up the field for new MMOs to try their hand .

With the new games , companies are going to be showing off new bells and whistles for computer gamers -- specialized keyboards and mice , chat headsets , and high-powered gaming laptops and towers . It 's a good bet a few booths on the show floor will be packed with the latest and greatest hardware for people who game on PCs .

More games

Third-party game developers will also be showcasing their talent with promises for this year and next .

Warner Bros. . Entertainment just announced a new `` Mortal Kombat X '' title , which should get some play at E3 , as well as more about `` Batman : Arkham Knight . '' Both of those games are likely to be available in 2015 .

Electronic Arts plans on a mix of updates to classic franchises , like `` Madden , '' `` FIFA , '' and `` The Sims , '' while planting the early seeds for new , original projects set to blossom over the next few years . They will also announce a game from Criterion Games that is NOT another `` Need For Speed '' game , but something brand new .

Ubisoft will be showing off a new `` Assassin 's Creed Unity '' game they said was built specifically for the next-gen consoles . They also announced `` The Division , '' an open-world , role-playing game set in the heart of New York City , and `` Far Cry 4 , '' taking the action to the Himalayas .

`` Civilization : Beyond Earth '' from 2KGames , `` The Evil Within '' and `` Battlecry '' from Bethesda Softworks , and `` Destiny , '' a Bungie-produced title from Activision are all expected to be shown with more video , more explosions , and more excitement for the fans . Plenty of other third-party developers will be announcing titles throughout the three-day event .

What else ?

Virtual reality gaming is likely to be on the rise with the strides Oculus Rift has made toward a home headset in the past two years . Some companies are looking to be the first to produce a blockbuster hit for the VR headset .

Mobile gaming , both on its own and as a companion to console gaming , will get more attention this year as many games produce one-off titles for smartphones or incorporate gameplay into tablets . It will also be curious to see how much social-platform gaming is featured this year .

Regardless of what is predicted , expected , or promised , E3 always manages to have a few surprises and twists just to keep everything interesting .

What do you hope to see revealed at E3 this year ?
