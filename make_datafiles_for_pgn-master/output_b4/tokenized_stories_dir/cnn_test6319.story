-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Filming for the next `` Star Wars '' movie will take a break next month to give Harrison Ford 's broken leg time to heal , producers said Monday .

Two `` young aspiring actors '' will join the cast as the result of a search `` high and low for young and undiscovered talent , '' the filmmakers also announced .

`` Star Wars : Episode VII '' is still on a path to land in theaters on December 18 , 2015 .

`` In August , the team will take a brief two-week hiatus while adjustments to the current production schedule are made as actor Harrison Ford recovers from a leg injury , '' producers said in a note to fans on their official website . `` Harrison is doing well and is looking forward to returning to the set soon . ''

Harrison Ford broke leg in ` Star Wars ' set mishap , publicist says

Ford , who is reprising the Han Solo role that brought him fame in the first `` Star Wars '' in 1977 , broke his left leg in an on-set accident at London 's Pinewood Studios on June 12 , according to his publicist . The 71-year-old actor underwent surgery and began rehab on his leg last month , spokeswoman Ina Treciokas said in a statement to CNN .

The two new faces Ford will see when he returns to the production are American actress Crystal Clarke and British actor Pip Andersen . They were chosen through an open casting call by Lucasfilm and Disney executives starting seven months ago , according to a statement .

Producers considered 37,000 hopefuls who showed up in 11 U.S. and British cities , and another 30,000 who submitted online applications , they said .

`` The Star Wars universe has always been about discovering and nurturing young talent and in casting Episode VII we wanted to remain absolutely faithful to this tradition , '' Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said in the announcement . `` We are delighted that so many travelled to see us at the open casting calls and that we have been able to make Crystal and Pip a part of the film . ''

Clarke was born in Belleville , New Jersey , but later moved to Nashville , according to her biography on the Internet Movie Database . The bio and producers ' announcement did not list her age , but she will graduate this year from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow , her bio said .

Her professional acting resume is short . Clarke 's first feature film role will not hit theaters until next year , when she acts opposite Pierce Brosnan and William Hurt in `` The Moon and the Sun . ''

Pip Andersen 's budding career is built on his skills as `` a practitioner of parkour , a discipline that involves propelling oneself through any given environment with incredible grace and agility , '' the release said . He is best known for using his parkour skills in a Spider-Man ad for Sony , the producers said .
