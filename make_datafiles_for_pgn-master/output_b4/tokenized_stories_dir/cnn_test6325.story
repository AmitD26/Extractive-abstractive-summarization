-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Amazon 's new Fire Phone is n't a phone . It 's a shopping mall . Not that boring shopping mall slowly dying on the edges of suburban America , but a gorgeous mall with infinite selection and endless opportunities for entertainment , from books to movies and everything in between .

The price starts at $ 199 with a two-year contract , or $ 649 without a contract . The Fire Phone may well give its competitors a run for the money .

Malls are social spaces , and so is Fire Phone . Its five cameras and assorted sensors are exactly what is needed to create immersive interactive experience . And what better thing to socialize around than using it to identify new products , deals and scoops ? The only piece missing from Amazon 's new mall is food , but you can be sure that soon , there will be an Amazon Fresh truck waiting around the corner or an Amazon aerial drone hovering just over the horizon ready to deliver your order .

Amazon is pretty late to the mobile space , and if Fire Phone was just another well-designed mobile device , it would n't have a prayer of catching up to Apple or Google . But Amazon is n't playing catch-up , it 's changing the game by shifting the focus of mobile devices to what it does best : Satisfying our seemingly endless desire to buy stuff .

Google is still struggling with creating a shopping strategy for physical products , and Apple is little more than an elegant specialty store in cyberspace . In contrast , Amazon pioneered online shopping and has reinvented the shopping experience time and again . Fire Phone is just the latest chapter in that long history .

A crucial feature in the Fire Phone is Amazon 's Firefly technology , which turns the phone into a one-touch information source for anything that can be viewed with the phone 's many cameras . You see a cool jacket on an actor in a movie -- capture the image and Amazon will find it for sale . If you hear a song you like , grab a sample and Amazon will tell you the artist and offer to sell you a copy .

Or , next time you are at your favorite suburban mall , snap a picture of a product in a physical store and Amazon will offer it to you for less . This may be the most diabolically disruptive aspect of the Fire Phone .

While Apple and other companies are building out physical stores at great cost as part of their shopping strategy , Firefly allows Amazon to invade every store in every mall on the planet and turn it into a de facto showroom for Amazon .

This will drive retailers crazy . Expect to hear much about how Fire Phone is going to kill physical shopping in the days to come . I would n't be surprised if some stores attempt to ban Fire Phone entirely .

Once upon a time shopping was mainly `` bricks-and-mortar : '' an exclusively physical retail experience . After Amazon appeared on the Web , shopping evolved to `` bricks-and-clicks : '' an expanded shopping reality that provided shoppers the option of visiting either a physical space or a virtual space . Doomsayers proclaimed the end of physical stores , but while online shopping has been profoundly disruptive , the physical shopping experience evolved to coexist with shopping in cyberspace .

We are now moving from `` bricks-and-clicks '' to `` bricks-in-clicks : '' a world where the line between physical and virtual not only blurs , but becomes a two-way conversation .

Getting competitive pricing with your phone camera is just the start . The next phase will be `` augmented reality '' shopping . Want to see if that elegant lounge chair really fits in your living room ? Select your chair , hit a button and it appears on your screen as if it were actually in your room . You can even walk around the chair , viewing it from multiple perspectives . Sounds futuristic , but iPhone and Android users can experience this today with apps like Sayduck . With five cameras and multiple sensors , Fire Phone will be able to do this with even greater fidelity .

Amazon 's Fire Phone is being released at a moment when we are seeing the rapid growth of the so-called `` Internet of Things , '' where billions of physical objects from toothbrushes to satellite sensors are being connected to the Internet .

Before long , shoppers wandering into a physical store wo n't use their phones to merely take a picture of an object ; they will have a phone-mediated conversation with that object . And when that happens , Jeff Bezos will probably reinvent things again .
