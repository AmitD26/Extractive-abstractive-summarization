-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Written on every page of Israel 's history , in ink and in blood , is the name Ariel Sharon . His life , which ended today after an eight-year coma , deeply influenced Israel 's past . But even in death , Sharon will influence the future , as Israelis consider their options if the two-state solution fails .

During Israel 's 1948 War of Independence , the handsome blond officer , known as `` Arik , '' was shot and left for dead . He recovered and founded Israel 's first commando unit , which conducted raids beyond Israel 's borders . In the 1956 Sinai campaign , he led Israel 's legendary paratroopers into clashes behind enemy lines .

A successful general in the 1967 Six Day War , he achieved world fame six years later by spurring Israeli troops across the Suez Canal to encircle the Egyptian army in the Yom Kippur War . The image of Sharon , still blond but now stout , his head wrapped in a bloodied bandage , became iconic . His heroism was uniquely Israeli , built by breaking rules as well as orders , and by surrounding himself with controversy and myth .

But Sharon 's real legacy was made in politics . Here , too , he ignored the norms and forged his own often-tortuous path . He traversed the political spectrum , from the labor farm in which he grew up to the rightist Likud that he established with Menachem Begin . As agriculture minister in the late 1970s , he constructed dozens of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza , gaining a reputation as an opponent of peace .

But then , as defense minister , he evicted thousands of Israelis from settlements in Sinai to fulfill Israel 's treaty with Egypt . In 1982 , Sharon masterminded the Israeli invasion of Lebanon , by some accounts deceiving Prime Minister Begin , and besieged Beirut . An Israeli investigation implicated Sharon in the massacre of 800 Palestinian civilians by Lebanese militiamen and compelled him to resign .

I saw the two sides of Sharon , the bullheaded warrior and man of the people . I saw how Israelis were alternately repelled and captivated by him . I was stationed with the Israeli paratroopers in Beirut when we learned that Sharon wanted to visit the troops . Furious over what they regarded as a reckless war , my buddies indicated that the defense minister was unwelcome . Sharon never arrived .

But weeks later , while hosting Sharon at a base inside Israel , I watched amazed as he left the table to chat with the cook , about whom he remembered every detail .

Known even in Hebrew as the Bulldozer â € '' as much for perseverance as girth â € '' Sharon in 2000 burst into the political forefront . The Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had rejected Israel 's offer of independence in all of Gaza , most of the West Bank and half of Jerusalem , and blamed Sharon 's visit to the Temple Mount for igniting the Second Intifada .

Through the havoc wrought by Palestinian suicide bombers , Sharon pressed into the prime minister 's office with Labor 's Shimon Peres as his deputy . The once-impetuous soldier became the prudent statesman as Sharon waited through months of bombings before finally striking back . In April 2002 , he ordered Israeli forces to eradicate terror and restore peace to Israeli neighborhoods .

Then Sharon , with characteristic audacity , pivoted toward peace . But failing to reach an agreement with the Palestinians , he decided to act unilaterally . The former champion of the settlements now proposed `` disengagement '' -- to uproot them , along with Israeli forces , from Gaza . This divided the Israeli public and drove Sharon to create his own party , which gained wide support .

In 2005 , the residents of all 21 Gaza settlements were evacuated . Hamas subsequently took over Gaza and fired thousands of rockets at Israel . Still , an unapologetic Sharon was about to apply his unilateralist strategy to the West Bank when he suffered a massive stroke .

Today , as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry pursues a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians , Sharon 's approach is once again being discussed . A growing number Israelis are asking , `` What happens if the process fails ? ''

One solution could be a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian population centers in the West Bank . As in the disengagement from Gaza , the United States would endorse this move , but unlike in Gaza , most Israeli settlements would remain within Israel , and Israeli troops would still patrol strategic borders . Of course , the preferable solution is two states for two peoples . But if that proves unattainable , then Israel can still end the occupation of the Palestinians , preserve its security , and perhaps lay new foundations for peace .

Even when comatose , Ariel Sharon was a constant presence for Israelis . Whether as the dashing commando , the farmer , the builder , the contrarian , and belated seeker of peace , he reflected them and embodied their story . And after his death , his brazen Israeli way of action lives on .
