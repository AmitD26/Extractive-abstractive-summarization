-LRB- CNN -RRB- Charlottesville Police said Monday that investigators found no `` substantive basis '' to support a University of Virginia female student 's story that she was raped at the Phi Kappa Psi house , an account that Rolling Stone published last November .

`` Jackie '' told the magazine that in late September 2012 , she was assaulted at the house , the article said . Police Chief Tim Longo noted that just because police found no evidence to support her account , `` That does n't mean that something terrible did n't happen to Jackie '' on the day in question .

Longo said he welcomed any information that might still be out there about the case .

The Rolling Stone story generated controversy from the moment it came out , first sparking a debate about the prevalence of rape on college campuses throughout the country . But then the controversy turned toward the story 's content when apparent contradictions and discrepancies in the article came to light .

Rolling Stone said it did not get the accounts of those accused in the piece , and apologized . Editors vowed to conduct their own investigation , which is expected to be published in early April .

Longo said Jackie did not give police a statement during their investigation .

CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said it 's not unusual for a sexual assault victim to avoid the criminal process .

`` Sometimes they ca n't deal with the probing that occurs . They do n't want to submit to a rape kit . They 're embarrassed . They know that they will be scrutinized , quite frankly . So that in and of itself ... does n't make this young woman a liar , '' she said .

Hostin pointed out that only about 2 % of rapes that are reported are false , and only about 40 % of rapes that occur are even reported : `` So the suggestion that she just sort of made this entire thing up flies in the face of the statistics . ''

Nine out of 11 people at the fraternity house at the time the sexual assault allegedly occurred talked to police , Longo said . None of them said they knew about a rape , he said , and investigators further determined that it was unlikely a party even happened at the fraternity house on the day in question as was alleged in the Rolling Stone story .

The Rolling Stone reporter , Sabrina Rubin Erdely , talked to police , authorities said , but there were some questions she declined to answer for journalistic reasons . It 's unclear what those questions were .

In total , authorities spoke to 70 people as part of their investigation , and just two believed that Jackie was the victim of something , Capt. Gary Pleasants told CNN 's `` Erin Burnett OutFront . ''

`` The two of them were fairly convinced that something had happened -- not the way it was described , the way it was written . But they thought , again , that something had probably occurred , '' he said .

After the story 's publication , UVA suspended the fraternity 's activities , and outrage spread throughout campus as many struggled to comprehend the horrific experience that Jackie said she endured .

The article also suggested the school failed to respond to the alleged assault .

Phi Kappa Psi released a statement Monday , saying the `` discredited '' story has done significant damage , while acknowledging the `` importance of sexual assault issues on America 's college campuses . ''

The fraternity asked Rolling Stone to `` fully and unconditionally retract its story . ''

Rolling Stone editors said they chose not to contact the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on Jackie , or any of the men she said participated in her alleged assault , `` because the editors feared retaliation against her , '' the magazine said , adding that it regretted that decision .

`` In the face of new information , there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie 's account , and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced , '' Rolling Stone said in December .

Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana later tweeted that `` the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story . ''

Rolling Stone issued an apology for discrepancies in its article and began to fact-check it . Steve Coll , dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism , has been leading the independent review , CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter reported Sunday . Stelter said there has been much speculation about Coll 's findings .

Columbia University 's review will be published in early April in the magazine .

`` I ca n't really say I 'm surprised since so much of the evidence was already called into question , '' a former friend of Jackie 's said in response to what police found . `` I think it 's great that they 're staying open to considering any new evidence that comes up . ''

Ryan Duffin added : `` I 've resigned myself to realize that I might never know what did or did n't happen . ''

CNN 's Sara Ganim and Michael Martinez contributed to this report .
