New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prosecutors on Thursday dropped a drug possession with intent to sell charge against a musician who was arrested earlier this year in connection with the heroin overdose death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman .

In return , Robert Aaron Vineberg pleaded guilty to a lesser charge , according to the Manhattan District Attorney 's office . He will serve no jail time .

Vineberg will be sentenced October 14 to five years of probation , forfeiture of $ 1,284 confiscated from his apartment after his arrest and 25 days of community service , said Joan Vollero , director of communications for the Manhattan District Attorney 's office . Vineberg also will attend an outpatient drug treatment program .

Vineberg , who is from Canada , could face immigration consequences in light of his felony plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree , Vollero said . He was originally also charged with third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance , which included intent to sell .

Vineberg was among four people arrested in Manhattan in the days after Hoffman 's death .

Prosecutors said Vineberg had just under 50 small bags of heroin as well as packaging paraphernalia in his apartment during a raid . Additionally , 250 small bags of heroin were found in another of Vineberg 's apartments in the same building , prosecutors said .

Vineberg , 58 , was found to have the actor 's phone number stored in his phone , a law enforcement official told CNN .

Calls to Vineberg 's lawyer were not immediately returned .

The guilty plea comes the same day that the city 's health department released 2013 data showing that heroin overdose deaths have doubled since 2010 in New York City .

The city 's health department said that 77 % of drug overdose deaths in 2013 involved an opioid , including opioid analgesics -LRB- prescription painkillers -RRB- , methadone or heroin . `` On average , there is more than one fatal opioid overdose a day , '' according to the release .
