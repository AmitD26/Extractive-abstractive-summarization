-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A team of medical examiners has ruled that Oklahoma death row prisoner Clayton Lockett died from the state 's lethal injection and not by heart attack .

The report , which was released Thursday by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections , called the manner of death a `` judicially ordered execution . ''

The controversial April 29 execution of Lockett , who was convicted in 1999 of murder and rape , took 43 minutes from the time he was first injected .

Witnesses described the man convulsing and writhing on the gurney , as well as struggling to speak , before officials blocked the witnesses ' view . The execution was halted , but Lockett eventually died .

The botched lethal injection catapulted the issue of U.S. capital punishment back into the international spotlight , raising new questions about the drugs being used and the constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment .

Many needle marks

The report said there were numerous attempts to start an IV because it was difficult to find `` intravenous access sites . ''

There were at least 15 needle marks on Lockett 's body , according to the autopsy , which was conducted by the Dallas-based Southwestern Institute of Forensic Sciences .

An attorney who represents a group of Oklahoma death row prisoners who have commissioned an independent autopsy said the state-sponsored exam failed to answer one vital question .

`` What this initial autopsy report does not appear to answer is what went wrong during Mr. Lockett 's execution , '' Dale Baich said , adding that more information is needed . He thinks that will be discovered in an independent autopsy .

Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton said in April that Lockett had died of a heart attack , but there was no support for that statement in the autopsy .

The Oklahoma Department of Public Safety said Thursday it is wrapping up an investigation that was ordered by Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin . The findings will be revealed next week .

Time : Every execution in U.S. history

New drug cocktails

Thirty-two U.S. states have the death penalty , as does the U.S. government and the U.S. military . Since 2009 , three states -- New Mexico , Connecticut , and Maryland -- have voted to abolish it .

States that have capital punishment have been forced to find new drugs to use since European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using theirs for executions . One of those manufacturers is the Danish company Lundbeck , maker of pentobarbital .

Earlier this year , a convicted murderer and rapist in Ohio , Dennis McGuire , appeared to gasp and convulse for at least 10 minutes before dying from the drug cocktail used in his execution .

Lockett 's execution was the first time Oklahoma had used midazolam as the first element in its three-drug cocktail . The drug is generally used for children `` before medical procedures or before anesthesia for surgery to cause drowsiness , relieve anxiety and prevent any memory of the event , '' the U.S. National Library of Medicine said . `` It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow relaxation and sleep . ''

Lockett was convicted in 2000 of a bevy of crimes that left Stephanie Nieman dead and two people injured .

The trouble with Lockett 's execution prompted the state to delay the planned execution of Charles Warner from May to November .

In a CNN/ORC poll earlier this year , 50 % of Americans said the penalty for murder in general should be death , while 45 % said it should be a life sentence . The survey 's sampling error made that a statistical tie . Fifty-six percent of men supported the death penalty for murder in general , while 45 % of women did .

A Gallup poll last year found 62 % of Americans believe the death penalty is morally acceptable , while half as many , 31 % , consider it morally wrong .
