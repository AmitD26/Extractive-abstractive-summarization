-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We just ca n't leave well-enough alone .

In 1960 , the movie `` Scent of Mystery '' opened in theaters , marking the first and only official attempt at Smell-O-Vision , in which strategic odors were emitted during the film from little pipes near the seats .

At the time , it was big thinking and an interesting draw for moviegoers , sort of like the collective asthma attack everyone developed a few years ago for modern 3-D . Which I think most of us will now agree is more trouble than it 's worth .

Like wearing pants .

Before Smell-O-Vision , other motion pictures had unsuccessfully tried to use aromas in disjointed and haphazard ways . But in `` Scent of Mystery , '' new , specific patented technology was developed to actually drive the plot . And that had n't been done before .

Fortunately , the storyline had nothing to do with Peter Lorre getting sick from bad oysters . Though the reviews might 've been interesting .

`` I liked it up until the 30-minute bathroom scene . Two stars . ''

`` Scent of Mystery '' was eventually de-odorized and retitled `` Holiday in Spain , '' at which point Smell-O-Vision was neatly tucked away in the vault of American bad ideas .

It now shares that space with game footage from the XFL .

But more than 60 years later , a startup company in Japan is bringing back the Smell-O-Vision concept for a smaller screen . Specifically , the one on your phone .

Sexting just got way more interesting .

They call this thing ChatPerf , and it 's a thumb-drive-sized atomizer that plugs into your mobile device so it can be triggered to release specific odors on command . However , the major design limitation is that it can release only one specific fragrance from whatever scent tank you happen to have inserted into the atomizer .

So God help you if you suddenly want to smell `` Summer Flowers '' but accidentally left the house with `` Larry the Cable Guy Doing Situps . ''

Git-R-Done !

Holding but one fragrance tank at a time definitely steals some of the potential fun , for it also seems unlikely that you could remotely sneak attack a friend who 's on a first date , digitally wafting his table with the putrid stink of rotten eggs .

Not that it would necessarily change things .

`` Um , Jarrett , did you just pass gas ? ''

`` Yes . Yes , I did . ''

Naturally , this new little gizmo is still in development , but they hope to have it out in markets by the fall for both iPhone and Android . Which , sadly , will be months too late for strategically teaming up with Bonnaroo so tech-savvy music fans can olfactorily brag to everyone back home with the familiar summer festival smell of a hot Port-O-John .

`` Sounds like Heather is having fun . ''

`` Do n't you mean smells like Heather is having fun ? ''

`` Ha ha ha ! Yes . We have indoor plumbing . ''

But the sky seems to be the limit for ChatPerf , so long as we agree that the sky is rather low and remarkably pointless . That said , the company is being smart and releasing a software development kit to encourage outsiders to hack away at new , creative uses for different smells .

So , you never know . Perhaps there 's hope for something interesting . I just ca n't think of what that might be .

Nevertheless , Team ChatPerf thinks there are possibilities ranging from the pleasant to the completely absurd . For instance , they excitedly ponder the possibility of concert venues handing out tanks of sweat for fans to truly experience the closeness of their favorite performer on stage .

Clearly , they 've never been to a Meatloaf concert .

One somewhat practical application , they say , might also be for game play , where , say , a shooting game could be programmed to release the smell of gunpowder . Or a driving game might enhance the experience with burning rubber .

Come to think of it , maybe even World of Warcraft could be designed to smell like your mom 's basement . You know , just in case you happen to emerge from the darkness to play the game somewhere else .

Not that you 'd want to .

At least it has indoor plumbing .
