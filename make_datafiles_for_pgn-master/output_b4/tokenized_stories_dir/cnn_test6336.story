-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Reading the legal complaint leaves a heavy feeling in the pit of your stomach .

The claim , filed by attorney Gregory Owen on behalf of one child , alleges 4 - and 5-year-olds at the First Lutheran Child Development Center in Carson , California , were performing oral sex on each other at the preschool .

The suit alleges that in addition to acts performed on the 5-year-old plaintiff , other students were removing their clothing and engaging in sexual acts on the playground and during nap time .

Such behavior , experts say , would be rooted in normal childhood development ; the children participating in or seeing such sexual acts may not fully understand what is taking place . Whether such alleged inappropriate acts will have a long-term impact on students depends on how the situation is handled , experts say .

`` Young children are not developmentally prepared to engage in sex , '' said Kathryn Seifert , an expert in youth violence and sexual behavior . `` Their brains are not ready to absorb that kind of information . ''

Owen told CNN he is representing six children who attended the church 's program and their parents . He plans to file five additional lawsuits before the end of February . The first , filed Tuesday , names the school , several of the First Lutheran Church of Carson 's leaders , an unnamed `` minor perpetrator '' and the perpetrator 's parents as defendants .

The suit said that the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services conducted an evaluation of the center in November and found a lack of supervision , which `` allowed for inappropriate touching between minor students . ''

In a statement , First Lutheran officials said the incident referenced in the lawsuit happened in October and was `` addressed and dealt with '' at that time . The statement notes that the plaintiff was still enrolled in the church 's preschool until last week .

Kids at risk : Say something or bite your tongue ?

Michael Weston , spokesman for the California Department of Social Services , told CNN the department met with officials from the church on February 1 concerning `` noncompliance '' license violations against the school over the past six months . The violations discussed included a lack of supervision at the care facility , child-teacher ratios and inappropriate discipline .

At that meeting , Weston said , the department was informed that the school 's director was resigning and the school license would be set to inactive on Friday . The decision to close the school was made based on the director 's resignation , which was for personal reasons and not related to the incidents , according to the church officials ' statement .

On Wednesday , the California Department of Social Services issued a temporary suspension order to the development center after determining there was an `` immediate risk to the children in care . '' The order prohibits the facility from operating , according to a letter from the department .

Weston said the department will continue to investigate after the school closes .

Questions remain , Seifert said , about what exactly happened at the school : Was this a group of unsupervised children just being curious about their bodies ? Were they copying something they had seen on TV or in a magazine at home ? Was it the result of sexual abuse -- either by another student or an adult ?

Judith Myers-Walls , an expert in human developmental stages at Purdue University , said sexuality , in a sense , starts younger than you might think . Between the ages of 2 and 5 , children learn to dress and undress themselves and begin to understand what it means to be a boy versus a girl . Many toddlers like to run around naked , Myers-Walls said , and may touch themselves .

`` That is again , very normal . ... They 're simply doing things that feel good , in the same way they might curl their hair , '' she said . `` They do n't -LRB- know -RRB- social norms . They have n't learned what 's polite and impolite until parents teach them . ''

Children are excellent imitators , Myers-Walls said . Often the actions they 're exhibiting have been copied from somewhere else .

Adults who come across children exploring their bodies in inappropriate ways should step in immediately and stop the behavior , she suggested . They should explain that the acts are not acceptable in public areas . Parents should teach their kids about `` private parts '' that need to be covered in public , she said , and about personal space .

The way parents deal with the alleged situation in California will affect how much of a long-term impact it may have on the children , Seifert said . Getting upset or angry may convey to a child that he is in trouble and lead to anxiety surrounding his sexuality down the road . Instead , asking questions calmly about what happened and why should clear up whether the child has been traumatized by events .

A professional therapist can help determine the extent of trauma and work with the family to recover , Seifert said . Even if the child does n't know sexual activity is wrong , it can still have lingering effects .

While some exploration is natural , sexual acts such as oral sex may `` make them feel odd or funny or sad or angry , '' she said . `` It 's those emotions that have to be cared for . ''

The best way to avoid these kinds of situations is to have ongoing conversations about sexual behaviors with your kids , Myers-Walls said . `` It 's important for parents to realize you do n't have ` the talk ' and you 're done . ''

When children are around 2 , parents can discuss body parts and the differences between boys and girls , she said . As children grow a bit older , parents can talk about private parts and when it 's OK -LRB- and not OK -RRB- for kids to explore their bodies . In later years , kids will ask where babies come from ; you do n't have to talk about birth control and abortion , but you should answer their questions simply and directly , Myers-Walls said .

'' -LRB- Sex -RRB- is very different than drugs and smoking -- you do n't ever want them to do that , '' Myers-Walls said . `` Being a sexual being is who we are . ''

There are warning signs that your child is participating in inappropriate behavior or is being abused , Seifert said . Every day , parents should be talking to their children about their day : what happened , who they hung out with , what they did . If topics come up the child should have no knowledge about , calmly ask more questions , she suggested .

Other signs include drastic changes in behavior , trouble sleeping , eating changes or anger issues , Seifert said .

`` We want people to be aware so if they 're in this situation they know what to do , '' she said . `` Even if it is something that 's unfortunate that 's happened to your child , there is help out there . ''
