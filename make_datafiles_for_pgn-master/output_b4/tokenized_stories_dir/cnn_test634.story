-LRB- CNN -RRB- Hillary Clinton is back in the middle of an unfolding controversy . The revelation that as secretary of state she maintained a private email account , and that she had a private computer server in her New York home , sent shock waves through the world of politics last week .

Questions arose about whether Clinton conducted her official business on private email , possibly violating regulations that were written to ensure that the activities of government officials remain accessible to the public .

Republicans jumped on the story . `` It makes you wonder , '' said Reince Preibus , the chairman of the Republican National Committee . `` Did she use the private emails so she could conduct diplomacy and fund-raising at the same time ? '' Even many Democrats are worried about the implications of this recent story . Their front-runner , their `` inevitable '' nominee for 2016 , now seems vulnerable . Many in Washington are anticipating that the scandal is only getting started .

This is not the first time that Hillary Clinton has found herself in this situation . She has spent much of her political career battling scandals . When her husband , Bill Clinton , was president of the United States , she was one of the first targets of the earliest investigations into the administration -- `` Travel-gate , '' `` File-gate '' and the Whitewater affair .

She stood by her husband 's side later in his presidency when House Republicans moved to impeach him for having lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky , a White House intern . Although Clinton enjoyed a bit of a break when serving in the Senate , the controversies resumed once she became secretary of state under President Obama .

During her tenure , Republicans became consumed with multiple investigations into her role in the tragic Benghazi attacks . Although the investigations failed to find any evidence of wrongdoing , the issue became a rallying point for conservative activists and fund-raisers . Some Republicans now claim that the emails will provide the data that they have been looking for to prove what they were saying .

But those observers who are predicting her demise should remember that Hillary Clinton has proven to be remarkably resilient over the years . Each time she or her family has been hit with a scandal , she has survived . She has proven to be an extraordinarily tough fighter who turns these challenges into opportunities to become stronger . As Kate McKinnon , playing Hillary Clinton on `` Saturday Night Live '' said , `` Nice try . ... This is NOT how Hillary Clinton goes down . ''

Based on her history , what can we expect from the Clinton scandal playbook ?

Attack the accuser and the investigative process : Nobody has done this better than Hillary Clinton . When her husband first confronted charges about his affair , Clinton famously went on television and spoke about a `` right-wing conspiracy '' that she claimed was driving the scandal . Although the revelation that the affair did occur brought her family great embarrassment , her charge became part of a larger counterattack from the administration that proved to be extremely effective .

The Clintons zeroed in on the hyperpartisanship of some members of the GOP , such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich , claiming that the Republicans in Congress were on a mission to pull off a political coup . She employed a similar strategy with the Benghazi investigations , arguing that the inquiry was more a political tool used to rally the base than a serious investigation .

We are likely to hear similar arguments now , particularly since the email controversy has opened up right as the campaign season is taking off . As more Republicans ca n't resist jumping on the issue , Clinton will push back , focusing public attention less on the issue than on the idea that this is part of a political narrative to bring her down .

Stick it out : One thing that Hillary Clinton and her husband understand well is that the news media love a good scandal feeding frenzy , but that soon enough reporters move on . The American public , which is now used to fast-paced and constantly changing news stories , will follow the coverage as it shifts to a new story even after weeks , or months , of attention on one single issue . Remember the Ebola crisis ? Not many people do , though for a time it was all anyone was talking about . As Brendan Nyhan wrote in The New York Times : `` If there 's one thing we 've learned from past presidential campaigns , it 's that most supposed game-changers like this quickly fade from the memory of the political class , having never been noticed by most Americans in the first place . ''

When dealing with scandal , Hillary Clinton and her husband have avoided taking any rash action , ignoring whispers about resignation or discussions about major apologies . Instead they strike back against their opponents and wait out the news cycle until the frenzy dies down .

People should not expect Clinton to do anything drastic in the near future . Her first move , via Twitter , was to announce in straightforward fashion that she has asked the State Department to review and release some of the email as soon as possible . While some Democrats are champing at the bit to use this opportunity to push other members of their party -LRB- Elizabeth Warren ! -RRB- into the political fray , Clinton is not going to give them any space to do this . She will wait until reporters and Congress move in a different direction .

Rally the party base : If there is one thing that the Clintons understand , it is that their party is desperate for a good fight . After years of dealing with congressional Republicans and the hardball tactics of conservative activists , the Clintons appreciate that members of their party are searching for leaders who will take on their opponents .

Democrats are tired of elected officials who roll over too easily when attacked by Republicans . This has been one of the major complaints from Democrats about Obama . Even when many Democrats were furious with the White House following the Monica Lewinsky revelation , the Clintons appealed to partisan instincts and rallied the troops to fight for them as a way to push back against the GOP . By 1998 , they had transformed the issue from being about Clinton and perjury to a struggle to protect the Democratic Party .

Clinton will do this again . Democrats are feeling particularly vulnerable ever since former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush entered the race , bringing star power to a GOP campaign that seemed filled with lightweights and flawed candidates . Given that Democrats feel the stakes are enormously high to keep control of the White House so that the next president can protect Obama 's programs from Republican attack , Clinton will appeal to that instinct to carry her through .

Will it work ? That remains to be seen . It will depend on the scale and scope of the upcoming revelations and what her opponents decide to do with the material .

But the Clinton playbook is pretty clear and road-tested . If Clinton 's critics and opponents expect her to just roll over , they really have n't been studying their history .
