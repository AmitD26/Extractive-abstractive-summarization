-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Anything you can do , I can do better .

That was the message from Lionel Messi to Brazil 's boy wonder Neymar .

Both players , teammates at Barcelona , have lit up this World Cup with four goals in their opening three games .

But unlike Neymar , who at the age of just 22 has scored 35 goals in 52 international appearances , Messi has had to contend with critics who say he never delivers when playing in an Argentina shirt .

Now , having scored more times in this tournament than his previous two World Cups combined , those opinions appear to have disappeared ahead of the last-16 tie against Switzerland .

Two goals against Nigeria in Wednesday 's 3-2 victory secured top spot in Group F against a Super Eagles side which qualified for the last 16 in second place courtesy of Iran 's 3-1 defeat by Bosnia .

`` Messi is one heck of a player , '' Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi told reporters .

`` You ca n't take that away from him . He 's blessed . I think there are other players in the Argentina squad who are very strong , but Messi is from Jupiter .

`` We gave too much respect to the Argentinians and did not play our game in the first half . We played a bit more aggressive in the second half . Congratulations to the Argentina team , I wish them all the best in the tournament . ''

Messi left Argentina for Spain at the age of 13 -- a move which led many in his homeland to question whether he had taken on a Catalan identity by the time he grew into one of the world 's greats .

Surely that myth will be extinguished should Messi lead his country to its first World Cup triumph since 1986 -- and the signs are increasingly encouraging .

He has now scored 42 goals in 88 international appearances while playing with an energy which suggests he may have been saving his best for last following a relatively poor season at Barcelona , which was interrupted by injury .

His last-gasp goal which secured a 1-0 win over a valiant Iran was a moment of magic which will long be remembered .

That goal , which came just moments after Diego Maradona -- arguably Argentina 's greatest ever player -- had left the stadium , appeared to signal his arrival as the nation 's new hero .

Messi , who turned 27 on Tuesday , said his perfect birthday gift would be to win the World Cup -- and given his recent performances , it would take a brave person to bet against it .

Unlike on Saturday against Iran , Messi required just three minutes to unpick the Nigerian defense in Porto Alegre .

A sumptuous through ball by Javier Mascherano released Angel Di Maria and , when his shot was pushed onto the post by the Nigeria goalkeeper , Messi followed up to lash the ball high into the net .

Nigeria , which had n't conceded a goal in its previous two games , could scarcely have reacted better .

Just over a minute later , a quick break allowed Ahmed Musa to find space on the left before he cut inside a curled home a delightful effort past the outstretched arm of Sergio Romero .

A draw would have been enough to take Nigeria through to the next stage for the first time since 1998 but the Africans struggled to contain a rampant looking Argentina .

Di Maria , a star of Real Madrid 's European Champions League triumph , unleashed a fierce 30-yard drive which Vincent Enyeama , the Nigeria goalkeeper , did well to turn behind .

Enyeama , who has enjoyed an impressive season with French club Lille , then denied Messi from 25 yards as the forward arrowed a free kick towards goal .

But with the first half drawing to a close , he was beaten again as Messi curled home an exquisite effort from 20 yards with his wand-like left-foot .

Nigeria could have been forgiven for beginning to fear the worst at the interval given Messi 's moments of magic .

But Stephen Keshi 's men appeared reinvigorated after the break and Musa broke through the Argentina defense to level within two minutes of the restart .

Nigeria , paired with Argentina for the fourth time in the World Cup , suffered narrow defeats in each of its previous three fixtures against the South Americans .

But any thoughts that this would finally be its day were soon extinguished when Marcos Rojo bundled in Messi 's corner just three minutes later .

The mercurial Messi , having already tormented Nigeria for just over an hour , was then substituted by coach Alejandro Sabella -- either to give him a rest or out of sympathy for his opponents .

As Messi walked off to a standing ovation and an almighty roar from the thousands wearing blue and white packed inside the stadium , the game appeared to meander somewhat .

There was still time for Musa to threaten a hat-trick while Messi 's replacement , Ricky Alvarez , should have done better with a headed chance late on .

But with the news of Iran 's demise filtering through from Salvador , Nigeria appeared aware of its qualification and a showdown with France in Brasilia on Monday .

Iran , which fought so valiantly during the 1-0 defeat by Argentina last Saturday , required a victory to progress for the first time in its history , combined with a Nigerian defeat .

But it was frustrated in its attempt by a Bosnia team , which despite already being unable to qualify for the knockout phase , appeared determined to go out of its first World Cup in style .

Bosnia 's 1-0 defeat by Nigeria , which riled coach Safet Susic after his team wrongly had a goal disallowed , left several players inconsolable at the final whistle .

But there was little sign of a hangover and Edin Dzeko , the man whose effort was ruled out , finally gained the goal he so badly craved when he drove home from 20 yards .

Roma 's Miralem Pjanic added a second after the break before Reza Ghoochannejad pulled one back with 11 minutes remaining .

But with Iran pushing forward for an equalizer , Avdija Vrsajevic rounded off a rapid move by firing in off the post to secure his country 's historic first World Cup victory
