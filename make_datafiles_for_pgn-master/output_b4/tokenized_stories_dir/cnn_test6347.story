-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For a time Monday if you looked up the Wikipedia entry on John Brooks , this is what you 'd find :

`` John Anthony Brooks , Jr. referred to as John Brooks -LRB- born January 28 , 1993 in Berlin -RRB- is a German-American footballer . He is the greatest American since Abraham Lincoln . ''

If you had n't heard his name before , you certainly have now : John Brooks is the 21-year-old who came in as a substitute into the USA vs Ghana game Monday , and scored a header to keep America 's hope alive in the World Cup in Brazil .

His 86th minute goal was sweet payback against Ghana -- a team that dashed America 's hopes in the last two World Cups .

Here 's what you need to know about America 's new hero :

He straddles two cultures

Each of Brooks ' elbows sport a tattoo .

On the left is an outline of Berlin , with a star marking the neighborhood he grew up in . The state of Illinois covers his right , with a star representing Chicago , his father 's hometown .

And while he has relatives stateside , his main attachments are in Berlin where his mother 's from , he said in his U.S. Soccer video portrait .

`` My mom , it 's the most important person in my life . ''

His American father , a serviceman , has moved on to Switzerland .

He is bilingual

Brooks mixes it up on Twitter and Facebook with posts in English and in German , and sometimes in both -- like the one he wrote about his nomination for the U.S. team .

`` Happy to be called into the preliminary USMNT roster ! Will work hard to be part of it ! - Gl端cklich 端ber meine Nominierung f端r die US Nationalmannschaft ! Werde mein bestes geben um dabei zu sein ! ''

His video portrait on U.S. Soccer 's website is heavily edited , sometimes in mid-sentence , and his German accent comes through at times , but he says he 's proud to be part of the U.S. team .

`` It was a big dream to come to this team . It 's an honor to wear this jersey , '' he said .

He made history Monday

Brooks was n't in the starting lineup for Monday 's game against nemesis Ghana . But he was called into service when Matt Besler complained of hamstring problems -- and the coach did n't want to take chances .

Brooks goal was one for the record books . He 's the first substitute in U.S. soccer history to score in a World Cup match .

He seems to leave an impression

Just like Monday , he made a grand entrance during his first game with Hertha BSC , after the Berlin team he plays for ascended from the minors to the major league . Brooks scored a goal in his first game of the season in August .

Then , he rushed to the airport to make his first U.S. national team match .

He 's part of a German presence on Team USA

Brooks is not the only German national soccer league player to make the jump across the Atlantic to kick for the U.S. national team .

Four more have joined him on this World Cup journey on a soccer Mayflower of sorts .

When J端rgen Klinsmann , a household name in German soccer , took over as U.S. coach , he went shopping for quality talent made in Germany -- with a U.S. passport .

In addition to Brooks , the team boasts Jermaine Jones , Timothy Chandler , Julian Green and Fabian Johnson -- all of them U.S.-German dual nationals .

This will make for a particularly interesting game next week , when the United States team faces soccer powerhouse Germany in the coastal resort town of Recife .

If you hear someone on the U.S. team scream `` Tor !! '' after a score ...

... well , that 's German for `` Goal !! '' for Team USA .
