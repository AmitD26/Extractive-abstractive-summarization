-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hundreds of migrants departing from unstable Libya died in early October in a shipwreck while trying to reach Lampedusa , their gateway to Europe . But although their tale is tragic , it is far from exceptional .

In the last two decades 20,000 people have perished from hypothermia , drowning , or landmines on the journey toward their `` European dream . '' And while European Union institutions are beginning to address this history of loss , it is crucial that the discussion on asylum , immigration , and borders be further democratized .

These are defining moments shaping the future of Euro-Mediterranean geopolitics , democracy , and human rights . Members of the EU Parliament recently adopted a joint resolution calling for a coordinated approach to immigration and asylum , to be inspired by both intra-European solidarity and responsibility toward would-be migrants .

Seeking to prevent further disasters , the EU 's 28 heads of state have reached a consensus on the need to pursue activities that have long been in place . These include cracking down on organized crime ; boosting search and rescue and Frontex border patrol activities ; implementing the EUROSUR border surveillance system ; cooperating with countries of origin and transit ; collaborating with international agencies .

Additionally , a new task force for the Mediterranean has been set up and is expected to offer operational proposals by December . Immigration and asylum will again be discussed at the next EU summit in June 2014 with possible legislative action at that time , when strategic guidelines `` in the area of freedom , security and justice will be defined . ''

Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta has also announced that his government is working on new national norms to regulate asylum . But he has dodged a crucial question -- whether forced migrants , including children , could be allowed to apply for temporary protection in Italy or elsewhere in Europe while still living in countries such as Libya . As a clear political direction and `` strategic guidelines '' are still to emerge at the national and EU level , civic engagement with these issues is vitally important .

Demographic and economic disparities between northern and southern Mediterranean shores contribute to migration as an enduring condition . Post-World War II boundaries between forced and economic migration are increasingly blurred as terrorism , corruption , border disputes , trafficking , drought , and sectarianism displace millions of people south and east of the EU . Developing countries host 80 percent of the world 's refugees , with Pakistan , Iran , Germany , and Kenya hosting the largest numbers . In protracted refugee situations , such as that of Somalis in Kenya , children are born to refugees who themselves were born in refugee camps .

OPINION : Europe 's immigration nightmare just beginning

What all migrants have in common is the hope for a good life . And a good life , for most of them , is not merely about remittances , but also civic and political rights and duties , and belonging to a community that accepts them and their children for who they are and who they become . Some are convinced Europe can offer this . Opaque technocracy , abstract humanitarianism , and militarization alone can not provide answers to their plight -- answers must be political , and the EU 's discussion in this sense is only beginning . A democratized discussion on borders , asylum , and migration would need to include a more grounded assessment of the costs and benefits -- financial and in terms of human rights -- of colossal projects including EUROSUR , Frontex , and EU Border Assistance Missions to non-EU countries such as Moldova , the Ukraine , and Libya .

In the short term , small reallocations of the massive spending supporting these surveillance projects might enable the proliferation of initiatives akin to Germany 's Humanitarian Admissions Program . This relatively modest , feasible program has recently flown to Germany in cooperation with the UNHCR for 5,000 Syrian at-risk women and children , people with serious medical conditions , and survivors of torture . For two years they will be integrated into the socio-economic , healthcare , and educational fabric of German cities -- and the program may be extended beyond that timeframe .

OPINION : EU must solve crisis to deserve Nobel Prize

EU institutions are also recommending migration management agreements between the EU and transit countries . But several readmission agreements are already into force . They essentially oblige non-EU signatories to take back not only their own citizens , but also third country nationals . In renewing or promoting such agreements , the EU should better assess whether those countries offer a reliable state apparatus , a functioning asylum system , and the resources to adequately protect human rights . The EU also needs to consider whether the youth in non-EU signatory countries will continue to experience these agreements as disparaging and humiliating , or as equitable and mutually beneficial .

More broadly , EU actors will have to decide whether the Mediterranean is to serve as an integrated space of common growth or as an insurmountable frontier . Both options have their costs . But in the latter case , everyone must appreciate the risk of more deaths at sea -- and billions of euros will need to be invested in permanent `` military-humanitarian '' operations . And despite the massive deployment of the `` Mare Nostrum '' Italian military mission off Lampedusa , transnational smuggler networks will look for other routes , as they have done for years , or alternatively bet precisely on patrol and rescue operations and ask inexperienced migrant themselves to take the helm of unseaworthy vessels . Either way , they will profit by gambling with the lives of thousands of people .

OPINION : What 's the place of outsiders in Europe ?

As consequential and costly decisions are being considered in Brussels and other capitals it is time for citizens and leaders to make a choice as to how they envision national and European liberal democracy . What is the place of outsiders ? What is my legacy in writing the history of the present ? What will I say to the children of the drowned ? Survivors , human rights advocates , pluralists , Islamophobes , Eurosceptics , fiscal conservatives , post-colonial and `` second generation '' Europeans need to speak out now , engaging each other and their representatives .

I admit I am not a supporter of European right wing parties , and I do believe their growing popularity can not be challenged by merely adopting sanitized , `` light '' copies of their rhetoric . National and EU politicians have to pragmatically tackle the serious challenges faced by their constituents . But they also have to more courageously explain what their vision of Europe is , accepting that in a functioning , non-demagogic democracy making everyone happy is impossible .

And yes , the EU has yet to win the hearts and minds of its citizens . It is precisely with our actions , relationships , voices , votes , and laws that we can help ground in democratic methods core EU ideals of freedom , security , and justice . If we fail , the `` European Dream '' will remain a scam marketed by smugglers and other dream dealers .
