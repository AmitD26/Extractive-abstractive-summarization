-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bayern Munich completed the $ 50m signing of Spanish midfielder Javi Martinez from Athletic Bilbao , on Wednesday .

Martinez , part of the victorious Spain squad at the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 European Championship , had a $ 50m release fee in his Bilbao contract , but was required to pay the amount himself , which created huge tax liabilities for the player and complications for the German club .

Bayern 's chairman Karl-Heinz Rummennigge described the transfer as `` very complicated '' and accused Bilbao of `` refusing to cooperate from the very first day '' of negotiations .

`` We 've had tax and legal problems to solve over the last few days , but fortunately we 've succeeded , '' he said .

`` The player has made an indirect contribution by foregoing a large sum of his salary . Our management is convinced the player will do very well with us , '' he added .

Despite being only 23 , Martinez has made 201 appearances for Athletic Bilbao and was a key member of the side that enjoyed a surprise run to the final of last season 's Europa League . The Basque native can play in central midfield , or as a center-back .

`` Bayern are one of the best teams in Europe , and the whole world , '' Martinez told the club 's website .

`` There are so many top players here , all of them fantastic footballers . That 's hugely motivating for me . And naturally , I 'm looking to win trophies , ''

In the English Premier League , Tottenham Hotspur announced the signing of Belgian midfielder Mousa Dembele from London rivals Fulham .

`` We are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with Fulham for the transfer of Mousa Dembele , '' Tottenham announced on their website .

Neither side confirmed the fee involved , but it is believed to be in the region of $ 24m . Dembele was signed as a striker for Fulham from AZ Alkmaar ahead of the 2010-11 season , but thrived for the club after moving into a midfield role

`` Dembele originally joined Fulham as a forward , although his ability to drive forward with the ball and his eye for a pass saw him played in an attacking midfield role last season , a move that proved a huge success , '' explained a statement on the club website .

Tottenham will be hoping the 25 year old can replace Luka Modric , after the creative Croatian midfielder completed his moved from Spurs to Real Madrid earlier in the week .

`` Following two full seasons at Craven Cottage , the Club would like to thank Mousa for his contribution and wish him well throughout the rest of his career , '' Fulham said in a short statement on their website .

In Italy , AC Milan further strengthened their attacking options with the capture of Bojan Krkic on a year long loan from Serie A rivals Roma .

Krkic joined Roma from Barcelona last summer for $ 15m , but the Spanish club have the option to re-sign the player next summer for $ 16.25 m .

After making more than 100 appearances for Barcelona , Krkic enjoyed a fruitful debut season in Italy , scoring seven goals in 33 appearances . AC Milan will be hoping the young forward can help replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic , who moved to Paris St-Germain earlier in the season .

In his final season at Barcelona , Krkic was , coincidentally , chosen to replace Ibrahimovic as Barcelona 's number nine after the Swedish striker moved to AC Milan .

Also on Wednesday , Bayer Leverkusen completed the signing of former Bayern Munich goalkeeper Michael Rensing , who was released by Cologne following their relegation last season .

`` We have signed an experienced and high quality back up for our number one , '' explained Leverkusen managing director Wolfgang Holzhauser on the club 's website .

`` We 've made this move as we are involved in three competitions . ''

North German side Hamburg have also made moves to strengthen their side before the close of the transfer window . Czech midfielder Peter Jiracek has moved from Wolfsburg , signing a four year contract with the Rothausen .

In Spain , Atletico Madrid strengthened their defence with the capture of Domingo Cisma from Racing Santander . The defender played for Atleti 's youth teams and declared he was `` back to stay '' at the club , despite only signing a one year deal .

`` A special group of players is being assembled here and I hope my arrival will increase the competition for places , '' he said .

Real Betis have completed the signing of French born Poland international Damien Perquis from Sochaux . Perquis has signed a three year contract after impressing during his brief appearances at Euro 2012 .
