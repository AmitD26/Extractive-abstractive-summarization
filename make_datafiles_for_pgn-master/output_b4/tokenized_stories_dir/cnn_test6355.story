-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Filled with regret , Kelley Fielder wishes she would have tried to stop them .

She was Amanda Miller 's best friend . Amanda and her husband , Jerad Miller , had moved from Indiana to Las Vegas and for two weeks had been living with Fielder .

Jerad was always going off , she recalled , spewing anti-government rants . He filled his Facebook page with political cartoons that mocked police and other authorities . A recent post read : ` We must ... prepare for war . ''

Then something really disturbing .

Around 5:45 Sunday morning , Fielder told CNN , the couple were awake . They had a cart full of ammunition .

What were they doing ? she asked .

They told her they were `` going underground , '' Fielder said .

`` The revolution has begun , '' Jerad Miller told Fielder .

`` I should have called the cops , '' she said Monday . `` I 'm so , so , so sorry -- to everybody . I 'm sorry . ''

On Tuesday , Carie Stichter , Jerad Miller 's mother , released a statement .

`` We wish to express our greatest sympathies , thoughts and prayers to the families who have lost their loved ones in this horrible act of violence . We are profoundly saddened , confused and in shock over the senseless actions of our son and his wife . We ask that the media respect our family 's privacy during this ... difficult time . ''

Bystander went after Jerad Miller

Within hours of Fielder 's exchange with Amanda , 22 , and Jerad , 31 , the couple had shot to death two police officers and a bystander who apparently tried stop their rampage .

That man , Joseph Wilcox , was with Jeremy Tanner , a longtime friend at a Las Vegas Walmart when the Millers walked through the door . Tanner recalled seeing Jerad Miller come into the store , seeing Miller dressed in some kind of fatigues and wearing gear .

Tanner had to very quickly process what was happening .

He heard Miller shout , `` This is the beginning of the revolution ! Everybody get out ! You will be shot ! ''

Tanner looked at his friend Wilcox . He knew Wilcox had a concealed carry permit and sometimes had a gun on him . Customers and staff were fleeing the store .

Wilcox `` had the option to go left to exit the store to safety , '' Tanner told CNN . But he chose not to leave . Wilcox instead stayed inside and confronted Jerad Miller , Tanner said .

Tanner told CNN his friend was unaware that Jerad Miller was with Amanda Miller . Wilcox was shot , authorities said .

The couple retreated toward the back of the store , where police closed in .

Amanda Miller shot her husband and then herself , police said . They both died .

It was hours before Tanner was told that his friend was killed . He is devastated , he told CNN . Sunday 's violence made him `` ashamed for the human race ... that people just have total disrespect for themselves and other people . ''

He ca n't stop thinking about it . What if he 'd changed his schedule a little bit that day ? What if he and his friend had not been in that Walmart at that time ?

`` You never expect it , '' he said . `` It 's something you see on TV , in the movies . ... ''

Wilcox 's 18-year-old sister , C.J. Foster , told CNN that she felt her brother was brave for attempting to interfere .

`` I 'm very proud of him , '' she told CNN . `` I would have never done it . I would have never . I would have froze in place probably and the fact that he just rushed in after and tried to save those people , it was heroic . ''

Who were the victims ?

Two officers slain

Wilcox was the Millers ' third victim .

Their rampage began when they walked into a CiCi 's Pizza place around 11:30 a.m. in a non-glitzy part of the city where two police officers were having lunch .

The couple shot Igor Soldo , 31 , in the back of the head , and Alyn Beck , 41 , took a bullet to the neck , authorities said .

On Tuesday , Beck friend Tracy Smith remembered the officer in an opinion piece for CNN.com . Officer Beck was kind and funny , intelligent , a tireless worker and a devoted husband and father of three . He loved his dog , Marty , she wrote .

Soldo was married and had a baby .

The Millers placed a `` Do n't Tread on Me '' flag and a Nazi swastika on one officer 's body , authorities told reporters Tuesday .

On the other officer 's body , authorities said , a note was pinned . It read something to the effect of , `` This is the beginning of the revolution , '' Second Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters .

`` We do n't necessarily believe that they are white supremacists or associated with the Nazi movement . We believe that they equate government and law enforcement ... with Nazis , '' McMahill said . `` In other words , they believe that law enforcement is the oppressor . ''

`` I just sat down to have lunch . The officers were sitting in front of me , at the table right next to me , and this man came in out of nowhere , '' witness Sheree Burns told CNN affiliate KTNV .

`` I thought he was going to get a drink , the way he walked up and walked past them , '' she said . `` And then he turned around , pulled a gun on his right and shot the bald officer in front of me . ''

The pair took the officers ' guns and ammunition , McMahill told reporters .

As the Millers walked out of the CiCi 's , they passed Alvaro Lopez .

`` They had a backpack , and I saw a gun in their hand , '' Lopez told CNN affiliate KLAS . `` He just told me to tell the cops that it was a revolution and that he 'd just killed two cops inside CiCi 's . ''

McMahill confirmed that the Millers said something about a revolution while leaving the pizzeria .

Opinion : Right-wing extremists strike again

A search for why

Police are still in the early stages of their investigation . They say they think that the couple acted alone and that the officers shot were targeted at random , authorities said Monday .

`` What precipitated this event , we do not know , '' Sheriff Doug Gillespie said . `` My officers were simply having lunch . ''

Investigators searched an apartment late Sunday night that was thought to be where the couple lived . They were going through the couple 's social media postings , McMahill said Monday .

Police also recovered hundreds of rounds of ammunition from the couple 's backpacks at Walmart , suggesting they were prepared for a lengthy gunbattle , he added .

`` There is no doubt that the suspects have some apparent ideology that 's along the lines of militia and white supremacists , '' McMahill said .

Who were the Millers ?

A woman who says she lived near the couple told KTNV that the married couple liked to dress up as the villainous `` Batman '' characters Joker and Harley Quinn .

The neighbor , Krista Koch , told the station the man also sometimes dressed as Slenderman , a fictional horror character that recently surfaced in the stabbing of a 12-year-old girl in Wisconsin .

Koch also told the station the couple had told her they were going to carry out an attack , but she thought they were `` crazy , '' so she dismissed what they said .

McMahill told reporters he 'd heard unconfirmed reports the pair spoke to a neighbor about the attack before it happened .

`` You know we have the ` see something , say something ' campaign , '' he said , urging people to call police when something does n't feel right .

`` We need to hear about those times when individuals or groups of individuals are talking about going out and committing acts of violence -- whether it 's against the police or anybody else in our community , '' McMahill said .

`` We need to hear from our citizens . They 're the best eyes and ears that we have out there . ''
