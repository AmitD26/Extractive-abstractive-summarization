-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mobile World Congress is the world 's largest mobile phone trade show , held every year in Barcelona . It is the venue for manufacturers like Nokia , HTC , LG , and Samsung to reveal the must-have mobile devices and services of the year .

This year is likely to be no different with big launches expected from all the major players except Apple .

So what can we expect ? Some phone makers have already announced their MWC line up , some have hinted , others have been rumored . Talking to sources , joining the dots , and getting the word on the street , this is what is expected at the show :

Nokia
Nokia is rumored to be launching a number of handsets at MWC this year . Some will focus on emerging markets -LRB- Brazil , Russia , India , and China -RRB- , while the others , the developed ones . The phones you are most likely to be interested in will be a European version of the recently announced Nokia Lumia 900 , and a low end Lumia ; the Nokia Lumia 610 . Both models will work with Microsoft 's Windows Phone 7 operating system .

HTC
We are expecting three handsets from the Taiwanese company ; The HTC One X , The HTC One S , and the HTC One V . The top-of-the-range One X will feature the new Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor and run Android , while Pocket-lint has confirmed with sources that the One V will be a music-focused device aimed at men and similar to the more female friendly -LRB- if that is possible -RRB- HTC Rhyme that is already on the market .

Samsung
Although Samsung was expected to launch the Samsung Galaxy S III at MWC this year , the company has now confirmed that it wo n't . With a number of pre-MWC launches already detailed , Samsung is expected instead to focus on tablets at the show . If rumors are to be believed , it will launch a 10.1-inch version of the Samsung Galaxy Note announced in September 2011 . The difference from all the other tablets it sells ? It will have a built-in stylus .

LG
Following Samsung 's lead with the Galaxy Note , LG has announced its LG Optimus Vu prior to the show . A cross between a phone and a tablet , it will measure 139.6 mm x 90 . mm , meaning it 's going to be one for those with big hands and big pockets . There are also rumors that the company will announce a follow up to the LG Optimus 2X called the 3X . Expect it to have a quad-core processor too .

Research In Motion
BlackBerry maker RIM has said that there will be no new hardware at the show this year , but that it will be showing off the new PlayBook 2.0 operating system and the software operating system , BB OS 10 , that it hopes will power its new phones expected later in the year .

Panasonic
Having just announced a new waterproof and dustproof phone called the Eluga , Panasonic has also confirmed it has a second handset in the pipeline to launch at MWC . It will feature a dual-core processor , OLED screen and will run Android .

Fujitsu
Japanese brand Fujitsu has confirmed that it will be launching phones in Europe following its success in Japan . The company has yet to announce which models it will be bringing the continent , however the smart money is on the waterproof quad-core Tegra 3 powered Android smartphone it announced at CES in Las Vegas in January .

Sony -LRB- aka Sony Ericsson -RRB-
Trying to pinpoint a Sony phone destined for Mobile World Congress is as hard as Sony Ericsson 's transitions to Sony . We are expecting a European launch for the already announced -LRB- at CES -RRB- Sony Ericsson Xperia S though . Rumors and leaked internet photos suggest maybe a bigger screen version too , as well as an array of other Android devices .

Motorola
Motorola 's MWC plans are even quieter than Sony 's with the company traditionally focusing on CES in Las Vegas to launch many of its first-half-of-the-year handsets . There is a suggestion that Motorola has teamed up with Intel to launch one of the first Intel-powered smartphones , but that is still to be confirmed . Motorola does n't have a press conference at the show , but Intel does .
