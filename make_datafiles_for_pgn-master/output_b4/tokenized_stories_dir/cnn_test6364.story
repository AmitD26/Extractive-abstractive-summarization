-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It hurts me to say this , but I bet when I say `` Kim , '' you know the last name .

Our world is no longer run by bankers and brokers but by public relations people who will do anything to keep certain names in -LRB- or out -RRB- of the news . If they are not trained psychologists , they sure act like them ; they know how to get our interest even when we absolutely do not want to give it .

And so into this vortex of extreme public relations savvy comes Kim K , one of the people who is `` famous for being famous . '' How did she do it ? By flaunting her vapid lifestyle , her great body and good looks and her money .

Of course America idolizes her . But as it turns out , not nearly so much as she idolizes herself .

Kim is putting together a big book of selfies called `` Selfish . '' She said she was assembling sexy pictures of herself from a trip to Southeast Asia for a book to give to her newish husband , Kanye West , on Valentine 's Day . But then the thought occurred to her -- why would n't everyone want one ?

Normal people would find a 352-page compilation of selfies in bad taste . But in truth we recognize the basic instinct : It 's hard to resist walking by a mirror and not having one of two reactions -- to look or , at all costs , to avoid looking .

Unlike Kim K , the Queen of Narcissism , most of us have a more ambivalent relationship to our own image . We look at pictures of ourselves and more often than not , cringe . If it 's a flattering picture , we save it for our Facebook page or give it to our partner . But few of us , even few movie stars , want to create books of how glorious we look .

Yes we all are mini-narcissists , but most of us have a sense of our flaws and the limits of how much time we should spend on adoringly looking at our own image . Kim K is a lesson in how extreme it can get when you are a canny self-promoter : You just love yourself so much 24/7 .

If you , like me , is relieved at the disappearance of Paris Hilton from the front pages and are not a fan of pathological narcissism , you know we should ignore Kim K and shun falling into her PR trap .

But the fact that she has an esteemed publisher and that the editors there must think this book will sell well presents a serious issue : Why are young women entranced with this woman ? -LRB- I understand why young men would be . -RRB- But young girls who are easily impressionable and hooked by hype may be enchanted with the ease with which she seems to float through life and take on her `` struggles '' -LRB- Which brand name shall I buy ? Which mini-feud will I rage about ? -RRB- as ones they would rather have than the ones they have in real life .

They envy her . The fact is that the Kardashians have gained traction in their lives . They have built an empire and no one can deny she and her posse have figured out how to make a fortune based on her brand . Kim K wo n't be around forever . But is it some failure of feminism among the young that allows this kind of person to be a star ?

I remember the icons of my day : Janis Joplin -- a wild woman , a maverick and a massive talent -LRB- though , sadly an addict as well -RRB- . There 's Gloria Steinem , a woman who was mission driven . And while perhaps she had extra press attention because she was good-looking , it was her feminist theory , her amazing verbal ability and her mentoring of others that made her someone to follow and emulate . These were women who deserved to be famous . Even Madonna , embellished by PR but not created by it , had -LRB- and has -RRB- talent , and a provocative message about sexuality .

Kim K , like Paris Hilton , is just about as thin as their photographs . They want our love and money and they hope to achieve it by showing how much love and money they have already .

So would n't it be great if Kim K 's selfie book sat moldering in book stores and on Amazon ? That would reassure me about the soul of modern girls and young women . I would n't blame anyone for paging through it . It 's a little like a car wreck -- awful , but hard to totally avoid looking at . But buying the book is another thing altogether .

Instead of sending Kim K to the bank , let 's encourage her to go to a really good therapist . This kind of narcissism needs to be treated , not celebrated .
