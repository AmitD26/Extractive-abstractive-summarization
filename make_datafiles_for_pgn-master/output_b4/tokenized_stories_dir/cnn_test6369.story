-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While a 5-year-old victim of an alleged rape recovers in a New Delhi hospital , India 's prime minister admits that his country has `` vast improvements to make '' when it comes to `` the safety , security and status of women in our society , '' and protesters are taking to the streets of the Indian capital .

The little girl is stable , conscious and alert , her doctor , D.K. Sharma , said Sunday .

The girl 's neighbor , who allegedly raped her , was arrested in Bihar state in eastern India , then brought to New Delhi in police custody , city police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said . The suspect is expected in court Monday and will not be eligible for bail , Bhagat said .

Indian police say the suspect abducted the 5-year-old last Sunday , locked her in his house and brutally raped her repeatedly before she was found semiconscious Wednesday on the ground floor of her building .

Doctors said they had to remove foreign objects , including candle pieces and a small bottle , from the girl 's genitals .

The assault came just four months after a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was gang raped in a moving bus , triggering seething protests in India . She later died at a Singapore hospital .

Criticized for what was seen as a slow response to the savage December attack , Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was quick to issue a statement this time , calling the act `` shameful . ''

Sunday , in a follow-up statement , Singh said , `` The gruesome assault on a little girl a few days back reminds us once again of the need to work collectively to root out this sort of depravity from our society . ''

Protests have swept through New Delhi since Friday . Many demonstrators are members of a political party of a leading anti-corruption activist , Arvind Kejriwal .

Outside the prime minister 's residence Sunday , nonviolent demonstrators conducted a sit-in . Video from CNN affiliate CNN-IBN showed police removing the protesters .

As the nation 's media ran footage of a police officer slapping a female protester outside a hospital Sunday , Singh ordered strict action against the officer and anyone else who roughed up demonstrators . The offending officer was suspended , Bhagat said .
