Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- America 's longest war . Much more National Security Agency surveillance . An alphabet soup of new government departments and agencies . Long security lines at airports .

All those things happened in response to the 9/11 al Qaeda attacks on New York and the Pentagon that forever changed U.S. security perceptions and practices .

Now a commission created to examine what happened then says we need to do more now to protect ourselves .

Read the 9/11 Commission 's new report

`` The ` generational struggle ' against terrorism described in ` The 9/11 Commission Report ' is far from over , '' the panel said this week in reference to its assessment a decade earlier . `` Rather , it is entering a new and dangerous phase , and America can not afford to let down its guard . ''

Its bottom line assessment ? `` Strenuous counterterrorism efforts will remain a fact of our national life for the foreseeable future . ''

Here is a look at the report , analyzing what has worked , what has n't and has to happen now .

WHAT WORKED

Going after al Qaeda 's leadership

The immediate reaction to the hijack attacks that toppled the World Trade Center towers and damaged the Pentagon targeted the culprit -- the al Qaeda network of Osama bin Laden operating out of Afghanistan near the Pakistani border .

Years of war in Afghanistan ended the safe haven there for terrorists and achieved the goal of degrading al Qaeda 's core , the report said . U.S. special forces eventually killed bin Laden in Pakistan .

Air travel security

Long security lines , reinforced cockpit doors , removing laptops from carry-on bags , no liquids , checking shoes -- all followed the attacks that killed 3,000 people .

A no-fly list that had 16 names before the attacks now has more than 1,000 , the report noted .

So far , no similar foreign attack has occurred in America . The closest call came in 2009 when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab failed to ignite an explosive in his underwear as a Northwest Airlines jet from Amsterdam approached Detroit on Christmas Day .

Expanded government

The Department of Homeland Security . The director of National Intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center . The Transportation Security Administration . The FBI National Security Branch and the military 's Cyber Command .

All exist in response to the 9/11 attacks as part of an unprecedented expansion and reorganization of government security resources .

`` These measures have largely succeeded , '' the report said . `` The mass-casualty attacks many feared in the wake of 9/11 did not materialize . Today , in large part because of these many reforms , the United States is a much harder target . ''

NSA surveillance

The security apparatus also expanded its ability to track telephone and computer communications after 9/11 .

Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified details of those programs last year , revealing they were much broader and potentially intrusive than publicly known .

A resulting backlash at home and abroad caused the Obama administration to make some changes without substantively changing the ability to monitor suspect communications .

`` We believe these programs are worth preserving , albeit with additional oversight , '' the report said .

The American spirit

The Boston Marathon went on as scheduled this spring , undeterred by the terrorist bombings at the finish line a year earlier , the 9/11 commissioners noted .

`` This year 's triumphant marathon sent an unmistakable message to the world : Americans will not bend to terrorism , '' the report said , adding that `` the country must continue to prepare for the unforeseen , but it appears to be moving in the right direction . ''

WHAT HAS N'T WORKED

Full disclosure

The new report 's biggest takeaway ? Tell the people what they need to know .

Prior to the 9/11 attacks , `` the government did not effectively explain to the public the evil that was stalking us , '' it said . `` We fear that this is happening again . ''

On major issues of the day -- a transformed and resurging al Qaeda , the growing terrorist haven spawned by the Syrian conflict , increasing cyber threats -- `` public awareness lags behind official Washington 's , '' it said .

`` If this gap persists , the political support for needed national security capabilities will fade , '' the report continued . `` In today 's very dangerous world , that is something we can ill afford . ''

Efforts to reduce Islamic extremism

Islamic extremism has increased in the past decade , the report said .

`` While al Qaeda 's various affiliates are enmeshed in their own local conflicts , hatred of the United States remains a common thread , '' it added , citing the emergence of groups such as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , Al Shabaab and Boko Haram .

`` Partly , this is a consequence of the Arab Spring and the power vacuums and ungoverned spaces that have sprung up in its wake , '' it said . `` Partly , it is the result of America 's inability or reluctance to exert power and influence in a number of places . ''

In particular , the commissioners noted their 2004 report on the 9/11 attacks said that if Iraq became a failed state , `` it will go to the top of the list of places that are breeding grounds for attacks against Americans at home . ''

Today , the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria controls vast territory in those countries , creating `` a massive terrorist sanctuary , '' the latest report said .

A State Department official warned a congressional committee on Wednesday that `` ISIS is al Qaeda . ''

`` It may have changed its name , it may have broken with senior al Qaeda leadership such as Ayman al-Zawahiri , but it is al Qaeda in its doctrine , ambition and increasingly in its threat to U.S. interests , '' said Brett McGurk , the deputy assistant secretary for Iraq and Iran . `` In fact it is worse than al Qaeda . ''

Congress

Not surprisingly , a dysfunctional Congress with some of the lowest approval ratings also gets cited by the 9/11 commissioners .

The funding process for national security is fragmented , with multiple budget categories providing the money . In addition , the Homeland Security Department reports to more than 90 congressional committees and subcommittees .

`` While the executive branch has undergone historic change and institutional reform , Congress has proved deeply resistant to needed change , '' the report said . `` It has made some minor adjustments , but not the necessary structural changes in oversight and appropriations for homeland security and intelligence . ''

WHAT NOW

Prepare better for cyber attacks

According to the report , readiness to deal with cyber attacks `` lags far behind the threat . ''

The commissioners noted the issue got little mention in their 2004 report , but now represents a constant and growing concern .

`` One lesson of the 9/11 story is that , as a nation , Americans did not awaken to the gravity of the terrorist threat until it was too late , '' the report said . `` History may be repeating itself in the cyber realm . ''

It called for government leaders to `` describe to the American people , in terms as specific as possible , the nature of the threat and the tools they need to combat it . ''

`` A growing chorus of senior national security officials describes the cyber domain as the battlefield of the future , '' the report said . `` Yet Congress has been unable to pass basic cybersecurity legislation , despite repeated attempts . ''

Use of military powers

After 2001 , Congress authorized the use of military forces against terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks . It remains the legislative permission slip today .

The report said the authorization needs updating , calling on the administration to `` clearly explain whether it needs new legal authority to confront threats like ISIS and how far , in its view , any new authority should extend . ''

Better oversight

Streamline the system so that the NSA and the Homeland Security Department have more clear and direct oversight , the report recommended .

`` If Congress is not effectively overseeing these programs , no one is , '' the report said .

Vigilance

The biggest threat to America is failing to recognize the threat still exists and is growing .

`` Many Americans think that the terrorist threat is waningâ € '' that , as a country , we can begin turning back to other concerns , '' the report said . `` They are wrong . ''

The threat remains `` grave , '' it continued , warning `` we can not afford to be complacentâ € '' vigorous counterterrorism efforts are as important as ever . ''

In particular , the report said , `` young Americans need to know that terrorism is not going away . ''
