Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- First lady Michelle Obama stepped into the fashion world on Wednesday by helping those pursuing fashion careers have face time with some high-profile fashion icons .

More than 150 students attended the first White House Fashion Education Workshop with some of the nation 's most famous designers and magazine editors , such as Anna Wintour of Vogue Magazine , Jason Wu , Diane von Furstenberg and Narciso Rodriguez .

Obama , who hosted the workshops and luncheon , emphasized the importance of education in getting ahead .

`` I know that many of you are hoping to one day pursue a career in fashion , and that 's why we invited you here today , because we want you to really understand what it 's going to take to be successful , '' Obama said . `` We want you to see firsthand that a solid education and the willingness to work hard is really at the core of what it 's going to take to achieve your goals : education and hard work . It 's that simple . ''

Von Furstenberg , who designed the famous wrap dress , echoed that message and told the participants how she made her dreams come true .

`` When you are young , it 's most important that first you study , that first moment of studying , that is what will stay with you forever , '' she said . `` But keep your eyes opened . And be open . Be open to everything . Be curious . ''

The first lady also talked about the example of an unlikely fashion icon : Sara Blakely .

Blakely worked her way up from selling fax machines for an office supply company and working as a ride operator at Disney World , all while developing and devoting her savings to a new business idea .

`` She pitched her idea to factories and mills , asking them to help her make the product a reality , and of course , she was turned down again and again and again , '' Obama recounted . `` But finally , a manager at a factory liked her idea , and today , 14 years later , Sara 's idea , Spanx , is a multibillion-dollar company with products selling in more than 50 countries . And we all wear them with pride ! ''

The students represented more than a dozen schools from the East Coast and participated in five workshops , where they heard from dozens of experts on the topics of construction in fashion , entrepreneurship , and fashion journalism .

They also heard from a panel that included several top designers like von Furstenberg , Jenna Lyons of J. Crew , and Wu , all whose creations have been worn by Obama .

Wu , who designed the first lady 's dresses for both her husband 's inaugurations , told the audience about growing up in Taiwan and feeling like he was different when he chose designing clothes over playing sports .

Obama assured the fashionistas that hard work and perseverance are essential to succeed .

`` I want those stories to show you that there 's no magic to being successful in fashion or in anything else . What is required is a willingness to work long nights , to suffer through rejection and failure , to rise above all of that , all the doubts and fears and anxieties , whether you come from , you know , the city , the suburbs , no matter where you come from , all those feelings are natural , '' Obama said .
