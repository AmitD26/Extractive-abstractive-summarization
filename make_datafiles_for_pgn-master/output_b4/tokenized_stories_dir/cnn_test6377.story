Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The surprise disclosure of an intelligence assessment about North Korea 's nuclear capabilities this week raised further questions over what the United States believes the communist nation is capable of , and has kept the U.S. , the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world on edge , worried about the possibility of an imminent missile launch .

At a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday , Rep. Doug Lamborn , R-Colorado , read from a declassified version of a document in which the Defense Intelligence Agency expresses `` moderate confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles , however , the reliability will be low . ''

But James R. Clapper , director of U.S. national intelligence , quickly shot that assessment down . `` North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear-armed missile . ''

Still , many issues about North Korea 's nuclear capabilities remain unclear as U.S. officials prepare for a potential missile launch by Pyongyang that they say could come at any time . Here is a look at a few of those questions :

------

1 . Does North Korea have nuclear weapons ?

Likely . North Korea conducted its first underground test of a nuclear weapon in 2006 , as well as two other tests , with the most recent coming in February of this year . Others believe the communist nation is assumed to have already separated enough plutonium for up to 10 warheads . It is unclear , however , if they have developed a way to weaponize or effectively deliver them . A U.S. official who briefed reporters in Seoul said that North Korea `` has demonstrated at least three times now that they can detonate a nuclear weapon . '' Still , with fewer than 10 functional nuclear devices -- compared to the more than 7,650 warheads in the U.S. arsenal -- the tiny nation is at the dangerous infancy of becoming a nuclear state .

2 . Has the nuclear device been miniaturized enough to fit atop a missile ?

Unclear . Taking a basic nuclear weapon and shrinking it down so it can fit on top of a missile is quite difficult . Many experts have suspected the North Koreans have been working feverishly to do just that , but their success has not been confirmed . Said the same U.S. official : `` miniaturizing a weapon is a very , very difficult task . '' Secretary of State John Kerry , responding to the initial DIA assessment , said that `` it is inaccurate to suggest that the DPRK has fully tested , developed or demonstrated capabilities that are articulated in that report . ''

3 . Do they have missiles sophisticated enough to deliver a nuclear warhead ?

Possibly . The North Koreans are believed to have a host of rockets or missiles , either deployed or in development , that many believe capable of carrying a potential conventional , chemical or nuclear warhead . Their long-range and unconfirmed UNHA 3 rocket has never been tested as a missile , but , with a suspected range of 6,200 miles -LRB- 10,000 km -RRB- , it could possibly reach parts of the western United States . Their intermediate-range TAEPODONG 1 and TAEPODONG X rocket could cover Japan , parts of Russia and Central Asia and some U.S. bases in the Pacific . And their short-range SCUD-D , with a range of about 435 miles -LRB- 700 km -RRB- , would be a threat to South Korea , Japan and China . However , experts say their guidance systems are primitive and their propulsion systems are unstable . But the U.S. official said they have capabilities . `` They have demonstrated that they can launch a three-stage missile . We believe they are continuing to develop putting a nuclear warhead on top of an intercontinental ballistic missile or intermediate-range ballistic missile , '' the official said . `` I think it 's premature to say they 've been able to put everything together , from development of a warhead , launching it , getting it to re-enter and actually target something . I think that 's a little premature to say right now . ''

4 . If North Korea launches a missile , how will we know if it is carrying a nuclear warhead ?

Basically , we wo n't . While U.S. officials said there is `` nothing to indicate '' that North Korea can or will place a nuclear warhead atop a missile right now , most experts say it is very difficult to know the warhead and payload of a missile test in advance . That raises the heightened concern that , despite public U.S. proclamations that they would be hesitant to shoot down a North Korean missile launched over the ocean unless it appeared to be heading toward a known land-based target , such a shoot-down is still possible .

5 . Why is it so hard to know full details of North Korea 's nuclear program ?

The highly secretive nation -- led by the young , reclusive Kim Jung Un -- has been largely isolated from much of the rest of the world . Subject to strict United Nations sanctions , the country 's primary supporter has been China , to its north and west . Entry into the country is strictly limited and communications -- TV , radio , Internet and even cell phones -- have been tightly controlled by the communist government . And even North Korea 's nuclear capabilities are unclear . Months after North Korea 's latest underground detonation , U.S. intelligence is still unable to determine what material actually exploded -- uranium or other radioactive materials . Mike Chinoy , a former CNN correspondent who has visited North Korea 15 times , said the current confusion about Pyongyang 's capabilities recall a similar episode in 1998 , when U.S. spy satellites discovered an underground complex at Kumchangri , not far from North Korea 's main nuclear facility at Yongbyon . A debate raged inside intelligence communities about whether what the satellites saw was evidence of a burgeoning nuclear reactor , a secret , underground nuclear weapons facility or something else . In the end , the underground complex turned out to be empty , Chinoy noted .

CNN 's Tom Cohen , Jethro Mullen , Barbara Starr , Michael Pearson , K.J. Kwon , Tim Schwarz , Kyung Lah , Deirdre Walsh , Judy Kwon , Joe Sterling , Kevin Bohn , Chris Lawrence , Elise Labott , Jill Dougherty , Adam Levine and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report .
