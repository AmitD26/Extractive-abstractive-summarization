Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama sought to link the past and future on Monday in his second inaugural address , tying the nation 's founding principles to the challenges confronting his second term in a call for Americans to fulfill the responsibility of citizenship .

Eschewing poetic language for rhetorical power , Obama cited the accomplishments of the past four years while laying out a progressive agenda for the next four that would tackle thorny issues like gun control , climate change and immigration reform .

`` We have always understood that when times change , so must we ; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges ; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action , '' he said .

`` My fellow Americans , we are made for this moment and we will seize it so long as we seize it together , '' he added later .

Analysts called the speech politically astute and an important expression of new forcefulness by the president as he enters his second term following re-election last November .

`` It 's a real declaration of conscience , about principles , about what he believes in , '' said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen . `` He basically said , ` When I came in the first term , we had all these emergencies , we had these wars . We 've now started to clear the decks . Let 's talk about what 's essential . ' ''

Obama speech addresses social justice movements

The foundation of the address , and Obama 's vision for the future , were the tenets he quoted from the Declaration of Independence -- `` that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . ''

`` Today , we continue a never-ending journey , to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time , '' Obama said to gathered dignitaries and flag-waving throngs on the National Mall . `` For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident , they have never been self-executing ; that while freedom is a gift from God , it must be secured by His people here on Earth . ''

In particularly pointed references , the president made a forceful call for gay rights that equated the issue with the struggle for women 's rights in the 19th century and civil rights in the 1960s .

`` We , the people , declare today that the most evident of truths -- that all of us are created equal -- is the star that guides us still ; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls , and Selma , and Stonewall , '' Obama said , mentioning landmarks of the women 's , black and gay rights movements .

`` It is now our generation 's task to carry on what those pioneers began , '' he continued , prompting the loudest applause and cheers of his address when he said `` our journey is not complete until our wives , our mothers , and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts . ''

More cheers came when Obama called for `` our gay brothers and sisters '' to be treated `` like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well . ''

According to observers , it was the first time a president championed gay marriage in an inaugural address .

With further mention of topical issues such as immigration reform and gun control , Obama came to his key point -- that adhering to America 's bedrock principles requires taking action on today 's challenges .

`` Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life ; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way , or follow the same precise path to happiness , '' he said . `` Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time -- but it does require us to act in our time . ''

A deep partisan divide in Washington and the country characterized Obama 's first term , with Congress seemingly paralyzed at times and repeated episodes of brinksmanship over debt and spending issues bringing the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating .

Acknowledging the political rift , Obama called for leaders and citizens to work for the greater good of the country .

`` We can not mistake absolutism for principle , or substitute spectacle for politics , or treat name-calling as reasoned debate , '' he said . `` We must act , knowing that our work will be imperfect . ''

At the same time , he made clear he would fight for the central themes of his election campaign .

`` For we , the people , understand that our country can not succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it , '' he said .

While `` we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit , '' he said , `` we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future . ''

Text of speech

In particular , he defended the need for popular entitlement programs that provide government benefits to senior citizens , the poor and the disabled , saying they were part of the American fabric .

`` The commitments we make to each other -- through Medicare , and Medicaid , and Social Security -- these things do not sap our initiative ; they strengthen us , '' Obama said . `` They do not make us a nation of takers ; they free us to take the risks that make this country great . ''

On Monday , Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell , one of Obama 's harshest critics , called the president 's second term `` a fresh start when it comes to dealing with the great challenges of our day ; particularly , the transcendent challenge of unsustainable federal spending and debt . ''

Other issues also appear difficult , if not intractable .

Obama made a reference to gun control , saying that the nation needed to ensure that `` all our children , from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia to the quiet lanes of Newtown , know that they are cared for , and cherished , and always safe from harm . ''

However , congressional Republicans and some Democrats , as well as the powerful gun lobby , have rejected proposals Obama recently announced in response to the Connecticut school shootings that killed 20 Newtown first-graders last month .

In citing climate change as a priority , Obama raised the profile of the issue on the national agenda after a presidential campaign in which it was almost never mentioned .

`` We will respond to the threat of climate change , knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations , '' he said , warning of a `` long and sometimes difficult '' path to sustainable energy sources in a nation dominated by its fossil fuel industries such as oil and coal .

`` America can not resist this transition ; we must lead it , '' Obama said . `` We can not cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries -- we must claim its promise . ''

Obama infused his speech with references to two assassinated American icons -- President Abraham Lincoln and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. .

In one passage , Obama cited `` blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword '' in mentioning the Civil War and slavery . It mimicked Lincoln 's second inaugural address in 1865 , when he spoke of the possibility that `` every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn the sword . ''

Of King , Obama referred to those who came to Washington almost 50 years ago `` to hear a preacher say that we can not walk alone ; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth . ''

The inauguration coincided with the national holiday honoring King .

The president concluded by urging Americans to fulfill their responsibility as citizens by meeting `` the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast , but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals . ''

At a little more than 2,100 words , Obama 's speech was about 300 shorter than his first inaugural address four years earlier .

In 2009 , he was fresh off his historic election as the nation 's first African-American president , facing an economic recession , wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the ongoing terrorist threat .

David Maraniss , author of the book `` Barack Obama : The Story , '' said the difference from four years ago was palpable , adding : `` I could feel his heart beating this time . ''
