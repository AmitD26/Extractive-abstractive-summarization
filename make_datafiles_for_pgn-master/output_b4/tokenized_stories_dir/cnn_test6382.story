Bernstein booked the Carnegie Hall concert in August 1963 -- the same year that Capitol Records had rejected three singles from the group .

`` I 'm a hunch player , you see , '' Bernstein once said , according to his publicist 's statement . `` I was just glad to get this group I had been reading about for months . It took eight months after I booked them for there to be any airplay of their records on the radio . I had to convince Carnegie Hall and my financial backers to take a chance on this then-unknown group . I had been reading about their progress in the European papers and was fascinated with the hysteria that surrounded them . I was the first to promote The Beatles in the States and Ed Sullivan called me first about them before he ever booked them on his television show . ''
