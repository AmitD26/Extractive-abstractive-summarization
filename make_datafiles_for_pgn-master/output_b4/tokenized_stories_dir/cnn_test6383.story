-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hannah Whiteley laughs in the face of danger -- at least she does now .

But it was n't always that way , for this was one kitesurfing tale which almost ended in tragedy .

Rewind 11 years and with her father Pete , a five time British senior champion , watching on in horror . Whiteley came within inches of serious injury -- and maybe even death .

It was a moment which would have forced lesser beings into nightmares and cold sweats -- but not this British-born battler .

`` My dad was teaching me and I was going along fine , then all of a sudden then I was out of control and went flying through the sky , '' Whiteley told CNN 's Human to Hero series .

`` I was getting dragged down with the kite and heading into the wavebreakers .

`` I thought I was going to hit the pier and that was scary , but I hit the ground and was in a daze . Some guy came and helped tame my kite and made sure I stayed still .

`` When you crash in the water , the water turns into concrete , it 's not soft . You get a lot of whiplash in your neck and it gets flung back .

`` I was in a semiconscious state , a bit shaken up but that put me off for five years . Looking back , I 'm just so relieved I gave it a second chance . ''

Rising star

Kitesurfing is a fusion of some of the most exciting and challenging water sports , taking components of paragliding , surfing , windsurfing and wakeboarding before sprinkling some acrobatics and gymnastics on top for good measure .

Standing on a small board , the rider uses the wind to power the large kite , which propels it across the waves at rapid speed .

Since returning to action at the age of 15 , Whiteley has gone on to establish herself as one of Europe 's rising stars -- an outcome which looked unlikely following her first ever event .

On that occasion , the amateur competition ended in disappointment after she finished last , beaten by a considerable distance and defeated by a far more experienced field .

It was to prove the turning point .

`` I was so embarrassed , '' Whiteley recalled . `` I could n't do any freestyle tricks and I came last .

`` I just sat there and thought , ` What am I doing here ? ' But that competition really inspired me and suddenly I said to myself , ` I 'm never going to be that bad again . '

`` I went out and trained as much as possible after that . ''

Reaching the top

That chastening experience powered Whiteley through months of training , hitting the waves at every opportunity despite the infamous British weather .

The rest is history .

At just 15 , Whiteley became the youngest ever female to win the British Amateur Ladies title , repeating the feat the following year at the professional championship .

Two more title wins followed in consecutive years as did the prestigious Big Air/Board off crown at the 2009 Pro Kite World Tour competition .

Now at the age of 21 , and voted as the country 's most influential female kitesurfer , Whiteley has her sights set on reaching the very top .

`` I 'd really like to be European champion , '' she added .

`` At the moment I feel as if I 'm not at my peak . I always want to push it and I think I 'm going to be going for some time .

`` There 's plenty of time for me to progress and have fun . ''

Magical

There 's certainly plenty of fun . Whiteley travels across the globe to some of the most exotic places to improve her kitesurfing skills .

Australia , Turkey and Hawaii are just three of her favorite places -- although she retains an affection for her local beach at Lytham St Annes in the north west of England .

But it does n't matter whether its brown water off the British coast or sharks lurking beneath sunnier climes , nothing puts Whiteley off taking her kite into the deep unknown .

`` It 's a pretty magical feeling when you 're out kitesurfing , '' she added .

`` You 're looking back at the land , you 've got the whole ocean , and it 's just really special .

`` We 're using the wind , the sea and the waves . When it 's cold and windy you feel like you 're really in the elements , it 's great , you feel alive .

`` When I started to compete at the age of 15 it was a real eye-opener . I got to travel to some amazing places and it was definitely for me .

`` You have so much freedom on the water and it takes you to beautiful places you would n't normally go to . It 's amazing . ''
