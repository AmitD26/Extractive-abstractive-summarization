-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As Formula One racer Jules Bianchi continues to fight for his life in a Japanese hospital , his Marussia team says it has been angered by `` a number of media reports '' into the cause of the accident .

The French driver spun off in rainy conditions in the closing laps of the Japanese Grand Prix and collided head-on with a recovery vehicle .

The vehicle was removing Adrian Sutil 's Sauber which had left the track on the preceding lap , prompting double yellow flags to be waved to warn drivers to slow down and be prepared to stop .

Various reports suggested that Bianchi did not slow down and that the team had actively encouraged him not to do so .

`` The Marussia F1 Team is shocked and angered by these allegations , '' said the statement .

`` At a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital , and the team has made clear that its highest priority is consideration for Jules and his family , it is distressed to have to respond to deeply upsetting rumors and inaccuracies in respect of the circumstances of Jules ' accident .

`` However , given that these allegations are entirely false , the team has no alternative but to address these .

`` Regarding point 1 , Jules did slow down under the double waved yellow flags . That is an irrefutable fact , as proven by the telemetry data , which the team has provided to the FIA -LRB- world motorsport 's governing body . -RRB-

`` Regarding point 2 , an audio copy of the full radio transmission between Jules and the team , and a written transcript , were provided to the FIA .

`` It is quite clear from the transmission and the transcript that at no point during the period leading up to Jules ' accident did the team urge Jules to drive faster or make any comments suggesting that he should do so . ''

The FIA is investigating the accident and is considering implementing a system which will automatically slow down the cars following a crash .

Charlie Whiting , the FIA 's race director and safety delegate , gave a briefing to media in Sochi in which he outlined these plans .

He also indicated that Bianchi had slowed down prior to his accident .

Bianchi 's family issued an update on the 25-year-old 's condition Tuesday , nine days after his accident at Suzuka .

`` As a consequence of the accident at Suzuka a number of medical challenges have needed to be overcome , '' the statement issued by Marussia said .

`` The situation remains challenging due to the diffuse axonal traumatic brain injury Jules has sustained .

`` Jules remains in a critical but stable condition in the Intensive Care Unit of Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi .

`` The Bianchi family continue to be comforted by the thoughts and prayers of Jules ' man fans and the motor sport community . ''

There was a moving show of support for Bianchi before the drivers resumed racing for the first time since the accident at the Russian Grand Prix .

The Frenchman 's 21 fellow Formula One racers gathered together at the front of the grid in Sochi for a minute 's silence .

Earlier , Bianchi 's Marussia team made its own tribute with its sole driver in the Russian race , Max Chilton , holding a pit board which read , `` Racing for Jules . ''

Lewis Hamilton , who won the race for Mercedes to extend his lead in the drivers ' championship , later dedicated his win to Bianchi .
