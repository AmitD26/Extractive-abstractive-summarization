-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When patients walk in the door at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington , they 're handed a form with more than 75 questions about their family history , current medications and symptoms .

They have to answer many of the same questions when they visit radiology . Then again when they get lab work done . And the next time they come to the medical center , they fill out the paperwork all over again .

The long , redundant process is extremely error-prone , says Subha Madhavan , director of biomedical informatics at Georgetown . Handwriting often makes answers illegible . Questions get skipped . Even inputting data into the hospital 's computer system can lead to mistakes .

Collecting accurate data is crucial , not only for patient care but for research , Madhavan says . That 's why she 's working with Georgetown 's cancer clinics to roll out a tablet app called Tonic that aims to make the intake of patient information feel less like a chore .

The app uses colorful graphics and interactive features to reduce literacy barriers and move patients through the questionnaire . For instance , it asks you to slide a button along the bottom of a birthday cake to determine your age , or to rate your pain on a scale of happy green to angry red .

The app is also intuitive , skipping questions about your mother 's breast health if you say you have no family history of cancer . Along the way , Tonic provides pop-up educational boxes for patients who are unfamiliar with certain medical terms .

`` Many organizations are moving toward this electronic data capture , '' Madhavan says . `` It really allows for better patient engagement . ''

Patient engagement is the buzzword du jour in the medical community , says Sterling Lanier , CEO and co-founder of Tonic Health . With the Affordable Care Act , hospital reimbursement will be partially tied to patient-reported outcomes , or how well patients perceive a facility treated them .

`` Health care is the ultimate consumer product -- we all consume it , '' Lanier says . `` We need to think of patients as consumers . They have the same motivations and mindsets . ''

How the cell phone can improve health care

Tonic is working with large medical communities , including the Mayo Clinic , UCLA , the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Kaiser Permanente . Clients find they can ask patients up to 40 % more questions by using the app , Lanier says .

`` Why is that important ? The more we know about somebody , the better we can treat them at a lower cost , '' he says .

The app also offers doctors a real-time risk assessment . When patients submit their questionnaires , the data go straight to doctors ' tablets . For example , using information on a patient 's family history , daily nutrition and exercise habits , the app can determine his or her risk for heart disease . If it 's high , the app flags that for the doctor .

`` You might be there for a cough , but the doctor says , ` Let 's talk about this , ' '' Lanier says . `` We 're helping people not get lost in the shuffle . ''

Digital health for kids , seniors and workout buffs

Patients are `` universally enthusiastic '' about using Tonic , says Dr. Eric Esrailian , vice chief for the digestive diseases and gastroenterology department at UCLA . UCLA began using the app last year .

Esrailian says he was worried initially that less tech-savvy patients would have difficulty using a tablet , but he says the app 's format makes it accessible for everyone .

Doctors in his department are also happier because they 're getting completed surveys with accurate information , Esrailian says . `` We can spend more time actually talking to the patient and focusing on health care , '' he says .

Moving forward , Esrailian says he would like to see patient intake information integrated with electronic health care records . These records should be interactive , he says , so clinicians could schedule tests or consult on other doctors ' patients .

Georgetown 's Madhavan says questions are often raised about electronic health records and storing patients ' personal medical information `` in the cloud . ''

Lanier says Tonic is fully compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act , or HIPAA , but the discussion needs to be ongoing as the medical industry moves more toward mobile health .

`` The more we talk to clients , the more cloud-based computing is seen as inevitable , '' Lanier says . `` Some are very excited . ... Some are resigned to it . This is where the future is going . ''
