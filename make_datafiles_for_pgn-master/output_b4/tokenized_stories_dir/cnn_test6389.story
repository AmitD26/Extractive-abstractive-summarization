Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The year 2013 started off with a fiercely emotional gun-control debate that dominated Washington for months , as both sides felt bolstered and more fervent than ever with the nation stunned by the mass shooting of first graders in Newtown , Connecticut .

But that 's as far as it would go .

A year after the massacre at Sandy Hook elementary , there would be no expanded background checks or other substantial legislative changes in place at the national level .

There was yet another school shooting in suburban Denver on Friday , and advocates are still fighting for tougher firearms laws .

But attention has shifted to another common root of tragedies like Sandy Hook elementary , the 2011 attack on then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , and the Washington Navy Yard rampage -- a mental health system that many say desperately needs fixing .

An alternative route

The Senate Finance Committee approved bipartisan legislation on Thursday that would create pilot programs in 10 states to enhance access to mental health services .

The Senate measure , co-authored by Sen. Debbie Stabenow , D-Michigan , and Sen. Roy Blunt , R-Missouri , was one of at least three-dozen bills introduced or re-introduced in Congress this year that specifically focused on mental health issues .

In the previous two years , or the previous session , about 30 bills were introduced . But none passed the House or Senate .

On the other side of Capitol Hill Thursday , a Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania , Tim Murphy , became the latest lawmaker to introduce new legislation specifically tailored to mental health .

Murphy , who spent three decades as a psychologist before coming to Congress , said little has been done in the past few decades to get people the help they need .

`` This nation has moved forward in knowledge of what it takes to help , but has moved backwards in getting that help done , '' he said this week . `` And where there is no help , there is no hope . ''

The White House has also been highlighting mental health in the week leading up to the December 14 Newtown anniversary .

Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced $ 100 million in new funding from the Obama administration to improve mental health facilities and community centers .

So what changed ?

On April 18 , a divided Senate rejected a measure that would expand background checks to cover purchases at gun shows and over the Internet . Of all the gun control proposals raised in Congress and at the White House , it was considered perhaps the most viable because it was the least aggressive .

In the same package , however , an amendment aimed at addressing mental health was backed overwhelmingly by the Senate , 95-2 . Three senators voted present .

The country was again confronted with a mass shooting in September , this time at the Washington Navy Yard .

But the shooting by a lone gunman who killed 12 people hardly moved the dial in the halls of Congress just two miles from the massacre scene .

At a memorial service in Washington , Obama gave some of his most forceful remarks in favor of gun control , yet the speech barely made headlines .

Predictably , a few lawmakers argued the shooting marked another case for firearm restrictions .

But as more information came in out about the shooter 's troubled past with mental illness , lawmakers started talking more about mental health .

Sen. Kelly Ayotte , R-New Hampshire , helped introduce the Senate amendment that received strong support back in April . She said Friday in a statement to CNN that she has called on Senate leaders to bring the measure for a vote `` immediately . ''

`` It 's clear that this bill could pass with overwhelming bipartisan support , '' she said .

The legislation , which was introduced with Democratic Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut , would improve mental health training for teachers , emergency personnel , and others in the community . It would also renew suicide prevention programs .

States taking charge

Meanwhile , states have been taking on their own steps to boost mental health care all year .

State funding for mental health hit major setbacks during the recession . Between 2009 and 2012 , states cut $ 4.35 billion from their budgets for such services , according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness .

But as the economy gradually got better in 2013 , states were throwing money back into their mental health systems .

Texas allocated a $ 259 million increase this year ; California added $ 143 million . South Carolina and Illinois also reversed cuts .

All told , 36 states and the District of Columbia increased their mental health budgets for fiscal year 2013-2014 . Six saw a decrease in funding , while eight remained the same as the year before , according to a report issued by NAMI in late October .

State legislatures also passed other laws that centered around increased mental health screening services , especially for children and adolescents , trying to identify problems before they fully manifest , the report said .

Outgoing Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell this past week announced an additional $ 38.3 million for mental health in his state for the next two years .

His announcement came less than a month after Democrat Creigh Deeds , his former rival in two statewide elections and a popular state senator , was stabbed repeatedly by his own son , who then shot and killed himself .

One day prior , officials said Deeds ' son had essentially been turned away from a medical facility because it lacked enough psychiatric beds .

Well known in the Washington and Virginia political circles , Deeds ' case seemed to resonate in the nation 's capital . When Rep. Murphy introduced his new legislation on Thursday , he alluded to the situation .

`` No more being ` told there are no more beds , take your son or daughter home ' no matter how much they are at risk of hurting you or themselves , '' he said .

Will Obamacare make an impact ?

Mental health advocates say the future also looks promising because of reforms from the Affordable Care Act .

With the expansion of Medicaid -- the largest public coverage provider for mental health services -- in about half the states , an estimated 2.7 million people with mental illnesses could qualify for insurance , according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration .

Another 2.6 million with mental illness could qualify for subsidies to buy private health insurance in the marketplaces under Obamacare .

Another part of the Affordable Care Act requires small group and individual health plans to cover mental health services at the same rate as general medical care , a practice that 's already been in place for larger group plans since 2008 .

Some critics , however , argue that Medicaid and Medicare are limited in its scope for mental health treatment . For example , certain mental health services will only be reimbursed for those under the age of 21 and older that 65 -- missing a huge bloc of people .

The bill introduced by Murphy on Thursday seeks to fight other policies that permit only one prescription drug per therapeutic class , meaning physicians ca n't prescribe all the medications they could for certain illnesses under the public programs .

Breaking down barriers

The past year has also seen continued efforts at reducing the stigma of mental illness .

At a White House conference on mental health this summer , Biden delivered a frank and emotional plea to those fighting mental illness .

`` There is nothing , nothing to be ashamed of if you are struggling with mental issues or if your child is or your spouse or your friend , '' he said . `` It 's okay . It 's okay to talk about it . It 's okay to ask for help . It is okay to acknowledge that it is frightening . ''

The summit also featured celebrities who talked about their own experiences , and the Obama administration launched a new website -- mentalhealth.gov -- that educates readers on recognizing signs of mental illness and directing them on how to get help .

Breaking down the stigma of mental illness has been a White House mission for more than a decade .

In 1999 , President Bill Clinton 's administration held the first White House conference on mental health , and President George W. Bush continued the tradition .

`` Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of , '' Clinton said , when he first announced the conference . `` But stigma and bias shame us all . ''
