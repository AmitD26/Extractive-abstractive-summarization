-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It all seemed like a Friday night prank in the beachfront paradise of Isla Vista , the off-campus housing quarter for students from University of California at Santa Barbara and the local community college .

The pops sounded like firecrackers , a common mischief .

And the gun looked fake , like one used for pellet games .

But what seemed like a college joke at first became very real .

Sienna Schwartz saw the gunman driving by her and thought he was a hoaxster -- until she felt the whoosh of a bullet passing her skin .

`` He lifted up a little black pistol and ... I just thought it was an Airsoft gun or something , so I was like , hey , what up ? '' she said , becoming tearful as she recounted the experience .

`` And I turned around and I started walking the other way , '' she said . `` He shot ... I just felt the wind pass right by my face . ''

Schwartz broke down in retelling how the beauty of Isla Vista became a scene of mass death Friday night .

In all , seven people were killed , including the gunman who fired into crowds while driving his black BMW .

It was the second time that a mass killing has occurred in the unincorporated community in 13 years ; the other one also involved a motorist .

Friday night 's violence could n't have picked a more beautiful college setting .

Beachfront beauty

UCSB is renowned as a school on the beach , and as such , it 's one of the most scenic campuses in America , caressed by cool Pacific breezes .

Just 100 miles from Los Angeles , Santa Barbara attracts weekend crowds seeking a getaway . Its main street features boutiques and eateries in stylish Spanish-mission architecture .

Isla Vista is the adjacent residential quarter for students mostly enrolled in UCSB and others at Santa Barbara City College . The community sits on beachfront bluffs just west of UCSB and offers off-campus apartments where students commonly double up in one bedroom .

In fact , Isla Vista holds legend status as the most densely populated square mile in California , though the county says its size is actually a half-square mile , or 320 acres .

Officially , Isla Vista is an unincorporated community of 20,000 people -- 13,000 of them are students -- in Santa Barbara County , the county says .

The streets prove the student presence : they 're lined with bicycles .

Friday night 's mass shooting occurred on an weekend evening when Isla Vista is typically jammed with students moving shoulder-to-shoulder from one party to another .

On Saturday morning , however , the community was a massive crime scene .

Pizzerias , delis , cafes and convenience stores downtown were lined with yellow police tapes zigzagging everywhere -- because the drive-by gunman apparently fired upon several places while in motion .

Bullet casings lay scattered on the street , and storefront windows were shattered .

2001 mass killing

As grisly as it was , the setting was n't the first time that Isla Vista has known a mass killing , especially by a motorist .

In 2001 , David Attias , son of film director Daniel Attias , ran over five people in Isla Vista , killing four of them , and exclaimed he was the `` angel of death . ''

Attias was convicted of four murders in 2002 , but a jury later ruled him not guilty by reason of insanity . Attias was then sent to a California mental hospital .

In Friday night 's deaths , witnesses -- largely of college-student age -- initially thought the unfolding events were student antics .

Sounded like fireworks

Summer Young said she was walking down the street and heard what sounded like fireworks set off by students . `` People get stupid out here sometimes , '' she said .

But the pops were gunfire , and the car passed her , she learned .

`` He was just firing up shots , '' Young said .

Another witness , Cayla Bergman , a UCSB student , also described the bangs as fireworks . `` We 're used to loud noises around here , '' she said .

But then the crowds went into a panic .

`` A bunch of people from outside just started running into the store , '' Bergman said .

Sorority bloodshed

Kyle Sullivan , 19 , a student at Santa Barbara City College , came upon three young women -- all shot -- on a lawn in front of the Alpha Phi sorority , located in a cluster of Greek houses in Isla Vista .

One woman appeared to be dead . Another was struggling and `` just barely able to move her eyes . '' A third , wounded in the kidney and arm , was on the phone with her mother , telling her she probably was n't going to make it and `` how much she loved her , '' Sullivan said .

`` It was a huge shock last night , '' Sullivan told CNN in an interview on the sorority lawn , reconstructing events . `` I really was n't able to sleep at all . It was heartbreaking , that something would happen in our community like this . ''

Nikolaus Becker , a graduating high school senior who was visiting Isla Vista , was eating a burger in a restaurant when he and friends heard pops , thinking they were fireworks . Other students were doing homework inside the eatery .

`` We were actually joking around about it , '' he said of the popping . `` People were riding their bikes around outside , and parties were still going on . ''

Then Becker and friends heard two more sets of bangs -- with police running . They also saw a speeding car -- moving at 50 mph , screeching around a corner .

`` Nobody knew what was going on , and everybody was kind of scared to go outside , '' Becker said .

When he finally went outside a half hour later , Becker saw body bags on the street .

Colleges ache

Both colleges expressed sympathies Saturday . They are now coordinating counseling and student support services .

`` Our hearts are aching as we learn about the tragedy that unfolded in Isla Vista last night , '' a Santa Barbara City College statement said Saturday . `` We know our students co-mingle with UCSB students and Isla Vista residents as part of our greater community and we all , as an extended family , are impacted by this unimaginable event . ''

UCSB is providing temporary housing for displaced students .

`` Our campus community is shocked and saddened by the events that occurred last night in the nearby community of Isla Vista , '' a university statement said .
