-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A children 's book about gun rights has benefited from an unexpected boost in sales after it became the subject of a mocking segment on `` Real Time with Bill Maher '' last week .

`` My Parents Open Carry '' is the story of a typical Saturday for 13-year-old Brenna Strong , running errands with her parents while they carry handguns in plain sight , or `` open carry . ''

`` If you open carry and have a difficult time explaining why to your family and friends , or if you want to learn about the open carry of a handgun , or if you 've wondered if open carry is right for you , then this book is what you need , '' is how the book 's website sums up the plot .

Published by White Feather Press , the book was made available in 2012 on limited release and picked up by Amazon in February of this year .

Its appearance on `` Real Time '' on August 1 increased sales dramatically , with orders pouring in , according to White Feather Press founder Skip Coryell .

`` Sales were weak for the first few years , '' Coryell said . `` But after it was trashed on the show , sales have gone up . ''

`` It happened overnight , '' he said . `` Took me by surprise as a publisher . ''

The book was featured on the `` New Rules '' portion of Maher 's show , during which Maher commented on the book 's cover illustration , asking `` if mom and dad are both safe because they 're packing , why are they using their daughter as a human shield ? ''

Open carry has been a hot topic of conversation with several state legislatures debating its merits . Georgia recently passed legislation that allows gun owners to openly bear firearms in public places , such as bars , schools and churches .

On Amazon , `` My Parents Open Carry '' has a total of 115 reviews . All but 11 of them are one-star or five-stars , and many of the reviews have been posted in days following the show . Most of the reviewers admit to not having read the book .

Some say they have , though , such as `` Ken , '' who posted a five-star review on August 5 :

`` I did purchase the book and found it to be very helpful to my daughter . She was able to easily relate to the characters and apply their situation to our family . I would recommend this book to anyone that carries a firearm with kids ages 5-10 . ''

The authors , Brian Jeffs and Nathan Nephew , are founders of the nonprofit group Michigan Open Carry , Inc. . When they started the group in 2009 , Jeffs said that it was n't widely known what open carry was , or that it was legal in the state .

`` Our organization provided educational materials and seminars on the legality of open carry , '' Jeffs said . `` We answered many of the same questions over and over as well as debunked the myths surrounding the practice . ''

Jeffs decided that they should write a book answering the most common questions they got about open carry . `` Since so many books were for adults , I thought a nice change would be a kid 's book . ''

As expected , the reactions to the book have been mixed , and Jeffs said he 's gotten death threat e-mails from anti-gun critics .

Despite the threats , the authors already have plans to write a sequel to the book , and Nephew is working on an outline .

According to the book 's website , the illustrator , Lorna Bergman , is also from Michigan , and enjoys deer hunting and shooting .

`` While we strongly support providing children with information that will protect them from gun violence , this book crosses the line from information into the realm of indoctrination , '' a representative from Parents Against Gun Violence told CNN in an e-mail . `` We welcome material that makes children safer from gun violence , but this book is not it .
