-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jana Pittman was the woman to beat in track and field 's 400-meter hurdles for nearly a decade , only to suffer crushing disappointment as a string of injuries wrecked her chances of Olympic gold .

It must have been tempting to step out of the sporting limelight -- but Pittman did exactly the opposite .

Instead she took up the white knuckle sport of bobsleigh , and is making Olympic history in Sochi by becoming the first Australian woman to compete in both the Summer and now Winter Games .

Less than 18 months after her first `` terrifying '' run on an ice course , Pittman says she is `` extraordinarily lucky '' to be part of a team in the two-woman event with experienced driver Astrid Radjenovic .

Despite being hampered by a lack of funding , and having to replicate the all-important start in bobsleigh by pushing a converted supermarket trolley around her local running track , Pittman is relishing the new challenge after the end of her athletics career .

`` I was n't quite sure what sport , so I pretty much tried everything , '' she tells CNN 's Human to Hero series .

`` I tried rowing , I tried boxing and then I got a wonderful call from Astrid to say would I be interested in trying to do bobsled , and pretty much it went from there . ''

A world champion on the track in 2003 and 2007 , Pittman carried the hopes of all Australia going into the Athens and Beijing Olympics the following years -- only for her dreams to be shattered .

The final blow came during 2012 when injury again scuppered her chances of competing in the London Olympics .

The 31-year-old went into this month 's Sochi Winter Games with a realistic view of her chances , free from the previous pressure of expectation .

`` I think I want to stop and smell the roses . To actually feel what the spirit of the Games is like , '' she says .

`` Other times it sped past with huge expectations on results . This time I got to share it with my friend Astrid and to be part of a small but successful Australian team .

`` It has been wonderful . Better than expected , I think this time around I get to really take it in and appreciate the moment . ''

Not that the competitive fire which spurred on Pittman as she dominated her discipline on the track was ever extinguished .

She put herself through a rigorous training regime and bulked up , adding over 10 kg in weight from her hurdling days .

`` In an ideal world in bobsled , you want two massive women . This is the sport where everybody gets happy if you 've put on a kilo , rather than `` Oooh I 've lost a bit of weight ! '' she explains .

`` It 's all about power and speed . You have to run 15 meters , 20 , sometimes 30 meters , jump in the sled , and the start really sets you up for the whole run down to the bottom .

`` So coming from a track and field background meant I 'd lifted weights since I was 15 and I had a very natural running technique behind the sled . ''

But despite her physical advantages , Pittman also had to adapt her mindset to cope with the fear factor of racing down a icy course at over 140 kph -LRB- 85 mph -RRB- , tucked in as brakeman behind her driver Radjenovic .

`` You might be a great athlete , you might be able to do this , but you never know if you 're actually going to be able to overcome that fear and terror at the top of the hill , '' she admits .

`` Really , it just feels like a giant washing machine . It 's incredibly fast . I started at one of the hardest tracks in the world so it was pretty much the rollercoaster ride of your life . ''

That initial training run at Altenburg in Germany was a case of being thrown in at the deep end , but she quickly adapted .

`` Astrid was very clever in the fact that she made sure I had to do three runs on my first day because I got out of the first sled and was like , ` I 'm going home ! This is horrible ! ' but by the time I went down on the third go , I was absolutely hooked . ''

The pair had immediate success and took seventh place in a World Cup event on the same track , the best on record by an Australian team . They were 14th after Tuesday 's opening heats in Sochi , and maintained that placing in Wednesday 's final two .

Radjenovic has been to the Turin , Vancouver and now Sochi Games , competing in the sport for 11 years , but coming from nation like Australia , with little history in bobsleigh , the lack of funding has been a challenge .

`` Bobsleigh is like Formula One and it costs a lot of money to have fast equipment , '' Radjenovic , also 31 , tells CNN .

`` So like a Formula One team , if you do n't have a lot of money to invest in it , it is hard to do well , which has made it hard for us . ''

The addition of Pittman has helped raise funds , reaching a target of $ A20 ,000 -LRB- $ 18,000 -RRB- to help buy a new sled .

Sponsors were invited to support the `` Icebirds '' -- which is the nickname the team adopted for branding and publicity purposes .

`` Astrid advertised on our Facebook page , '' Pittman says . `` A little competition on names and then people voted . It gave us an identity a team name , so certainly helped with our support . ''

Pittman said they had also resorted to some unusual training methods in the quest for success .

`` We push shopping trolleys in our backyard , we train at a normal athletics track because we do n't have snow and we do n't have ice , so for Australians to make the Olympics in bobsled is pretty much a ` Cool Runnings ' all over again , '' she says .

That Hollywood film about the Jamaican bobsleigh team in the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary may well act as an inspiration , but during her storied career in track and field , Pittman was rarely the underdog .

Already a world youth champion , she went to her first Olympics on home soil in Sydney in 2000 and won Commonwealth Games gold two years later in Manchester .

Then came world championship success in Paris but in the buildup to Athens she picked up a knee injury that required surgery just before the Games .

Despite the disadvantage , she still managed a creditable fifth place in the final , although that was little consolation at the time .

Further Commonwealth Games success in Melbourne in 2006 was tempered during the course of the year by a very public row with 4x400m relay teammate Tamsyn Lewis , which led to adverse publicity for both athletes .

Pittman was reportedly ready to leave Australia and by then she was married to Britain 's former champion hurdler Chris Rawlinson , giving birth to their son Cornelis Levi later that year .

Relenting on the threat -- `` I 've always been a very proud Australian '' -- and coached by Rawlinson , Pittman dominated the 400m hurdles in 2007 and won her second world title in Osaka .

However , injuries again took their toll on her Olympic hopes , and her relationship with Rawlinson also soured . After a brief reconciliation they have separated again , leaving Pittman to face life as a working mother .

`` I 'm studying medicine full-time and I have a little boy who is seven , but for me , having him in my life is so grounding and I feel like I have a very full , loved life so I will certainly not go to my grave with any fears or regrets , '' she says .

That also extends to her track and field career , despite missing out on her ultimate goals .

`` I 've been very lucky that I 've been to two Olympic Games and won two senior world titles , so it 's certainly been a wonderful career and I 'm very grateful for the opportunity . ''

Pittman also has no intention of fading quietly into retirement post-Sochi , and wants to maintain her partnership with Radjenovic on the World Cup bobsleigh circuit .

`` I know that Astrid wants to retire but I 'm still trying to get her to go another year , '' she says .

`` I 've really found something that I love in bobsleigh . It is a great sport , the people in this sport , even from other countries , are really together , they really help you on every possible angle and I think I 'd love to stay in this sport if possible . ''

Failing that , Pittman has also hinted at a return to track and field -- although she would have to shed the extra muscle that is such an asset in bobsleigh to be competitive in running events .

That would appear not to offer much of an obstacle for a young woman who is renowned for being singleminded with athletic excellence in mind .

In 2010 she caused a stir by revealing that she had undergone surgery to remove breast implants , feeling they were affecting her performance on the track .

`` Every time I raced I panicked about whether I was letting my country down , all for my own vanity , '' she was quoted as saying at the time .

`` I do n't want to short-change Australia either . ''

After her heroic efforts to reach the Olympics in an entirely new sport , that 's certainly not something Pittman could ever be accused of .

`` It was lovely to have the support of the public , they helped get us our new sled and really got behind us all year , '' she says with pride .
