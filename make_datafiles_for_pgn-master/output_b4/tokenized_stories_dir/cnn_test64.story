SPRINGFIELD , Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Georgia Keightley strolled through the religion section at Barnes and Noble in Springfield , Virginia , on Monday searching for a last-minute Christmas gift .

The Green Bible looks at the text through the lens of the environment .

`` I 'm looking for a book on -LSB- the Apostle -RSB- Paul for my husband , '' she said clutching a 15 percent off coupon and lamenting the limited selection .

She would have had better luck if she had been looking for a new take on the Bible -- on the next rack in front of her were three shelves filled with Bibles of various shapes and designs .

Keightley said she and her husband already have five copies of the Bible in their home . Consistently the best-selling book on the planet , publishers are constantly repackaging it to lure new audiences .

Harper One in October released the Green Bible , looking at the Bible through the lens of the environment . In an effort to keep it true to its eco-conscious motif , it was printed in the United States on recycled paper with soy ink , and has a sustainable linen cover . `` It is still printed on paper though , '' conceded publisher Mark Tauber , who said a digital format would be greenest .

Tauber said publishers were hoping to capitalize on the growing trend in Christian circles of eco-theology and creation care . The Green Bible is filled with essays from across the theological spectrum as a companion to the text .

Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu wrote the forward while Brian McLaren , a popular progressive author and pastor , and N.T. Wright , the staunch conservative theologian , contributed essays . Anytime the text mentions something about the environment , the letters are printed in green , similar to how some Bibles print the words of Jesus in red .

In the United States , where religion and politics have danced and intertwined into a sometimes unrecognizable amalgam , environmentalism has been viewed by many politically conservative evangelicals as a `` liberal issue . ''

Matthew Sleeth is the author of `` Serve God , Save the Planet '' and for years he has been trying to convince churches that environmentalism and creation care are theologically sound . Their attitude , he said , has changed rapidly in the past few years .

`` Recently I went to Grace Fellowship , the largest church in Baltimore , -LSB- Maryland , -RSB- and the pastor introduced me and said , ` I used to be against this , but examined my heart and the Bible and came to the conclusion I was wrong . ' ''

Another Bible out in time for the holiday season is The Illuminated Bible . The glossy oversized magazine format could easily mingle on coffee tables with Italian Vogue and GQ . It takes the text of the New Testament from the Good News translation and mixes it with editorial photos .

Pages following a verse from Mark 's gospel referring to John the Baptist -- `` God said I will send my messenger ahead of you to open the way for you '' -- are adorned with pictures of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , Angelina Jolie , Mother Teresa and Che Guevara to hammer home the point to a modern day audience .

`` The text is our heritage even if you 're not a believer . We are stuck with it . Let 's know more about it , '' said Dag Soderber , the Swedish advertising executive who is behind the project . Soderber said his motives were philanthropic . Though not a practicing Christian , he said the more people who read the Bible , the more who will see what it is all about -- and that will generate more religious tolerance .

Soderberg 's first goal was to make the packaging like a glossy fashion magazine so it would be more accessible to a modern audience , making it , `` something you can find in a hair salon , something you can find anywhere , '' he said .

The Illuminated Bible debuted last year in Stockholm , Sweden . When bookstores would n't carry it , Soderberg brought it to friends who owned fashion boutiques and design stores and said it flew off their shelves . There have been a few tweaks to the English language version .

`` There were some pictures that were sexy here -LSB- in Sweden -RSB- that we took out because I do n't want to make it more offensive than I have to . '' Soderberg hopes to have an Old Testament version in stores in time for Easter .

So how do such repackaged Bibles sell among the other versions filling stores ' shelves ? A manger at Borders Bookstore in Springfield , Virginia , said the Green Bible is selling briskly . Georgia Keightley thinks that 's a good thing . `` Anything that gets people to read the Bible is a good thing . ''

Mark Tauber from Harper One said , `` I 've seen a statistic that the average American home has four to nine Bibles in their homes . There 's always room for more Bibles . The industry has shown us that . ''
