WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A national poll suggests that nearly three-quarters of all Americans support the plan to withdraw most U.S. combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns , even though most respondents said they think the troop movements will lead to an increase in violence in that country .

The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll comes Tuesday , the day of the long-anticipated deadline for American troops to pull out of Iraqi towns and cities .

The U.S. military gradually has been moving its combat troops out of Iraq 's population centers for months to meet the deadline agreed to by Washington and Baghdad .

Since January , Americans have handed over or shut down more than 150 bases across the country , leaving U.S. troops in a little more than 300 locations that gradually will be handed over to Iraqi control .

The United States has pulled about 30,000 troops out of Iraq since September , leaving about 131,000 troops there .

Seventy-three percent of Americans questioned in the poll favor the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns , with 26 percent opposed .

`` This plan has widespread bipartisan support , '' said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director . `` Seventy-two percent of Democrats and 74 percent of Republicans favor this move . ''

The poll indicates that 52 percent think the level of violence in Iraqi cities will increase after U.S. troops withdraw , with 32 percent saying things will remain the same and 15 percent saying the level of violence will decrease . If violence does increase , the poll suggests Americans are clear about how to respond :

`` Nearly two-thirds say that the U.S. should not send combat troops back into Iraqi population centers , even if there is a significant increase in the number of violent attacks , '' Holland said . `` Americans seem to believe that once the Iraqis are in charge , it 's up to them to solve any future problems . ''

The war in Iraq remains unpopular , with about one-third of the public supporting U.S. efforts there .

The CNN/Opinion Research poll was conducted Friday through Sunday , with 1,026 adult Americans questioned by telephone . The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

More than 4,300 Americans have been killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion .

The latest deaths happened Monday when four U.S. soldiers serving in Baghdad died of combat-related injuries . The U.S. military announced the deaths Tuesday without giving further details .
