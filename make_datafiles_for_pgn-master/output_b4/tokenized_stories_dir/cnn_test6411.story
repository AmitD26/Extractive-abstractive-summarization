Havana , Cuba -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Cuba says it foiled a terrorist plot by Cuban exiles to attack military facilities on the island and has arrested four U.S. residents .

According to an Interior Ministry statement , the men -- identified as Jose Ortega Amador , Obdulio Rodriguez Gonzalez , Raibel Pacheco Santos and Feliz Monzon Alvarez -- were arrested last month after traveling to Cuba to `` promote violent actions . ''

It was not clear whether the men had been officially charged or appointed attorneys .

The statement said Cuban officials would ask the U.S. government to investigate the activities of the men , who the statement said were all U.S. residents .

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that she did not have additional information about the accusations .

`` The Cuban government has also not been in touch with us yet on these cases , '' she told reporters .

The Cuban government alleged that the arrested men have ties with Luis Posada Carriles , a Cuban exile and former CIA operative accused of blowing up a Cuban commercial airliner in 1976 . Posada has denied he participated in that attack , but he remains a wanted man in Cuba and Venezuela for his alleged role in the airline bombing , which killed 73 people .

In its statement Wednesday , Cuba 's interior ministry also accused several other Miami-based exiles of orchestrating plans for an attack .

One of them , Santiago Alvarez , denied any association with the men Cuba says it arrested .

`` I do n't recognize the names , '' he said . `` It 's all a smoke screen to start a crackdown on dissidents . ''
