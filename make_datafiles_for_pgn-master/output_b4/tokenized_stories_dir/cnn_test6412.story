-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It takes a special person to join Mensa .

For one , the elite society only takes individuals with IQ scores in the 98th percentile , meaning just 1 in 50 Americans is eligible .

This exclusivity -- some might say snobbery -- is part of Mensa 's lore . Early Mensans in Britain walked around with yellow buttons , organizational publications once referred to non-Mensa members as `` Densans , '' and last year , a top Mensa member and tester called anyone with an IQ of 60 a `` carrot . ''

In short , you do n't always join Mensa because you think you 're smart . You join to be set apart from most people , who are , as one member put it : `` mundane . ''

But a new partnership between American Mensa and online dating giant Match.com offers a new , enticing reason to join the society of geniuses : true love .

Beginning this week , members of the brainiac group can connect through a separate , exclusive dating service called Mensa Match . In addition , Match.com members can add a special Mensa badge to their profiles , signaling a specific interest in connecting with a single person with a confirmed genius-level IQ score .

Smart dating struggles

Anne Sereg is one of those geniuses .

The 55-year-old Florida woman is an IT project manager who graduated high school in three years , college in two-and-a-half and has a law degree from Georgia State University .

`` It 's been a long time , '' she said about her dating life . `` I went hermit-y for a quite a few years . I just did n't find anyone who 's been interesting enough . ''

Sereg found she does not connect with people who are athletes or sports nuts , for example .

`` I 'm looking for people who are intellectually curious . And when all you 're talking about is sports teams and barbeques ... when you 're talking about physical traits and not existential philosophy , I 'm not going to get the vibe . ''

Sereg admits this attitude can limit her relationship options . But one expert thinks the results could be much worse .

Ali Binazir is the author of The Tao of Dating , and penned a 2009 article , `` Why the Smartest People Have the Toughest Time Dating . ''

A Harvard graduate , Binazir said highly intellectual people can frequently feel `` entitled '' to love . And sometimes this means unwilling to make the compromises for a successful relationship .

`` IQ tends to be pretty one-dimensional . There 's no way to say if this person interacts well with others , '' he said . `` For a relationship , it matters more how that person implements that intelligence in the real world , for jobs and parenting and exchanging of ideas . ''

`` You need to remove the barriers to love . And when you exclude those people , as smart people tend to do , that 's when you become lonely . ''

According to Match 's data , 80 % of singles say they `` must have '' or find it `` very important '' to be with someone of the same intelligence level .

What your IQ score does n't tell you

Sereg has decided a college education -- not a Mensa IQ -- is her basic requirement for a future mate .

`` I just want someone who can keep up with me , '' she said .

New possibilities

The new Mensa partnership will give Match.com users a new way to find common ground , said Helen Fisher , a professor at the University of Indiana and Match.com 's chief scientific adviser .

`` If you 're proud of being in Mensa , if someone -LRB- else -RRB- is also proud of being in Mensa , then you 're already in the same clan , '' she said . `` It 's not unlike saying I read a lot of books and I 'm looking for someone else who reads a lot of books . There 's an automatic filter . ''

In their announcement of the partnership , Mensa and Match.com included a heat map of the U.S. , listing where the `` smartest singles '' live , based on the cities with the highest percentage of Ivy League graduates on the dating site . The top 10 is dominated by college towns such as Durham , North Carolina ; Ithaca , New York ; Ann Arbor , Michigan ; Boulder , Colorado ; and Charlottesville , Virginia .

Fisher cites numerous studies that suggest relationships with a brainy mate could come with great perks .

`` People who are smarter tend to have a higher income , tend to be creative , coordinated , and good at solving problems , '' she said . `` So not only could you have a better conversation during dinner , but dinner could be in a nicer place , and -LRB- you could -RRB- leave in nicer car . ''

Binazir does not believe Mensa members are better at relationships than anyone else . But the partnership with Match.com provides another way for people to find common interests , which is always positive , he said . `` I think it 's a step in the right direction . ''

Anne Sereg hopes he is right , but she wo n't get too excited just yet .

`` One of the most recent marriages in our Mensa group came through finding each other on Match.com , and that was before the partnership , '' she said .

`` I 'm hoping that it -LRB- works -RRB- . I do n't know if it will . But you ca n't go anywhere if you do n't have hope . ''
