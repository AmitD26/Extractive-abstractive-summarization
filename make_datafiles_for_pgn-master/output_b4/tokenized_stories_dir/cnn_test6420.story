-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After a student made obscene comments about her on Twitter , a high school teacher in northern Mexico taught a lesson with an online post of her own : a video showing her confronting the girl in class .

Now the teacher is on administrative leave . The student has been suspended . The video has gone viral , with hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube . And there are now copies floating around .

The eight-minute video gives a glimpse of a lesson that students at the science and technology high school in Mexico 's Tamaulipas state are n't likely to forget .

At first , it looks like a typical classroom scene , with students attentively listening as human resources teacher Idalia Hernandez Ramos presents the day 's lesson .

For several minutes , Hernandez asks one student to stand up read a statement about social media out loud , then peppers her with questions about how harmful it can be and how people can be prosecuted for what they 've posted .

The student mentions possible problems with cyberbullying .

`` And the destruction of the image of another person ? '' Hernandez asks .

The student nods vigorously .

That 's when Hernandez confronts her .

`` Knowing that , could you tell me why you wrote this ? '' she says , handing the student a phone .

A long , tense silence follows . The student then admits being the author of the tweet , saying that she was `` upset . ''

Growing visibly emotional , Hernandez tells the student that she 's also `` very upset . '' She then points to several other students recording the incident on cell phone cameras and tablets and demands an apology .

`` My family saw it -LRB- the tweet -RRB- and now you 're going to apologize in front of these cameras , '' Hernandez says .

`` I made a mistake , '' the student says in a barely audible voice . `` The teacher did n't deserve being called those things . ''

A fellow student who apparently shared the comments is also chastised by the teacher , who calls them both `` cowards '' in front of the whole classroom . Hernandez then repeated the words used against her -- b*tch and whore -- in front of the shocked group of students .

`` Listen to me well : I will not allow anyone to call me that , especially a young brat like you and you , '' Hernandez says .

An official at the CBTis 103 science and technology high school told CNN that Hernandez has been temporarily taken out of the classroom while the August incident is investigated .

The 17-year-old student was suspended for two weeks but is back in school , the official said . CNN is not disclosing the student 's name because she 's a minor .

Debate has surged on social media over the video , with some praising the teacher and others criticizing her for humiliating the student .

The school official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said that `` most of the teacher 's colleagues are siding with her . ''

The official also said federal education authorities in Mexico City are reviewing the case .

`` It may take up to four months to make a final determination on whether the teacher is fired or not , '' she said .
