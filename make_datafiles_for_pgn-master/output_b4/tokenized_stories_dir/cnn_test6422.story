-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Debbie Wasserman Schultz visited her friend Gabrielle Giffords in the hospital last week , she talked to her about the demonstrations in Egypt and the Republicans ' proposed budget cuts -- not exactly topics you might expect during a hospital visit .

But Wasserman Schultz says she remembers what she wanted to talk about when she was hospitalized with breast cancer a few years ago .

`` As much as -LRB- Giffords ' husband , Mark Kelly -RRB- cares about her , he does n't know all the fun stories about what 's going on in Washington , '' she said . `` There 's only 435 of us in the House of Representatives , and I knew she 'd want to be caught up on what 's going on , so I told her stories about different colleagues and who said what . ''

In the nearly six weeks since the Arizona Democrat was shot , Wasserman Schultz , a Florida Democrat , has made three trips to visit her friend : two to Tucson and one to Houston , where Giffords is in a rehabilitation hospital . She 's planning another trip there in a few weeks .

She fits the travel into her busy schedule because she remembers how important such visits were to her when she was recovering from her seven breast cancer surgeries , including a double mastectomy , breast reconstruction and removal of her ovaries .

`` Being hospitalized and sidelined in such a significant way can be so isolating , and Gabby is even more isolated from the world than I was . She 's isolated in her own body while she 's recovering , '' she said .

Wasserman Schultz says that even though Giffords could n't speak to her during a visit two weeks ago , she felt that Giffords understood what she told her and appreciated the visit .

`` She reacts with facial expressions as she would ordinarily , just without words , '' she said . `` She smiles ; she frowns ; she laughs . ''

When Wasserman Schultz tried to think about what gift her friend would most want , the answer was easy : Giffords would want someone to help take care of the people in her district in Arizona .

`` Her constituents are so important to her , and my staff jumped right in to help with constituent services , '' she said .

Wasserman Schultz 's own constituents say they feel like well-cared-for friends , even when they do n't live near the congresswoman .

Eleven years ago , doctors told Rixys Alfonso her 2-year-old son , Devin Alvarez , was going to die . Her doctor in Florida said there were no more treatments left to treat his congenital disease , called Sprengle 's deformity , and Florida Medicaid was unwilling to pay for her son to go a surgeon in Texas who could help him .

Alfonso says that not only did Wasserman Schultz , then a member of the Florida Legislature , persuade Medicaid to pay for Devin to get treatment in Texas , but she 's called and visited him regularly even after moving to Washington in 2005 to become a member of Congress .

`` If it were n't for Debbie , he 'd be dead , and she did n't have to do any of it , '' Alfonso says . `` She 's a mom to the community . ''

Sometimes , when a friend who lives far away has a medical crisis , it 's tough to know how often to visit , what to say or what you can do to help without violating your friend 's and their family 's privacy . But Wasserman Schultz says that stepping forward can make a huge difference .

In her case , her friends were `` critical '' because she received all her care in Washington , while her husband , Steve Schultz , stayed home in Florida with their three young children , who were unaware of her breast cancer diagnosis .

`` My mother was with me , but she works full-time and had to get back to work , so my girlfriends came up to be with me and rotated every few days so I 'd always have one of them with me , '' she said .

Here are tips from Wasserman Schultz and others about how to give your friend the best care you can even when you live far away .

1 . Know your friend

If you 're not sure whether your friend wants to you to travel for a visit , ask .

`` Everyone deals with illness differently , '' Wasserman Schultz said . `` Some like to have a lot of interaction , and others are private . It really is very unique .

`` In Gabby 's case , she ca n't express her opinion , so Mark 's got to do it for her , '' she said . `` But in most cases , people can say what they want . ''

2 . Make specific offers

When television reporter Diem Brown got ovarian cancer five years ago at age 23 , many friends said something to the effect of `` let me know what I can do . ''

To her , that felt like an empty promise .

`` I got very , very bitter . Everyone said , ` I want to help you , ' but I felt like it was n't real , '' she remembered .

What did help were friends who helped her figure out specifically what she needed . In her case , it was a wig -- a good one that cost $ 2,000 that she could wear on TV -- and her friends helped her pay for it .

Brown , an entertainment reporter for Sky TV , has since started medgift.com , where patients can register for the gifts they want , just as couples make a wedding registry .

3 . Give the right gift

If you ca n't send yourself to your friend , send the right gift . Carepages.com has some ideas , including a subscription to an online video rental service or an appointment for pampering at a spa for after the person has been discharged .

`` You should try to put yourself in the person 's shoes when getting a gift , '' Brown advised . `` For example , maybe they have a dog , and what they need is a service to walk the dog . ''

4 . Call at night

`` Know that nighttime is often the hardest time for people in crisis , '' psychologist Gail Brenner writes on her blog . `` Call in the evening to check in . ''

5 . Call weeks later

Support often flows in when someone first becomes ill and then wanes when the illness goes on and on . Brenner suggests checking in with your friend weeks or months after the initial health crisis , when others may have stopped calling .
