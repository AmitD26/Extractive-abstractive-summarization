Novato , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When health care reform passed Congress more than two years ago , Julie Walters yelled for her husband to come into the living room where she was watching the vote live on television .

`` I was so happy , '' Walters remembers . `` I yelled for Matt . I said , ` Do you know what this means ? Do you know what this means ? ' ''

The historic vote meant their 18-month-old daughter , Violet McManus , would be able to keep her health insurance . Without health care reform , she would have gotten kicked off her parents ' insurance , perhaps as early as her 5th birthday , because her care is so expensive .

`` I was like , Violet 's covered now ! '' Walters remembers . `` We 're okay . We can breathe . ''

But now Violet 's parents are worried they wo n't be able to breathe easily again .

This week , the Supreme Court is hearing a debate on health care reform . The court could keep the reform intact , repeal parts of it , or get rid of the law altogether .

`` I 'm really scared , '' Walters says . `` Like , I-can ` t-sleep scared . ''

` Completely blue in her crib '

Violet McManus was born healthy , but when she was 11 months old her parents woke up in the middle of the night in their Novato , California , home to find her having a seizure .

`` She was completely blue in her crib and shaking , '' Walters remembers .

It was to be the first of hundreds of seizures -- sometimes thirty in one day .

Violet has been hospitalized about six times and each hospitalization cost more than $ 50,000 .

She 's now on two drugs to control the seizures and carries oxygen with her wherever she goes because she stops breathing when she has her seizures . She needs speech therapy and frequent doctor 's visits .

Matt McManus , Violet 's father , gets health insurance through his work as a video game designer . Before health care reform , there was a $ 5 million lifetime limit on Violet 's insurance policy . Violet is now 3 and her parents calculate she could hit that cap by her 5th birthday , and almost certainly by her 10th .

Health care reform made lifetime limits illegal -- which is why Violet 's family breathed easier when it passed -- but now her parents are worried the Supreme Court could restore the limits and Violet would lose her insurance . Walters has been so passionate about health care reform she contacted the office of Sen. Barbara Boxer -LRB- D-California -RRB- and MomsRising.org to advocate for the law .

If Violet does lose her current insurance , her parents know there 's no way another insurance company will want to insure her because her care is so expensive .

`` They 'd be crazy to want to insure her , '' Walters says . `` I mean , I would n't want to insure her if I was an insurance company . ''

Watching the Supreme Court case closely

Several provisions of health care reform have already gone into effect , so millions of other people , like Violet McManus , stand to lose a lot if all or part of it is reversed .

For example , 2.5 million young Americans get to stay on their parents ' insurance until their 26th birthday because of health care reform , according to the Obama administration .

Seniors and people with disabilities have saved $ 3.2 billion on prescription drugs because of health care reform and insurance companies and 45 million women have received free mammograms and pap smears because of health care reform .

There are ripple effects , too .

After health care reform passed , Walters and McManus felt more secure about Violet 's future and decided to have another child . Violet 's little brother , Rory , was born two weeks ago .

iReport : Should health insurance be mandatory ?

Violet 's parents know not everyone shares their enthusiasm about health care reform . Some people even traveled to Washington to protest in front of the Supreme Court this week . In particular , they object to the `` individual mandate , '' which requires nearly all Americans to purchase insurance or pay a fine .

The protesters object to being forced to pay for something they do n't want , but Walters and McManus see it differently .

At any point in time they say someone could find themselves in a difficult situation like they 're in now and would want a system that insures you no matter how sick you are .

As McManus puts it , `` I think people just sort of need to change their mindset about health care . ''
