Rome , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Vatican had praise Saturday for this week 's announcement that scientists had created the world 's first synthetic cell , calling it an `` interesting result '' that could help cure disease .

In an article Saturday , the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano called it `` important research '' and `` the work of high-quality genetic engineering . '' But it said the scientists who created the cell had not created life , just `` replaced one of its motors . ''

The response may appear to mark a turn for the Vatican , but in fact the church does not officially oppose genetic engineering as long as the science avoids embryonic stem cells , cloning or anything else that fiddles too much with the re-creation of human life .

`` Genetic engineering can do good : It is enough to think that it could heal chromosome-related diseases , '' the article said .

However , scientists must `` join courage with caution , '' it said .

`` They touch a very fragile territory where the environment and manipulation play a role that can not be underestimated , '' the article said .

Genetics pioneer J. Craig Venter , who runs an eponymous U.S. institute for genomic research , announced Thursday that he and his team had created artificial life for the first time .

Using sequences of genetic code created on a computer , the team assembled a complete DNA of a bacterium and inserted it into a cell of bacteria . The new cell was self-replicating , controlled only by the synthetic genome .

`` The weight of the DNA is great , and great are the expectations of genetic science , '' L'Osservatore Romano said . `` Nevertheless , the DNA , even though it is an excellent engine , is not life . ''

Venter said his team had not created life .

`` We created a new cell . It 's alive . But we did n't create life from scratch , '' he said .

Venter said the discovery would help give science new tools for a range of applications , from converting carbon dioxide into fuel and creating new food substances to creating new vaccines to treat diseases .

The breakthrough will stimulate discussion about the possibilities , Venter told CNN . He said his next step would be to `` see if we can create some of these cures for the planet . ''
