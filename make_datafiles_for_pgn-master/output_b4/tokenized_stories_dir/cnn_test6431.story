Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two children sued Malaysia Airlines and three government agencies Friday over the loss of their father aboard missing Flight 370 .

Jee Kinson , 13 , and Jee Kinnland , 11 , named the airline , officials at Malaysia 's civil aviation and immigration agencies , and the country 's air force chief as responsible for the loss of the jet , which disappeared on March 8 .

Their father , Jin Jing Hang , 41 , was on board the flight bound for Beijing from Kuala Lumpur International Airport . It lost contact with air traffic control over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam .

Missing for 237 days now , Flight 370 carried 239 people , including 12 crew members . Malaysia , Australia and China are conducting a deep-sea search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean , where authorities say they believe it ended up .

In the suit , the claimants say the airline breached the agreement with their father for a safe passage when it failed to land in Beijing .

The claimants say that air traffic control failed to take sufficient measures to establish contact or to launch a search for MH370 within a reasonable time after it had lost contact with the Boeing 777 .

The boys , who filed the suit through their mother , Ng Pearl Ming , said the immigration agency had failed to vet passengers properly , resulting in some people with fake identification boarding the flight .

Two Iranians with forged Italian and Austrian passports were on the flight , according to authorities .

Against the air force chief , the claimants allege that the Malaysian air force failed or neglected to investigate an unscheduled flight , presumed to be MH370 , after detecting it .

The government of Malaysia was named , as it is the employer and principal of the agencies named in the lawsuit .

Civil aviation director Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said he found out about the lawsuit from news websites .

`` We just read this from the news websites and have not received anything official yet , '' he said . CNN 's attempts to reach other agencies named in the lawsuit were unsuccessful .

The claimants are suing for loss of support from their father , who operated an Internet-based business .
