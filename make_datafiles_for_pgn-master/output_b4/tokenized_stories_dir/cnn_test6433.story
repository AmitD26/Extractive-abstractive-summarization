Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- David Austin is one of the few outsiders who has seen firsthand how people live in the North Korean countryside , and he describes a population `` lethargic '' from malnutrition .

Just two weeks ago , he visited an orphanage as part of his work as the North Korea program director for the relief organization Mercy Corps .

He said the last protein children had eaten was in January -- eggs .

`` That tells us not only are they not getting a balanced diet but in terms of the rations , they 're getting only about 60 % of what a child needs , '' he said .

Austin describes widespread severe malnourishment and `` an entire generation '' that is `` stunted physically , developmentally because of chronic malnutrition . ''

No sign of North Korean rocket launch

According to Austin , in seven visits since 2007 , he has been to dozens of orphanages and hospitals and more than 19 private homes .

He says he is troubled that the United States plans to call off a massive shipment of food aid as a result of the anticipated rocket launch by North Korea between now and Monday .

Pyongyang insists that the rocket is necessary to put a weather satellite in orbit , but Washington and Seoul consider it a ballistic missile test in disguise . Such launches by North Korea breach U.N. Security Council resolutions .

Under a recent food deal with the United States , North Korea agreed to refrain from long range missile launches and nuclear tests . In exchange , the United States would provide what Austin described as a year 's worth of corn-soy porridge mixed with vegetable oil for children younger than 10 and pregnant women .

The food `` would n't taste delicious but it saves lives , '' Austin said , noting that it would have helped 2.4 million people .

At the White House , President Barack Obama 's aides suggest their hands are tied after Pyongyang announced the launch just weeks after the food deal was agreed .

The North Koreans ' `` blatant disregard for their commitments makes it impossible for the United States to provide the nutritional assistance that it had hoped to provide for the North Korean people , '' said Jay Carney , the White House press secretary .

Some observers have doubts about the White House 's approach .

`` I have real questions about whether we should have linked humanitarian food assistance to the nuclear missile program in the first place , '' said Mike Green , who was senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council during the Bush administration . `` It is not the fault of the average North Korean who needs the food , who is at starvation level , that the regime is developing nuclear missiles . ''

He said the threatened missile launch was a `` provocation that should have been predictable . ''

But Green acknowledged that if the North Koreans flaunt the deal , sending the food `` would be a political liability for the administration at home , and it would look weak internationally . ''

Austin of Mercy Corps was careful not to criticize the Obama administration . But he did say the administration had previously made it clear it would send food to North Korea if there was a verified need for that aid .

`` We know there is a need and we know we can met the need . As a humanitarian organization we are saying there is an opportunity to do that , '' Austin said . `` I do n't want to assign blame . But I 'm saying there is an opportunity to engage positively and constructively with a group of people the White House describes as innocent and starving , and we can do that . ''
