-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mike Nichols , the award-winning director and pioneering comedian who was one of the few people to win an Emmy , a Grammy , an Oscar and a Tony award , died Wednesday evening , according to a note from ABC News ' president to its staff .

Nichols , 83 , who directed `` Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf '' and `` The Graduate , '' was the husband of former `` ABC World News '' anchor Diane Sawyer .

Nichols ' influence looms large in entertainment . He was among the founders of the Compass Players , the predecessor to the Chicago-based comedy troupe Second City , which has been a proving ground for comic talent for more than four decades .

As a performer with Elaine May in the late '50s and early '60s , he took comedy into places it had seldom gone before , bringing an improvisational swagger and intellectual edge to a field that had been dominated by joke-telling standups .

`` Nichols and May combined the political and social satire of -LRB- Mort -RRB- Sahl and -LRB- Lenny -RRB- Bruce with the inspired comic skits of -LRB- Sid -RRB- Caesar and -LRB- Imogene -RRB- Coca , '' wrote Sam Kashner in a 2013 Vanity Fair profile .

Nichols was also an outstanding theater director . At one point in 1967 , he had four plays running on Broadway -- including two by Neil Simon , `` Barefoot in the Park '' and `` The Odd Couple '' -- and he was a go-to guy for stage works until the end of his life , helming Tom Stoppard 's `` The Real Thing '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- , `` Monty Python 's Spamalot '' -LRB- 2005 -RRB- and a 2012 revival of `` Death of a Salesman '' starring Philip Seymour Hoffman .

But he 's probably best known for his movies , including the groundbreaking `` The Graduate '' -LRB- 1967 -RRB- , the Oscar-nominated `` Silkwood '' -LRB- 1983 -RRB- and box-office smash `` The Birdcage '' -LRB- 1996 -RRB- .

He was known as an `` actor 's director , '' one able to pull strong performances from his ensemble and capable of seeing things others did n't .

Dustin Hoffman remembered Nichols ' ability at an American Film Institute tribute . Hoffman observed that Benjamin Braddock , the character he played in `` The Graduate , '' was a tall , blond , WASP-y type in the novel . -LRB- Indeed , among the actors considered for the role was Robert Redford . -RRB- But Nichols saw the character as uncertain and neurotic , qualities Hoffman brought to life on screen .

`` And so I thank you for casting this short , 29-year-old , unknown actor with a prominent nose to play Benjamin Braddock , '' Hoffman said . `` God bless you , sir . You 're more than a great director . You 're a real artist down to your toes , because you 're insanely courageous . ''

Starting with two phrases

Nichols was born Michael Igor Peschkowsky in Berlin in 1931 . With war clouds looming and Nazi persecution of Jews rising , he immigrated to the United States in 1939 .

As recounted in the book `` Faces of America , '' a young Nichols arrived in the United States knowing only two phrases : `` I do n't speak English '' and `` Please , do n't kiss me . '' The family changed its last name to Nichols after settling in New York City , where the family patriarch established a medical practice .

Nichols attended college in Chicago and later headed back to New York , where he studied acting under famed teacher Lee Strasberg . He returned to Chicago , where he started up a comedy troupe and met Elaine May . The pair would go on to form a partnership that would later take Broadway by storm .

Nichols said he took to the stage .

`` I liked doing the stand-up , '' Nichols told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012 . `` I only stopped because Elaine wanted to stop . I 've never understood it . I thought : ` Why ? It 's not a very long show . It does n't cost us anything emotionally . ' ''

He moved behind the scenes and directed Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley in `` Barefoot in the Park , '' which won him his first Tony in 1964 . For a time he was Broadway 's golden boy , with success following success : `` Luv '' -LRB- 1964 -RRB- , `` The Odd Couple '' -LRB- 1965 -RRB- , `` The Apple Tree '' -LRB- 1966 , featuring a young Alan Alda -RRB- , `` Plaza Suite '' -LRB- 1968 -RRB- and `` The Prisoner of Second Avenue '' -LRB- 1971 -RRB- . `` Barefoot , '' `` Odd Couple , '' `` Plaza Suite '' and `` Second Avenue '' were all written by Neil Simon .

He was also the director of the musical `` Annie '' -LRB- 1977 -RRB- , which was one of Broadway 's longest-running musicals when it closed almost six years later .

Notable movies

More acclaim would follow for his work on the big screen . His first film was a biggie : `` Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf '' -LRB- 1966 -RRB- , starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton . It was nominated for 13 Oscars and won five , including a best actress trophy for Taylor .

His next film , however , was in many ways even more impressive : `` The Graduate , '' which made innovative use of pop music -LRB- thanks to Simon and Garfunkel 's songs -RRB- , featured a terrific script by Buck Henry and Calder Willlingham and became a blockbuster sign of the New Hollywood -- one led by youthful moviegoers and antihero protagonists .

`` Nichols and veteran cinematographer Robert Surtees threw out the -LRB- Directors Guild -RRB- playbook for ` The Graduate , ' experimenting wildly with lighting and lenses , lending the film a sense of freewheeling freshness , a sheen of visual inventiveness that has n't dimmed over the years , '' wrote Slant magazine 's Budd Wilkins in a 2012 look back .

Nichols won best director for his work .

His movies never quite caught lightning in a bottle again -- few movies do -- but still contained stirring scenes and fine performances : the launch of the planes in `` Catch-22 '' -LRB- 1970 -RRB- , the sour Jack Nicholson in `` Carnal Knowledge '' -LRB- 1971 -RRB- , the lives of blue-collar nuclear plant workers in `` Silkwood '' -LRB- 1983 -RRB- , the unrestrained glee of the plotting Melanie Griffith in `` Working Girl '' -LRB- 1988 -RRB- .

He also directed the TV production of `` Angels in America '' -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , which won a then record-setting 11 Emmys .

His last film as director was 2007 's `` Charlie Wilson 's War . ''

`` No one was more passionate about his craft than Mike , '' James Goldston , president of ABC News , said in a note to the staff . `` He had recently been immersed in a new project for HBO to adapt ` Master Class , ' Terrence McNally 's Tony Award-winning play about opera legend Maria Callas . The project reunited him with Meryl Streep , one of his most frequent collaborators . ''

Nichols occupied that rare air in the industry of those who have won the EGOT -- an Emmy , a Grammy , an Oscar and a Tony . In 2012 he earned his record sixth Tony for best direction of a play for `` Death of a Salesmen . ''

He met Sawyer later in life -LRB- he was 54 at the time -RRB- and she became his fourth wife . He told The Hollywood Reporter that he first spotted the then - `` 60 Minutes '' correspondent on a flight and later struck up a conversation with her .

`` I found her and said , ` You 're my hero . ' And she said : ` No , you 're my hero . Do you ever have lunch ? ' She wanted to interview me for '60 Minutes . ' I pretended that I was up for it , and we had about 14 lunches . ''

The couple was married for 26 years .

In addition to Sawyer , Nichols is survived by his three children -- Daisy , Max and Jenny -- and four grandchildren .
