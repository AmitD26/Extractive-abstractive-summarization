-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.N. panel on Friday said with 95 % certainty that the effects of climate change are real and largely man-made .

To which pretty much everyone in Shishmaref , Alaska , said ...

Well , duh .

If only they were n't so polite .

The tiny Inupiat Eskimo community in near-Arctic Alaska -- which I was lucky enough to visit on a reporting trip in 2009 and which is home to some of the sweetest and most colorful people you 'll meet -- has been watching climate change happen to it for years now .

Locals see the sea ice forming later each year , the coast eroding and the permafrost melting . The hunting seasons have shifted and lakes have dried up .

The coast had become so unstable that one house toppled off the edge of the barrier island that harbors the village . When I was there , the town was considering relocating to more stable ground .

Now those plans seem to have dried up , too .

Stanley Tocktoo , the mayor of Shishmaref , told me by phone Thursday that residents have tabled their plans to move the town . Money is one reason . Another is that they were unable to find a suitable location upon which everyone could agree .

Potential relocation spots also are hit by the changing climate , he said .

`` The island is only a quarter-mile wide by three miles -LRB- long -RRB- , probably narrower now . I do n't know how long we 'll be able to be on this island , '' he said .

`` These floods get pretty fierce now , worse than before . ''

It should seem laughable in 2013 that anyone would try to deny the reality of climate change , which is causing tougher droughts , stronger storms , rising seas and melting ice . The effects are scattered , to be sure . It 's difficult to attribute any single storm to macro-changes in the atmosphere , for example .

But it 's clear things are changing . It 's clear that 's for the worse .

And it 's clear -- has been clear -- that we 're to blame for that .

I 'm thankful the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change continues to update all of us on the latest science and evidence .

But it 's already obvious to everyone paying attention that we need to act in new and profoundly urgent ways to blunt the future impact of climate change , and to mitigate the changes that are already taking shape all over the world .

The Marshall Islands and other Pacific nations that could be swallowed up by rising seas have banded together to try to make their economies 50 % or 100 % renewable .

The urgency is clear to them . They fear for survival .

But in the United States , we 're still running around with our eyes shut .

Sure , President Barack Obama has tried , between arguing for strikes on Syria and trying to resurrect the middle class , to make climate change a front-burner issue . But Congress has n't followed suit . America remains a serious laggard on climate action .

Perhaps we should open our eyes , and turn them to Alaska .

There , the evidence is like a slap in the face .

A wake-up call .

`` The town is coming apart , getting smaller and smaller . ''

That 's Shelton Kokeok , a 68-year-old who lives , with his wife , Clara , at the very edge of the Shishmaref coast , which has been thawing and falling into the sea .

A multimillion-dollar U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project has bought Kokeok some peace of mind . The engineers piled rocks high on the shore , as if imploring the land to stay . But even the engineers know that the measures are temporary .

The Army Corps of Engineers in Alaska had $ 45 million to deal with coastal erosion issues that are related to climate change , according to Bruce Sexauer , chief of planning for the Alaska District . That money ran out though . The rock wall in Shishmaref was planned to be nearly twice as long as it is , but money is now only available if the village can put up 35 % of the cash needed to build it . I 'm pretty sure a place where people hunt seals for food and harvest ice for water does n't have millions to spare .

It 's a beautiful , generous village . But not a rich one .

The wall , as it stands , likely will buy Shishmaref several years .

But much already has been lost .

When I visited him four years ago , Kokeok told me he blames the death of his youngest son , Norman , on the changes to the climate . Norman fell through a thin sheet of ice on the first week of June several years ago .

That area should have been frozen solid , Kokeok said .

He told me , back in 2009 , that he has n't been the same since .

I was pleased to hear on Thursday that , after two knee replacements , Kokeok was able to go caribou hunting with his grandchildren and daughter this summer .

That 's something he had n't done in years .

The land here , and the community , means so much to him .

Another community , Newtok , which was the subject of a fascinating series by The Guardian , is actually in the process of relocating now , according to Sexauer .

Dave Williams , a colleague of Sexauer 's , told me that the permafrost is thawing out from beneath the town , making it nearly unlivable .

`` Some of the boardwalks are underwater during the summertime , '' he said . `` You ca n't step off the boardwalk and walk anywhere without getting wet up to your crotch and covered in muck . You can see that when it floods now , houses that were above the flood level now get water in them or are surrounded by water and -LRB- you -RRB- ca n't go anywhere . ... It happens slowly , over years and years . ''

Slowly , over years and years .

But still , impossible not to notice .

I could think of a few senators I 'd like to send up to that village to wade in the muck . Maybe it would alleviate their nagging sense of industry-funded doubt .

Or , at the very least , they 'd have to make excuses in a ruined pair of pants .
