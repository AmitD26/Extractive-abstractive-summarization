-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just in time for Halloween , the new season of `` American Horror Story '' has fans checking for monsters -- actually , make that clowns -- under the bed .

Brad Falchuck and Ryan Murphy 's acclaimed anthology series debuted its fourth season Wednesday night , this time taking viewers inside a carnival of `` curiosities '' stationed in Jupiter , Florida , in 1952 .

`` American Horror Story 's '' previous seasons have involved a haunted house , an asylum and a coven of witches .

Several of the FX series ' usual players are back , including Jessica Lange as the show 's ringleader ; Evan Peters as Jimmy Darling , a.k.a. the housewife-pleasing `` Lobster Boy '' ; Kathy Bates as Ethel , the `` bearded lady '' ; Angela Bassett as the three-breasted Desiree Dupree ; and Sarah Paulson as conjoined twins Bette and Dot -- and yes , Paulson plays both parts .

`` Bringing her to walking , talking two-headed life is achievement enough . ... But the real special effect is Paulson , who invests the two sisters with such distinct personalities , '' said Time magazine 's James Poniewozik in a review . `` The way the two Paulsons carry themselves and react to each other -- even argue -- is a triumph of both editing and performance . She 's her own best co-star , playing her own worst enemy . ''

In addition to these '50s - era sideshow stars , there 's someone else lurking around town : John Carroll Lynch 's incredibly creepy clown , Twisty , who happens to have a penchant for murder and kidnapping .

In other words , exactly what you want to see right before you turn out the lights . It was apparently a bit much for some .

But reaction from critics has been more mixed .

'' ` Freak Show ' ... still has the high style we 've grown to expect , '' said the New York Times ' Mike Hale . `` And it still has plenty of clever touches in word and picture ... But it 's not particularly scary , and does n't even feel that creepy or freakish , despite the sideshow setting and the obvious attempt to emulate one of the eeriest of American movies , Tod Browning 's ` Freaks , ' from 1932 . ''

Entertainment Weekly agreed that `` American Horror Story : Freak Show '' owes much to that 1932 film but adds that `` Murphy and Falchuk pay homage to that movie while skillfully mixing fresh aspects with the familiar . ` AHS ' may no longer have the element of surprise on its side , but it remains , to quote the lyrics of a certain David Bowie tune performed by -LRB- Jessica -RRB- Lange , the freakiest show . ''

New York Magazine 's Vulture cautioned that it 's too early to tell , but at least `` on the basis of its first two episodes , '' `` American Horror Story : Freak Show '' appears `` to be the best -LRB- season -RRB- yet , or at the very least , the best directed . ''
