-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When I was doing my degree in computer science in Ghana 's Valley View University 10 years ago , there just were seven girls in the class . After four years , only four graduated and out of that number , just two of us have stayed in technical roles . Today , my little sister 's computer science class has at least 30 % females and a smaller drop-off rate .

All across Africa , the number of women entering the tech industry is improving thanks to the several nonprofit groups teaching girls how to code and the bigger availability of funds . As a result , more women are training to become tech professionals . Yet , a large number of them are having to leave their jobs after a few years as they ca n't break the glass ceiling in an industry that 's still largely male-dominated .

To address this , the Google Developer Group for women was created in Ghana less than two years ago . But soon the organizers came under attack from some men in the wider Google Developer Group community , with comments like `` why do you need a women only group ? '' One guy 's email even said , `` leave them alone , maybe they want to create apps about menstrual periods together . ''

Such attitudes are widespread . I run the Women in Tech group in Ghana and at one of our monthly events one young female computer scientist approached me and said : `` They keep telling me I can not be really good at IT and also be a good wife and a mother . '' Straight away , I introduced her to Estelle Akrofi , the Google Country Manager for Ghana , a mother of two and an all-round success ; then I introduced her to Otema Yirenkyi , the country manager of Microsoft Ghana and mother of a beautiful five-year - old .

Uphill task

The problems that African women in tech face are not very different from the ones female techies in many other parts of the world also come across . Yet , these challenges , coupled with some Africa-specific problems like power shortages and broadband inaccessibility , create an uphill task for women wanting to enter the industry and develop the high-level technical skills required in order to progress .

Yet , I know there is progress , and the examples are many -- female tech entrepreneurs like Regina Agyare -LRB- Soronko Solutions -RRB- , Anne Amuzu -LRB- Nandi Mobile -RRB- , Rebecca Enonchong -LRB- Apps Tech -RRB- , and myself are all running their own tech enterprises and succeeding at it .

Pan-African Women in Tech meet up

Up until now , no one had attempted to build a pan-African Women in Tech network that would allow us to compare our challenges , learn from each other and connect across borders to expand our influence . That lack is what motivated myself , Ethel Ella Mbawe from Zambia , Barbara Bingu from Uganda , Sam Beckbessinger from South Africa and Akaliza Keza Gara from Rwanda to organize in early August the first Women in Tech Africa meet up .

More than 150 women signed up to the event that was supposed to happen online via Google hangout on August 2 . Yet , bad Internet connection and technical challenges marred the event and made it difficult for the participants to communicate .

But while we were trying to fix the technical challenges we noticed something interesting happening on the event 's page : the women had already started introducing themselves and talking to each other .

We saw how big the desire was to network and to share knowledge that we quickly decided to move the discussion to Twitter and start a live chat . The need to connect , to learn and to share was greater than any technical challenge .

In the end , the Twitter conversation with the hashtag #WtechAfrica had the reach of 74,502 and 195,209 impressions on Twitter connecting female technologists all over Africa ably supported by one of our speakers Enyonam Kumahor . Here are some of the highlights of the discussion .

Looking back into history and comparing it to today we know technology is not just a man 's world . It is imperative that African women take advantage of this to provide a sustainable environment that would encourage and promote technology amongst women . So of course we will run the event again , this time with the lessons we learned and maybe strong sponsorships to help us succeed .
