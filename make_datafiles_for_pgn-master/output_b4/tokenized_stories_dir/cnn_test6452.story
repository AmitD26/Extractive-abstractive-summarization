-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prosecutors say he may be a criminal . People who say they know him describe him as a great dad .

So what 's the story with Justin Ross Harris , the Cobb County , Georgia , man accused of murder after leaving his toddler strapped into his car seat under a blistering Southern sun ?

The truth is , we do n't know much . Police and prosecutors are being tight-lipped about the case against Harris , who is charged with felony murder and second-degree child cruelty in the death of 22-month-old Cooper Harris . He 's refusing visitors to the Cobb County jail -- including CNN . His family is n't talking , and his attorney has not returned repeated telephone calls from CNN .

Here 's what we do know :

Harris is 33 years old . He has worked at Home Depot for two years . Home Depot Corporate Communications Manager Catherine H. Woodling said he worked `` on our . com business , but I 'm not sure what his title is . ''

He was placed on unpaid leave after the charges were filed in the June 18 incident -- a routine action in such situations , Woodling said .

He held jobs at the University of Alabama from August 2001 until May 2006 as a parking monitor and later as a mail delivery clerk , said Cathy Andreen , university director of media relations .

He worked as a police dispatcher in Tuscaloosa , Alabama , from June 10 , 2006 , to May 22 , 2009 , according to Police Department spokesman Sgt. Brent Blankley . He said the department would confirm only Harris ' tenure , and not any details from his work history , so we do n't know why he left the job .

In May 2012 , Harris graduated from the University of Alabama with a bachelor 's degree in commerce and business administration , having majored in management information systems , Andreen said .

The boy 's mother , Leanna Harris , is listed as having the same home address as the father , but she told CNN last week that she 's been advised not to discuss the case with the media . They were married May 7 , 2006 , in Tuscaloosa , according to the Tuscaloosa County marriage license clerk .

A woman who knew Harris as a teenager but has n't seen him in 15 years described him as `` a good kid '' who spent a lot of time at University Church of Christ in Tuscaloosa , where Cooper is to be remembered at a funeral Saturday .

`` We were always happy to have him in our home . And we were happy that he was friends with our child , '' Carol Brown told CNN 's Nick Valencia .

People who say they know Harris posted change.org petitions asking that the charges against him be dropped but closed the petitions this week . One of the organizers posted , `` based on the recent developments this petition is no longer revelant . ''

CNN could n't immediately confirm the authenticity of the petition comments , many of which speak glowingly of Harris as a man and a father .

One petition signer , identified as Matt Wiley of Northpoint , Alabama , described Harris as `` a great husband and a great father . ''

Another , identified as Michael Gordon of Northpoint , wrote of what he said was Harris ' `` grace and exemplary attitude . ''

`` He has been nothing but a caring father and supporting husband . He worked full time and went to school for many years to get where he wanted to be , '' he said .

A petition signer identified as William Overstreet wrote that he could n't imagine that man he says he knows intentionally killed his child .

`` I 've known Ross for over 10 years and he is a selfless man who loved people and loved his family more , '' the post reads . `` NOTHING in his life even hints at this behavior . ''
