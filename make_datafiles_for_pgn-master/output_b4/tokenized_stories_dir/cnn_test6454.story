-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a down economy , pursuing the American dream can be challenging , but restaurant owner Todd Steele was willing to take a chance .

For nearly 20 years , Steele worked all levels of the restaurant game , from dishwasher to general manager , before partnering with his mom and opening his own eatery called Metrovino on Portland , Oregon 's , 11th Avenue streetcar line .

`` I would not have picked this spot if it were n't for the streetcar , and my business has certainly benefited from our location , '' Steele said . `` Streetcars are also a romantic way to travel , and they are fun to watch from inside Metrovino . ''

While America lost much of its love for streetcars as public transportation during the 1960s , a few cities have kept the romance burning . The heart of San Francisco includes its nearly 140-year-old electric cable car system . In New Orleans , the location for Tennessee Williams ' `` A Streetcar Named Desire , '' many tourists are drawn by the picturesque St. Charles Avenue Line .

The Obama administration recently offered some U.S. cities a piece of a $ 130 million federal fund for streetcar projects aimed at reducing traffic congestion , cutting pollution and reliance on foreign oil , and creating jobs . Transit systems in Dallas , St. Louis , Cincinnati and Charlotte , North Carolina , are slated to share grants from the Federal Transit Administration 's Urban Circulator program .

Other cities have plans and other funding for streetcar projects , too .

But not everyone is a fan of streetcars . `` This is a waste of money , '' said Ron Utt of The Heritage Foundation .

`` Streetcars certainly create jobs , but they are a poor investment and create little lasting value , '' he said . `` Because it requires extensive ongoing subsidies , it is also unsustainable . Improving roads would be the better bet in most communities . ''

CNN iReporter Raymond Becich is a supporter . `` Sure , Portland paid incentives to businesses to build along the streetcar -LRB- line -RRB- , '' he said . `` But how is this any different than any governmental jurisdiction giving tax breaks and other incentives for businesses to relocate to a city or state ? ''

Streetcars have transformed a `` blighted warehouse district ... into a vibrant area of shops , grocery stores , restaurants and apartments that provide entertainment and employment , '' he said .

But there 's nothing streetcars can do that buses ca n't do better , faster , safer and for far less money , said CATO Institute senior fellow Randal O'Toole . `` Even though a single light-rail train can hold more passengers than a bus , a bus route can move more passengers per hour than any light-rail line . ''

Portland 's streetcar system attracts about 12,000 daily riders at an average ticket cost of $ 1.47 . Its creators credit it with $ 3.5 billion in surrounding development , including shops , restaurants and 10,000 new housing units .

Also , streetcars that run on either hydro or coal-generated electricity spit out less greenhouse gases per passenger mile than diesel buses , according to University of California researchers .

So , what is a streetcar , exactly ? The transportation community generally defines it as a rail-based passenger tram that shares streets with cars and trucks .

Becich said he rides his city 's system so often he 's considering selling his car .

`` Riding public transportation in Portland is quick , easy and enjoyable , '' he said . `` It 's absolutely easier than driving , and streetcar operators go out of their way to be helpful . ''

But is it faster than driving ? `` If you count the time from point A to B , it is slower to ride the streetcar , '' Becich said . `` But if you factor in time to find a place to park and the cost of parking , it is more convenient and cheaper to ride the streetcar . ''

It 's no secret that public transit offers commuters an escape from hectic traffic and a chance to read , make phone calls or snooze .

These transportation issues were recently at the heart of an $ 85 million question faced by leaders and residents of Fort Worth , Texas : Should they green-light a proposed three-mile streetcar line from LaGrave Field through downtown and into the near-south side ?

After much debate , city leaders decided `` no '' earlier this month `` because of the timing and questions regarding how it would be fully funded . ''

As many as 2,250 people were projected to use the system daily , according to a city study . Utt says that 's not very many riders , considering the cost of building and maintaining the line . `` Most ridership projections are overly optimistic , '' he said . `` There are good reasons why most cities got rid of their trolley systems in the '50s and '60s .

A federal transportation official acknowledged that ridership is often low , according to industry studies .

In Michigan , supporters are working to bring a light-rail line to revitalize downtown Detroit , a city among the hardest hit by the recession .

But on Capitol Hill , a House transportation committee spokesman acknowledged that there may be less federal money available for streetcar projects as Republicans prepare to take control of the House in January .

Transportation blogger Yonah Freemark agreed . `` Based on recent decisions by party members at the state and national level , that will mean a renewed emphasis on roadway projects and less proposed funding for transit . ''
