Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two California men were sentenced to prison Thursday for their roles in the severe beating of a San Francisco Giants fan after a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2011 .

Marvin Norwood , 33 , and Louie Sanchez , 31 , were sentenced to four years and eight years , respectively .

Members of victim Bryan Stow 's family appeared in court and made statements to the defendants and the judge during the sentencing .

Now brain-damaged as a result of the beating , Stow is disabled and unable to care for himself , said his father , David .

`` The time you serve will be insignificant to what Bryan must endure . However , the years you spend in prison is what you two cretins deserve , '' David Stow said to the two men .

Norwood , however , was scheduled to be released with credit for time served ; he had been in jail in the case for more than two years . Federal authorities plan to take Norwood into custody , if released by local authorities , because Norwood faces a federal charge of a being a felon in possession of firearms , said spokesman Thom Mrozek with the U.S. Attorney 's office in Los Angeles .

Earlier in the day , Norwood pleaded guilty to felony assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury . Sanchez pleaded guilty to felony mayhem .

In exchange for their guilty pleas , other felony charges were dropped against the defendants . Both men are from Rialto , California .

The Dodgers issued a statement saying `` we are pleased that the culpable parties have finally accepted responsibility for their actions and have been sentenced for their crimes . ''

The baseball team declined to comment further because the Stow family is suing the organization in connection with the beating and the stadium 's security .

Prosecutors say the men attacked Stow , now 45 , in the Dodgers ' stadium parking lot after the Opening Day game on March 31 , 2011 . The paramedic from Santa Cruz went into a coma as a result of the beating and , after returning to consciousness , is still struggling with a severe brain injury .

The men , who appeared in court in handcuffs , were harshly criticized by Judge George Lomeli .

`` Mr. Stow will be forever trapped in the medical condition '' that the men put him in , he said during the sentencing . `` I have to comment on the attack , which was absolutely brutal .

`` You blindsided Mr. Stow , '' the judge said . `` You are a complete coward . ''

Sanchez smirked during the judge 's admonishment .

`` You show no remorse whatsoever , '' Lomeli added . `` At the end of the day , it was only a game . ... And you lost perspective . ''

A statement from the district attorney 's office said Sanchez attacked Stow from behind in `` an unprovoked attack '' and witnesses testified that Norwood prevented Stow 's friends from helping him .

Caregivers and family members shower , dress and feed Stow , who takes 13 medications a day , said sister Bonnie Stow .

`` No sentencing you receive will be long enough , '' she told the defendants . `` Your lack of regret makes me despise you even more . ''

Another sister , Erin Collins , said the damage to her brother 's brain was catastrophic . A shunt now protrudes on the right side of his skull , and its left side is slightly sunken . His skull has deep scars .

`` Because of your actions , Bryan ca n't go to the bathroom by himself , '' Collins said . `` He has to wear adult diapers . I hate having to say that out loud , but it shows the severity of what you did .

`` Being here , I hope to see one tiny bit of remorse in order to not think you are both that despicable , but I do n't . How can we begin to consider forgiveness when you are n't even asking for it , '' Collins said .

Collins also read aloud in court a statement written by Stow 's wife that was directed to the defendants :

`` Our son Tyler 's first word was ball . His next word was daddy . And when they started playing catch , Bryan promised to play catch with him every day , and he did until you took that away from him . Our daughter , Tabitha , loved to ride bikes with her daddy and he did that every day he could , again , until you both took that away .

`` Based on your actions , it is completely obvious that you have no respect for human life . ''
