-LRB- InStyle -RRB- -- After years in the bronze age , when sun-kissed cheeks and gloss reigned supreme , fall 's return to glamour means that lipstick is making a major comeback . Lipstick outsold gloss by $ 76 million last year , and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas that are more wearable than ever .

So pucker up . We 'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly , along with the most flattering shades for day and night .

For foolproof application , stick with sheer , subdued shades in the morning and save deep , bold colors -LRB- which require more time and precision -RRB- for night .

Daytime equation

1 . Condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen , like Softlips Raspberry with Green Tea SPF 20 . `` Dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower , when your lips are still a little moist , '' suggests Hollywood pro Kara Yoshimoto Bua . The smoother your lips , the more perfect your lipstick will look .

2 . Choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube . A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color . Try Neutrogena Moistureshine Soothing Lipsheers in Fresh Rose .

3 . Blot , reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain , says Bua . `` The color looks more natural and lasts longer . '' Instead of tissues , use lint-free blotting papers , like Boscia Fresh Blotting Linens -LRB- $ 10 -RRB- .

Nighttime equation

1 . Exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy . Sally Hansen Gentle Peel for Rough Lips -LRB- $ 10 ; at drugstores -RRB- uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches .

2 . Create a base with a gel-based primer that fills in fine lines around the mouth and helps lipstick go on more smoothly . One to try : Olay Regenerist lip treatment -LRB- $ 19 ; at drugstores -RRB- .

3 . Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding , says Robin Fredriksz , who gave Barrymore her deep fuchsia lip . To avoid an unnaturally dark outline , use a shade that 's lighter than your lipstick , like Revlon Colorstay lip liner in Plum -LRB- $ 8 ; at drugstores -RRB- .

4 . Brush on color for more control . Try : Shu Uemura Kolinsky Portable Extra lipbrush -LRB- $ 35 -RRB- with Isadora Perfect Moisture lipstick in Bordeaux Red -LRB- $ 11 -RRB- .
