-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From the scorched corn fields of Kansas , to the storm-lashed hills of Nicaragua , an increasingly volatile climate is posing ever greater challenges for farmers around the world .

But opportunity is arising from crisis , through next-generation climate analysis tools that could make agriculture - the world 's largest industry - vastly more efficient and profitable .

The Climate Corporation , founded by two ex-Google engineers , is dragging a famously technophobic industry into the digital era . Through exhaustive data modeling and an elite pool of climate and agriculture analysts , the Corporation is seeking to take guesswork out of the field .

`` The increasing uncertainty in agriculture , with the changing patterns of weather we are seeing , is making it difficult for farmers to grow successful crops consistently , '' says CEO David Friedberg . `` The tools we provide help farmers make smarter decisions based on analytical techniques , rather than intuition . ''

Data revolution

Friedberg sees `` huge opportunities '' to revolutionize a vast industry that employs over one billion people and occupies almost half the planet 's total land , but has not adapted to the possibilities of data , despite its vulnerability to climate change .

The Climate Corporation 's model produces hyper-local climate forecasts for individual farms , using satellite imaging , growth modeling and simulations . This is supported by decades of data , much of it from government sources , covering crop performance , soil properties , moisture levels and weather .

The free `` Basic '' platform allows farmers to monitor their land and crops , while the `` Climate Pro '' platform includes a suite of features such as to optimize use of nitrogen fertilizer , control pests , and plan perfect harvests .

`` Fertilizer is the number one expense for farmers and they are basically throwing away money , '' says Friedberg . `` We can help farmers decide how much fertilizer to put in the field at what point in the season , reducing what goes into the atmosphere and waterways , so that 100 % goes to plants to deliver food . ''

While Friedberg is a strict vegetarian and keen to support environmental protection , his priority is to convince farmers with an economic argument .

`` I do n't see collective action on climate change in agriculture . We need to create commercial incentives to change behavior , that 's where we can be successful . ''

The company estimate they can make $ 20 billion in efficiency savings in the U.S. by applying their data models , and increase corn field yields by 30 % an acre .

`` Our initial results show a 10-20 % increase in yield , '' said Tim Malterer , a Minnesota farmer that uses the software .

More with less

With the UN 's agriculture body claiming that the food supply needs to increase 70 % by 2050 to meet the needs of a growing population , without cultivating new farmland , there is an imperative for the industry to do more with less .

The challenge is daunting but the Corporation 's ambitions are on a global scale . Having been recently acquired by Monsanto in a $ 1 billion deal -- which Friedberg claims has not altered its work -- the group has vast resources .

Its technology covers 50 million acres in the U.S. , including a third of total land for corn and soybean , serving thousands of farmers . This figure is growing rapidly , and its platforms will be rolled out internationally from 2015 .

That level of adoption would enable dramatic changes in the industry . Friedberg would like to see farmers choosing different crops to suit the climate data -- such as switching from wheat to corn in Canada as the weather warms -- and planning five-season cycles that use a better understanding of the changing properties of soil .

Optimal performance

The opportunities for data in agriculture are also shown by Edyn , a Californian startup that emerged from one of the state 's worst ever droughts .

`` Around the world , water stress has been one of first impacts of climate change on agriculture , '' says founder Jason Aramburu . `` But most farmers still have n't adopted water saving techniques . ''

With award-winning designer Yves Behar , Edyn produced a multi-faceted sensor that allows growers to micro-manage their plots , providing constant readings on moisture level , with a connected water valve that keeps the level optimal . It also gives readings of light , temperature , humidity and fertility so that even inexperienced users can sustain high performance yields .

The device , which more than trebled its crowdfunding goal , is initially targeted at smaller growers . But Aramburu wants to build immense data sets from environmental input , which would scale to the needs of high volume food production . The sensor is undergoing trials with major farm operators .

Aramburu is confident about the integration of data , but believes the industry must change now to protect livelihoods and the environment .

`` It 's a question of when , not if , '' he says . `` This is as big an opportunity as the Internet was , in one of the last big industries that has not adopted big data .

`` If we do nothing , more farmers will have to leave their land over the next decades ... which means creating new farmland , which would have a dramatic environmental impact . ''

Data modeling in agriculture has great potential , believes Mckenzie Funk , author of `` Windfall , '' an investigation of how businesses are adapting to climate change and in some cases seeking to exacerbate it .

`` Hyper local data ca n't hurt macro farming , although it 's still early for the science and we may not see the full effects for five or 10 years , '' says Funk . `` If efficiencies deliver profits that will be a major incentive for change . ''

Funk adds that improving efficiency of existing farmland would have less negative effects than cultivating new land , and hopes the concept is expanded .

`` I do n't think there 's a problem with people making money from climate change . My only concern is whether the technology would be expanded to farmers everywhere , whether they can afford it in places like the Sahara , otherwise the effects -LRB- of climate change -RRB- will continue to get worse . ''

With the right information , even the most extreme conditions can be profitable .
