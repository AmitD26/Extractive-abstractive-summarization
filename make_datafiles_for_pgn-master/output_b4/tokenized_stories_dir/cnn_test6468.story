Pope Francis created 19 new cardinals Saturday in a ceremony in the Vatican 's St. Peter 's Basilica -- the first such appointments since he was elected pontiff last March .

The new cardinals come from countries around the world , hailing from as far afield as Brazil , Ivory Coast , Burkina Faso , South Korea and Haiti .

The pope presented them with the traditional biretta , or red cap , and ring at a formal ceremony called a public consistory .

The scarlet color of the cap symbolizes the cardinals ' willingness to die for their faith .

Looking frail , Benedict , the Pope Emeritus , lined up with the existing cardinals for the ceremony in the historic church .

When last year he became the first pope in almost six centuries to stand down , Benedict said he would live a life of seclusion and study .

His presence in St. Peter 's Basilica alongside that of Francis and the cardinals who will one day vote for his successor is a highly unusual event .

Francis spoke

Sixteen of the new cardinals are under the age of 80 , making them eligible to elect a new pope when the time comes , according to Vatican Radio .

Three of them are over age 80 and `` are chosen for their distinguished service '' to the Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church , it said .

One of those is 98-year-old Archbishop Loris Capovilla , who was the secretary of Pope John XXIII . He was not present for the ceremony , but will be presented with his biretta in the coming days .

Two of the newly appointed cardinals already hold top Vatican positions -- Archbishop Pietro Parolin is its secretary of state , while Archbishop Gerhard Mueller is head of the church 's chief doctrinal office , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith .

No Americans were named among the new members of the college of cardinals , but there is one Canadian , Quebec Archbishop Gerald Cyprien Lacroix .

Francis : Not a promotion

In a letter sent last month to the chosen clergy , Francis gave some words of advice about remaining humble .

Becoming a cardinal `` does not signify a promotion , an honor nor a decoration : it is simply a service that demands a broader vision and a bigger heart , '' he said .

`` And , although it seems a paradox , this ability to look further and love more universally with greater intensity can be acquired only by following the way of the Lord : The way of lowliness and of humility , taking the form of a servant . ''

Commenting last month on the clergy named by Francis , Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi highlighted the geographical range and diversity of the countries they come from .

`` The choice of cardinals of Burkina Faso and Haiti shows concern for people struck by poverty , '' he is quoted as saying by Vatican Radio .
