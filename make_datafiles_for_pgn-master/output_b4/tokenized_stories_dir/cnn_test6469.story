Bayern Munich has honored the remarkable life of its former president Kurt Landauer , who was hounded out of office 80 years ago by the Nazi regime and sent to a concentration camp .

During four terms as president of the German football club , Landauer is credited with establishing Bayern as an international force and nurturing the club 's youth policy .

The legacy of Landauer , who served as a soldier for the German army in World War I but was later imprisoned in Dachau , is to be remembered by the club , who has named him as Bayern 's third honorary president .

`` This accolade is long overdue , '' said club president Uli Hoeness during a presentation to Landauer 's nephew Uri Siegel , his only surviving relative .

`` For my uncle , there was only ever FC Bayern , '' Siegel recalled on the Bayern Munich website .

Landauer was born into a Jewish family in 1884 and at the turn of the 20th Century was playing for Bayern Munich 's youth team .

His football career was cut short when he left for Switzerland to train as a banker but when he returned to Munich he was soon elected as president of Bayern in 1913 .

The outbreak of World War I interrupted Landauer 's term and he left to serve in the German army .

After the war , Landauer again took up the post of club president in 1919 and it was during this period he established his legacy with the club .

Founding father

`` The president , who favored investment in the team rather than the construction of a stadium demanded by a section of the membership , rates to this day as one of the founding fathers of the club 's widely-admired youth policy , '' explained Bayern Munich 's website .

Bayern also won their first domestic title under Landauer 's tenure in 1932 .

But the following year with the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany and its extreme anti-Semitic policies soon brought a dark shadow over the club 's achievements .

The Nazi authorities branded Bayern a `` Jewish club '' and the club lost team members and fans , and fell back in the national rankings .

Landauer resigned the presidency and in 1938 he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp .

His service as a solider during World War I meant he was released after 33 days and he left for Switzerland .

However , his three brothers all died under the Nazi regime , while his sister Gabriele was deported and is still officially listed as missing .

Auschwitz goalkeeper

Landauer returned to Munich in 1947 and resumed presidency of his beloved Bayern in 1947 to 1951 . He died 10 years later at the age of 77 .

The former youth player and four time club president has joined player Franz Beckenbauer -- star of the team which won three European Cupss in the mid-Seventies -- and former president Wilhelm Neudecker as Bayern 's only honorary presidents .

`` His efforts were pioneering during an extremely difficult time for FC Bayern , '' Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge recalled in 2009 .

`` He experienced things which so many people unfortunately experienced in those times . We must do everything necessary to prevent times like that happening ever again .

`` Remembrance is a vital component in that . ''

In Britain , a former prisoner of war , Ron Jones , has also detailed his painful memories of football under the Nazi regime in a new memoir .

The 96-year-old recounts his experiences in the Auschwitz death camp where he and fellow British soldiers formed a football team .

His story has been published in a 2013 book called The Auschwitz Goalkeeper .
