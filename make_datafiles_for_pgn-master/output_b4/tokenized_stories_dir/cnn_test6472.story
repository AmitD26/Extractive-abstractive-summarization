Pushing her meal cart into the hospital room , a research assistant hands out tall glasses of reddish-pink liquid , along with a gentle warning : `` Remember , you guys have to finish all your Kool-Aid . ''

One by one , young volunteers chug down their drinks , each carefully calibrated to contain a mix of water , flavoring and a precisely calibrated solution of high fructose corn syrup : 55 % fructose , 45 % glucose .

The participants are part of an ongoing study run by Kimber Stanhope , a nutritional biologist at the University of California , Davis . Volunteers agree to spend several weeks as lab rats : their food carefully measured , their bodies subjected to a steady dose of scans and blood tests . At first , each volunteer receives meals with no added sugars . But then , the sweetened drinks start showing up .

For the final two weeks of the study , volunteers drank three of the sweet concoctions daily -- about 500 calories of added sugar , or 25 % of all calories for the adult women in the study . Within just two weeks , their blood chemistry was out of whack . In one striking change , the volunteers had elevated levels of LDL cholesterol , a risk factor for heart disease .

While force-feeding junk food may sound extreme , this controlled diet is not so far from the real world . A 20-ounce regular soda contains 227 calories , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture -LRB- USDA -RRB- . That single drink is more than 10 % of the total calories an adult woman needs to maintain a healthy weight , according to USDA diet guidelines . Meanwhile , about 1 in 4 Americans gets at least 200 calories a day from sugary drinks . These numbers , along with work like Stanhope 's , gives ammunition to doctors and public health officials who say soda should be treated as public health enemy No. 1 .

`` Soft drinks and sugar-containing beverages are the low hanging fruit in public health today , '' says Dr. David Ludwig , director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center , at Children 's Hospital in Boston . `` Many children are consuming 300 calories per day or more , just in sugar-containing beverages . Compare the challenge of giving up three glasses of sugary beverages , versus getting them to do two hours of moderate physical activity . ''

`` If you switch from Coke to water , that 's easy , '' says Elizabeth Mayer-Davis , a professor at the University of North Carolina and a recent president of the American Diabetes Association . `` You do n't have to make big complicated changes in how you cook , and shop , and all that . And the number of calories you can save , can be substantial . ''

Some in the soft drink business say their product has been unfairly singled out . `` Consumption of added sugars is going down , '' says Karen Hanretty , Vice-President of Public Affairs for the American Beverage Association . `` Soda consumption has declined , even as obesity has increased . To say that sugar is solely responsible for obesity , does n't make sense . ''

Coca-Cola has adapted to meet consumer demand , says Rhona Applebaum , the company 's Vice President and Chief Scientific Regulatory Officer . More than ever , she says , those consumers choose low-sugar products . Today , Diet Coke and Coke Zero make up 41 % of Coke 's North American soda sales , up from 32 % a decade ago . `` Our products are part of a balanced , sensible diet , and they can be enjoyed as a valuable part of any meal , including snacks , '' says Applebaum .

Buried in the flood of horror stories about America 's obesity crisis , are a few hopeful signs . Not only is sugar consumption going down , but obesity rates among girls and women have actually stayed flat since 1999 , according to Cynthia Ogden , a scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- . For boys and men , those levels have increased only modestly since around 2006 , Ogden says .

Coincidentally or not , the leveling off of obesity coincides with a drop in the amount of soda that Americans consume . Consumption of soda -- both regular and diet -- has fallen by 17.3 % since 1998 , according to Beverage Digest .

Of course soda is n't the only concern . An 8-ounce glass of fruit punch or apple juice has nearly 130 calories . The same glass of chocolate milk has more than 200 -- a solid 20 percent of all recommended daily calories . Overall , added sugars -- which includes both natural sugar , and high fructose corn syrup -- make up about a sixth of all calories taken in , according to USDA figures . Somewhat more than a third of those sugars come from soda and other drinks .

That 's why most people who take a hard look at American diets say that cutting out sweetened drinks , is the first step for anyone struggling with weight or diabetes .

`` If we create the assumption that doing one thing will reduce the epidemic -LSB- of obesity -RSB- , we 're making a mistake , '' says Dr. William Dietz , director of the CDC 's Division of Nutrition , Physical Activity , and Obesity . `` But within the dietary side , we have to focus on where the biggest action is . ''

The action , says Dietz and others , lies with sugar and its close cousin , high-fructose corn syrup -LRB- HFCS -RRB- . Most sweet drinks , including nearly all soda in the United States , use HFCS .

Not everyone agrees they 're equivalent . While most studies show that table sugar and HFCS play an equal role in weight gain , some research suggests that HFCS -- which usually contains 10 % more fructose than sucrose -- is more likely to change the body 's metabolism , in ways that can increase risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes .

But most scientists say the differences are subtle . That includes even Stanhope , whose work has focused on comparing the effects of fructose and other sugars . In terms of advising patients or making public health policy , she says , there is n't much difference . `` I think we really , at this point , need to treat them all alike . ''

`` Are sweetened drinks the only reason we have epidemics of obesity and diabetes ? No , they 're not , '' says Mayer-Davis , the past ADA president . `` But sometimes the easy answer , is the answer . ''
