On Veterans Day , former Army special ops officer Gary Linfoot took a brisk stroll around the Statue of Liberty .

That 's remarkable because Linfoot is a paraplegic -- injured while on one of his many tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan . He 's been wheelchair-bound and paralyzed below the waist since 2008 .

But new technology has offered Linfoot the opportunity to walk again .

The bionic suit

It 's possible because of a kind of wearable robot -- a full-body apparatus developed by California-based Ekso Bionics . Built-in sensors detect the user 's weight shifts and initiate steps . Battery-powered motors drive the legs and make up for deficits in neuromuscular function .

Linfoot is the first veteran to receive the Ekso suit for personal use .

It 's a gift made possible through a nonprofit organization focused on mental and physical issues facing returning veterans and their families .

`` We were able to surprise the heck out a great soldier of ours . He 's now marching around , '' said Colin Baden , president of Infinite Hero Foundation .

The symbolic walk signals Linfoot 's determination to move on -- and the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty National Monument represents `` the freedom I fought for , '' said Linfoot .

One soldier 's strength

A highly decorated soldier , Linfoot was a member of the U.S. Army 's elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment -LRB- Airborne -RRB- . During his 19th combat tour in Iraq , his helicopter had a mechanical failure and crashed .

After just three months of rehabilitation , Linfoot returned to duty as the officer in charge of the Special Operations Aquatic Training Facility . Since retiring from service in 2010 , he has pushed hard to overcome limitations . Linfoot now lives with his wife , Mari , in Clarksville , Tennessee .

He will provide crucial information to advance the technology of the bionic suit . It 's in limited , trial use at hospitals and rehabilitation centers for patients with spinal cord injuries or those who 've suffered strokes .

Fast-moving technology

Creators of the Ekso suit predict the kind of rapid availability seen with other technology in recent years . `` We definitely see opportunity to reduce the cost -LRB- currently about $ 100,000 -RRB- . When you look back in time , only a few people could afford the first cell phones . Now , the masses can enjoy that technology , '' said Ekso Bionics co-founder Russ Angold .

The idea was originally funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , the U.S. Department of Defense agency that has a history of world-changing innovations .

Today , many entities are working to broaden applications of the wearable robot . A team of engineers and medical doctors at Georgia Tech Research Institute is working to enhance sensors in the suit that would make mobility possible even in difficult terrain .

`` Technology is developing not only to help people walk again , but to help retrain neural pathways and mend the ruptured spinal column so that it can regenerate , '' said GTRI Health Systems Technical Director Dr. Shean Phelps , a former special forces officer .

Veterans find a new way to serve -- in the kitchen

The scope of paralysis

In this country , some 6 million people -- one in 50 -- live with some degree of paralysis , according to a 2009 report by the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation . Actor Christopher Reeve , who was outspoken about his resolve to walk again after a paralyzing accident , died in 2004 . At that time , the concept of the robotic exoskeleton was still in its infancy .

`` It was science fiction technology . That is what we were working on , '' said Angold . `` Here we are less than 10 years later , and we 're helping people walk again that otherwise could n't . And so we 've brought science fiction to reality in a very short period of time . ''

Just five people in the world own Ekso suits . One of the pioneers is endurance athlete Mark Pollack . Though blind and paralyzed , he recently set a record -- walking the equivalent of a mile and a half in a one-hour training session .

Symbolic steps

On this day , a crisp , clear afternoon in November , Gary Linfoot stands his full 6 feet , 2 inches tall and walks again .

The site is significant on many levels . The Statue of Liberty is a universal beacon of freedom and part of the National Parks Service , which offers free , year-round access to all national parks for disabled veterans .

`` Being here on Veterans Day with New York City in the background -- it 's very special , '' says Linfoot . `` It exemplifies hope for the future . One day , one day soon , we 'll be able to leave that wheelchair behind . ''
