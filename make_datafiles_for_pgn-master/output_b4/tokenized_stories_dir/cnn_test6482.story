-LRB- CNN -RRB- Uruguay 's politicians who led the charge to legalize marijuana and same-sex marriage appeared to win another ringing endorsement from voters in the South American country Sunday .

The country 's electoral court announced that Tabaré Vazquez of the left-wing Broad Front coalition won the presidential runoff with about 53 % of the votes . Candidate Luis Lacalle Pou of the conservative National Party told supporters Sunday evening that he had conceded to Vazquez and wished him well , as exit polls predicted defeat . He garnered about 40 % of the vote .

Vazquez 's victory gives Uruguay a third consecutive five-year term with a leftist leader at the helm .

President Jose `` Pepe '' Mujica -- a former Marxist guerrilla who donates the majority of his salary , drives a 1987 Volkswagen Beetle and sells flowers with his wife at their home -- leaves office next year .

Vazquez , a 74-year-old oncologist , was Uruguay 's President from 2005 to 2010 .

`` Uruguayans again have said ` yes , ' yes to more freedoms and more rights , better democracy and better citizenship , '' he said in a televised speech Sunday .

Under Mujica 's leadership , the Broad Front has pushed through reforms legalizing abortion , same-sex marriage and marijuana -- major policy shifts in a region once defined by conservative policies influenced by the Roman Catholic Church .

The changes have given Uruguay , formerly a military dictatorship , a reputation in Latin America as a leading nation for liberal social policies .

And that approach is n't likely to change , if Vazquez 's `` Uruguay does n't stop '' campaign slogan is any indication .

This year the South American nation became the first in the world to have a system regulating the legal production , sale and consumption of marijuana .

Lacalle had vowed to repeal some parts of the new law if he were elected .

Vazquez , a doctor who crusaded against tobacco during his first term as President , has expressed some concerns about the new marijuana law , but said he plans to enforce it . Still , Uruguay 's El Pais newspaper recently reported that he has n't ruled out the possibility of modifying it .

`` There will be a strict and very close evaluation about the impact that this law has on society . We are going to analyze it very carefully . And if at any moment we see that it does not work , we will not hesitate for a moment in making the necessary corrections , '' he said , according to El Pais .
