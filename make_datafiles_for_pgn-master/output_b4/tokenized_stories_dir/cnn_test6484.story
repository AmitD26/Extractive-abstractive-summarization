-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than 60,000 people have now been infected with cholera in Zimbabwe , according to the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- .

Tendani Baloyi , 4 , gets treated for cholera in Musina , on the border between Zimbabwe and South Africa .

Latest figures released Friday from the organization also show that 3,161 people have died from the disease since August 2008 .

In December , WHO spokesman Paul Garwood told CNN the organization an estimated 60,000 people would be infected with cholera in the `` worst case scenario . ''

But that number now stands at 60,401 and shows no sign of abating the agency said .

The WHO , a Geneva , Switzerland-based organization , said `` drastic action , '' was now needed to curb one of the world 's largest outbreaks of cholera .

The UN agency called for `` political differences to be put aside '' and for international intervention to deal with the crisis .

`` We are dealing with an extraordinary public health crisis that requires from us all an extraordinary public health emergency response , and this must happen now before the outbreak causes more needless suffering and death , '' the WHO 's Dr Eric Laroche said on its Web site .

`` Political differences need to be put aside , economic barriers overcome , health services in the country 's periphery strengthened and community awareness to respond enhanced to save many more people from dying due to a disease that can be readily prevented and treated , '' he added .

Since August , the cholera epidemic has swept through a country wracked with a political and economic crises . It has also coincided with a nearly five-month-long strike by doctors and nurses who are demanding salaries in foreign currency .

Cholera is an intestinal disease caused by bacteria in contaminated water .

The epidemic has been aggravated by erratic water supplies , shortages of water purification chemicals , broken water and sewer pipes and uncollected garbage from a waste-disposal system that has collapsed .

Children can be seen playing on heaps of uncollected garbage in the suburbs of most urban areas in Zimbabwe .

In early December , President Robert Mugabe 's government declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency , paving the way for aid from international groups such as Oxfam , Doctors Without Borders , W.H.O. , the U.N. Children 's Fund and USAID .

But that assistance has not yet improved the situation , and the disease has spread to new areas since then .

`` The problem in Zimbabwe is that the infrastructure is obsolete , especially when it comes to water sanitation . People are going for months without tap water in towns , '' said Peter Hinn , the director of a German group called Welt Hunger Hilfe -LRB- World Hunger Help -RRB- , which is helping to fight cholera in Zimbabwe .

`` In rural areas , 60 to 70 percent of boreholes -LRB- wells -RRB- are not working . So the international community might have come in but they have to address this infrastructure . ''

Zimbabwe was already suffering an enormous economic crisis , with a hyperinflationary economy and shortages of all essentials including food , fuel , cash , foreign currency and electricity .

The country 's rainy season peaks in January or February and ends in late March , and Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned the epidemic could get worse during that time as runoff from the rains spreads the bacteria to other rivers , streams and wells .

Mugabe declared in mid-December that the cholera epidemic had slowed , but health experts differed with him and the latest figures seem to contradict his statement .
