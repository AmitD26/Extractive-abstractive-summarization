Two women shot to death by a man at an Elkhart , Indiana , grocery store may have known their attacker , police said Thursday .

Police shot and killed Shawn Walter Bair , 22 , Wednesday to end the rampage at Martin 's Super Market .

Although state police said they do not believe the three knew one another , State Police Sgt. Trent Smith told CNN on Thursday that investigators have received calls that Bair may have had some relationship to the two women .

The nature of that relationship , if there was one , was n't immediately clear .

The women 's names have not yet been released .

According to Smith , Bair arrived at the store around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday armed with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and a large hunting knife . He walked around for more than 30 minutes before opening fire , Smith said .

About a dozen people were in the store at the time , Smith said .

According to police , he shot two women -- a 20-year-old shopper and a 44-year-old employee -- before police arrived to find him holding a store manager at gunpoint .

They managed to distract him , allowing the manager to run away . But Bair also escaped down a store aisle , resulting in a search through the store that lasted between 40 and 60 seconds before police confronted Bair , who then pointed his handgun at them , Smith said .

He declined to say if Bair opened fire on police before he was shot but said he appeared to be agitated .

Police found the women 's bodies aisles apart inside the sprawling store .

Tony Beltran told CNN affiliate WNDU that his mother was working at the store at the time of the shootings .

`` She told me that she heard what sounded like gunshots , and everybody around her was telling her they heard gunshots , '' he told the station . `` Obviously , I was afraid . I said a quick prayer . ''

Two Elkhart City police officers shot the gunman to death when he turned his weapon on them , according to WNDU .

Employees at the store knew Bair or had seen him before , Smith said .
