Just days before the Nobel committee announces the winner of this year 's Nobel Peace Prize , the world found out who stands at the opposite extreme on the quest for peace and justice . We have discovered who the biggest cowards on the planet are today .

The competition for the mark of shame is hard fought , but the title goes to the men who approached a van carrying girls home from school in Pakistan on Tuesday and asked for one very special 14-year-old . Then shot her in the head .

The world 's worst cowards are the members of the Pakistani Taliban . Perhaps they believe their thick dark beards , dangerous weapons and fanatical religious pronouncement make them fierce warriors . But their actions tell the true story : The Pakistani Taliban are terrified of a 14-year-old girl named Malala Yousufzai .

And why are they so afraid of Malala ? Mostly , because she is not afraid of them .

And because Malala is a relentless advocate of education for girls , something the Taliban find very threatening .

The Taliban , with all their bravado , seem to fear women most of all .

The cravenness that has come to define the group -- also known as the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan , or TTP -- is easily matched by Malala 's stunning bravery . The fearless activist for girls ' education now lies in a hospital bed trying to recover from serious injuries to her head and neck . Overnight doctors performed emergency surgery to remove a bullet near her spinal cord and to relieve swelling in her brain .

Malala knew she was on a TTP hit list , but she did not back down . The Taliban , whose religious , social and political views are founded on a brutally anti-woman ideology , can not countenance even a young girl challenging their ideas on a blog .

Shortly after Tuesday 's assassination attempt , which also left two of Malala 's school friends wounded , TTP spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan acknowledged the group tried to kill her and vowed they will try to do it again if she survives . As is common , he couched the threats in extreme interpretations of Islam and on repression and intimidation of women . `` Any female that , by any means , plays a role in the war against the mujahedeen , '' Ehsan declared , `` should be killed . ''

The TTP spokesman called Malala 's advocacy for education `` a new chapter of obscenity , '' adding , `` We have to finish this chapter . '' He also accused her of being pro-West and admiring President Barack Obama .

Malala started to become a problem for the TTP when she was just 11 . The Pakistani Taliban , who hold the same ideology but are not directly affiliated with the Afghan Taliban , had taken over Pakistan 's Swat Valley . Pakistani politicians were turning a blind eye to what had become an increasingly brutal regime . They executed their critics , ordered all men to grow beards and whipped women in public as punishment for real , imagined or fabricated offenses .

It was all about imposing their will , their version of Islamic law , and subjugating the entire population , but women in particular .

The Taliban reportedly had destroyed more than 200 schools and ordered all girls ' schools shut down when Malala slowly emerged from obscurity . In 2009 , she started writing a blog for the BBC under a pseudonym , talking about her dreams for the future and how the Taliban were pushing those aspirations further and further out of reach .

Her story helped bring attention to the disaster befalling the population of the storied Swat Valley . At about the same time , the videotaped beating of a 17-year-old girl by a group of Taliban went viral in Pakistan , adding chilling images to a girl 's lament .

Until then , Pakistan had treated the fight against the Taliban as an American problem , something going on across the border in Afghanistan . Malala helped Pakistanis realize their own country , their own way of life were threatened by the TTP . The government fought back and regained control of the region . She continued to speak out and was the first recipient of her country 's National Peace Award last year . She and her cause became celebrated throughout the country , and increasingly despised by extremists and their supporters .

Rural areas of Pakistan and the districts near the Afghanistan border include deeply traditional regions from where the Taliban took much of their social views . Many practices , particularly regarding women , are horrifying to more modern Pakistanis living in places such as the capital , Islamabad .

The country has become a dangerous incubator of fanatically enforced prejudice . A prominent politician who opposed Pakistan 's controversial blasphemy laws was killed last year . Just last month a Christian girl was sent to prison after her neighbors concocted blasphemy charges against her .

The country has become one of the front lines of the struggle between modernity and the deeply intolerant , misogynistic practices dating back centuries . Malala , despite her young age , stands at the battle line of the push for equality .

iReport : Your views on girls ' education

The rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 showed just how the outcome in Pakistan could affect everyone , but especially women 's lives . The TTP aims to impose precisely the kind of rules the Taliban forced on Afghans . Afghan women were barred from working , studying , leaving their homes without a male companion . Even laughing out loud was prohibited . They became nonentities , stoned and beheaded at the local stadium , banned from showing their faces , speaking their voices or earning a living .

In 2002 , just after the regime was toppled , a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of mental health in the country found a vast majority of Afghan women suffering from depression , anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder .

A decade later , in bordering Pakistan , in the aftermath of the assassination attempt against Malala , many question if the threat has receded to the extent the authorities claim .

By trying to kill a bright and admired young girl in cold blood , the Taliban have revealed not only their own moral makeup . They have also reawakened the Pakistani people to the threat posed by extremists and the choices the country faces .

Pakistanis are pressuring their populist politicians to speak out against the crime , to take sides .

Pakistan is home to the world 's worst cowards . But it 's also Malalai 's home . Let 's hope she makes it , and inspires many to follow in her small but indelible footsteps . There 's something -- and someone -- for the Nobel committee to consider .
