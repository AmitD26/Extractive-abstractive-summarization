Shweyga Mullah 's face lights up with a smile that spreads like a sunrise across her face .

She 's just arrived at a party , organized by the small Ethiopian community on Malta . It 's the first time she 's seen many of her new friends since being discharged from hospital last week .

They raise paper cups of soda in a toast and Shweyga bashfully takes the salute and laughs and jokes with her fellow Ethiopians .

It 's heart-warming to see her finally enjoying herself . All her Ethiopian friends here had been lured to Libya by promises of lucrative work . But no one we know of has suffered quite like Shweyga .

One friend Emanuel Tsegay tells me that on hearing Shweyga 's story he burst into tears .

Shweyga 's unbelievably awful story of torture at the hands of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi 's daughter-in-law Aline has touched people around the world and resulted in some $ 40,000 being donated to a special fund for her recovery .

We found Shweyga abandoned in a Gadhafi family compound in August .

Lying alone on a mattress on the floor , she told me how Aline Gadhafi and one of her staff poured boiling water over her head and body , simply because she 'd been unable to stop one of the Gadhafi children from crying .

Offers of help poured into CNN Center and resulted in her evacuation to the tiny Mediterranean nation of Malta .

She arrived here in September and has undergone surgery and skin grafts since then .

Now though , surgeons are satisfied enough with her progress to allow her to become an outpatient .

She 's staying at a small apartment on the island and is receiving some financial help from the Qatari government , which has helped bankroll the Libyan revolution and arm its fighters .

Shweyga 's life here is not ideal though . She yearns to see her family , but red-tape has slowed down efforts to bring her relatives to Malta .

Shweyga says she does n't feel ready physically or emotionally to return to Ethiopia and be subjected to the scrutiny of people in her hometown . She remains profoundly self-conscious of her appearance .

But the doctors and nurses treating her at the Mater Dei hospital are pleased with her recovery .

Nurse Mary Rose Bonnici has been treating her since she arrived . We watched as she delicately trimmed the growing crown of hair on her scalp . It 's growing back fast but for now it must be kept short , in order to prevent infection .

Nurse Bonnici says : `` She is making very good progress . It was discharging before now it 's getting drier and drier . But now it 's good , very good , she feels it 's good anyway . ''

The consultant in charge of her case , Francis Xavier Dermanin , says : `` Ms. Mullah had regular physiotherapy for mobilization of her limbs especially the right shoulder which showed signs of early contractures due to immobility from the burns that she had sustained .

`` She also had the support of our psychologists in helping her to get over the horrific trauma that she had sustained . In both aspects she did very well .

`` In general , Ms. Mullah is more confident and communicating well with the medical and nursing staff . ''

It 's encouraging that her hair is growing back in places on her head . But the hair follicles towards the front , where the skin graft was performed , seem to have been permanently killed off .

The doctors hope there are enough towards the back to enable her to grow her hair out and disguise the scars .

I ask Shweyga about Aline Gadhafi and she speaks rapidly and with conviction .

She hopes the former dictator 's daughter-in-law will one day be caught and prosecuted . But like her husband Hannibal Gadhafi , Aline 's whereabouts remains unknown . Victims like Shweyga are still waiting for justice .
