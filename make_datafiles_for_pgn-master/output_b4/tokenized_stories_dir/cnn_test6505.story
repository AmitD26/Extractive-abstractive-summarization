Sam Kane Beef Processors of Corpus Christi , Texas , has recalled 90,987 pounds of ground beef products after consumers complained about finding pieces of metal inside the meat , the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Saturday .

The USDA said four consumers complained , with one person reporting a chipped tooth . The pieces of metal were reported to be about 3 mm , a USDA press release said .

Alfred Bausch , general manager for the company , said all the products were shipped to Texas retail outlets .

`` It was not a food safety issue , '' he said . `` It was a foreign object and the foreign object was very small . ''

The press release said these products are subject to recall :

-- 3-pound packages of `` HEB Ground Chuck , '' bearing the establishment number `` 337 , '' a production date of `` 09/12/14 '' and a use by date of `` 10/02/14 . ''
