Three numbers to keep in mind Tuesday night as President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address : six , 30 and 43 .

Six as in the number of seats Republicans need to gain this November to take control of the Senate .

30 : The historical average of House seats gained by the other party -- in this case the Republicans -- in a two-term president 's `` six-year itch '' midterm election .

And 43 % , of course , is Obama 's job approval rating -- a reminder that his political standing is weak , though up slightly from its recent low point , as he stands before a closely divided Congress -- and country -- to lay out his agenda for year six of his presidency .

`` One of the greatest powers a president has is the power to set the agenda , '' said veteran Democratic strategist and wordsmith Paul Begala , a close adviser to former President Bill Clinton . `` He -LRB- Obama -RRB- will use that power to great effect in the State of the Union address . ''

Here 's how we see the state of the Union

Another Clinton White House veteran disagreed , arguing this president is too weakened and the 2014 campaign landscape too troublesome to seize the initiative .

`` State of the Union means nothing , '' this Democrat said , speaking only on condition of anonymity . `` Re-read last year 's address . How relevant was it last year in terms of how 2013 turned out ? ''

In fact , Obama failed to get any of his top 2013 State of the Union priorities through Congress . Congress ignored his calls for a new jobs program , for new gun controls and for sweeping immigration reform .

Because of that , the 2014 speech is viewed by strategists in both parties as part of a defining test : Can Obama rebuild his standing enough to force action on some of his priorities , or will 2014 instead be remembered as another frustrating year of gridlock and the gateway to `` lame duck '' status ? To that end , many see this speech -- this wish list -- as potentially his last chance for significant action .

8 memorable State of the Union moments

`` At this stage of a presidency , a State of the Union address can not be expected to have much , if any , consequence in terms of public opinion , '' said leading Republican pollster Bill McInturff .

Despite all the attention , McInturff called the speech `` an ephemeral event that is perhaps a short-term focus of the ultimate D.C. policy insiders . ''

As always , the State of the Union is a policy address , a chance for the President to lay out his wish list to the Congress and the American people . But it is always a political stage as well , a dramatic nationally televised theater for the President to frame his argument .

This year , even as he asks Congress to act on economic and other initiatives , President Obama will distance himself from an unpopular Congress and promise to use executive powers to implement some of his priorities .

The stakes are enormous : As the President delivers his speech , the odds -- and the early election year data -- suggest Republicans will not only keep their House majority but also have a good chance to capture control of the Senate .

How would complete Republican control of Congress alter the final two years of the Obama presidency ? It is a debate worth having , yet one that can wait a bit , as we first test whether the President has better luck with Congress in 2014 than he did in 2013 , and whether he can bend the political climate back more in his favor .

Which is where those numbers come in .

The White House says its No. 1 political goal this year is protecting the Democratic majority in the Senate . Yet that goal -- blocking Republicans from a net six-seat gain -- could significantly complicate the President 's policy agenda .

Several of the most vulnerable Senate Democratic incumbents are from states Obama lost badly in 2012 : Arkansas , Alaska and Louisiana to name three . Those and other Democrats are opposed to some things the President wants -- like new gun controls -- and in favor of ideas the White House is against , including modifications to the President 's health care law .

Zelizer : Six ways to fight inequality

Begala acknowledges the tough political environment facing the President . But he says he can navigate it with a smartly crafted 2014 State of the Union wish list .

`` How can he help red-state Democrats running in places where he lost badly ? '' Begala said . `` By raising issues that play well in places he does n't . So you will hear a lot about middle-class economics : raising the minimum wage , extending unemployment insurance , pay equity and workplace fairness for working women , greater access to child care for working moms , pre-K for young kids and college aid for young adults . ''

The House Republican majority opposes most of the President 's ideas , though there have been some discussions testing whether compromises can be reached on the minimum wage , unemployment insurance and , from time to time , even immigration policy .

The historical average for a two-term president 's party in this sixth year midterm is a loss of 30 House seats . Even the most optimistic Republicans view that as unlikely , given the shrinking number of competitive House districts .

But Republican flexibility in policy discussions could depend on their own November midterm calculations , and at the moment top party strategists predict GOP gains in the high single digits on the House side .

Republicans say Obama has a lot of explaining to do

`` They will oppose his popular economic agenda at their own political peril , '' Begala said , holding out hope the President would have an opportunity either to score policy successes or bend the political momentum back in his favor .

The 43 % number is the one worth watching as the year unfolds -- midterm elections are shaped most by the President 's standing .

If Obama can climb closer to 50 % , Democratic chances improve significantly . If he slips closer to 40 % or below , then a GOP takeover of the Senate becomes more and more likely .

A little history :

In 2006 , President George W. Bush had an identical 43 % job approval rating at the time of his State of the Union address .

There was little fear of the President in Congress then , in either party , and as a result little of his agenda was enacted -- immigration and Social Security changes were among the goals Bush laid out . Come November 2006 , Republicans lost 30 House seats , and their majority .

7 things you did n't know about the State of the Union

Bill Clinton , on the other hand , had a 59 % approval rating to begin his sixth year in office , and Ronald Reagan was at 64 % around his 1986 State of the Union .

Democrats defied the historical averages in the Clinton `` six-year itch '' election ; Republicans actually lost five House seats , and the Senate balance of power was unchanged .

In 1986 , then-majority Democrats made only modest gains in the House -LRB- plus five seats -RRB- , but did pick up eight Senate seats to take control of that chamber .

Outside of Washington , observers like New Hampshire GOP activist Thomas Rath see an opportunity if the President `` acknowledge -LRB- d -RRB- at the outset that overwhelmingly Americans share a common belief -- Washington does not work . He should acknowledge that both parties share that blame ; both are responsible . ''

Rath 's advice ?

`` He needs to listen to the mood of this country and understand that folks do not want to hear a partisan harangue but rather want a strong message of leadership and cooperation from the man they elected to do just that . ''

And Rath 's election-year State of the Union prediction : `` He will do nothing of this sort . ''
