German leaders are furious with Greece . Yet again they have to go back to their electorates asking for more billions to throw down the black hole that is the Hellenic Republic . They have now become so angry that they are even openly proposing that Greece 's fiscal affairs be deferred to some European Commissioner , preferably one of a Teutonic disposition .

Greek leaders , meanwhile , have seized upon this German `` transgression '' with glee . For it offers them a wonderful excuse to put on domestic display their patriotic fervor at a time when they are running low on legitimacy in the eyes of a battered , demoralized electorate .

Beating their chests about the German threat to Greece 's national sovereignty , they are hoping that the Greeks will somehow forget that it was they , their leaders , who ceded sovereignty to the so-called troika of the European Commission , the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank .

This is a typical case of a shady coalition of vested interests that is disintegrating under the weight of its collective hubris . For the past 18 months , German and Greek leaders have been working together to deny the truth about three simultaneous bankruptcies : The irreversible bankruptcy of the Greek state , the effective insolvency of many Franco-German banks , and , last but not least , the unsustainability of the euro-system as we know it .

To keep these truths from surfacing , German and Greek politicians , each for their own purposes , settled on gigantic loans for Greece that would act as plaster on the festering wounds of the aforementioned bankruptcies .

But to get these `` historic '' loans through the parliaments of Berlin and Athens , they had to be portrayed as a form of humanism ; as German solidarity to the Greek people . Alas , to extend such `` solidarity , '' German lawmakers demanded subsidiarity ; which is euro-speak for the recipient agreeing to a tough reform agenda , complete with strict fiscal targets . In plain language , the huge loans would only be granted if similarly lofty promises were made by the Greek government .

Thus , German leaders , unwilling to confront their bankers and the fault lines developing throughout the eurozone , pretended to believe that the problem was Greece and that Greece could be `` cured '' by means of loans and austerity . At the same time , Greek leaders , unwilling to confront their electorate , pretended to believe that they could deliver the targets demanded by Germany .

Of course , it was only a matter of time before reality caught up with both sets of leaders . Once it became abundantly clear that the targets Greece had committed to were well and truly unrealistic , the coalition between our German and Greek leaders became testy . The knives are out and , if it were not for an equilibrium of terror at the thought of a euro-system collapse , a disorderly brawl would be plain for all to see .

The worst part of this sad saga is that public debate is still failing to keep track with the real issues . Instead of coming to terms with the structural imbalances within the eurozone , the Germans accuse the Greeks of incompetence , corruption and a singular failure to meet `` their '' targets .

The Greeks , meanwhile , are replying with references to World War II and yelps of horror at the prospect of violations of national sovereignty . Neither side is willing to admit that the whole rescue package was flawed from the outset . No serious consideration is given to the plain facts :

• That the cascade of insolvencies in the eurozone should never have been treated like liquidity problems fixable by loans to the bankrupt banks and states .

• That it is always a terrible idea to make large loans to an already shrinking economy conditional on further reduction in the national income from which these loans must be repaid -LRB- for this is precisely what hefty austerity measures in the middle of a recession achieve -RRB- .

• That Greece 's agreed targets would be equivalent to my promising , perhaps under duress , to break the world 100-meter sprint record in the forthcoming London Olympics .

The punishment of any big lie is its revelation . Unfortunately , we are not there yet .

The preordained failure of the Greek `` program '' has not yet exposed our leaders ' connivance . It is , instead , generating Teutonic wrath among the hard working Germans -LRB- whose living standards have been under constant pressure for a decade , and who are now told they must guarantee even more zillions for the Greek state -RRB- and unbearable Sisyphean pain for Greeks caught up in a vicious cycle -LRB- from which no amount of hard work or innovative thinking can help them escape -RRB- .

Something must give . If it is not our leaders ' insidious lie , it will be the eurozone . It 's that simple .
