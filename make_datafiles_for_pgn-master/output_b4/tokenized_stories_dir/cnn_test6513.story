This week it was reported that Steve Jobs , the CEO and cofounder of Apple , underwent a liver transplant two months ago . One detail concerning Jobs 's transplant seemed odd : The surgery took place at a hospital in Tennessee , some 2,000 miles from Jobs ' home in northern California . Why Tennessee ?

Steve Jobs -LRB- pictured in October 2008 -RRB- has been on a health-related leave of absence since January 2009 .

The answer sheds light on the intricacies of the organ transplant system , as well as why it 's sometimes easier for people with significant financial resources to get an organ transplant . -LRB- Jobs ' estimated net worth : $ 5.7 billion . -RRB-

Livers are a scarce resource . In any given year , only about one-third of the people on the national transplant waiting list receive one , and as of late June , more than 16,000 people were on the list .

Yet it sometimes seems that celebrities in need end up at the front of the line when they need a transplant , and people often assume they get preferential treatment . -LRB- Rumors about special treatment circulated after baseball player Mickey Mantle 's liver transplant in 1995 , for example . -RRB- Health.com : The real gift of life : How medical donations help

The truth is more complicated . No one can actually buy an organ in the United States -LRB- legally , that is -RRB- . But getting a liver transplant , it turns out , is a lot like getting into college . Once you 're on the waiting list , your chances of getting off it depend largely on your personal circumstances -- how sick you are and whether you are a good donor match . But getting on the list in the first place -- or on more than one list , as the case may be -- requires resources and know-how that most people do n't have .

Can some people ` cut the line ' ?

There are 127 centers in the U.S. that perform liver transplants . If you need an organ transplant , your doctor will refer you to one of these centers , where you will be evaluated , given a score based on the severity of illness , and placed on the center 's waiting list , if you are indeed a candidate for transplant .

The center 's waiting list feeds into a national database managed by the United Network for Organ Sharing -LRB- UNOS -RRB- , a nonprofit organization that contracts with the federal government to manage the nation 's organ transplant system .

UNOS works with 58 organ procurement organizations -LRB- OPOs -RRB- that coordinate organ distribution in their region of the country . When an organ becomes available , the OPO in that region searches the UNOS database for a local match using blood type -LRB- and other biological considerations -RRB- , the patient 's severity score , and the time spent on the waiting list . If a match ca n't be made within that region , the organization expands its search to neighboring regions .

The problem -- or the advantage for some patients -- is that not all OPOs are created equal . Some regions contain nearly 15 times as many people as others , and their waiting list times vary widely . Patients in the smaller OPOs tend to be less sick and experience shorter wait times before getting an organ . In the Tennessee OPO where Jobs received his transplant , the median wait for a liver between 2002 and 2007 was just over four months . The national average was just over a year , and in some OPOs it was more than three years .

Though there is always the possibility of preferential treatment once a patient is on a waiting list -- UNOS conducts periodic audits of transplant centers for exactly this reason -- it is unlikely that someone like Steve Jobs can `` cut the line '' of the transplant waiting list .

The reason that some people might be able to get transplants more quickly is that they 're standing in more lines . Nothing prevents someone from being evaluated and listed at multiple transplant centers . As long as a patient has the wherewithal to fly around the country -- and be available at the drop of a hat if a liver becomes available -LRB- this is where the private jet comes in handy -RRB- -- a patient can , in theory , be evaluated by all the transplant centers in the country .

`` The system works at two levels , '' explains Arthur Caplan , Ph.D. , the chair of the department of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania . `` One , who gets in to a center . Two , who gets transplanted off a particular center 's list when an organ becomes available . Most of the attention goes to stage two , but the biggest ethical challenges are really at stage one . ''

Jobs underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2004 . -LRB- He reportedly had a type that grows more slowly -- and has a better prognosis -- than others . -RRB- He was said to have recovered , but last year he appeared in public looking thin and sick . He took a leave of absence in January and underwent a liver transplant a few months later . However , it 's not clear how long he was on the transplant waiting list , or whether he was on the waiting list for a center other than the one in Tennessee .

Insurance matters too

Since 2003 , UNOS has required that transplant centers inform all candidates that they can be evaluated and listed at more than one center , and that they can also transfer their care from one center to another without losing the time they have accrued on the waiting list . However , not everyone can afford to fly around the country and be evaluated at more than one transplant center . In fact , many people ca n't afford a liver transplant , period .

According to the most recent estimates , the cost of a liver transplant is $ 519,600 -- a price tag that excludes roughly one-third of Americans because they do n't have sufficient insurance -LRB- or any insurance -RRB- , Caplan estimates . According to data collected for UNOS , only about 5 percent of liver transplants are paid for out of pocket . Health.com : Where the money goes : A breast cancer donation guide

`` What your insurance covers is very different from everyone else 's , '' says Anne Paschke , a spokesperson for UNOS . Some insurance companies wo n't cover evaluations at multiple transplant centers , Paschke explains , and in at least one case , an insurance company has restricted its coverage to a single transplant center that the company itself owned .

Moreover , your insurance continues to be important during the evaluation process . The decision to accept a transplant candidate takes place before UNOS enters the picture , and the committees that determine whether a patient is added to the transplant center 's waiting list have access to a patient 's full medical and financial history .

`` There 's a huge triage involved in getting in , '' says Caplan . `` If you 're a homeless alcoholic sleeping on the streets of L.A. , and you 're going toe-to-toe with Steve Jobs , you 're going to lose . ''

For most people , the ability to pay is a precondition for acceptance at more than one transplant center . Wealthy people who are , in effect , financially `` pre-approved '' for a liver transplant , can shop around and identify the transplant centers that will give them the best chance of receiving a new organ .

Reforming the system

Despite the apparent problems with the transplant system , past efforts at reform have generally failed . Health.com : Could painkillers be hurting your heart ?

In the late 1990s , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued new regulations that would have given priority to the sickest patients , regardless of region . This would have eliminated the geographic disparities that make approval at multiple transplant centers advantageous , but Congress blocked the regulations and instead asked the Institute of Medicine , an advisory organization that belongs to the National Academy of Sciences , to consider the issue .

The IOM 's proposal was less far-reaching , but it did recommend standardizing the size of the organ donor pool for the sickest patients . Congress failed to implement this measure as well , however .

Some transplant centers advocated the shift away from the OPO system , but others vigorously lobbied Congress to oppose the new policy . The smaller transplant centers were concerned that in a national organ allocation system , they would receive fewer transplants and be driven out of business . The larger transplant centers , meanwhile , wanted to maintain the size and geographical reach of the OPOs in their areas .

`` There was a huge split in the transplant community , '' says Paschke . `` It was very territorial at the time , and there was a lot of maneuvering going on . There were a lot of business interests on the part of the transplant centers . ''

UNOS itself has been split on the issue of multiple listing . The organization 's board of directors has voted on whether to restrict multiple listing three times in the past 15 years ; the first vote resulted in a tie , and in the others the proposal was rejected by a divided vote .

The inequity revealed in the liver transplant process is symptomatic of the larger inequalities in the American health-care system , says Caplan , who also cochairs a United Nations task force on organ trafficking . In countries such as Canada or Switzerland that have national health-care systems , a patient 's finances do n't influence access to organs to the same extent , he says .

`` Money does n't play such a big role in entry into the system , '' he says . `` Steve Jobs ' transplant is relevant to why we need some health reform . ''
