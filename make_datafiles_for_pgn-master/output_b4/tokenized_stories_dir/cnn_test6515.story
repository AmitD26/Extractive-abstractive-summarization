One of the world 's oldest civilizations took a major step toward democracy Wednesday as polls closed in Egypt 's historic vote for president , even as many worried the armed forces would quash the results if the top brass does n't like the country 's choice .

It is the first time the country has had a presidential election where no one knows what the result will be before the ballots are cast .

`` Finally , Egypt is born , '' one weeping 80-year-old man told Rep. David Dreier , a California Republican who is in Cairo as an election observer .

Grandmother Nadia Fahmy , 70 , was so determined to be the first one to vote at her polling station that she camped out in a plastic chair for 2 1/2 hours before it opened .

`` I am here to vote for the first time in my life , '' said Fahmy . `` I want to see a new generation for my country . I want everything to change . ''

Other people told CNN they had waited up to four hours to vote as an atmosphere of enthusiasm swept polling stations in the capital .

The voting is a monumental achievement for those who worked to topple longtime President Hosni Mubarak in one of the seminal developments of the Arab Spring more than a year ago . And it could reverberate far beyond the country 's borders , since Egypt is in many ways the center of gravity of the Arab world .

`` Egypt has always set trends in the Arab world and for Arab political thought . Trends spread through the Arab world and eventually affect even non-Arab , Muslim-majority countries , '' said Maajid Nawaz , the chairman of Quilliam , a London-based think tank .

Egypt 's election `` bodes well for the rest of the Arab world and particularly those countries that have had uprisings , '' said Nawaz , a former Islamist who was imprisoned in Egypt for four years for banned political activism .

There are 13 candidates on the ballot , although two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed . If no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the first round , a second round will be held June 16-17 .

Results of the first round are not expected before the weekend .

Some 30,000 volunteers have fanned out to make sure the voting is fair , said organizers with the April 6 youth movement , which has long campaigned for greater democracy and rule of law in Egypt .

They reported only minor violations Wednesday , mostly supporters of one candidate or another trying to influence voters at polling stations .

There is a pervasive fear that the powerful military , which has run the country since the fall of Mubarak , could try to hijack the election .

The concern persists despite the insistence of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government . The military put armored personnel carriers on the streets with loudspeakers broadcasting a message that they will relinquish power , but that did not convince doubters .

Nawaz , the analyst in London , said Egypt probably is not heading toward a simple case of the military either giving up control or rejecting the results of the election .

Instead , he anticipated , there will be an `` unhappy settlement '' where the military remains `` ever-present , in the shadows , '' influencing the civilian government without controlling it .

Old politics joins new in Egypt

`` Egypt is going along similar lines to Turkey or Pakistan , '' he said , naming two other countries that have formal democracies in place but where a powerful military can affect events .

The degree to which the military continues to exercise control in Egypt will depend on who wins the election , Nawaz anticipated -- but he laughed aloud when asked to predict who that would be .

Whoever wins the election , Nawaz said , will face tremendous challenges , even without worries about the army .

`` They are inheriting a failed economy , an abysmal bureaucracy , a frustrated people , and a deep distrust on behalf of the people towards their military and any policing , '' Nawaz said .

And Egypt has an elaborate political mosaic where alliances shift quickly , he added .

Secular democrats oppose military rule , for example , but if an Islamist candidate wins the presidency , `` Some of the democrats would switch because they would rather have military rule than the Islamists , '' Nawaz said .

`` It 's far more complicated than ` Islamists vs. liberal democracy . ' It 's rich vs. poor , -LRB- hardline -RRB- Salafists vs. the -LRB- more moderate -RRB- Muslim Brotherhood , secularists vs. Islamists , '' he said .

On top of that , the country does not yet have a new constitution defining the powers of the president or the parliament , after a court last month suspended the committee charged with writing it . The court ruled that the members of the committee did not reflect the national population well enough .

Among the candidates vying for the presidency are Mohamed Morsi , of the Muslim Brotherhood 's Freedom and Justice Party ; Amre Moussa , who served as foreign minister under Mubarak and headed the Arab League ; Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh , a moderate Islamist running as a respected independent ; Ahmed Shafik , who was Mubarak 's last prime minister ; and Hamdeen Sabahy , a leftist dark-horse contender .

Shafik was mobbed by opponents who threw things at him when he went to vote Wednesday , his spokesman , Ahmed Serhan , told CNN .

`` People chanted against him upon his entrance to cast his vote , '' Serhan said . That prompted soldiers guarding the polling station to shut the doors while Shafik voted , he said .

`` On his way out , some people threw their shoes and rocks at him while he rushed into the car , '' Serhan said . `` He is not hurt , and this attack is not representative of how Egyptian people feel about him . ''

Many Egyptians seem uncertain of their loyalties to any particular candidate , and even the weakest of arguments or the strangest of rumors can shift public opinion overnight .

The vote comes nearly 16 months after the popular uprising that brought down Mubarak in February 2011 . Mubarak was tried on charges of ordering police to shoot protesters during the uprising against him , and of corruption .

He is awaiting the court 's verdict and could potentially face the death penalty .

Despite the high-profile trial of the man who ruled the country for 30 years , popular distrust and anger , particularly against the military 's power in Egyptian governmental affairs , still inspire protests , some of which have been marked by deadly clashes .

Protesters are upset at what they see as the slow pace of reform since Mubarak 's ouster . Some are also concerned that the country 's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule .

In January , two Islamist parties won about 70 % of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the post-Mubarak era .

The Freedom and Justice Party won 235 seats and the conservative Al Nour party gained 121 seats in the People 's Assembly , according to final results . The assembly consists of 498 elected members , and the rest of the seats were divided among other parties .
