Mitt Romney hit his party 's `` magic number '' on Tuesday , unofficially clinching the Republican presidential nomination in a race he entered as the front-runner and has had to himself for weeks .

Romney led the pack when he announced his second run for the White House last June , and he has watched his rivals for the nomination slowly trickle out as their own wins looked increasingly unlikely .

The delegates to put him over the 1,144 necessary for the GOP nomination came in Texas , the lone state to vote this week . Romney entered the day 78 delegates away from the magic number , and on Tuesday CNN projected he would win the state 's GOP presidential primary , where 152 of the state 's 155 delegates were at stake .

On Tuesday , Romney said he was humbled to have secured the requisite delegates to become the GOP nominee .

`` I am honored that Americans across the country have given their support to my candidacy and I am humbled to have won enough delegates to become the Republican Party 's 2012 presidential nominee , '' Romney wrote . `` Our party has come together with the goal of putting the failures of the last 3 1/2 years behind us . I have no illusions about the difficulties of the task before us . But whatever challenges lie ahead , we will settle for nothing less than getting America back on the path to full employment and prosperity . On November 6 , I am confident that we will unite as a country and begin the hard work of fulfilling the American promise and restoring our country to greatness . ''

The chairman of the Republican National Committee , Reince Priebus , congratulated Romney on the milestone , saying Romney would `` offer America the new direction we so desperately need . ''

Priebus ' Democratic counterpart , Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , was less enthusiastic .

`` Tonight , after six years of trying and millions of dollars spent , and after a year of tepid support against one of the weakest fields in history , Mitt Romney has finally secured enough delegates to become the Republican Party 's presidential nominee , '' wrote Wasserman Schultz , the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee . `` Romney may have finally gained enough delegates to become the nominee , but what 's been truly remarkable about his path to the nomination is how much damage he 's left in his wake as he enters the general election . ''

Romney has been the presumptive nominee for weeks , but will not be the official party nominee until the Republican National Convention , set to be held the week of August 27 in Tampa , Florida .

Romney launched his campaign on a warm day last June , telling his supporters gathered at a New Hampshire farm that `` Barack Obama has failed America . ''

`` From my first day in office my No. 1 job will be to see that America once again is No. 1 in job creation , '' he said .

The early primary battleground state would play an important role in his campaign . He initially invested more in New Hampshire than the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa , which he eventually lost by a small margin to former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania .

New England voters have long been familiar with Romney , even before his 2008 presidential bid . He served as governor of Massachusetts between 2003 and 2007 .

Texas figured into this presidential race long before the first votes cast on Tuesday . One of the three factors in Santorum 's April decision to end his presidential bid was a decision by Texas Republicans not to change their proportional delegate model to a winner-take-all system , which -- if he had stayed in the race and won the state -- could have given him a boost and held back Romney 's delegate accumulation .

Two of Romney 's rivals in the once-crowded field are from Texas . Texas Gov. Rick Perry exited the race two days before the mid-January primary in South Carolina after a disappointing fifth-place finish in Iowa and his decision to stop campaigning in the second state to vote , New Hampshire .

Earlier this month , Rep. Ron Paul of Texas said he would no longer actively campaign for the Republican nomination , effectively ending his third run for the Oval Office with 122 delegates .

When Santorum , Paul and others were still in the race , talk of a contested convention swirled and it seemed to some a realistic possibility that Romney might not reach the magic number before the last state voted in June .

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to push his bid onward to the convention unless Romney were to clinch the nomination earlier . He told reporters in late March that if Romney `` does not have a majority -LSB- of delegates -RSB- , I think you 'll then have one of the most interesting , open conventions in American history . '' He suspended his bid in early May , and on Tuesday was to appear with Romney at a fundraiser in Las Vegas .

The earliest contests weeded out Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota , who won the Iowa straw poll last summer but finished sixth in its January caucuses , and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman , who ended his bid before the South Carolina vote after falling short in New Hampshire .

Others dropped out before the voting began . Businessman Herman Cain 's once-unlikely rise ended in December amid allegations of sexual misbehavior . Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty dropped out months earlier , in August , after the high stakes Ames , Iowa , straw poll .

Romney , who becomes the first Mormon presidential nominee of a major party , previously sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2008 . He dropped out after Super Tuesday , which allocated 1,020 delegates from 21 states . The Texas primary in early March of that year gave Sen. John McCain of Arizona the necessary delegates to seal up the GOP nomination .

In his 2008 convention speech , Romney spoke about many of the same themes that are prominent in his campaign this cycle , including a call `` to rein in government spending , lower taxes , take a weed wacker to excessive regulation and mandates ... pursue every source of energy security , from new efficiencies to renewables , from coal to non-CO2 producing nuclear and for the immediate drilling for more oil off our shores . ''

President Barack Obama faced no national competition for the Democratic presidential nomination , and CNN projected he accumulated the 2,778 necessary delegates on April 3 .
