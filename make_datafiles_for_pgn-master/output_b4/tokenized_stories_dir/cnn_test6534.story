Cesar Millan has been showcasing his talents as `` The Dog Whisperer '' since 2004 , teaching dog owners how to train their energetic and oftentimes misbehaving canines .

Millan gained celebrity status after helping stars such as Oprah Winfrey with their precious pooches , but on his Nat Geo Wild series `` The Dog Whisperer , '' he works with everyday people .

Recently in Atlanta , Millan shared his tips for adopting a shelter dog with Sara and Casey Giessen , a married couple who recently decided they are ready to adopt a dog .

Millan strongly supports adopting pets , but he warns that taking in a shelter dog based on pity is n't in the best interest of the dog . Many people choose a dog based on emotion , but Millan recommends a different approach .

`` I always suggest to people to be logical with the adoption because you get to understand compatibility and what energy are you bringing home , '' he said . `` It 's hard because most of the time people do impulse adoptions , but unfortunately those dogs are brought back more often than kept at home . ''

He said compatibility starts with understanding a dog 's body language , beginning with the eyes .

`` It 's the softness of the eye contact that can tell you a lot -LSB- because -RSB- they can tell you sadness , as much as it can tell you , ` I 'm open for a relationship . ' Or they can tell you , ` I do n't want to be with you , ' '' he explained . `` Through the eye contact you can know exactly how they feel about your presence . ''

Millan accompanied the Giessens as they checked out the homeless dogs at DeKalb County Animal Control in Atlanta . Casey Giessen recounted how Millan helped explain to the couple how they should go about choosing their future pet .

`` There were pictures on the cages of the dogs and he would cover the bottom of the face and he said , ` Just look at the eyes , ' '' Casey Giessen said . `` You could tell immediately -LSB- from the eyes -RSB- that this dog was sad , extra hyper , or calm and sweet . ''

Millan said many future pet owners often mistake a high-powered tail wag as happiness .

`` That does n't mean the dog is happy , that means the dog is excited ! '' he explained .

If you are considering adopting a dog , Millan said you must first assess your own energy level , then look for a dog that matches it . When a dog 's energy level is higher than the owner 's energy level , it can lead to problems .

`` That 's when you see people , when they go for a walk , they 're being pulled by their dog , or when they open the door , just to answer the doorbell , the dog gets to the door first , '' he explained .

Next , he said future dog owners need to consider how they will set boundaries and limitations for their pet .

The Giessens , who described their energy level as medium , found a small lab mix at the DeKalb shelter that they liked . After observing them together , Millan said he believed she was a compatible dog for the couple . The couple later noticed the dog shedding quite a bit , so , because Sarah has allergies , they decided to continue their search using the advice Millan has shared .

That , according to Millan was the right decision .

`` My goal was to teach them a little bit more than what they knew , '' Millan said . `` And what they adopt today was knowledge , maybe not a dog yet , but when they adopt a dog , it will be the right dog for them because they will do it with knowledge . ''

Millan said after you have adopted a shelter dog , the first thing you need to do before bringing your new pet home is take it for a long , one - to two-hour walk .

`` It 's like his vacation . It 's almost like you 're really welcoming him by removing physical energy , '' Millan said . `` Then you bring him home . Immediately , before you give affection , you tell a dog where he 's going to sleep or stay . You begin practicing separation so you do n't have separation anxiety in the future . ''

Millan said the hardest thing for a dog to learn is how to be away from its family .

`` We go to work , kids go to school , at one point he will be by himself , '' he explained . `` So , it 's best to introduce him to how his life is going to look like in the future from day one . So you do n't catch him by surprise . ''

Understanding dog behavior is key to creating a lasting relationship with a dog , Millan said .

`` Follow through with exercise and discipline , '' he said . `` Everybody wants to pet a dog , but not everybody walks the dog and is consistent with rules , boundaries and limitations . We do n't have a problem with breed , with pit bulls , we do n't have a problem with aggression , we have a problem with education . ''

Several weeks after their shelter visit , the Giessens saw a dog available on Facebook . They were drawn to his cute looks and his big ears , but they reminded themselves of Millan 's tips .

`` We kept saying to each other , we ca n't get him just because he 's cute , '' Sara Giessen said .

They found the dog at Georgia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , which has a `` spend the night '' program . They were allowed to bring the dog home for a night , which sealed the deal .

`` We were really surprised because at the shelter he was really hyperactive , '' Casey said . `` We got him home and he was really chill . ''

The Giessens credit Millan 's advice for leading them to the right dog , which they named `` Beans . ''
