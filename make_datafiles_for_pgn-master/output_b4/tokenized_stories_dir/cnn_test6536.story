Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- Detentions , the kidnapping of bishops , tearing down churches -- these are the actions against Christians China has been guilty of .

Even the pope has not been welcome in Chinese airspace in the last few decades .

So when Pope Francis was given permission to fly over China on Thursday on his way to South Korea , many saw it as a sign of hope for religious freedom -- especially Catholicism -- in China .

The state-run Global Times calls it a sign of `` possible d√©tente . ''

But even as the central government and the pontiff seem to be getting along better , reports have emerged that Chinese Catholics have been barred from visiting South Korea to see the pontiff .

Around half of more than 100 students who had planned to travel from China to South Korea to attend the Asian Youth Day event and catch a glimpse of the Pope have not made it .

Heo Young-yeop , spokesman for the Committee for the Papal Visit to Korea , told the media that it was due to `` a complicated situation inside China . ''

This apparent U-turn in attitude towards the papacy , within a matter of days , has Vatican-watchers confused , hinting at an increasingly opaque Chinese government that is struggling to manage its religious groups .

`` There 's a pattern of pendular movement in the Chinese government 's stance towards religion , of being repressive and then of being accommodating , '' says Lionel Jensen , Associate Professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures , at the University of Notre Dame .

`` I do n't believe that the Vatican and the Communist Party will come to any agreement in the manner that some might hope , '' he said , adding that he has heard from a source , which he does not wish to name for security reasons , that the students who did not make it to the event in Korea are currently unaccounted for . CNN is not able to independently confirm this .

Woes of worship

The Vatican and Beijing have had no formal relations since the Communist Party came into power in 1949 .

Officially an atheist country , China does not recognize the authority of the Vatican over its millions of Catholics . Instead , it has set up its own Catholic governing body , known as the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association that answers to the Party .

This association is similar to other state organizations that manage followers of major faiths , including the Three-Self Patriotic Movement for Protestants and the Chinese Patriotic Islamic Association .

But there are other religious groups in China that have not been sanctioned by the state and that worship underground .

Jin Tianming is a priest and member of Beijing Shouwang Church , an underground Protestant community . His group of worshipers has had trouble finding a permanent location to hold church gatherings , frequently suffering harassment from police , with members of the church arrested or detained on occasion .

`` We put our beliefs above society . I do n't think the two are compatible in any way , '' says Jin .

Religious bloom

The existence of unregistered religious groups makes it difficult to calculate the number of Christians in China . A Pew Research Center study from 2011 estimates the number of Christians inside China at 67 million , about 5 % of the country 's total population at the time , amongst which around 10 million are Catholics . This is compared to 10 million Christians in total in 1996 .

According to researchers , the numbers are rising quickly . Professor Fenggang Yang , director of the Center on Religion and Chinese Society at Purdue University , has predicted that China will be home to the largest Christian population by 2030 .

The rapidly growing popularity of religion may be seen as a threat to the Communist Party 's authority .

`` The matter of religion in China -- especially the issue of Islam and Christianity , including Catholicism and Protestantism -- these are the fault lines in the future development of the country , '' says Jensen . `` I think that the Chinese government does n't know how to go about assessing the strain along those lines . ''

In the past few months , crucifixes , and even entire churches , have been torn down in China under the premise of building code violations . The Christian community has reacted in large numbers , with thousands showing up to protest the demolitions .

Sino-Christianity

In the latest move by the central authorities to control the spread of Christianity , the governing body for religious affairs has said that it will develop `` Chinese Christian theology . ''

`` The construction of Chinese Christian theology should adapt to China 's national condition and integrate with Chinese culture , '' said Wang Zuoan , director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs . The announcement was made at a seminar on the Sinicization of Christianity in Shanghai last week .

An official five-year campaign has been ongoing since 2013 to promote `` positive and correct theological thinking '' and provide guidance to official registered church groups .

Just how will a Chinese-style Christian theology look like ?

`` It will attempt to tie together values of socialist culture and the practice of faith . The criteria will probably be vague , they will leave it open so authorities can determine who is violating the rules or not , '' says Jensen .

He predicts that it will likely echo what one hears within the larger context of the Chinese education system in general , stressing social harmony and social stability .

He points out that a Chinese theology is `` startling '' because it suggests that the long standing framework of constraints of religious practice may not be working out anymore . `` It is an effort to gain an upper hand within the wilderness of immense Christian expansion . ''
