NAPLES , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least seven possible tornadoes were reported Tuesday in eastern Florida as Tropical Storm Fay battered parts of the state with high winds and heavy rain , the National Hurricane Center said .

Fay tore through Barefoot Bay , Florida , south of Melbourne Tuesday .

Fay could strengthen into a hurricane when it swings over Florida again Thursday , according to the center .

`` This storm is going to be with us for a while , '' said Florida Gov. Charlie Crist . `` Looks like it could be a boomerang storm . ''

A hurricane watch has been issued for Florida 's east coast , from north of Flagler Beach to Altamaha Sound .

At 5 p.m. , the center of the storm was about 60 miles southwest of Melbourne , the hurricane center said . Fay was traveling north-northeast at 8 mph .

Florida Power & Light reported more than 93,000 customers without power in 20 counties . Most of the outages -- 34,000 -- were in Collier County , where Fay came ashore earlier in the day .

As many as 9,700 residents in Brevard County were without power Tuesday evening , according to David Waters , the county Emergency Operations Center spokesman .

A Brevard County tornado that hit about 1:45 p.m. damaged more than 50 homes , leaving nine uninhabitable , according to the emergency operations center . Three people suffered minor injuries , officials said .

Fay 's maximum sustained winds remained near 65 mph , with higher gusts , forecasters said . A storm tracker in Moore Haven , near the west bank of Lake Okeechobee , reported winds up to 81 mph in the afternoon .

`` Some fluctuations in intensity are likely this afternoon and tonight as Fay moves inland over Florida . Some strengthening is expected when Fay moves over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday , '' according to the hurricane center .

The storm was earlier buffeting Lake Okeechobee with high winds as it moved north and northeast through Florida , leaving a trail of flooding , broken trees and power outages .

At midday , the hurricane center issued two tornado warnings -- for St. Lucie and Indian River counties , and tornado watches were in effect for several areas , most of them ending at 4 p.m. .

A possible twister hit Wellington in Palm Beach County , where the violent weather ripped a small barn off its foundation and left a horse standing unhurt on a concrete slab , authorities said .

Dr. Bob Smith , an associate veterinarian at the Palm Beach Equine Clinic , said an 8-year-old quarterhorse named Onyx was in a stall , untied , when the suspected tornado hit about 2 a.m. . It destroyed the structure `` and left the horse standing there unscathed , '' Smith said . iReport.com : Flooding , beached whale as Fay hits

When he came to work several hours later , a technician had rescued the horse , who was not visibly rattled , Smith said .

`` She 's just calm and cool , '' he said . `` She 's fine . ''

Smith said roof tiles flew off the veterinary clinic and broke car windows in a nearby parking lot . The storm also picked up a horse trailer and smashed it into another horse trailer , he said .

A tropical storm warning remained in effect along Florida 's east coast from north of Ocean Reef to Flagler Beach , including Lake Okeechobee . A tropical storm watch covered that coast north of Flagler Beach to Fernandina Beach .

Fay is expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain over southern and east-central Florida , with possible maximum amounts of 15 inches . Three to 5 inches of rain were possible in the northwestern Bahamas .

Steve Delai , deputy chief of Fire and Rescue for Palm Beach County , said he could not confirm a tornado had hit the southeast county , but the damage was `` consistent with a tornado . ''

`` It 's clear that the damage was in a very linear fashion , '' he said .

Crist said 31 schools were closed in the region Tuesday as a precaution . All but four , including Brevard County , will be open Wednesday .

`` Floridians should continue to monitor local news reports , stay calm and exercise common sense , '' he advised . `` Please remember to be cautious when testing generators and other hurricane-related equipment .

`` In areas where the weather is getting worse , stay inside and stay off the roads and be safe , '' Crist added .

Fay 's landfall at Cape Romano south of Marco Island was the third for the storm , which came ashore in western Cuba Sunday night and then again over Key West Monday afternoon .

Cindy Lou Corum , who lives in Palm Beach County , said her home was surrounded by water . See the path of damage in photos and videos ''

`` I 'm going to need a rowboat to get out of my house , '' she said . `` I may have to swim out . ''

For residents in Punta Gorda , in southwest Florida , the storm and its trail of damage are a reminder of the devastation from Hurricane Charley in 2004 .

Irene Faust has lived in mobile homes up and down the Florida coast for 35 years . Her trailer in Punta Gorda was destroyed by Charley .

Faust , who turns 82 on Thursday , said she learned from Charley and is urging others not to wait out the storm in their trailer .

`` I 'd say , get out of a mobile home , because it 's like a cracker box , '' she said . iReport.com : Your images tell the story
