Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- Top congressional Republican leaders quickly criticized the U.S.-China climate change pact to cut carbon emissions that President Barack Obama announced while traveling in Asia .

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , House Speaker John Boehner and Sen. Jim Inhofe , who is expected to chair the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , slammed the agreement in statements released shortly after the deal was announced Wednesday .

`` Our economy ca n't take the President 's ideological War on Coal that will increase the squeeze on middle-class families and struggling miners , '' McConnell , who hails from the coal state of Kentucky , said . `` This unrealistic plan , that the President would dump on his successor , would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs . ''

President Barack Obama announced Wednesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping that the U.S. will cut its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26-28 % by 2025 while China committed to creating more energy from zero-emission sources and begin reducing its emissions footprint by 2030 .

Boehner called the deal another example of Obama 's `` job-crushing policies . ''

`` And it is the latest example of the president 's crusade against affordable , reliable energy that is already hurting jobs and squeezing middle-class families , '' Boehner said in a statement Wednesday .

Inhofe criticized the deal as unfair and knocked the Chinese pledge to produce 20 % of its energy from zero-emission sources as `` hollow and not believeable . ''

`` The United States will be required to more steeply reduce our carbon emissions while China wo n't have to reduce anything , '' Inhofe said .

China overtook the U.S. within the last decade as the world 's top polluter following decades of the U.S. as the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .

McConnell and Inhofe called attention to the midterm election results , both noting that `` the American people spoke up against '' Obama 's policies .

The two senators also made a pledge of their own , vowing to rein in regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency , a common target for Republicans .

McConnell will take the helm of a freshly won Republican majority in the Senate in January . And while McConnell and Obama have both vowed to try and work together , climate change regulation is likely to remain a contentious point with little common ground between Obama and GOP leaders .

The agreement does not require congressional ratification , but a senior Obama administration official said `` leading climate deniers '' in the GOP could try and stop the initiative through legislation .

`` Congress may try to stop us , but we believe that with control of Congress changing hands we can proceed with the authority we already have , '' the official said .

The plan will also offer incentives in the United States to build up solar and wind power .

`` Consumers and businesses will save literally billions of dollars , '' a senior administration official said .
