Haiti 's terror did n't end when the ground stopped shaking .

Reports of rape and sexual violence have been all too common after the January 2010 earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people and displaced almost 25 % of the entire population .

`` On the evening of January 20 , several young men were firing gunshots in the air . They came into our shelter and grabbed my 19-year-old niece , '' one woman , Dina , told Amnesty International . `` They just came in , grabbed her and dragged her away . ... She was raped by several men . They took her at around 9 p.m. and let her go at around 2 a.m. ''

Another woman , Guerline , told the rights group that she and her 13-year-old daughter were attacked on the same night in March 2010 . The men wore hoods and told Guerline that if she went to the police , she would be shot dead .

`` There is nowhere safe where I can live , so I had to keep quiet , '' she said . `` I did n't take my daughter to the hospital . She was too scared . I sent her to another town where some relatives live . ''

In the days following the disaster , camps were set up to provide shelter for more than a million displaced Haitians . But these `` tent cities '' have been far from ideal , according to Malya Villard-Appolon , one of this year 's top 10 CNN Heroes .

`` After the earthquake , the situation was inhumane and degrading . There was no security . There was no food ; there was no work , '' said Villard-Appolon , a rape survivor who co-founded an organization , KOFAVIV , that helps other victims find safety , medical aid and legal support .

`` Two years after the earthquake , it is still the same , '' she said . `` The people are still under the tent , they do n't have electricity , they are getting raped . ''

Nearly 370,000 people remain in displacement camps , according to the U.N. And gruesome reports of violence , inadequate health care and substandard living conditions have painted a picture of horror and hopelessness .

In one study , published in January by the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice -LRB- PDF -RRB- , 14 % of households reported that at least one member of the household had been a victim of sexual violence since the earthquake . And 70 % of households surveyed said they were now more worried about sexual violence .

Residents have cited lack of lighting , long walks to the bathroom , and flimsy tents as some of the issues putting females at risk of attack . Many females also are on their own for the first time .

`` Women and girls were left to fend for themselves in camps , '' said Anne-christine d'Adesky , project coordinator for PotoFanm + Fi , a nonprofit that has been working with more than 70 Haitian support groups to track post-earthquake violence . `` Because of the great displacement , people lost that sense of community protection . ''

Accurate numbers of gender-based violence are difficult to find in the aftermath of such devastation , especially when many victims fear retaliation . But d'Adesky said her group has seen a steady rise in reports , which she attributes to increased outreach .

One young woman , Marie , was raped in the Champ de Mars camp and had her jaw broken . She said she was also forced into prostitution so she could eat and survive .

High numbers of adolescent girls are engaging in what they call `` transactional sex '' for shelter and food , d'Adesky said . Many of those interviewed claimed they had never sold sex before , but the earthquake had left them no option .

`` I call this gender aftershocks , '' said d'Adesky , whose group is publishing their report on Haiti next month . `` These women and girls have no means of survival and are engaging in transactional sex work -- or survival sex -- sometimes just for shelter . ''

And many of those women -- as well as those who have been raped -- are becoming pregnant , raising fears about rising maternal health issues .

Even before the quake , Haiti was the most dangerous place to be pregnant in the Western Hemisphere : the lifetime risk of dying during childbirth there is 1 in 47 .

`` We followed up with a number of pregnant girls who were no longer pregnant , '' d'Adesky said . According to her sources , there has been a high rate of illegal street abortions and child abandonment .

But amid the depressing and dire reports comes a glimmer of hope .

KOFAVIV and other groups are working to help young girls and women , giving them safety , support and training so they can make money and not have to sell themselves .

Better lighting has been installed in some displacement camps . More than 10,000 military and police personnel are now helping to provide security throughout the country , and hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers have been assigned to specifically work with the Haitian National Police .

And in the last two years , there has been a big change in the way rape is prosecuted , according to legal experts . More women are reporting the crimes , and more rapists are being prosecuted .

`` There has been a higher percentage of complaints that are turning into pre-trial investigations and are leading to formal charges , '' said Brian Concannon Jr. , director of the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti .

In the first two years after the quake , sources in Haiti had estimated there were few , if any , rape convictions . But this year there have already been more than 60 convictions for sex crimes in Haiti , according to the National Human Rights Defense Network .

This summer , 22 rape cases were prosecuted and there were 13 convictions , said Meena Jagannath , a lawyer who has worked with Haitian rape victims . There was one acquittal , and eight of the trials were `` left blank '' for a number of reasons , including lack of representation for the victim who may not have even known she was to appear in court .

`` It sounds like it 's a small number , it sounds like more should have been filed since 2010 , '' Jagannath said . `` But we should take into consideration the biases of the system and level of disorganization and corruption . It really is an accomplishment . I 've heard those numbers are much higher now than even before the earthquake . ''

Concannon said Haiti 's justice system has a history `` of not taking rape that seriously . '' It was n't until 2005 that rape was classified as a crime on par with an assault . Before that , rape was a `` crime against public morals , '' which Concannon says is something like a misdemeanor compared with a felony .

Now the challenge is changing attitudes and empowering women to speak up . While it still can be difficult for many victims to file a police report and obtain the necessary medical documents needed to pursue justice , there are more resources for women who want to speak out .

`` All this progress is the result of advocacy by KOFAVIV and other grassroots women 's groups and their allies , '' Concannon said . `` I believe that the progress has the potential to play a key role in transforming attitudes about violence against women -- not just in the justice system , but in Haitian society as a whole .
