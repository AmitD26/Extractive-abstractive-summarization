On Friday President Obama will address the nation about the NSA 's controversial surveillance programs . He is expected to announce some substantive changes to those programs which collect data about the phone calls of every American .

After the first leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden were published in June , Obama defended the NSA 's surveillance programs during a visit to Berlin , saying : `` We know of at least 50 threats that have been averted because of this information not just in the United States , but , in some cases , threats here in Germany . So lives have been saved . ''

Similarly , Gen. Keith Alexander , the director of the NSA , testified before Congress that `` the information gathered from these programs provided the U.S. government with critical leads to help prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world . ''

Rep. Mike Rogers , R-Michigan , chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said on the House floor in July that 54 times the NSA programs `` stopped and thwarted terrorist attacks both here and in Europe -- saving real lives . ''

However , a New America Foundation review of the government 's claims about the role that NSA `` bulk '' surveillance of phone and e-mail communications records has had in keeping the United States safe from terrorism found that these claims are overblown and even misleading .

An in-depth analysis of 225 individuals recruited by al Qaeda or a like-minded group , or inspired by al Qaeda ideology , and charged in the United States with an act of terrorism since 9/11 , demonstrated that traditional investigative methods , such as the use of informants , tips from local communities , and targeted intelligence operations , provided the initial impetus for investigations in the majority of cases , while the contribution of NSA 's bulk surveillance programs to these cases was minimal .

The controversial bulk collection of American telephone metadata , which includes the telephone numbers that originate and receive calls , as well as the time of those calls but not their content , under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act , appears to have played an identifiable role in , at most , 1.8 % of these cases .

This finding corrobrated that of the Obama-appointed White House review group who had access to classified materials that concluded in December that `` section 215 telephony meta-data was not essential to preventing attacks . ''

Our study also found that NSA programs involving the surveillance of non-U.S. persons outside of the United States under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act played a role in 4.4 percent of the terrorism cases we examined , and NSA surveillance under an unidentified authority played a role in 1.3 percent of cases we examined .

In 27 percent of the cases we reviewed , court records and public reporting do not identify which specific methods initiated the investigation . These cases , involving 62 individuals , may have been initiated by an undercover informant , an undercover officer , a family member tip , other traditional law enforcement methods , CIA - or FBI-generated intelligence , NSA surveillance of some kind , or any number of other methods .

Furthermore , our examination of the role of the database of U.S. citizens ' telephone metadata in the single plot the government uses to justify the importance of the program -- that of Basaaly Moalin , a San Diego cabdriver who in 2007 and 2008 provided $ 8,500 to Al-Shabaab , al Qaeda 's affiliate in Somalia -- calls into question the necessity of the Section 215 bulk collection program .

According to the government , the database of American phone metadata allows intelligence authorities to quickly circumvent the traditional burden of proof associated with criminal warrants , thus allowing them to `` connect the dots '' faster and prevent future 9/11-scale attacks . Yet in the Moalin case , after using the NSA 's phone database to link a number in Somalia to Moalin , the FBI waited two months to begin an investigation and wiretap his phone .

This undercuts the government 's theory that the database of Americans ' telephone metadata is necessary to expedite the investigative process , since it clearly did n't expedite the process in the single case the government uses to extol its virtues .

In sum , the surveillance of American phone metadata has had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism and only the most marginal of impacts on preventing terrorist-related activity , such as fundraising for a terrorist group .

Given that , what should the Obama administration do about the NSA 's phone data collection program , which keeps the phone data of all Americans for five years ?

President Obama has a number of potential choices . The first is to continue the program as is . Another is to give the phone collection program to some kind of private third party entity , and another is to mandate that the phone companies keep the data .

There are problems with all these approaches .

The status quo is open to legal challenges . Judge Richard J. Leon of the District of Columbia ruled in December that the program likely violates the Constitution . Another federal judge , in New York , ruled in favor of the program a week later , so its legal fate might have to be determined by higher courts .

Giving the data collection program to some kind of government-nominated private third party will likely be seen as just another way for the government to store the data . And the phone companies do n't want the costs and headaches of storing five years of data .

There is another approach that should be considered , which is to abandon the bulk phone data collection program entirely and go back to the tried and true approach of having the government get a court order to look at a suspect 's phone records , rather than leaving that decision to the discretion of a group of anonymous officials at NSA , as is now the case .

This hardly seems onerous . After all , since 1979 judges have only turned down 0.3 % of the requests they have received for warrants involving cases of suspected espionage or terrorism . But such a move would assure Americans that there was some sort of due process going on whenever their phone records are examined by the government . And this seems closer to the spirit of the Fourth Amendment , which guards against `` unreasonable searches , '' than does the present system .
