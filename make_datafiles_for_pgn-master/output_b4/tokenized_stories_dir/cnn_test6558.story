-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Seattle , Washington , police officer who was caught on video punching an alleged jaywalker did nothing wrong , the Seattle Police Officers Guild said .

Seattle police are reviewing the incident , which was caught on a witness 's cell phone camera , a department spokesman said .

Police officials originally said that Officer Ian Walsh had been sent to a training unit to review police tactics , but later said that the officer was not reassigned , Detective Mark Jamieson told CNN .

Walsh , who joined the force in November 2007 , has not been disciplined in the Monday incident , which remains under investigation , Jamieson said . The event has been referred to the department 's Office of Professional Accountability for review , he said .

`` The officer did nothing wrong . We always will review incidents like this , that 's how police officers learn , '' Sgt. Rich O'Neill , president of the Seattle Police Officer 's Guild , told CNN . `` I am confident that the review will show that the officer was totally justified . He was defending himself . ''

According to a police statement , Walsh was on patrol and in uniform Monday afternoon when he stopped a young man for jaywalking .

While interacting with the man , Walsh observed four women jaywalking at the same location and ordered them to step over to his cruiser , police said . The department described the women as being `` verbally antagonistic toward the officer . ''

One of the women began to walk away and appeared to raise her hand in a dismissive gesture after being ordered to step over to the car , police said .

Walsh escorted the woman back to the cruiser , but she then started to yell at him and pull away , `` breaking free of the officer 's grip several times , '' police said .

When the officer tried to handcuff the woman , another woman placed her hands on the officer 's arm , police said . `` The officer pushed the second subject back , but she again came at the officer , at which time he punched her , '' police said .

O'Neill forcefully defended Walsh 's actions .

`` The focus needs to be on the two individuals , '' O'Neill said . `` If you watch the entire video , he is trying to de-escalate the situation , first by voice commands , then by taking her by the wrists , and then she reacts by pulling away and swinging .

`` My critique is that he could have used more force and taken the girl to the ground , '' O'Neill said . `` He could have grabbed her , it 's called a leg sweep , handcuffed her and it would have been over a lot faster , but when you take someone to the ground you risk more injury . ''

The 19-year-old woman who allegedly grabbed Walsh 's arm was booked for investigation of assault on an officer , police said . The other woman , who police said was 17 , was booked for obstructing an officer . Both suspects were also cited for jaywalking .
