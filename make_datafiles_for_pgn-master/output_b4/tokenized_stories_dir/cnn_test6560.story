A Maine judge on Friday ruled in favor of a nurse who defied a quarantine in a tense standoff with state authorities , saying local health officials failed to prove the need for a stricter order enforcing an Ebola quarantine .

District Court Chief Judge Charles LaVerdiere ordered nurse Kaci Hickox , who recently returned to the United States after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone , to submit to `` direct active monitoring , '' coordinate travel with public health officials and immediately notify health authorities should symptoms appear . Another hearing is scheduled for Tuesday .

Standing with her boyfriend Ted Wilbur , outside their home in Maine , Hickox told reporters the decision was a `` good compromise '' and that she would continue to comply with direct active monitoring .

Ebola outbreak : Get up to speed

`` I know that Ebola is a scary disease , '' she said . `` I have seen it face-to-face . I know we are nowhere near winning this battle . We 'll only win this battle as we continue this discussion , as we gain a better collective understanding about Ebola and public health , as we overcome the fear and , most importantly , as we end the outbreak that is still ongoing in West Africa today . ''

In a news conference with her lawyers Friday , Hickox , via Skype , expressed her support with the army of U.S. health care professionals battling the outbreak in West Africa .

`` They are why I 'm here , '' she said , acknowledging that she will work in Africa again . `` I hope that one day I can meet some of them at the airport and give them a big hug and let them know that we 're in this together ... This is important day for public health . ''

Her attorney , Norman Siegel , earlier called the decision a victory .

`` She won , '' he said . `` She is not quarantined . She can go out in the public . ... -LRB- The judge -RRB- got the understanding of what liberty is about and how the government ca n't restrict your liberty unless there is compelling justification . ''

At the news conference , another lawyer for Hickox , Steve Hyman , called the decision `` an indication of thoughtfulness versus irrationality '' and said his client had become `` a prisoner because of misconceptions and a whole host of irrational arguments . ''

Hyman said he hoped politicians applied `` the same kind of thinking and rationality '' as LaVerdiere did when dealing with Ebola .

Late Thursday , the judge had ordered stricter limits on Hickox , requiring that she `` not to be present in public places , '' such as shopping centers or movie theaters , except to receive necessary health care . The temporary order permitted her to engage in `` non-congregate public activities , '' such as walking or jogging , but said she had to maintain a 3-foot distance from people . And it forbade her from leaving the municipality of Fort Kent without consulting local health authorities .

In Friday 's ruling , LaVerdiere praised Hickox for lending her skills `` generously , kindly and with compassion '' to `` aid , comfort and care '' for Ebola patients .

`` We owe her and all professionals who give of themselves in this way a debt of gratitude , '' he wrote .

While many people were acting out of fear that is not entirely rational when it comes to the deadly Ebola outbreak , the judge said that fear was present and real .

The actions of Hickox , as a health professional , `` need to demonstrate her full understanding of human nature and the real fear that exist , '' LaVerdiere wrote . `` She should guide herself accordingly . ''

Hickox said she has been sensitive to those fears .

`` This is one of the reasons I am saying this battle is n't over , '' she said . `` We need to continue this discussion . We need to continue educating ourselves and I do n't want to make anyone uncomfortable . I think so far Ted and I have shown a lot of respect to this community . We care about the community . ''

Maine authorities wanted Hickox to stay home for 21 days -- the incubation period for the deadly virus -- although she has tested negative for the disease and has shown no symptoms .

Hickox says that she is healthy and that forcing her to stay home is unconstitutional .

Wilbur said isolating medical professionals returning from West Africa , the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak , affects their partners as well .

`` This thing does n't just affect Kaci , '' Wilbur told CNN affiliate WCHS . `` And when people are going to be coming home from different parts of the world and West Africa , it 's just not affecting the aid workers and what not . It 's affecting their partners . ''

` We 're not trying to push any limits '

The two went out on a bike ride Thursday , trailed by a police cruiser and journalists .

`` If anyone in the community might have noticed , we went bicycling that way . We did not go into town , '' Wilbur told the affiliate .

He said they are not trying to cause trouble and want the community to feel at ease .

`` We did not go into the grocery store . We are not trying to get anyone sick , '' he said . `` We do n't believe that we can get anyone sick . We 're not trying to push any limits here . We 're members of this community too , and we want to make everyone feel comfortable . ''

Hickox 's quarantine was scheduled to end on November 10 .

Governor : Her safety is a concern

Maine Gov. Paul LePage said venturing away from her house jeopardizes Hickox 's safety .

`` The reason there 's a police car there when she does that is to protect her , more than anybody . 'Cause the last thing I want is for her to get hurt , '' he said . `` But at the same token , her behavior is really riling a lot of people up , and I can only do what I can do . And we 're trying to protect her , but she 's not acting as smart as she probably should . ''

At first , Maine officials said they wanted her to remain at home for 21 days . Then , they 've said they wanted Hickox -- who has twice tested negative for Ebola and says she feels healthy -- to avoid public places during that time .

Making a point with bike ride

Hickox has said state officials are the ones being unreasonable . She contends the U.S. Constitution and science are on her side .

`` I 'm fighting for something much more than myself , '' she said . `` There are so many aid workers coming back . It scares me to think how they 're going to be treated and how they 're going to feel . ''

Hickox has said she 's willing to compromise with the state , and she 's open to restrictions barring her from public transportation and limiting her to Fort Kent , a town of 4,000 on the Canadian border .

Siegel , her attorney , said the couple went for the bike ride to highlight that she could be out in public without interacting with people .

New Jersey incident

When she returned from a month working with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone last week , Hickox had an elevated temperature at an airport in Newark , New Jersey , officials said . She was put into an isolation tent .

She blasted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for enforcing a new policy that required anyone showing symptoms of Ebola , including an elevated temperature , to be isolated .
