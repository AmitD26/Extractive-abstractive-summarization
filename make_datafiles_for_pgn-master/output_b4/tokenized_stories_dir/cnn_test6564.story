-LRB- CNN -RRB- At least 21 people died and one more is missing after a survey tugboat sank on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River , state media reported Saturday .

Three passengers -- all Chinese citizens -- have been rescued and the search operation continues , an official from the search and rescue office of the Jiangsu Maritime Administration told CNN .

Those rescued included an interpreter and the suppliers of some of the equipment on board .

The boat , which had 25 people aboard , was `` testing water '' in the Hubei channel , China 's Xinhua state news agency said .

Among the 25 on board were eight foreign nationals , the China News Service reported .

Rescuers said their efforts were hampered by strong currents and cold water , Xinhua said .

As many as 23 vessels were involved in search and rescue operations , including a crane that is being used to lift the boat -- which turned over as it sank -- out of the water .

Rescuers believe that there are several people trapped in the boat 's cabin .

One of the rescued passengers , identified as translator Wang Chenkai , told Xinhua that he tried to hold onto one of the Japanese engineers but the current broke his grip .

`` Only the two of us were in the cockpit , '' he said . `` We have just finished the host load test of the main engine of the boat , when the vessel suddenly slid over . Water immediately filled in . ''

Xinhua reported that the owner of the boat had not followed procedure for the water-testing operation and had not filed a route .
