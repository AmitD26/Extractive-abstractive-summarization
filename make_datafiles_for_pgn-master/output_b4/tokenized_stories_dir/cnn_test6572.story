Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For more than a week , opponents of Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak had the upper hand in Cairo , protesting with near impunity in the face of police and an army that did little to stop them .

That all changed on Wednesday .

The morning after Mubarak dramatically announced he would not run for re-election in September , his supporters waded into Tahrir Square by the thousands , and suddenly serious , prolonged violence reigned in central Cairo .

There were immediate suspicions that the pro-Mubarak demonstrators were not simply average citizens standing up for the man who has led Egypt for three decades -- suspicions that proved at least partly founded .

As battles raged between the two sides , some pro-Mubarak protesters were captured by his opponents . Some were terrified to be caught and begged for their lives , screaming that the government had paid them to come out and protest . Others turned out to be carrying what seemed to be police identification , though they were dressed in plain clothes .

Shadi Hamid , a Brookings Institution analyst based in Qatar , told CNN that the use of hired muscle to break up demonstrations `` is a longtime regime strategy . ''

`` There are usually a line of thugs outside a protest who are waiting there , '' he said . `` They 're dressed in plain clothes , and then they 'll usually go and attack the protesters . Egyptians have seen this for quite some time , and that 's why they were able to recognize what was going on fairly quickly . ''

The global rights group Amnesty International said it has documented the use of unsavory forces by Egyptian authorities to disperse political gatherings in election years .

`` It looks like much of this violence is being orchestrated by the Egyptian authorities in order to force an end to the anti-government protests , restore their control and cling onto power in the face of unprecedented public demands for them to go , '' said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui , the deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International .

An Interior Ministry spokesman denied on state-run television that police identification cards had been confiscated from demonstrators . He said if they had been , they were were stolen or fake . But state television reporting Wednesday did not always match CNN 's own observations of what was happening in Tahrir Square .

Several CNN journalists heard from pro-Mubarak demonstrators that they worked for the government . Staff from the national petrochemical company said they had been ordered to come and protest .

Amnesty International researchers said witnesses told them of `` lorry loads '' of pro-Mubarak supporters leaving Wednesday morning from Mahalla , north of Cairo .

`` These -LRB- pro-Mubarak -RRB- protests were organized by the government and the ruling National Democratic Party , '' analyst Kamal Zakher told CNN . The government mustered government workers and lawmakers whose seats are threatened , he said .

`` They were ordered to go out today . They are well organized and that is suspicious -- especially the use of camels and horses . These are abnormal techniques to demonstrate , '' he said , referring to the shocking charge of about 50 or 60 mounted men through Tahrir in the middle of the afternoon .

And Emad Shahin , a Mideast analyst at the University of Notre Dame , said `` reliable contacts in Egypt '' told him the counter-protesters were organized `` by Mubarak himself , '' with the aid of businessmen who support him .

`` The whole objective is actually to give the impression that there is still support for Mubarak and to force the demonstrators out of Tahrir Square , '' Shahin said . He said the embattled president `` is presenting a very difficult choice before the Egyptian people -- either liberty or security -- and he is hoping that they will choose security at the expense of liberty . ''

In Washington , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed concerns about the outbreak of violence .

`` The president and this administration strongly condemn the outrageous and deplorable violence that 's taking place on the streets of Cairo , '' Gibbs said .

`` Obviously , if any of the violence is instigated by the government , it should stop immediately , '' Gibbs added .

State television called the pro-Mubarak demonstrators tourism workers . At least some Egyptians working in the tourism industry are known to be genuinely upset at the anti-Mubarak demonstrators , accusing them of hurting their business by bringing instability .

Zakher also said it was suspicious that security forces did not intervene to break up the violence .

`` There were no police or military to separate the two crowds at the beginning and that 's also suspicious enough to implicate the security agencies , '' Zakher said .

Journalist and protestor Reham Saeed told CNN she saw men with police uniforms go into hotels on the way to Tahrir Square and then come out wearing civilian clothes , joining the pro-Mubarak protesters . She called that an act of `` betrayal . ''

State TV interviewed several people at the demonstration who said they backed the president because he had provided stability and independence .

`` For 30 years , we lived in peace . President Mubarak kept us safe and secure for 30 years instead of being a country that takes orders from external forces just like -LRB- U.S. President Barack -RRB- Obama now wants , '' Iman Abu Futuh , a pro-Mubarak demonstrator , said on Nile TV . `` They want us to be another Iraq and this will not happen . ''

Another man said , `` I did n't cry when my father died . I cried when Mubarak spoke yesterday . I grew up watching him , seeing him , having him as my leader and the great president of this nation . ''

And a female demonstrator said : `` Mubarak is our father . No one can insult and ridicule their elders . If we do that , we belittle ourselves . This is how we destroy our country . ''
