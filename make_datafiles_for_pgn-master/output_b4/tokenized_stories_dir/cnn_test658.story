ST. BERNARD PARISH , Louisiana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` We were a normal red-blooded American family , '' recalls Rudy Aguilar . `` And ... it took -LSB- one day -RSB- to wipe us out . ''

Liz McCartney moved to St. Bernard Parish to help residents rebuild their homes after Katrina .

A lifelong resident of St. Bernard Parish , a community just east of New Orleans , Aguilar lost everything during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 .

Nearly three years later , like many in his area , Aguilar is still struggling to get back on his feet . But now he has help .

From her home 1,000 miles away in Washington , Liz McCartney was haunted by images of the storm 's destruction and stories of people like Aguilar . In February 2006 , she and her boyfriend , Zack Rosenburg , went to New Orleans to volunteer .

The experience changed their lives -- so much that they quit their jobs and moved to St. Bernard Parish . Now they 're dedicated to helping people rebuild and move back into their homes . Watch McCartney describe how the St. Bernard Project is rebuilding homes ''

McCartney said that when she first arrived in St. Bernard Parish , she was stunned .

`` We just wanted to pitch in and help out , '' McCartney , now 35 , recalls . `` I naively thought that six months later , you 'd see all kinds of progress . -LSB- But it -RSB- looked like the storm had just rolled through . ''

St. Bernard Parish was once home to 67,000 residents , but Katrina left nearly all of the area 's homes uninhabitable .

As McCartney got to know the locals , she was reminded of her parents and grandparents .

`` These were people who worked their whole lives , put their kids through college , and had never had to receive -LSB- help -RSB- before , '' she says .

That 's when she decided to do more to help the community recover . By June 2006 , the couple had left Washington and moved to St. Bernard Parish . Neither knew anything about construction , but both felt they could use their experience raising money and organizing volunteers to help with the rebuilding effort . Local residents , touched by the couple 's leap of faith , taught them basic construction .

Within two months , McCartney and Rosenburg opened the nonprofit St. Bernard Project , which focuses on helping those they consider most in need -- senior citizens and families with children .

The formula is straightforward : With donations , volunteers and skilled supervisors , homes get rebuilt -- and people move home .

`` It 's not rocket science , '' McCartney says . `` The problems in this community are widespread , but the solutions are really simple . ''

Yet this simple equation yields impressive results . The St. Bernard Project can transform a gutted house into a livable home in just eight to 12 weeks for an average cost of $ 12,000 .

For residents like Aguilar , the St. Bernard Project has been a lifesaver . In the years since Katrina , he lost his job and struggled with health problems .

`` I was so beaten down , '' he says . `` I was gon na blow myself away . ''

When the Saint Bernard Project agreed to rebuild his home , the relief he felt was palpable . `` They saved my life . '' Watch Aguilar describe his own Katrina experience ''

To date , more than 6,000 volunteers have worked with the St. Bernard Project , enabling more than 120 families to move back into their homes . McCartney says every house her group rebuilds has an impact on the community as a whole .

`` Once you get one family back , other families are willing to come back as well , '' she says . `` There 's a very nice ripple effect . ''

McCartney and Rosenburg plan to keep working until all the homes in St. Bernard Parish are rebuilt .

`` We 're here until we work ourselves out of a job , '' she says . Watch McCartney describe her turning point while volunteering in New Orleans ''

For Aguilar , McCartney is n't just rebuilding homes -- she 's restoring a sense of hope to the community .

`` Little by little , one house at a time , we 'll be back , '' he says . `` I feel it . I know it . ''
