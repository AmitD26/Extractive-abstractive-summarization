Getting to the chinstrap penguin colony along the Antarctic Peninsula is n't for the fainthearted . To reach the finger of land that juts out from the frozen continent 's western coast , you have to first face the stormy Drake Passage .

But the risks are worth it . Gliding through the waters of Orne Harbor , you may encounter humpback and minke whales , leopard and fur seals , and cormorants and other seabirds . Greeting you onshore is the sight of hundreds of squawking penguins tending their young .

Still unimpressed ? Then hike up the 935-foot Spigot Peak for awe-inspiring panoramic views of the world 's last great wilderness .
