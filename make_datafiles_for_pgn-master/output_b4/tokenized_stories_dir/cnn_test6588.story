The U.N. General Assembly on Thursday approved a resolution calling the Crimean referendum to secede from Ukraine invalid .

The vote on the nonbinding resolution was 100-11 , with 58 countries abstaining .

It 's the latest indication of Russia 's isolation within the international community over its actions in Ukraine .

Moscow formally annexed Ukraine 's southern Crimea region last week , days after the controversial referendum in which a majority of Crimeans voted to leave Ukraine for Russia .

Adding to tensions , Russia now may have as many as 40,000 troops near its border with Ukraine , two U.S. officials told CNN on Thursday . The officials said that this estimate was largely based on satellite imagery and that a firm number is difficult to assess .

However , a spokesman for Ukraine 's Council of National Security and Defense told CNN his government estimates 88,000 Russian troops are at the Ukrainian border .

U.S. officials said they believe the higher estimates may reflect Russian troops on alert farther to the east .

Earlier Thursday , former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko , released from jail last month , said she intends to run for president in May elections .

After more than two years in prison , she was released in February after the ouster of her archrival , President Viktor Yanukovych .

She has already been Prime Minister twice before and ran for President in 2010 .

`` Yes , I am planning to run , '' she said at a news conference at her Kiev office .

Tymoshenko said she intended to ask delegates at her Batkivshchyna Party congress on Saturday to nominate her as a presidential candidate .

Ukraine 's elections are taking place against a backdrop of poor economic conditions , Moscow 's annexation of Crimea and rumblings of discontent in the mainly Russian-speaking eastern regions .

Tymoshenko 's announcement came as the International Monetary Fund announced a $ 14 billion to $ 18 billion bailout for Ukraine to avoid bankruptcy . The bailout is tied to painful reforms as the country faces an escalating standoff with Russia .

U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday praised the loan agreement between the IMF and Ukraine , and said the United States will do its part to help , too .

Speaking with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Rome , Obama said he is calling on Congress to make sure the United States does its part with an economic assistance package to `` support the Ukrainian people as they move forward . ''

The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved $ 1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine , along with sanctions against Russia for its intervention in Ukraine .

Obama said he hopes that Russia will walk through the `` door of diplomacy '' but that its annexation of Crimea means the United States and European Union will increase their sanctions .

Earlier this month the House of Representatives approved Ukraine loan guarantees and is now voting on sanctions .

Symbol of ` Orange Revolution '

With her trademark hair braid , Tymoshenko came to international prominence during the 2004 `` Orange Revolution '' that toppled Yanukovych 's first administration .

A rerun of the election handed the presidency to her political ally , Viktor Yushchenko , under whom she was Prime Minister . Amid broad disappointment with that government 's performance , Yanukovych was again elected in 2010 .

Tymoshenko was imprisoned in 2011 in a corruption case linked to a gas deal she brokered with Russia in 2009 . She served two years of a seven-year term , mainly under prison guard in a hospital in Kharkiv .

Many demonstrators carried her picture during mass anti-government protests that began in November and eventually ousted Yanukovych .

Upon her release from prison , Tymoshenko , in a wheelchair , addressed crowds in Kiev 's Independence Square , the epicenter of the rallies that began when Yanukovych spurned a deal with the EU in favor of closer ties with Moscow .

Early presidential elections in Ukraine are scheduled for May 25 . Former boxer Vitaliy Klitschko and billionaire businessman Petro Poroshenko are also expected to take part in the elections .
