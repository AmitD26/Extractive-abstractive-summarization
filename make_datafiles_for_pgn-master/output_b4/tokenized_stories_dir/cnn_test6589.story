The Maker Faire is a festival spun out of the maker movement that brings together science , crafting , robots , steampunk , drones and Legos . Lots of Legos .

It 's a grassroots celebration of DIY , or the do-it-yourself culture that has helped boost Etsy , Pinterest and other sites . And in the Faire 's eighth year , organizers are having increasing success packaging and exporting the unique Maker Faire brand around the world .

The original Bay Area event was held last weekend in San Mateo , California , and organizers estimate it drew more than 120,000 people . For the past five years , Maker Media has also run an official Maker Faire in New York , on the grounds of the old World 's Fair in Queens . The movement also is gaining popularity internationally , so Maker Faire is planning a large October event in Rome , home of Arduino founder Massimo Banzi .

But in true maker spirit , most of the satellite events are homegrown . There will be more than 120 smaller Maker Faires put on in communities around the world in 2013 , up from just 60 last year . While Maker Media does n't directly organize these smaller events , it does provide locals with connections and a playbook on how to put on their own Maker Faire-branded events .

The colorful events are part carnival , part theme park , part crafts festival and part science museum . They 're a big attraction for older hobbyists , younger makers and crafters , and families who want to expose their kids to the creative side of science and engineering and get them more involved with hands-on projects .

`` It 's almost sort of the new Disneyland , where people get to participate in inventing and creating the future versus just watching it and walking through it , '' said Sherry Huss , Maker Media vice president and co-founder of the Maker Faire .

Some of the event 's most popular attractions were at the Bay Area festival this past weekend , including a Mentos and Coke demonstration , large sculptures originally made for the Burning Man gathering , and the car-smashing Life-Size Mousetrap , which is a giant Rube Goldberg device .

Smaller activities like lock-picking and soldering lessons are also big hits . But the fastest-growing categories at Maker Faires are Arduino -LRB- a tiny electronic controller -RRB- , the single-board computer Raspberry Pi , 3-D printing and personal fabrication , according to Huss .

The Fiesta Hall was kept dark for light-centric displays like a giant Tetris game , a glowing abstract forest , and the ArcAttack musical performance group , which dazzled the crowd with its Tesla coils . The event had a heavy focus on the local community and featured booths for Bay Area groups devoted to Legos , robotics , model tanks , and even building R2-D2 robots from `` Star Wars . '' In the Expo Hall , the makers gave talks and small companies sold their wares for crafters and makers .

There were around 1,000 makers at this year 's Bay Area event . Some 150 of them were kids , a 60 % increase from the previous year . Organizers think a key part of getting children more engaged in science is exposing them to these types of interactive activities .

Their parents seem to agree .

`` I think it 's part nostalgic , '' said Huss . `` As parents are aging they remember great experiences with their grandparents , and I think they 're probably trying to figure out how to make this happen to their own families , especially as schools get further and further away from hands-on activities . ''

Even the youngest kids were making things at the festival . At the Maker Camp tables , children and adults made crafts like duct-tape wallets . Nearby , a hill covered with used cardboard , tape , scissors and other supplies was a hotbed of imagination for kids built elaborate forts and costumes .

Maker Faire attendees are a faithful bunch , often returning year after year to their local events . Katherine Becvar , decked out in a purple velvet coat , cat-eye glasses and fanciful hat at the Bay Area fair , sells bags at Burning Man and all the major craft and maker shows . But she said the Maker Faire is her favorite because it combines a little bit of everything .
