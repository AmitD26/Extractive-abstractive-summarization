LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From bedroom creators to big studios , hand-drawn to CGI , animation has charmed and entertained children -- and , increasingly , adults -- for many years . The Screening Room went to Annecy in France to discover the secrets of success in animated films ...

Annecy has hailed animators like director Tim Burton , seen here receiving a special award at Annecy in 2006 .

Annecy is the Cannes of animation . The French town , which lies close to the Swiss border just 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- from Geneva , has hosted the International Animated Film Festival for almost half a century and attracts a younger crowd than many of the major film festivals . With prizes for long and short features , television and student animation , Annecy highlights a wide variety of different types of animation and budgets .

One veteran of Annecy is Craig Decker , known as worldwide cult figure `` Spike '' and co-founder of `` Spike and Mike 's Sick & Twisted Festival of Animation . '' Beginning 30 years ago as a means of bringing independent animation to new audiences , the touring festival was instrumental in showcasing the early works of legendary animators such as Tim Burton , Pixar 's John Lasseter and Aardman 's Nick Park , as well as the first episode of `` Beavis and Butthead . ''

Spike explained to CNN the challenge of getting animation taken seriously . He said , `` Originally we had to deal with the stigma . We showed great films like National Film Board of Canada -LSB- pieces -RSB- , or `` Tin Toy '' by John Lasseter , works of art , masterpieces that take two to three years to make , and we had to deal with , ` What is it ? Cartoons like Bugs Bunny or something like that ? ' And over the years we 've educated the public , and we 've put animation in the context of a very cool thing -LSB- with -RSB- a young , hip , adult audience of 18 and over . ''

Stop-motion classics

One of Spike and Mike 's biggest fans , Nick Park , won the Annecy award for Best TV Animation with `` Shaun the Sheep , '' a spin-off from `` A Close Shave , '' one of Aardman 's famous Wallace and Gromit short features that grabbed an Oscar .

Stop-motion is also close to the heart of director Tim Burton , who employed the technique on `` Corpse Bride '' and `` The Nightmare Before Christmas . '' He said , `` Because it 's such an old-fashioned technique , a lot of it truly has to do with finding the right group of animators , the right group of people to build the puppets , because a lot of things are being done by computer now . Very few people are doing this style of animation . ''

Allison Abbate , a producer on `` Corpse Bride , '' added , `` Stop motion is an age-old process as far as animation in film-making goes . It has n't really changed since the days of King Kong - we used new technology in ` Corpse Bride ' to bring it into a new century . ''

Appropriate animation

`` I think there 's room for all types of animation , '' she continued . `` It depends on the story . The story should really decide how you tell it . I think there are stories that are better made in 2-D and CGI and that 's what you 'd go for . ''

2-D animation is the mainstay of Japanese anime - a subject so vast it will command its own feature in a subsequent edition of the Screening Room . The film `` Paprika '' has won worldwide critical praise during the past year as a sophisticated example of the art , whose keenest supporters are sometimes contemptuous of their Hollywood animation counterparts .

Asia is becoming an increasingly powerful force in animation , where companies who traditionally provided a cheap source of labor for animation studios are now using their skills to take a leading role in the creative process . UTV Toons is one of several Indian companies forming partnerships with big U.S. production houses to make new animated features .

Combination of skills

Animation requires a combination of several skills , as producer Allison Abbate explained . She told CNN that animators face many complex challenges . `` Animators have to know how to move things , how things work anatomically in a space , but they also have to know how to act , how to emote and that is what makes animation so different from live action . It is so crafted , one frame at a time . ''

But Spike points out that the rewards animation promises can be very high . `` Obviously in features , look at the most successful films , '' he told CNN . `` They 're nearly all animated Pixar pieces or , if it 's live action , it 's the special effects animation that carries the film . ''

And the future ? Spike believes animation is going mobile . He said , `` Internationally , what 's exciting is with new media : with digital ; with broadband ; with mobile phones . That 's where we 're going with our stuff . '' E-mail to a friend
