Indonesia 's top rescue official says authorities believe the missing AirAsia jet is likely at the bottom of the sea , based on radar data from the plane 's last contact .

'' -LRB- Because -RRB- the coordinate that was given to us and the evolution from the calculation point of the flight track is at sea , our early conjecture is that the plane is in the bottom of the sea , '' Bambang Sulistyo , head of Indonesia 's national search and rescue agency , told reporters Monday .

But searchers still do n't know where the plane is , he said , and may need help from other countries for help with an underwater search .

The search for AirAsia Flight QZ8501 resumed on Monday , a day after the commercial jet disappeared in Indonesian airspace with 162 people aboard .

Ships , planes and helicopters are looking for the missing aircraft , Indonesian authorities said .

It 's unclear if weather played a role in the aircraft 's disappearance , but rescuers say it could be a factor that influences how quickly they find the plane .

Large waves and clouds hampered the search for the plane on Sunday , the agency said . By Monday morning , weather in the area appeared to be clearing up , CNN International meteorologist Tom Sater said .

Authorities say they 're combing a `` very broad search area . ''

AirAsia says air traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft at 7:24 a.m. Sunday Singapore time -LRB- 6:24 a.m. in Indonesia -RRB- .

The missing plane , flying from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore , went missing as it flew over the Java Sea between the islands of Belitung and Borneo -- a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters , according to Indonesian authorities , who are leading the search and rescue operations .

Before the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers , one of the pilots asked to fly at a higher altitude because of bad weather , officials said .

AirAsia statement on missing airliner

In addition to Indonesia 's teams , several other countries have joined the hunt for the missing plane .

A C-130 plane from Singapore has been participating in the search , and the country 's military says it 's sending two more ships to the search area . Malaysia 's transportation minister said his country has deployed three vessels and three aircraft to assist in the search . And the Royal Australian Air Force said Monday that it was deploying a patrol plane to help .

And Indonesia has reached out to the United Kingdom , France and the United States for help with sonar technology that may be needed for an underwater search , Sulistyo told reporters Monday .

Now that a day has passed since the plane went missing , investigators should have more data to help them find it , said Peter Goelz , former managing director of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board .

`` They 've had a full 24 hours now to gather all of the available radar data from all of the available sources , '' he said . `` They should be able to put that together , along with any satellite data , and have a more precise location on where to target their search . ''

Waiting and weeping

After hours of waiting in anguish for any word about the passengers aboard the missing plane , several dozen of their family members met with airport and airline officials in a closed-door briefing Monday at the airport in Surabaya .

As they waited for news before the briefing , some took cell phone pictures of a flight manifest posted on a wall . The black-and-white papers showed every passenger 's name and seat number , but not their fate .

Others simply sat and dabbed tears from their eyes .

`` Our concern right now is for the relatives and the next of kin , '' AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said during a news conference in Surabaya . He confirmed that storm clouds caused the pilot to ask for a change in flight plan , but added , `` We do n't want to speculate whether weather was a factor . We really do n't know . '' Once the aircraft is found , there will be a proper investigation , Fernandes said .

Of the people on board the Airbus A320-200 , 155 are Indonesian , three are South Korean , one is British , one is French , one is Malaysian and one is Singaporean , the airline said .

Eighteen children , including one infant , are among the passengers , the carrier said . Seven of the people on board are crew members .

Questions over pilots ' communications

Flight 8501 `` was requesting deviation due to en route weather before communication with the aircraft was lost , '' the airline said .

The flight 's captain asked permission to climb to a higher altitude , the Indonesian Transportation Ministry 's acting director general for air transportation affairs , Djoko Murdjatmojo , said , according to the national news agency .

According to flight tracking websites , almost the entire flight path of the plane was over the sea .

What role did weather play ?

CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said that if there was an onboard emergency , the pilots should have issued a mayday call or a pan-pan call .

`` Mayday means you 're immediately in danger of losing the flight ; pan-pan means that it is urgent but that you can continue the flight and request an alternate route or an alternate airport , '' said Schiavo , a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation .

`` It 's disconcerting in that the standard procedures for an emergency do n't seem to have been deployed , '' she said .

But Alan Diehl , a former Air Force and NTSB accident investigator , said pilots do n't always make mayday calls in an emergency .

`` You know that the controllers ca n't really help you , '' he told CNN . `` You and your co-pilot are going to have to solve this . ''

It 's too soon to know what happened to the missing plane , he said . Details released so far show some similarities , Diehl said , with an Air Algerie flight that disintegrated and crashed in July after changing its flight path because of bad weather .

But there 's also a chance that the AirAsia flight did n't crash after losing contact with air traffic control , he said .

The Airbus A320 is equipped with a ditching switch , Diehl said , that essentially turns the plane 's fuselage into a boat .

`` If they got the aircraft down on the water safely , '' he said , `` it should be floating . ''

` Very good ' safety reputation

As word spread of the missing plane , the airline changed the color of its logo on its website and social media accounts from red to gray .

Indonesia 's President Joko Widodo said his nation was `` praying for the safety '' of those on board . Pope Francis also prayed for the missing , according to Vatican Radio .

AirAsia is a Malaysia-based airline that is popular in the region as a budget carrier . It travels to about 100 destinations , with affiliate companies in several Asian countries .

The missing plane is operated by AirAsia 's Indonesian affiliate , in which the Malaysian company holds a 48.9 % stake , according to its website .

AirAsia has a `` very good '' reputation for safety , CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest said .

Flight 8501 's captain has a total of 20,537 flying hours , with 6,100 of them with AirAsia Indonesia on the Airbus A320 , the airline said . The first officer has a total of 2,275 flying hours , AirAsia said . The plane 's last scheduled maintenance was on November 16 , it said .

The French Foreign Ministry said the first officer is the French citizen who is on the plane . A state-run company in Indonesia that manages airports identified the first officer as Remi Emmanuel Plesel .

Airbus said the plane had `` accumulated approximately 23,000 flight hours in some 13,600 flights . '' The aircraft manufacturer said it would provide full assistance to authorities in charge of investigating the missing plane .

The loss of contact with the AirAsia plane comes nearly 10 months after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , which dropped off radar over Southeast Asia on March 8 with 239 people on board .

The Malaysia Airlines plane , a Boeing 777-200ER , lost contact with air traffic control over the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam .

Searchers have yet to find any debris from Flight 370 , which officials believe crashed in the southern Indian Ocean after veering dramatically off course .

But some aviation experts do n't think the search for Flight 8501 will be as grueling as the search for MH370 .

`` We are not talking about the deep Indian Ocean here , '' Quest said . `` We are talking about congested airspace around Southeast Asia . There will be much better radar coverage . There 's certainly better air traffic control coverage . ''
