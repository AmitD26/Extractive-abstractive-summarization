Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The `` Sons of Anarchy '' actor suspected of killing his landlord before falling to his death on Wednesday had drug issues , mental health problems and was a threat , his probation report said last spring .

The May 17 report says that Johnny Lewis , 28 , `` suffers from some form of chemical dependency , mental health issue and a lack of permanent housing . Given this , -LRB- Lewis -RRB- will continue to be a threat to any community he may reside . ''

Police are seeking to understand what may have sparked the rampage that led to the death of Katherine Davis , 81 .

She died from `` blunt head trauma and strangulation , '' according to preliminary findings from the autopsy conducted Thursday , the Los Angeles County Coroner 's office said .

Lewis was arrested twice in February on burglary and battery charges in Santa Monica , according to records obtained by CNN .

But Lewis ' lawyer , Jonathan Mandel , said Friday that he had not considered his client a threat to anyone . `` The behavior with me was fine , '' he said . `` What was known in May about Johnny was that he had two fairly minor offenses -- which were , fortunately , not serious . And he did have a diagnosis , eventually , of chemically induced psychosis . ''

Mandel , who first represented Lewis in April , said he never would have predicted Lewis ' involvement in a killing and had not suspected he was taking drugs .

`` From April until August or September , he was probably using no drugs at all , '' he said . `` He was incarcerated for a couple of months and then he went to a treatment facility . ''

Though Lewis did appear , at times , to be delusional , `` I never got the sense , when I was representing him , that he was an addict . I did think that he had severe mental problems . ''

Police suspect drugs may have been involved , but `` we do n't have any hard evidence that says he was on anything right now , '' LAPD Commander Andrew Smith said Thursday .

Toxicology findings from the autopsy are not expected to be completed for at least a month .

No one saw what happened inside the house where Davis , the homeowner , was found beaten to death , Smith said . Two men -- the owner of the house next door and a painter -- say Lewis attacked them before he fell to his death .

Other neighbors told police they heard a woman 's screams and glass breaking , Smith said .

The home is in the Los Feliz neighborhood near Griffith Park , on the eastern edge of the Hollywood district of Los Angeles .

An officer responding to a neighbor 's 911 call found Lewis dead in the driveway , Smith said Thursday .

The house `` appeared to have been ransacked , '' he said . Davis ' body was found on the second floor of the three-level house , with her dead cat nearby , police said .

Davis , who had lived in the home for decades , `` typically rented to people in the movie industry -- writers and actors -- and they would come up here because it 's a wonderful , quiet neighborhood , '' Smith said .

Lewis had lived in the home , located on a winding , narrow residential street on the eastern edge of Hollywood , for about two weeks , Smith said .

He played Kip `` Half Sack '' Epps in 26 episodes during the first two seasons of `` Sons of Anarchy '' on the FX Network , according to the Internet Movie Database . His character was killed in the finale of season two .

`` Sons '' creator Kurt Sutter , in a Twitter posting Thursday , called Lewis ' death `` a tragic end for an extremely talented guy , who unfortunately had lost his way . ''

`` I wish I could say that I was shocked by the events last night , but I was not , '' Sutter 's tweet said . `` I am deeply sorry that an innocent life had to be thrown into his destructive path . Yes , it 's day of mourning , but it 's also a day of awareness and gratitude . Sadly , some of us carry the message by dying . ''

Sutter told TV writer Alan Sepinwall in an interview published in December 2009 that `` Johnny was n't happy on the show . ''

`` Creatively , he really wanted out of his contract , '' Sutter told Sepinwell . `` We had ongoing conversations , and we decided we 'd find some noble way for him to go . ''

Lewis played Dennis `` Chili '' Childress in nine episodes of `` The O.C. '' in 2005 and 2006 , according to IMDb.com .

His last work was in an independent movie , `` 186 Dollars to Get Out , '' scheduled for release this month , the IMDb.com listings said .

Lewis , whose full name is Jonathan Kendrick Lewis , was born and raised in Los Angeles . He held dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship , according to his IMDb biography .
