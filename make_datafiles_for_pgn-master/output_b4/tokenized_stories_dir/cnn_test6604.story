Ellen Moshweu was just trying to go to church . A police officer shot her in the back on that November day in 1990 .

David Mabeka was at home in 1986 , sleeping through a newly declared South African government state of emergency , when police burst in to his home and took him away .

A young black man , just trying to get home , was thrown into the back of a police van and taken to jail despite the indignity of presenting a white police officer valid identity papers . The officer crumpled the pass at the man 's feet and took him to jail anyway .

Thaabo Moorsi , `` severely tortured and detained . '' Soyisile Douse , `` shot dead by policemen . ''

Families separated . Races relocated .

This was apartheid .

For many too young or too distant to remember , apartheid is little more than a distant historical fact , a system of forced segregation to learn about in history class , to condemn and to move on .

But for South Africans who survived the decades of punishing racial classification , humiliating work rules , forced relocation and arbitrary treatment by authorities , the end of apartheid was the birth of an entirely new world , midwifed in large part by Nelson Mandela .

A history of apartheid

Though white Europeans had long ruled in South Africa , the formal system of apartheid came into existence after World War II .

The country 's National Party -- led by the descendants of European settlers known as Afrikaners -- ushered it into existence after sweeping into power on a campaign calling for stricter racial controls amid the heavy inflow of blacks into South African cities .

Between 1949 and 1953 , South African lawmakers passed a series of increasingly oppressive laws , beginning with prohibitions on blacks and whites marrying in 1949 and culminating with laws dividing the population by race , reserving the best public facilities for whites and creating a separate , and inferior , education system for blacks .

One of the laws , the Group Areas Act , forced blacks , Indians , Asians and people of mixed heritage to live in separate areas , sometimes dividing families .

Blacks had to live in often barren tribal homelands or townships near cities , often in polluted industrial areas . Whites got the best agricultural areas , the choicest city addresses .

A system of passes and identity papers controlled where blacks could travel and work .

`` Ooo , do n't talk about the Group Areas Act , '' the resident of one such area , Gadija Jacobs , said , according to the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg . `` I will cry all over again . There 's when the trouble started ... when they chucked us out of Cape Town . My whole life came changed . What they took away they can never give back to us . ''

Apartheid rules governed virtually every aspect of daily life .

Blacks had to use different beaches and public restrooms . Signs distinguished facilities reserved for whites -- often referred to as Europeans .

Blacks earned meager wages compared with whites , and their children went to poorly funded schools .

In one of the telling anecdotes of the apartheid era , black nannies who dressed and fed and sang to the children of their white employers were unable to join them in the Dutch Reformed Church , the main Afrikaner congregation .

South Africa since apartheid : Boom or bust ?

Growing defiance

In the 1950s , growing calls for civil disobedience against the government took hold , sometimes resulting in violence as police cracked down on the protests .

The 1952 Defiance Campaign , for instance , prompted thousands of black Africans to flout the laws in hopes that their arrests would overwhelm the country 's prison system and bring attention and eventual change .

Thousands were arrested , but the African National Congress , which organized the campaign , had to call it off after scores were hurt by police .

In 1960 , the tide began to turn when South African police killed 69 protesters gathered outside the Sharpeville police station for a nonviolent protest .

The killings led not only to international outcry but calls for armed struggle by the ANC and other groups .

A grim record

That struggle continued for years .

It 's laid out in gruesome detail in the records of South Africa 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission , formed after the end of apartheid to help expose and heal the country 's many wounds .

Moshweu , the woman shot in the back as she went to church , told her story to the commission in 1996 .

She told an awful story , of a police officer with almost complete power in her neighborhood , a man who used to randomly fire off his gun -- and who she said had also killed her son .

`` He brought suffering to me by killing my son . He wanted to kill me . That is why he shot me , '' she told the commission .

Mabeka , who testified at the same hearing , told the commission he spent two months in prison after being taken from his home in 1986 and beaten at a police station .

`` They assaulted me with fists ; they kicked me , and I fell on the ground , '' he said . `` They did n't ask me anything ; they did n't tell me what do they -- what did they want . ''

John Biyase told his story to researchers from Michigan State University in 2006 .

He recalled marching in Johannesburg in 1977 after police closed many of the high schools attended by blacks in an apparent effort to break up resistance efforts .

Police trapped the marchers and set on them as they tried to escape .

`` They just hit everybody , '' Biyase told his interviewers . `` There was blood , cries . I remember we were shouting , ` Peace ! Peace ! Peace ! ' ''

He spent three weeks in the city 's John Vorster Square prison in a cell with 20 other young men .

There , he remembers police threatening to take troublemakers to the 10th floor `` workshop , '' where police were suspected of staging fatal accidents involving inmates .

`` We knew what the workshop meant , '' he told his interviewers . `` Death . ''

Finally free

When Mandela was freed in 1990 , four years before he would become president , another surprising element of apartheid reared its head .

Before his release , few had seen Mandela 's now-famous face or heard his voice .

Under apartheid , the government banned the publication of anything to do with opposition groups such as his African National Congress .

`` We were fed the information we were allowed , '' said Susan Campbell , a former prosecutor who now is an environmental lawyer in the coastal town of Knysna . `` It was only after his release , really , that we actually saw who he was . ''
