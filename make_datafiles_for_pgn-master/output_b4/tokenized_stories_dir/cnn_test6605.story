Rapper Gucci Mane will serve 39 months in prison after pleading guilty Tuesday to a federal firearms charge .

The plea agreement worked out with prosecutors saves Gucci Mane , 33 , whose real name is Radric Davis , considerable time behind bars .

He was facing up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 500,000 on two counts of possessing a firearm as a felon after a pair of September incidents in which he reportedly showed a gun and threatened police .

Both came on the same week that Atlantic Records reportedly dropped his recording contract .

`` On September 12 , 2013 , Davis , who was a felon at the time , was found in possession of a firearm , '' a federal prosecutor 's news release said . `` Then , just two days later , on September 14th , he again possessed a firearm different from the earlier gun . On both occasions , Davis displayed the loaded firearm , acted erratically , and made threats to individuals , including police and his attorney . ''

Davis has had numerous brushes with the law .

In 2012 , Davis was arrested for hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at an Atlanta nightclub . The man told police the incident occurred after he tried to strike up a conversation with the rapper .

In 2010 , he was arrested in Atlanta for violating a number of traffic laws , but the charges were dismissed .

In 2005 , Davis was charged with murder in the shooting death of a man , but the charge was dropped because of insufficient evidence .

`` The criminal history of the defendant , Radric Davis shows a complete and utter disregard for the lives of others as well as for their personal pursuits , '' Aladino Ortiz with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday .

Sentencing is scheduled for July 28 .
