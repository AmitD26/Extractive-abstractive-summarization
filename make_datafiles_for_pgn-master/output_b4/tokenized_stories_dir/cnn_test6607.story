Luay al-Khatteeb has spoken to CNN previously about the rise of ISIS , and the challenges facing the Iraq 's new oil minister , Adel Abdul Mahdi . Now , U.S. airstrikes have hit locations in eastern Syria where ISIS has been using mobile refineries to produce oil . CNN has revisited the conversation to find out the likely impact of the strikes . This is al-Khatteeb 's analysis of the situation .

What impact will the U.S. strikes on oil refineries have on ISIS ?

The impact of these strikes on ISIS oil refineries are going to be immense and grave . If they are hitting the facilities and the oil convoys on the smuggling roads they will significantly disrupt supply and regular production . If the bombardments continue it will impact the energy supply and deny ISIS much-needed fuel for their mobility and the servicing of the communities under their rule -- now around 8 million people between Iraq and Syria . It makes sense to target the refineries rather than the oil fields , as the crude ca n't be used to drive the tankers . The crude can be sold but the refined oil is much more valuable .

The U.S. and its allies now need to clamp down on the borders to break the smuggling routes , particularly into Turkey . If the ISIS refineries are completely hit , the group will need to rely on oil being refined in Turkey via the black market . These roads now need to be closely monitored , there needs to be sharing of information and the cross-border networks need to be targeted .

How much oil does ISIS control ?

ISIS , in control of a large swathe of eastern Syria , is now handling 60 % of the country 's oil assets and producing 50,000 barrels a day . This is not full capacity -- pre-conflict , the assets would have produced around 220,000 barrels a day out of the country 's 385,000 , according to Iraq Energy Institute figures . However , ISIS do control key oil fields including Al Omar , Tanak and Shadadi . ISIS also handle at least 25,000 barrels of oil a day in north and mid-west Iraq , but that is only a small slice of the country 's total production .

This oil has found its way to the global economy through Turkey 's southern corridor . This black-economy zone is known for its oil trades , smuggling antiquities from Iraq and Syria 's ancient sites , and funneling thousands of jihadists to both countries .

Many observers see Turkey turning a blind eye on a zone that is actively contributing to the instability of the Middle East . Southern Turkey has become ISIS ' safe haven for treating wounded fighters , a gateway for foreign jihadists , and a financial hub that brings ISIS over $ 3 million a day in oil money .

What should be done to tackle the black market in oil ?

Now that ISIS are involved in trucking oil out of Iraq , Iraqi Kurdistan must better comply with the federal regulations and stop any trucking of oil for export not accounted for by the federal authority . There is a risk the oil would be mixed with other smuggled quantities by ISIS to Turkish black markets .

Moreover , the U.S. and the UN Security Council must enforce harsh measures on countries not doing enough to close down black markets contributing to transnational terrorism .

Iraq has a new oil minister -- how will he help ?

This month , Adil Abdul Mahdi was appointed as oil minister . On his first day , he visited the besieged refinery of Baiji , which will help build respect for him in the industry . The facility has been under siege since ISIS occupied the city of Tikrit two months ago .

Abdul Mahdi is a senior politician with a background in economics , and his appointment is welcome news to international companies . However , as a non-oil veteran his leadership skills have yet to be tested .

He faces numerous challenges including resolving issues with the Kurdistan Regional Government , restoring the damaged petroleum industry and ramping up production to meet Iraq 's planned target of nine million barrels per day by 2020 , key objectives the government hopes to achieve within the next four years .

If he succeeds , his name will be immortalized in history as the savior of a united Iraq .

Will he be able to influence the fight against ISIS ?

Although the ministry of oil has a few thousand affiliated security forces , their job is not counter-terrorism -- they are not trained to handle such missions . This task will be for the Iraqi special forces , intelligence services and the army .

However , he can help . The people of the Sunni-dominated provinces are hijacked by three issues . They are : ISIS , a lack of reconciliation and an uncertain economic future .

Abdul Mahdi could do more to push ISIS out of current Sunni-controlled provinces by promoting oil projects that offer local jobs and investment opportunities .

He could strike a deal with local tribes and businessmen to develop plans for the rehabilitation of their provinces , something that would need to be done as part of a wider reconciliation agenda .

After all , the rise of ISIS could have been avoided had there been real political conciliation and economic plans in place to resolve the country 's challenges .

Abdul Mahdi can take some comfort from the fact around 90 % of Iraq 's oil production is in the south , and 10 % is in Kurdistan Regional Government-controlled area , so the bulk of Iraq 's super giant production centers are safe .

But without having the security situation resolved in Iraq 's ISIS-controlled regions , it will be impossible to resume operations , let alone consider development of the oil and gas upstream sector in conflict zones .

What 's the backdrop to Abdul Mahdi 's appointment ?

When ISIS invaded the Sunni-dominated part of Iraq , sympathetic Sunni insurgencies helped them expand into large areas of land , including seven oil fields with a total capacity of 80,000 barrels per day in Mosul , Tikrit and territories bordering Kirkuk .

By the end of June , 20,000 barrels had been reported as smuggled from the field of Ajil , traded at $ 25 to $ 60 per barrel . Later on , ISIS drew on oil in the fields of Hamrin , Qayyara , Ain Zala and Butma , pushing ISIS-controlled oil production to nearly 40,000 barrels per day .

With the help of local middlemen -- who control the supply chain by extracting oil , trucking it across territory trucking tankers , paying off border checkpoints and handling sales -- the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula has become a black-market zone funding transnational terrorism , led by ISIS and other Qaeda splinter groups .

Oil revenues have contributed to expanding ISIS recruitment , with the group 's numbers now estimated to be in excess of 30,000 .
