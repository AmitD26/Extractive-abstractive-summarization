BOGOTA , Colombia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Colombian officials are blaming the FARC guerrilla group for a car bombing late Sunday at a police station in Cali that killed two people and wounded at least 14 .

Residents check out a destroyed police building after a car bombing Sunday night in Cali , Colombia .

It was the second bombing in Colombia attributed to the Marxist guerrilla group in less than a week . An explosion at a Blockbuster video rental store in an upscale Bogota neighborhood Tuesday killed two and wounded more than 20 .

The suspect in Sunday night 's attack was killed in a shootout with police after the explosion , Cali Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina said Monday , hours after convening a special security meeting in the middle of the night .

`` Although the explosive device only had moderate impact , '' Ospina said on the Cali government Web site , `` we should not forget we are at war and the FARC has been committing terrorist acts in Bogota , Neiva , Cali and other cities in the country . That 's why we can not let our guard down , since they take advantage of Sundays and city centers , where control is more difficult . ''

The explosion came just hours after the rebel group released four hostages in what many interpreted as a gesture to reach a peace accord with the government . Two officials also are slated to be released this week .

FARC , which is the Spanish acronym for Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , is the largest and oldest revolutionary group in the nation and has been at war with the government for more than 40 years .

According to Ospina , a blue and red Renault 12 Break pickup crashed into the police headquarters in Cali at 10:38 p.m. and then exploded . The driver tried to flee but was felled by two shots from uniformed police and died a few hours later at a hospital , the mayor said .

The explosion caused damage in a two-block area , the Cali news Web site Semana.com said .

Five of the 14 wounded were minors , Ospina said , citing emergency director Laureano Quintero . The injured are suffering from fractures and other wounds not considered life-threatening , he said .

Cali 's health minister , Alejandro Varela , said earlier 32 were wounded , including a pregnant woman who was in good condition . Others complained of hearing problems .

The mayor 's office said the previous higher tally could be a result of people not wounded in the bombing but seeking medical attention to receive government help .

Three police were wounded , including a major with a broken arm and an officer who had to have three fingers amputated on his left hand , said the police chief , Gustavo Adolfo Ricaurte Tapia .

The bombing caused a temporary power outage , which made security more difficult for officials , said the news Web site Burladero.com .

It was the fourth bombing in Cali in less than 42 months , Semana.com said .

The latest bombing took place about five blocks from the Palace of Justice , which was blasted by a car bomb in August , killing four and wounding 26 . Police buildings were bombed in April 2007 and August 2006 . The earlier blast killed five and wounded 17 , Semana.com said .

Security analysts say FARC has about 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters , mostly in rural areas . The guerrilla group was established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party .

The guerrillas operate mostly in Colombia but have carried out extortion , kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela , Panama and Ecuador , according to the Federation of American Scientists Intelligence Resource Program .

Authorities said Sunday night 's bomb contained 90 kilograms -LRB- 198 pounds -RRB- of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and fuel , a commonly used explosive , Semana.com said .

By comparison , the bomb that Timothy McVeigh used in the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , contained more than 2,800 kilos -LRB- 6,200 pounds -RRB- of ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel .
