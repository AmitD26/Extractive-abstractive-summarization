MUMBAI , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bollywood superstar Anil Kapoor has been catapulted into the global spotlight for his award-winning performance as creepy quiz show host Prem Kumar in the smash hit movie `` Slumdog Millionaire . ''

Anil Kapoor : `` Slumdog Millionaire is like my story . ''

Kapoor talks to CNN 's `` My City , My Life '' about `` Slumdog '' , his hometown of Mumbai , his own rags to riches rise to stardom and how the recent terror attacks affected the city .

CNN : - Did you grow up in Mumbai ?

Anil Kapoor : I was born in Mumbai , in a suburb named Chembur . In my neighborhood the kids never wore shoes , we always had bare feet . I remember my parents asking me to wear shoes to go and play , but usually I would forget .

Usually kids say they want to be doctors or engineers , pilots or businessmen , but I just wanted to be an actor . My father was an assistant director for an Indian film maker and then from being an assistant he became a secretary to one of the big stars .

In my childhood I was surrounded by films , actors , film makers , directors and film talk . I would bunk school to watch movies , old English films and Hindi films -- that 's how I spent my childhood . And playing cricket !

CNN : Mumbai is the home of Bollywood movies -- was that an influence ?

Anil Kapoor : The influence of the film industry is tremendous over here . Every kid dreams of becoming either an actor or a cricketer . In India , we love film and everybody wants to get into films .

`` It 's in our bloodstream -- film making , songs , music , everything connected with cinema -- people just love it .

`` It 's the cheapest form of entertainment and recession or no recession , people just flock to the theaters to watch our movies . ''

CNN : Tell me about `` Slumdog Millionaire . ''

Anil Kapoor : Slumdog is like my story . I also started from scratch , went from rags to riches . I started in Chembur and I slowly climbed -- God has been kind in that way .

CNN : Do you think the film is an accurate portrayal of Mumbai ?

Anil Kapoor : It 's a fairytale -- the story is basically a love story , but shot in a very realistic way and it is very authentic . If there is a traffic jam , he -LSB- Danny Boyle -RSB- has not created a traffic jam , he has actually shot the traffic jam . If he has gone into the slums it is not choreographed at all . The film is very natural -- whatever you see in `` Slumdog '' is very real -- nothing is exaggerated and nothing is downplayed .

CNN : Is the portrayal of the slums realistic ?

Anil Kapoor : It is -- you 'll see from the way `` Slumdog Millionaire '' has been shot , it 's not portraying misery . You see there is a lot of hope in the kids , a lot of fun and a lot of innocence . There 's not a single portion where you feel it has been sensationalized . There is nowhere in the film where you feel they are trying to show misery or poverty .

Mumbai is growing and it 's a commercial city and you can see that things are changing . These are the realities and we have to face it . We are confident enough to face it , we are not ashamed .

CNN : What reaction have you had from family and friends ?

Anil Kapoor : People are very proud of this film . Generally , the public is happy , the whole country is very happy . It 's an Indian story with Indian content and it 's great .

There are a lot of friends from Britain and USA who want to come to Mumbai , after seeing this film . I happened to talk to Tom Cruise at the Golden Globes and he is very keen to come to Mumbai and visit India .

CNN : How have the terror attacks affected the city ?

Anil Kapoor : The whole country was stunned . Mumbai was coming to a standstill and we started questioning ourselves and the government , asking are we safe enough ? What is happening ? Is it our fault , their fault ? Why cant we take action ?

It really shook us completely and the tremors are still being felt . People are still angry , people are still upset , still insecure , still scared -- all these emotions are still there . You 'll find everything is normal , but internally there is a certain sense of insecurity .

CNN : What do you love about the city ?

Anil Kapoor : It is a city of opportunities . People come here to make it and they get absorbed by it . This city always surprises you ; there is something happening constantly , there is a real buzz -- it 's pulsating , like a roller coaster ride . You go somewhere outside the city and you feel it is dead compared to Mumbai . When you come to Mumbai you notice its energy , its excitement

Mumbai never sleeps . When I go to London and I want to eat something there is nothing open past 2 a.m. , but here at five in the morning everything is open , everything is alive . Here everyone is so full of life , so full of happiness .

CNN : What do you do to relax in Mumbai ?

Anil Kapoor : In Mumbai no one relaxes . People are always on the move -- that 's what is relaxing for them . Everybody is working and enjoying themselves and achieving and dreaming . Holidays are also combined with work ; the concept of holiday does n't exist for most people over here .

CNN : What 's it like being Anil Kapoor going about your business in Mumbai ?

Anil Kapoor : I 've never really felt like a star . I just feel like I 'm one of the ordinary people in the city . I cycle around and I 'm around in the street sometimes and obviously people meet me and I love meeting people from all walks of life . I just feel like one of them . I love interacting with them , I love meeting them , making friends . Wherever I go I am always available to talk , to listen . I 'm a good listener and that 's what I do .

CNN : Describe the people of Mumbai .

Anil Kapoor : The people are very open . It 's not that the city 's underbelly is hidden away and you ca n't see it -- you see it everyday , you know what the reality is .

Everybody who comes to Mumbai adds something to this changing , dynamic city . Mumbai is ancient India with a dynamic presence and it 's looking forward to a bright future .
