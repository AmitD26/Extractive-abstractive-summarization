-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- French soccer star Nicolas Anelka has been given a five-match ban and fined Â£ 80,000 -LRB- $ 130,000 -RRB- by the English Football Association -LRB- FA -RRB- for making a `` quenelle '' gesture in a game last year .

The West Bromwich Albion striker was charged by the FA on January 21 after making the gesture in an English Premier League match against West Ham United on December 28 .

The `` quenelle '' which involves pointing a straightened arm downwards while touching the shoulder of that arm with the other hand , is believed by some to be a Nazi salute in reverse and has been linked with anti-Semitism in Anelka 's homeland .

An Independent Regulatory Commission was asked to consider if the gesture was `` abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper , '' and `` included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief . ''

Both charges were proved , said the commission , but it added it did not believe Anelka to be a racist .

`` We did not find that Nicolas Anelka is an anti-Semite or that he intended to express or promote anti-Semitism by his use of the quenelle , '' the Regulatory Commission said in a statement .

In addition to the ban and fine , Anelka has been ordered to undertake a `` compulsory education course , '' the FA said .

The 34-year-old , who denied the charges and asked for a personal hearing , commented on Twitter after the match that the gesture was `` a dedication '' to the French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala before adding : `` I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic . ''

Known as Dieudonne , he has popularized the `` quenelle '' gesture in France and faces investigation by the Paris prosecutor 's office for his controversial stand-up routine .

During a performance , he said of a prominent Jewish journalist : `` Me , you see , when I hear Patrick Cohen speak , I think to myself : ` Gas chambers ... too bad -LRB- they no longer exist -RRB- . ''

Anelka has seven days to appeal the decision .

The Independent Regulatory Commission stated it will reveal how it arrived at its decision `` in due course . ''
