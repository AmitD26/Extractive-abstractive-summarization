LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Football fans are set to benefit from the recession as clubs slash season ticket prices to keep supporters coming back .

Some Premier League fans will save on season tickets after five clubs cut prices .

Price cuts have been announced at five English Premier League clubs . Manchester City , Sunderland , Everton , Portsmouth and Newcastle United have cut prices , while five further clubs announced price freezes on their season tickets .

Bolton dropped their season ticket prices last season .

Manchester City have taken an average of seven percent off their prices , while at Everton the cheapest adult season ticket will now be £ 399 -LRB- $ 550 -RRB- . At Sunderland under-16 season passes will be just £ 1 -LRB- $ 1.39 -RRB- per home match for the 19 matches -LRB- £ 19 -LSB- $ 26 -RSB- total -RRB- when purchased with an adult pass .

The move comes amid a slight decline in Premiership football crowds this season . The average attendance at Premier League matches is down about 800 per match compared to the 2007/2008 season -- however , on average the stadiums are still at almost 92 percent capacity .

Outside the United Kingdom , fans also stand to benefit from lower ticket prices .

In the U.S. Major League Soccer side Kansas City Wizards recently announced they would drop ticket prices for the coming season .

Wizards president Robb Heinemann was quoted in the Kansas City Star saying ; `` We understand these are tough economic times . ''

Other countries in Europe have maintained lower prices in recent years , with single tickets available for about 10 Euros in club games in Italy and Germany . Tickets in Australia 's A-League tended to be cheaper yet , while South America and Africa/Middle East remained the cheapest .

In England 's League One and League Two competitions crowds had dropped more significantly .

Dan Johnson of the Premier League told CNN the clubs cutting ticket prices were simply responding to the financial climate .

`` Given the economic situation , there will be pressure on fans ' ability to spend and the clubs have acted accordingly .

`` It 's a very real way that they can help at this time , '' Johnson said .

Johnson said the drop in crowds this season was not significant and may be made up towards the end of the season when attendances are traditionally higher .

Sport business expert Professor Simon Chadwick , founder of the Center for the International Business of Sport -LRB- CIBS -RRB- at Coventry University , told CNN recessions could have a strong impact on football crowds .

`` In previous recessions there is evidence to suggest that as unemployment rises , the attendance at football matches decreases , '' he said .

However , Chadwick said English football fans should n't hope for significant price reductions .

`` Some Premier League clubs are running at nearly 100 % capacity and there 's excess demand ... so in the short-to-medium term they should be able to continue at premium prices , '' Chadwick said .
