BUFFALO , New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One person credits bad weather and the other a long line .

An investigator works the scene of the plane crash Friday outside Buffalo , New York .

Those are the reasons two would-be passengers did not fly on Continental Connection Flight 3407 , which crashed Thursday outside Buffalo , killing all 49 people aboard and one on the ground .

`` It could have been me , '' David Becony said from his home in Springville , New York , as he watched television reports on the crash and its fiery aftermath . `` My wife would have been with all those families '' who had loved ones on the plane .

Becony missed the flight from Newark-Liberty International Airport to Buffalo Niagara International Airport because bad weather had delayed his earlier flight from New Orleans , Louisiana , to Newark .

Unable to get another flight and unable to find a hotel room near the airport , the supervisor for a demolition company decided to camp out on a seat in the terminal . Watch how airlines have reacted to crash ''

When he found out the plane he was to have taken had crashed , he called his wife , Marti , at their home outside Buffalo . `` He broke down , and I broke down , '' she said . `` We just could n't believe it . ''

Becony spent a sleepless night in Newark and then returned Friday morning to Buffalo -- on another Continental Connection flight .

It was n't a smooth ride , Becony said of his Friday flight . `` It was weird , shaky , knowing it was the same type of aircraft . ''

That type of aircraft was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft , operated by Colgan Air for Continental Connection 's regional service .

`` I 'm still in shock , really , '' said 49-year-old Becony , a Catholic . `` God was looking over me . ''

Becony is keeping his unused ticket for Flight 3407 as a reminder of how close he came .

His wife said friends and family called all morning to check on his safety .

`` It is wow , '' she said . `` It 's been unbelievable . We 're happy . We 're sad for everybody else . ''

Asked how her husband 's close call would affect the family , which includes two children and two grandchildren , she said , `` I think we 'll probably appreciate each other a lot more . ''

Susan Reinhardt , 49 , a marketer for Verizon , had a confirmed seat on a 4:30 p.m. flight from Newark to Buffalo , but it was delayed for four hours because of bad weather , and she was looking for alternatives .

Using her Blackberry to search Continental 's Web site , she noted that the 7 p.m. flight was delayed by only about 20 minutes , so she asked the gate agent whether she could get on the standby list for that flight .

`` He said , ` It 's pretty open ... easy eight standby seats . You wo n't have a problem getting on it , ' she said . `` I said , ` Can you put me on standby ? ' He said , ` No , you 've got to go on the customer service line . ' ''

But that line `` was a gazillion deep because of all the delays , '' enough to dissuade her from making the switch . `` I said , ehhh . ''

When she heard about the crash , Reinhardt was happy for her good fortune but shaken nevertheless . `` The heart-wrenching piece for me was , I was at the gate talking to this gate agent , and a young woman came up and she wanted to know : Should she stay on the 7 o'clock flight because of all the delays ? Did the gate agent think the 4:30 was going to get out before the 7 ?

`` He said , ` No , you will still get in before the 4:30 , ' and she said , ` OK , I 'm going to stay on the 7 o'clock ; I 'm calling my boyfriend . ' And she did . ''

For a while , the two women stood together at the gate , both of them using their Blackberries to study the flight information . Then , they went their separate ways . `` I said , ` Good for you . Have a nice trip . ' That 's the killer for me . ''

Reinhardt said her flight was uneventful . She and the other passengers landed at the airport in Buffalo shortly before 11 p.m. , oblivious to what had happened just minutes before and a few miles away .

`` I walked out , and I saw all these people standing there , and I 'm thinking , ` It 's Thursday at 11 at night . Why are all these people in Buffalo ? Who are they waiting for ? ' Watch witnesses describe fiery crash ''

`` They were waiting for that plane that did n't come in . Of course , I did n't know that until I got to my car , and then my phone starts ringing . ''

Reinhardt said the close call has made her `` a little more philosophical where , if it was n't my time , OK , it was n't my time . What is the meaning of my life now ? What am I supposed to do because it was n't my time ? I 've had several people say , you know , sometimes you ca n't ask why . It just is the way it is . ''

Reinhardt said she plans to go to one of the memorial services . `` I think I need to do that for some kind of closure . ''
