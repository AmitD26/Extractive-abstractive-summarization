-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- David Beckham was upstaged on the day his AC Milan future was finally resolved as teammate Filippo Inzaghi fired a hat-trick in the 3-0 success over Atalanta at the San Siro on Sunday .

David Beckham congratulates hat-trick hero Filippo Inzaghi as the San Siro enjoys a double celebration .

Milan confirmed in a brief statement a deal had been reached with Los Angeles Galaxy over England international Beckham . `` AC Milan announces that the player David Beckham will remain at the club until June 30 , 2009 , '' it read .

The 33-year-old midfielder will then return to the United States to play for the Galaxy between July and October .

`` I 'm grateful to both clubs for allowing this dream to come true , '' Beckham said in a statement posted on www.gazzetta.it .

What do think of Beckham 's move to play in the U.S. and Italy ?

`` It will enable me to play for Milan and the Galaxy in the same season , with the possibility of been able to keep up my commitments with Major League Soccer and the development of soccer in the United States , something which I 'm very passionate about . ''

The deal follows weeks of negotiations between the two clubs during which Milan baulked at the size of the transfer fee Galaxy were demanding -- thought to be around Â£ 12million .

Galaxy 's chief executive , Tim Lieweke , admits the deal is one which suits both clubs . `` I 'm sorry that it had to go for so long , for him and for us and particularly for the fans , '' he told the Los Angeles Times .

`` This is a good solution . It allows him to finish the season with Milan . We will see him in July . ''

Coach Carlo Ancelotti admits Beckham has exceeded all expectations during his first two months as an AC Milan player .

`` Beckham has done more than we could have possibly expected from him , '' Ancelotti told PA Sport . `` He has settled in very well with the squad and given a huge contribution up to now .

`` He is very professional and we are all very , very happy that he is staying . ''

He added : `` The aim was to keep him until June 30 and we have done that . He is very happy with the solution that has been found and we will make the most of having him now and then we will see . ''

Sunday 's victory gave Milan a five-point gap over fourth-placed Fiorentina , who lost 2-0 at home to Palermo .

Ancelotti said Inzaghi had helped lift the club out of a crisis after their UEFA Cup exit .

`` He gave us a real helping hand . It was a tough match and for most of the first half Atalanta caused us problems , '' he said .

`` Then Pippo 's ability to find the right place to be in allowed us to end the match well . We were in a crisis and now I hope that this result has put an end to the crisis . ''

Only the top three in Serie A will go straight into next season 's Champions League group stages with the fourth place finisher having to negotiate two qualifying rounds .

With his contract uncertainty behind him , Beckham seemed to have a new lease of life and he was even given a free role behind forwards Inzaghi and Pato by Ancelotti .

The former England captain dictated the play and helped open the way for Milan to take a seventh-minute lead when Marek Jankulovski firied across goal for the unmarked Inzaghi to score .

Milan had to wait until the 71st minute for Inzaghi 's second . He beat the offside trap to latch onto Pato 's chip and take the ball around Consigli before slotting home .

Moment 's later Inzaghi was once again in the right place at the right time to tap in Gianluca Zambrotta 's pass from close range .

After that Ancelotti took both Inzaghi and Beckham off to give the fans the chance to show their appreciation for both players .

There was no change to the top three in Serie A as Inter Milan and Juventus both won on Saturday , 2-0 at Genoa and 1-0 at Torino respectively .

Serie A top scorer Marco Di Vaio also scored a hat-trick as Bologna thrashed Sampdoria 3-0 .
