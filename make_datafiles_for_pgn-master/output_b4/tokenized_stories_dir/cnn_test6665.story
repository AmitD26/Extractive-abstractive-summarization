BANGKOK , Thailand -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A pregnant British woman facing possible execution in Laos will go on trial this week , the country 's foreign affairs ministry said Monday .

Samantha Orobator became pregnant in prison , according to a spokeswoman for rights group Reprieve .

Samantha Orobator `` is facing death by firing squad for drug trafficking , '' said Clare Algar , executive director of Reprieve , a London-based human rights group .

Orobator , 20 , was arrested on August 5 , said Khenthong Nuanthasing , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman .

She was alleged to have been carrying just over half a kilogram -LRB- 1.1 pounds -RRB- of heroin , Reprieve lawyer Anna Morris told CNN by phone from Vientiane , the Laotian capital . `` For that amount of heroin the sentence is normally the death penalty , '' she said .

Orobator 's mother Jane found out in January her daughter was pregnant -- more than four months after she was arrested , her mother said .

Jane Orobator heard the news from the British Foreign Office , which has been monitoring the case , the mother told CNN by phone from Dublin , where she lives .

She can not believe her daughter was involved in drug trafficking , and was surprised to learn she was in Laos , she said .

`` I do n't know '' what she was doing there , she said . `` The last time she spoke with me , she said she was on holiday in London and she would come to see us in Dublin before returning to the U.K. in July .

`` She is not the type of person who would be involved in drugs , '' she added .

Reprieve is worried about her health , especially given her pregnancy , Anna Morris said .

`` She became pregnant in prison . We are concerned that it may not have been consensual and we are concerned that someone who finds herself in prison at 20 is subject to exploitation , '' she said .

She is due to give birth in September , the lawyer added .

Reprieve sent Morris from London to Laos to try to help Orobator , Algar said .

The lawyer arrived there on Sunday and is hoping to visit Orobator on Tuesday , her boss at Reprieve said . A British consul has also arrived in the country .

`` Reprieve heard about her case two weeks ago . We had thought yesterday the trial was going to start today , '' Algar said Monday . `` We have now heard from Anna that it is not going to . ''

`` I am the first British lawyer who has asked for access to her , '' Morris said . `` She needs to have a local lawyer appointed to her . We are pressing very hard for the local authorities to appoint one . ''

She said it was normal in the Laotian justice system for a defendant to get a lawyer only days before a trial .

The last execution in Laos was in 1990 , the foreign affairs spokesman said .

British Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell issued a statement about Orobator on Saturday .

`` The British Government is opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances . We have made the Laos authorities aware of this at the highest levels in Samantha 's case , '' he said .

`` We are paying close attention to her welfare and are in regular contact with the Laotian authorities about her case . British Embassy officials , including the Ambassador , have visited her six times since her arrest , '' he said .

`` In addition , Britain 's consular representatives in Laos , the Australian Embassy , including the Australian Embassy doctor , have visited Samantha 10 times on our behalf , '' he said .

There is no British Embassy in Laos . A British vice-consul arrived in the country this weekend , the Foreign Office said Monday .

Rammell plans to raise the Orobator case with the Laotian deputy prime minister this week , he said .

Samantha Orobator was born in Nigeria and moved to London with her family when she was 8 , her mother said .
