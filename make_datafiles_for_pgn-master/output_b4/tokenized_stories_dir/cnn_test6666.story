-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- North Carolina State University women 's basketball coach Kay Yow , who won more than 700 games in nearly four decades of coaching , died Saturday after a long struggle with breast cancer , the university said .

North Carolina State University 's Kay Yow , in 1996 , was one of only six coaches to amass 700 wins .

She was 66 .

Yow , who was in her 38th season as a coach , had amassed numerous awards , including inductions into the Women 's Basketball Hall of Fame and the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame .

In her 34 years on the sidelines for the Wolfpack , her teams won four Atlantic Coast Conference titles , averaged 20 wins a season , appeared in 20 of 27 NCAA tournaments and reached the Final Four in 1998 .

She was one of only six coaches in the women 's game to win at least 700 games , the university said .

She also coached the 1988 women 's Olympic basketball team to a gold medal in Seoul , South Korea .

Yow was beloved by her players , colleagues and fans , and in 2007 , N.C. State christened the court in Raleigh 's Reynolds Coliseum in her name .

Since being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1987 , Yow had been active in efforts to raise awareness and money to battle the disease , which forced her to miss two games during the 2004-05 season and another 16 in the 2006-07 season , the university said .

She helped establish the Kay Yow/WBCA Cancer Fund , which raised money for the cause .

About three weeks ago , Yow announced that she was stepping away from coaching duties for the remainder of the 2008-09 season , after missing four straight games because of an extremely low energy level .

`` Stepping away from coaching is one of the hardest decisions I have had to make , '' Yow said January 6 , according to N.C. State .

`` Even though I do n't feel well enough to coach , I 'm hopeful to feel well enough to attend some ACC games and show my support for the team as well as N.C. State University , '' she added .

Yow was born in 1942 in Gibsonville , North Carolina , about 16 miles outside Greensboro . She began coaching at local high schools in 1964 before Elon University hired her . N.C. State hired her in 1975 .

`` It has been an honor and a privilege to work with Coach Yow for the last 15 seasons . I suddenly find myself grasping to retain everything she has ever said and ever taught me , '' interim head coach Stephanie Glance said , according to the university .

The team 's game against Wake Forest University , which was scheduled for Monday , has been postponed until February 10 in Winston-Salem , the university said .
