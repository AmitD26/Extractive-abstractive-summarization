-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 23-year-old Mexican beauty queen and seven men were taken into custody late Monday after being found in vehicles containing weapons and cash in central Mexico , police said Tuesday .

Laura Zuniga and seven men were found in vehicles with guns and $ 50,000 , Mexican police say .

Laura Zuniga and the men were traveling in two vehicles that contained AR-15 assault rifles , handguns , cartridges and $ 50,000 in cash , said Luis Carlos Najera Gutierrez de Velazco , secretary of public security for the state of Jalisco .

The eight were stopped in Zapopan , outside Guadalajara , and will face arms charges and an investigation by a federal organized crime team , Najera said .

Police , who had received a tip that a group of armed men were in a home , `` detected '' the vehicles as they were traveling to investigate the call , Najera said .

One of the men in the vehicles was 29-year-old Angel Orlando Garcia Urquiza , who is Zuniga 's boyfriend and the brother of `` one of the greatest capos of narcotraffic , '' Najera said .

Najera said Urquiza 's brother , Ricardo Garcia Urquiza , is a member of the Juarez cartel and already was in police custody .

All eight were filed before the news media Tuesday . Zuniga , wearing blue jeans and a gray sweater , raised her handcuffed wrists to cover her face in a police picture .

Zuniga is from Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa , a center of drug activity .

In July , she won the title Nuestra Belleza Sinaloa . That gave her the right to compete two months later in the national Nuestra Belleza Mexico in Monterrey , where she won `` The Election of the Queens , '' one of five special recognitions , and came in third overall .

In October , she won the title `` Hispanoamerican Queen 2008 '' in Santa Cruz , Bolivia .

According to the Nuestra Belleza Mexico Web site , she is to represent Mexico in next year 's Miss International contest .
