UNITED NATIONS -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than one million people in Darfur are at risk of losing food , water and shelter in coming months , following the expulsion of international aid groups by Sudan 's government , the United Nations ' chief humanitarian coordinator said Tuesday .

The statement by coordinator John Holmes comes after a joint U.N.-Sudanese assessment of the situation .

The information was gathered from March 11-18 in hopes of stemming further troubles in Darfur after Sudan 's government expelled 13 international relief organizations from the wartorn region .

The announcement came on the same day that President Omar al-Bashir , now an indicted war criminal , ignored the threat of arrest by traveling abroad to Eritrea . Also Tuesday , a Sudanese staffer working for a Canadian relief group was shot dead in Darfur .

A full report of the assessment will be released soon , according to the U.N. , but an executive summary and recommendations were made available on Tuesday .

`` While a significant effort is being made by the government , by the U.N. , by the NGOs -LSB- nongovernmental organizations -RSB- which are left , to plug some of the immediate gaps in these areas , these are at the same time , ` Band-Aid ' solutions , not long term solutions , '' Holmes said .

The U.N. estimates that 1.5 million people in Darfur are dependent on healthcare support , 1.1 million need regular food aid , and another 1 million are in need of clean drinking water .

The summary released Tuesday said the World Food Programme , which is still allowed to operate in Sudan , is carrying out a one-time-only distribution program in March and April , but that new partners will be needed to continue delivering food after April .

After the International Criminal Court charged Bashir with war crimes and crimes against humanity on March 4 , Khartoum expelled 13 international aid agencies and revoked the permits of three organizations in the country .

Bashir -- the first sitting head of state to be charged with war crimes by the court -- has continued to say that humanitarian efforts in the country should be `` Sudanized . ''

`` Within a year , we do n't want to see any foreign aid group dealing with a Sudanese citizen , '' he said at a rally a week after his arrest warrant was issued .

Holmes said that 13,000 to 14,000 aid workers in the region already were Sudanese nationals .

Holmes said the cooperation and technical help from the Sudanese government on the assessment was a good step forward . But he called it `` only the first of many steps if the people in Darfur are not going to suffer major consequences from these expulsions . ''

Sudan 's U.N. Ambassador , Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad , has repeatedly said he has information implicating the ousted organizations in activities contrary to their humanitarian missions . He has yet to make any of that information public .

One claim is that some organizations acted as spies for the International Criminal Court .

Holmes denied those allegations , saying they remain unfounded .

`` Despite claims that there are dossiers of evidence , we have not been given any of that evidence , '' he said . `` In the absence of that , no meaningful investigation can be done . ''

The British aid organization , Oxfam , one of the agencies expelled from Sudan , released a statement in response to Tuesday 's findings .

`` Current stop-gap measures will only be effective for a short time , '' the statement said . `` As the rainy season arrives within the next two months , people living in weak temporary shelters , in flood-prone locations where latrines can fill and overflow , will become at extreme risk of disease and death .

`` With the humanitarian capacity reduced by nearly 50 percent , responding to such emergency scenarios will be an enormous challenge for others to tackle , '' Oxfam said .
