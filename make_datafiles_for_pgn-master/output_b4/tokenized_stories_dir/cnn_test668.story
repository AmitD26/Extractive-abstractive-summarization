-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Canadian ski resort gondola cars that were left dangling and swaying with terrified skiers inside failed because ice buildup snapped a supporting tower , the resort said Thursday .

One gondola car is suspended above an icy creek at a ski resort near Whistler , British Columbia .

In a rare occurrence called ice-jacking , water seeped into the lower section of the lift tower and turned to ice Tuesday at Whistler Blackcomb resort , 177 kilometers -LRB- 110 miles -RRB- north of Vancouver , a resort official said in a press release Thursday .

The lift hangs from a tower that is spliced into two parts .

Extremely cold temperatures caused the ice buildup that exerted 800 tons of pressure between the two parts that hold the tower together , causing them to rupture , according to Whistler Blackcomb .

The section of the lift affected by the accident had 15 cars going up the mountain and 15 coming down at the time , but they were n't carrying a lot of passengers , according to Doug Forseth , senior vice president of the resort .

He said 53 passengers had been rescued from the stranded cars .

No skiers at the Whistler , British Columbia , resort were seriously injured .

`` The towers are not normally designed to allow for any water penetration and so this failure is a very unusual situation , '' said Warren Sparks , senior vice president of Doppelmayr Canada , the engineering firm that investigated the accident .

They are trying to figure out what caused the water to pool . He said independent structural engineers are examining the tower from Vancouver-based CVMM Consulting Engineers .

`` The evidence so far indicates a sudden rupture rather than a fatigue failure over an extended period , '' Sparks said .

At least two gondola cars broke away and hit the ground , both from relatively low heights near the tower that split , and caused the system 's heavy cable line to slacken , according to Tyler Noble , a reporter for CNNRadio affiliate CKNW in Vancouver .

`` One hit a bus stop and the other hit a house , '' Noble said Wednesday . `` Another one was suspended over a creek , but everyone is out of that car . ''

The broken Excaliber Gondola was not operating Thursday .

Whistler engineers checked eight similar towers across the two mountains of the resort . All passed those inspections , and are open Thursday , the release said .

The British Columbia Authority says it does not expect to rescind operating permits on any lifts at the resort , other than the Excaliber Gondola .

Jeff Colburn , general manager of Silver Mountain Resort in Kellogg , Idaho , said a lift tower at his resort was similarly damaged by ice in December 2006 .

The damage was discovered in the morning before the slopes opened , so no one was endangered , he said .

The damaged tower was replaced in about three weeks , Colburn said , and the resort 's business was not significantly disrupted .

`` We check our towers in the summer now , and we also check before we open up for ski season as well just to make sure they do n't have any water in them , and we 've worked with the manufacturers , '' he said .

Holes have been drilled in the bases of towers so that water can drain out , Colburn said .
