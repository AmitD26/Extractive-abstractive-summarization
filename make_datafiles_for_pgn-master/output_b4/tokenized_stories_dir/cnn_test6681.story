According to the earlier arrest warrant , Heinze provided `` investigators with false and misleading information about his whereabouts and involvement in the circumstances leading up to him calling 911 to report the deaths of his family members . ''

The arrest warrant also said he removed a shotgun from the residence and hid it in the trunk of his car .

Seven of the eight victims will be buried Saturday , as a 3-year-old who was injured struggles to survive at a Savannah hospital .

The toddler 's grieving grandmother , Diane Isenhower , who lost four of her children in the rampage , said the child is on life support .

Police said seven of the victims died in the mobile home , and the eighth died Sunday at a hospital .

The funeral for Joseph L. West , 30 , is to be held at mid-month .

Clint Rowe , whose wife is Isenhower 's sister , said the family was having trouble coping with the losses and noted that police , too , were affected .

`` They 're the ones who walked in on that , so you know it wears on the police as well , '' he said . Referring to Isenhower , he added , `` It has been a long week for her . She 's lost all of her family , so naturally it would be . ''

`` They 're just as nice as they could be , '' Rowe said of the victims . `` Friendly folks . Down-to-earth folks . '' Watch Rowe talk about the killings ''

Russell Toler Sr. , who worked at a nearby factory , was a generous man who allowed relatives facing financial and health problems to live with him .
