-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Florida man arrested with his wife on anabolic steroid possession charges claimed to have sold steroids to professional hockey and baseball players in the District of Columbia , but the National Hockey League and Washington Capitals said Wednesday they doubted the allegation .

Richard Thomas and his wife , Sandra , were arrested Tuesday night at their home in Lakeland , Florida .

Richard Thomas , 35 , told officers he sold the steroids to unidentified players on the NHL 's Capitals and the Washington Nationals of baseball 's National League , said Sheriff Grady Judd of Polk County , Florida .

`` Richard Thomas told us that he sold steroids to ballplayers on those teams , '' Judd said after the arrests late Tuesday night . `` Now , is that one ballplayer to two ballplayers ? We do n't know . ''

NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the league would investigate the claim , but added that the Washington Capitals `` have no knowledge of any aspect of this allegation . ''

`` Capitals players were subjected to no-notice testing five separate times over the past two seasons pursuant to the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and there was no indication of any improper conduct or wrongdoing , '' Daly said in a statement issued Wednesday .

A separate statement by Capitals president Dick Patrick said the team had `` no reason to believe there is any merit to this story , '' but would fully cooperate with the NHL 's investigation .

MLB.com , the Web site of Major League Baseball , reported Wednesday that the league would look into the allegation involving the Washington Nationals . The report posted on the Web site of the Washington Nationals quoted Nationals president Stan Kasten as saying the team knew nothing about the steroids claim , and that the league was handling it .

Thomas and his wife , Sandra , 49 , were arrested Tuesday night at their home in Lakeland , Florida , on 21 counts of possession of anabolic steroids , importation of anabolic steroids and maintaining a residence for drug sales , Judd said . He said the couple has been charged with 10 counts of steroid possession with intent to distribute , 10 counts of importing the drugs and one count of maintaining a residence for drug sales .

According to Judd , U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Philadelphia received information that the Florida couple would be receiving a shipment of steroids . Judd 's office then obtained a search warrant for the Lakeland home , where officers found steroids from points outside the United States , including Iran , he said .

The arrest report says Richard Thomas told officers he was `` the biggest steroids dealer in central Florida . ''

Bond for Richard and Sandra Thomas was set at $ 215,000 each , said Carrie Eleazer , spokeswoman for the Polk County Sheriff 's Office , and Sandra Thomas was released on bail Wednesday afternoon .

The two are scheduled to make an initial court appearance Thursday .
