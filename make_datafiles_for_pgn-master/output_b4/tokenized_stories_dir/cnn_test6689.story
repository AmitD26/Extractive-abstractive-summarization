Hinojosa , who formerly covered urban affairs for CNN , also serves as anchor and managing editor of National Public Radio 's `` Latino USA , '' a weekly national program reporting on news and culture in the Latino community .

Maria Hinojosa says Sonia Sotomayor 's success has helped boost self-confidence for many .

NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a question I never thought I would ask my daughter . But I loved being able to ask it .

`` Yurema ? ''

`` Yes , Mom , '' my 11-year-old daughter said .

`` Tell me what T-shirt you would most like to wear : one that says ` I am a Wise Latina , ' ` My Mother is a Wise Latina ' or ` Sonia is a Wise Latina ' ? ''

She cocked her head slightly and then quickly said , `` I am a Wise Latina . ''

Eleven years old , and this is the vision she already has of herself . It 's a pretty wonderful thing to watch that certain something blossom in a girl ... one of those often fleeting moments when a girl owns her own power .

For me , the decision to wear my own `` Wise Latina '' T-shirt raises all kinds of issues . It makes me confront a past that I have known for decades . Deep down inside , I , like many other Latinas , struggle with my own very deep insecurities in relation to my white male colleagues . I think after witnessing history on television for the past two weeks , those insecurities have pretty much dissipated .

Sonia Sotomayor has blazed the trail . I ca n't go back to thinking that way , anymore , ever .

Before , when I told people that I was a Latina , I never knew what , if any , image they might have in their mind . Everyone carries stereotypes and preconceived notions . But now when I say to people that I am a Latina , might they immediately think , `` A wise Latina '' ?

My daughter is learning all of these lessons from Sotomayor , a Puerto Rican woman . When I was Yurema 's age , back in the '70s , the only Puerto Rican woman I knew of was Maria -LRB- played by Natalie Wood -RRB- from `` West Side Story . '' I grew up on the South Side of Chicago after being born in Mexico .

My Puerto Rican Maria from West Side Story taught me that love and commitment could transcend borders and divisions . Sonia is teaching Yurema , and all of us , that intelligence and compassion -LRB- and an honest way with words -RRB- can also cross all borders : political ones , those of gender or ethnicity .

And I have learned that my own challenge now is to reach this very high bar that Sotomayor has set . I must `` own '' that I am , indeed , a wise Latina .

Later on the day of the T-shirt decision , my daughter hears my reaction when I read that Sen. John McCain , whom my daughter knows well because we followed the election , is going to vote against Sotomayor 's confirmation .

`` What a big jerk ! '' was her age-appropriate response .

Then , after a pause , Yurema said , `` So that means John McCain thinks Sarah Palin is a wise woman ? But not Sonia ? Harrumph . ''

`` Harrumph '' is also an age-appropriate response . But the lasting impact of McCain 's decision will be much more profound than upsetting an 11-year-old wise Latina girl .

In fact , I would venture to say that , politically , there are many in the Republican Party who are convinced this was a politically unwise choice by McCain .

It 's just not that complicated . Look at the changing demographics in the United States . Then think about what happens when you vote against the first Latina Supreme Court nominee .

Maybe McCain is n't wise enough to see that reality , so I will tell him a story about a Dominican-born , U.S. citizen cabby from my Harlem neighborhood .

While he drove down Broadway , I asked the cabby if he thought that President Obama was pandering to the Latino communities across the country with the Sotomayor nomination .

`` Pero muchacha ! '' he exclaimed in a true Dominican style . `` He is not pandering . He owes us ! Everyone knows now that without the Latino vote , you can not win the presidency . He has to deliver , politically . I am a new citizen , and I voted for Obama my first time . Just like a bunch of us Dominican cabbies . Now this is my country and my politics . ''

`` And is that the way you guys talk amongst yourselves ? That the Latino vote is that powerful ? ''

`` Yep , asi lo vemos . That 's how we see it ! But even though we love Sonia , Obama still owes us . ''

And what must Obama deliver to satisfy this very politically astute cabby ?

`` Imigracion ! He must solve this immigration problem . Families are divided up . It is unjust . So Obama must understand that is what we want him to deliver now . ''

A wise Latino with some wise advice for the president . And for McCain and the Republican Party ?

Buena suerte , winning the next elections !
