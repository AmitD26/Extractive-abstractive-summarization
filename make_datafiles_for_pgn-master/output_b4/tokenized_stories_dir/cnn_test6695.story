-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Public Utility Commission of Texas will review the case of a cancer patient fighting to keep her electricity on to power her oxygen machine , the commission told CNN on Wednesday .

Mable Randon , who has stage 4 cancer , was denied help paying for electricity , which she needs to power her oxygen tank .

CNN affiliate KHOU of Houston , Texas , said calls poured in from as far away as Connecticut after the station aired its story on Mable Randon , a stage 4 cancer patient who received a cutoff notice after she fell behind on her bills .

`` I 'm on a set income , '' she told KHOU . `` My husband lost his job . He finds a little work every now and then , but it 's hard . ''

She applied to CenterPoint Energy 's Critical Care Program which helps maintain service for people who depend on electric-powered life support systems , but she was rejected .

`` I 'm fighting for my life , and I thought people at the power company would help me , '' said Randon , who uses a wheelchair . `` I just thought they 'd make some kind of exception for me . ''

Randon 's power will stay on until the commission examines the facts in the case , said Terry Hadley , spokesman for the commission .

CenterPoint told Randon she failed to meet the criteria . Spokeswoman Alicia Dixon told KHOU that Randon could have bought a battery-powered oxygen machine . The critical care program has thousands of applicants , and only 300 of them have been accepted , she said .

`` This program is a communication program , not a guarantee of uninterrupted power , even to customers who are on the list , '' she said .

Since the rejection , Randon said she is `` up and down all night , '' partly because she is worried about whether the power will be on when she wakes up .

`` They have no consideration for life , '' she said . `` It 's just like they do n't care . ''

CenterPoint spokeswoman Leticia Lowe said the company does not send electric bills ; it merely owns the wires and poles and is directed to disconnect power by retail electric providers .

Randon 's electric company is Freedom Power , she said . CNN 's attempts to contact Freedom Power were unsuccessful Wednesday . As of Tuesday , CenterPoint had not received a notice from Freedom Power to disconnect Randon 's service , Lowe said .

Following the KHOU report , CenterPoint received calls from viewers , she said . But the company can do nothing since they do n't bill Randon .
