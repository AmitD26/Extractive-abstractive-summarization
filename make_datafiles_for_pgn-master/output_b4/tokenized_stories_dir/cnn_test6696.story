-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- To offset carbon dioxide , a Japanese airline is asking its passengers to go to the toilet before boarding .

All Nippon Airways is asking passengers to use the restroom before flying to reduce weight .

The unusual request by All Nippon Airways -LRB- ANA -RRB- is part of its `` e-Flight '' promotional program to reduce the amount of carbon expelled on 38 domestic routes and its twice daily international flights to Singapore .

`` Asking passengers to go to the toilet -LRB- before boarding -RRB- is just a small part of the program , '' said spokeswoman Megumi Tezuka , which includes using recycled paper cups and plastic bottles instead of glass .

`` We are making these items lighter -- and making the passengers lighter , a little bit , '' Tezuka said .

The airline estimates that if 50 percent of passengers relieved themselves before boarding , it would reduce carbon dioxide by 4.2 tons a month .

Flights will also show educational films on the environment .

The month-long trial program , which began October 1 , will be evaluated and may be extended if successful , Tezuka said .

In true Japanese fashion , the encouragement to eliminate is more suggested than explicit . This is what is announced before boarding the flights : `` This flight is a so-called ` eFlight . ' The idea behind the operation is to think about the Earth in the sky above . Fuel reduction by lightening the weight of the aircraft will lead to restrain the carbon dioxide emission , which is one of the causes of global warming . Thank you for your understanding . ''

So no mother-like admonishments to use the toilet before leaving ? `` No , it 's more subtle than that , '' Tezuka said . People are also encouraged to pack lighter for the flights , although no additional weight restrictions apply .

The program comes as the airline industry in Japan is struggling . The nation 's largest carrier , Japan Airlines , is seeking a government bailout and forecasts $ 700 million in losses this year . This week , ANA 's stock price hit a 52-week low in trading Wednesday .
