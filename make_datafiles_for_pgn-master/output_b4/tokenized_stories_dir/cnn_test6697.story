LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- During the current economic crisis , high-flying women have been overlooked for promotion , according to a study out Tuesday .

At the upper level of management , business is still dominated by men .

The study , by U.S. nonprofit research group Catalyst , surveyed 873 MBA alumni who graduated between 1996 and 2007 , asking how their careers had fared between November 2007 and June 2009 .

The results showed that overall , male and female MBAs have proved resilient to the recession and have fared equally well in the U.S. , Canada and Asia , with 31 percent of surveyed women reporting that they had been promoted during that time period , compared to 36 percent of men .

However in Europe , just 26 per cent of women were promoted , compared with 44 percent of men , according to the study published in the Harvard Business Review .

According to the Harvard Business Review , of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies only two per cent of the CEOs are women , and only 15 per cent of the seats on their boards of directors are held by women .

Professor Susan Vinnicombe is the director of the Center for International Women Business Leaders at Cranfield University School of Management in England .

She told CNN that while it is n't clear why the figures for Europe in particular show such a gender discrepancy , it reflects discrimination faced by women business leaders in general .

`` There is a whole stream of research of male and female MBAs that systematically shows the more senior they get the bigger the disparities in salaries and promotion , '' she said .

`` Immediately after the MBA -- at the mid level -- women do quite well , but as they progress upwards the disparities emerge and get wider . That 's not just for MBAs , it 's the function of men and women in the workforce in general . ''

When it comes to the top tier , women worldwide were much more likely than men to lose their jobs , with 19 percent of female senior executives losing their jobs , compared with six per cent of men .

Eleanor Tabi Haller-Jorden , General Manager of Catalyst Europe told CNN that the discrepancy is probably not the result of the current economic malaise . `` These figures reflect what has been a challenge in Europe for a number years , '' she said .

`` The talent pipeline in Europe is clearly not as robust for women . This study indicates that by and large this is not directly related to the economic crisis , but it may have magnified the discrepancy . ''

Haller-Jorden cites European corporate culture , perpetuation of gender-based stereotypes , exclusion of women from informal networks and a lack of role models as reasons behind the discrepancy .

Cranfield University produces what it calls the `` Female FTSE Index , '' showing the percentage of female directors in Britain 's top 100 companies . Vinnicombe says that in the last 10 years the number of female directors has hardly improved , increasing from seven per cent to just 11 percent .

Vinnicombe adds that she has found anecdotal evidence that a number of senior women in the British banking sector have chosen to leave their jobs , rather than work in a `` high pressure , highly controlling '' work environment brought about by the economic crisis .

The Catalyst study also shows that many MBAs are n't letting the economic crisis get in the way of career advancement . Overall , 34 percent of respondents had received a promotion and 35 percent made a lateral move .

`` The data almost indicates business as usual , in highly unusual times for business , '' Haller-Jorden told CNN .

The common perception might be that given the current economic uncertainty , employees would choose to play it safe rather than chance their luck in a volatile job market , but the study found that MBAs have been willing to risk career moves , with 20 percent of respondents changing jobs , 14 percent relocating and four percent starting their own business .

Haller-Jorden said that MBAs represent `` high-potential employees '' who tend to be entrepreneurial and show a high level of initiative .

She added that these individuals tend to be opportunistic when it comes to their careers , seeking out new developmental opportunities , exploring lateral moves , looking at options around relocating , and choosing other employment opportunities to make sure they are n't negatively impacted by recession .

`` The results are sobering for a corporate sector which may have assumed that people would be grateful to have a job and would n't necessarily be exploring other options , '' she said .

`` For companies to rest on their laurels and assume they do n't need to worry about retention is a mistake . ''
