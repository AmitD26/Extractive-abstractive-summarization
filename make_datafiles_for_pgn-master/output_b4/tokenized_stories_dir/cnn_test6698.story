Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Pentagon is blocking public release of photos apparently depicting abuse of suspected terrorists and foreign troops in U.S. custody , and urging the Supreme Court to dismiss a lower court ruling ordering the photos to be publicly disclosed , according to court documents .

Defense Secretary Robert Gates notified the high court late Friday that he was issuing an order to block the release .

The photos have been at the center of a years-long lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union . Congress last month gave the Obama administration specific authority to prevent any release of the 44 photos . Afterward , Gates signed a certificate of authorization , or order , to prevent the photos ' release , saying their disclosure would endanger U.S. troops serving abroad .

The order covers all photographs taken of people captured or detained in overseas military operations between September 11 , 2001 , the day of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington , and January 22 , 2009 , shortly after President Obama took office .

The Pentagon initially was set to release the images of Iraqi and Afghan prisoners in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the ACLU .

But Obama and the Justice Department objected to the court-ordered release , reversing an earlier executive decision . Obama had initially agreed to the release , but changed his mind after military leaders privately and intensely urged him to block it .

The ACLU criticized the administration 's about-face , saying it `` makes a mockery '' of Obama 's campaign promise of greater transparency and accountability , and damages efforts to hold accountable those responsible for abusing prisoners .

A homeland security appropriations bill passed October 29 by Congress and signed by the president grants the Department of Defense authority to withhold the photographs .

The images were gathered as part of a military investigation into allegations that detainees held in Afghanistan and Iraq were tortured and physically abused .

According to the government legal brief filed with the high court , several of the photos show `` soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees . '' Other images described by military reports show prisoners in restrained and humiliating positions . Military investigations led to criminal charges against some of the soldiers shown in the images .

The photos currently at issue are separate from those first publicly released in 2006 showing abuse of Muslim men held at Baghdad 's Abu Ghraib prison .

The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in September 2008 that the photos must be released . The president later said that doing so `` would pose an unacceptable risk of danger to U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq . ''

Newest Justice Sonia Sotomayor had served on that appeals court until August , but was not involved in that particular case .

The high court has delayed for weeks a decision on whether it would accept the ACLU appeal on the broader issues associated with government authority to block release of potentially embarrassing and inflammatory material by the military . The justices will now probably wait to hear from the ACLU over Gates ' order before deciding whether to take the case .

The Senate in May voted for the Detainee Photographic Records Protection Act , which would limit the reach of the Freedom of Information Act request in this instance . The House adopted a similar provision in October .

Other photos could be released under the earlier appeals court ruling . The case is Department of Defense v. ACLU -LRB- 09-160 -RRB- .

Separately , the administration also urged the high court to dismiss a pending lawsuit by several Guantanamo Bay detainees , over their claims of torture and religious discrimination .

A brief was filed by the Justice Department late Friday , the same time as the separate photograph disclosure case .

Four British men , all Muslims and former detainees at the military prison at the Navy base in Cuba , had sued onetime Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top Pentagon officials , saying they knew of and condoned physical abuse and denial of rights guaranteed under international law .

A federal appeals court had dismissed the lawsuit -- the second one filed by the men -- saying the officials had immunity from such claims .

But in June 2008 , the Supreme Court allowed Guantanamo prisoners to challenge their captivity in federal court , and the justices in December urged the lower court to reconsider its decision against the British detainees .

In the government filing , Solicitor General Elena Kagan told the high court to exercise caution in granting what she called `` new rights '' to detained foreign fighters suing for damages in a military setting . The high court , she noted , had previously told lower courts `` to pay particular heed to any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation . ''

The case is Rasul v. Myers -LRB- 09-227 -RRB- .
