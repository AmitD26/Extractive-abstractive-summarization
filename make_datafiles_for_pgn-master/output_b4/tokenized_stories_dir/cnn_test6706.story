LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Harry Patch -- the last surviving British soldier from World War I -- died Saturday at the age of 111 , Britain 's Ministry of Defence said .

Patch died peacefully at his care home in the southwestern English city of Wells , the ministry announced .

His death came a week after fellow British World War I veteran Henry Allingham died at the age of 113 .

Patch was the last surviving soldier to have witnessed the horrors of trench warfare in the first World War

He fought and was seriously wounded in Ypres , Belgium , in 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele , in which 70,000 of his fellow soldiers died -- including three of his close friends .

Born in 1898 , Patch became a plumber before being conscripted to the army in 1916 . After training , Patch was recruited to The Duke of Cornwall 's Light Infantry as a Lewis gunner assistant .

The unit was rushed to the front line trenches of Ypres , where soldiers were urgently needed to replace those who were wounded and dying by the thousand .

He fought in the trenches between June and September of 1917 and was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the war . In late September he was wounded when a light shell exploded above his head , bringing an end to his military service .

He received battlefield treatment without anesthetic .

After the war , Harry returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer . He married Ada Billington , a young girl he met while convalescing after the battle . They married in 1919 and had two sons .

In World War II , Patch joined the Auxiliary Fire Service and helped tackle the fires caused by heavy German raids on the English cities of Bath and Bristol .

At one point , he was sent to organize sanitary arrangements for soldiers at a camp near Yeovil , where he became friendly with some of the men . Patch remembered the shock of finding the camp deserted , with coffee still hot and meals half-eaten , on the morning that the soldiers had gone off to France , the Ministry of Defence said .

His wife , Ada , died in 1976 , and their two sons also later died . Patch remarried in 1980 , but he became a widower for the second time four years later .

Patch did n't speak about the war until he turned 100 , the Ministry of Defence said .

`` He tried to suppress the memories and to live as normal a life as possible ; the culture of his time said that he was fortunate to have survived and that he should get on with his life , '' a Ministry of Defence biography says .

`` That suited Harry ; he could ` forget ' his demons , the memories of what happened to him and to his close friends . ''

In 1998 , a television producer with an interest in the war talked to Patch , who then made the decision to speak of his memories , the Ministry of Defence said . He took part in a documentary on the war and began gradually to open up .

It was n't long before Patch became a spokesman for his generation , speaking about the horrors of the war as well as his own emotions and reactions , the Ministry of Defence said .

`` In speaking about his experiences , Harry began at last to come to terms with his war , and was at peace with himself and his memories , '' the Defence Ministry said . `` His thoughts then turned to reconciliation , to the long-term effects of suffering and coming to terms with that suffering . ''

Patch returned to Belgium in 2002 , something he had said he would never do , and laid a wreath to his battalion , the Defence Ministry said .

Two years later , he met and shook hands with a German artilleryman from the Western Front , Charles Kuentz . Patch later laid a wreath at Langemark Cemetery for the German war dead .

In his last years , Patch was honored at Buckingham Palace and the prime minister 's residence at 10 Downing Street .

On his 101st birthday France awarded him the Knighthood of the Legion of Honor , and this year President Nicolas Sarkozy upgraded that to the rank of officer .

Last year , King Albert II of Belgium made Patch a Knight of the Order of Leopold .

`` Harry was delighted to receive these awards and wore the medals with great pride , but he always made it clear that he wore these medals as a representative of the selfless generation he had come to represent , '' the Ministry of Defence said .

Patch wrote a book detailing his life in 2007 , called `` The Last Fighting Tommy . '' The name referred to the slang term for British privates .

`` While the country may remember Harry as a soldier , we will remember him as a dear friend , '' said Jim Ross , a close friend . `` He was a man of peace who used his great age and fame as the last survivor of the trenches to communicate two simple messages : Remember with gratitude and respect those who served on all sides , -LRB- and -RRB- settle disputes by discussion , not war . ''

Gen. Richard Dannatt , the chief of the general staff , issued a statement expressing his sadness about Patch 's death .

`` Self-effacing about his experiences in the trenches he was no less effective in describing the horror they represented when invited to speak to schoolchildren about the realities of war . '' Dannatt said .

`` He was the last of a generation that in youth was steadfast in its duty in the face of cruel sacrifice and we give thanks for his life -- as well as those of his comrades -- for upholding the same values and freedom that we continue to cherish and fight for today . ''
