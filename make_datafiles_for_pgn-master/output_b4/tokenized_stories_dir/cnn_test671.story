WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A group of student protesters were arrested Sunday after they called on President Bush to end the humanitarian crisis in Darfur , Sudan , and refused to leave the front gates of the White House .

The protesters shouted , `` Hey Bush , you ca n't hide ! Help us end this genocide ! '' and `` President Bush ! No more excuses ! '' Federal police arrested 18 of them after they marched to the White House .

Sunday 's protest was one of many scheduled around the world for `` Global Day for Darfur '' to mark five years of ethnic cleansing in Sudan . The conflict has killed more than 200,000 people , and it has made refugees of more than 2 million others .

In the U.S. , Scott Warren , national student director of the Student Anti-Genocide Coalition , said the students were bringing specific demands to the president , including bolstering the United Nations peacekeeping force in Sudan and stepping up pressure on China , Sudan 's trading partner .

`` In your last seven months , you can make peace in Sudan , and this is how you can do it , '' he said .

Warren said the students knew the president was n't home , but still hoped their message was heard . Bush was on his way back to Washington from his ranch in Crawford , Texas .

`` It 's not something we take lightly , and we do understand the implications of it . But we also understand that genocide is not just a casual issue , '' said student activist Ashley Kroetsch , who was among the 18 arrested . `` It is one of the worst crimes against humanity , and it requires a very severe response to end it . ''

The Bush administration supports economic sanctions and implementation of existing agreements for peace and security in Darfur .

Bush traveled recently to Africa , and spoke about genocide on several stops .

`` We 're trying to help them , but the truth of the matter is there are obstacles to peace in Darfur , '' he said at a stop in Tanzania . `` And that is one of the reasons we 've imposed tough sanctions -- real , meaningful sanctions against those who are stopping progress toward alleviating the human suffering in Darfur .
