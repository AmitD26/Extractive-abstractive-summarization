NEW HAVEN , Connecticut -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Raymond J. Clark III , charged with murder in the death of Yale graduate student Annie Le , was smart , amiable and loved his dog , say those who knew him .

Raymond Clark III was arrested Thursday and charged with murder in the death of Annie Le .

One researcher said he often went by the lab in the Yale School of Medicine building where Le was found strangled and stuffed in a wall . Lufeng Zhang worked with Clark , he said , and thinks the police may have the wrong man .

`` He 's a nice man , always , '' he said .

Clark , 24 , the same age as Le , was a technician in the school of medicine 's Animal Resources Center . While Le , who was pursuing a doctorate in pharmacology , conducted experiments on mice , Clark took care of the rodents and cleaned their cages .

Police will not say whether Clark and Le were acquainted or why they homed in on Clark after Le went missing September 8 , less than a week before she was scheduled to marry a Columbia University graduate student who was her college sweetheart . Watch police announce arrest ''

`` They work in the same building , passed in the hallways , '' New Haven Police Chief James Lewis said of Le and Clark . `` Anything beyond that , I wo n't talk about . ''

Though details of the investigation are scant , police said they arrested Clark on Thursday and charged him with Le 's murder after collecting more than 250 pieces of evidence .

Clark was an honor student at Branford High School in suburban New Haven . He graduated in 2004 , and according to the school 's yearbook , he was a member of the Asian Awareness Club his senior year .

High school friend Lisa Heselin remembers Clark `` as a jokester , kind of a class clown , '' she said . `` Everybody knew him . Everybody liked him . ''

She and others who knew Clark in high school are shocked that he was arrested in connection with Le 's murder , she said . Watch what acquaintances say about Clark ''

`` They ca n't believe it , and then , of course , you 're reminiscing , like , ` Oh my God , remember when we went over to his house and we all hung out ? ' You do n't expect somebody you grew up with to be involved in something like this , '' Heselin said .

Maurice Perry , who said he has been friends with Clark since first grade , told CNN on Thursday night that he does n't believe his longtime pal is guilty .

`` This is not the Raymond Clark that I know , '' he said . `` I 've known him so long , I just ca n't picture him doing something like this . ''

Asked if he ever knew Clark to be violent , Perry replied , `` Not at all . I 've known him to be outgoing , happy , athletic , fun . Violent , not at all . ''

Most of his current neighbors in Middletown , about 30 miles northeast of New Haven , said they moved in after Clark or knew him only in passing . Many said he shared the second-floor apartment with his girlfriend and a dog .

Police said he drove a Ford Mustang , which was seized as evidence .

Neighbor Ashley Rowe described Clark as `` decent '' and said he asked a lot of questions when he spoke to people and wanted to know their full names and where they were from .

Rowe also remembered the first time she met his dog .

`` His dog was very excited and he was just like , ` Oh , do n't worry . He 's friendly . ' You could pet him , '' she said . `` Pretty much , he just loved his dog and he walked around with his dog all the time . ''

Police arrived at his apartment Tuesday night to collect DNA samples and released him into the custody of his lawyer early Wednesday . Neighbors say they did n't see him return to the apartment . See investigation 's timeline ''

Clark was arrested early Thursday at a Super 8 motel in nearby Cromwell .

There were reports that Clark was scheduled to wed his roommate and girlfriend , Jennifer Hromadka , also a lab technician in Yale 's Animal Resources Center , in December 2011 . CNN could not confirm the report , and an Internet wedding page purportedly announcing the impending nuptials had been taken down Thursday .

Hromadka 's MySpace page was private as of Tuesday evening , but several media outlets reported she had posted messages about Clark last year after hearing a `` rumor of a fling . ''

`` My boyfriend , Ray , if you do n't know him , has no interest in any of the other girls at -LSB- the Yale Animal Resources Center -RSB- as anything more than friends , '' she reportedly wrote .

She said Clark had a `` big heart '' and tried to see the best in people , even if he did n't always make the best decisions .

`` He is a bit naive , does n't always use the best judgment , definitely is not the best judge of character , but he is a good guy , '' she reportedly wrote . `` He thinks everyone deserves a second chance and has a hard time hurting people 's feelings , and it takes him getting burned to learn .

Perry , Clark 's friend since first grade , said he had n't spoken to Clark in some time , but would send him a letter .

`` I have always wanted to catch up with him , but I did n't want this to happen for me to try to find out how he was doing , '' he said .

Clark is being held on $ 3 million bond , Lewis said , but he would not provide details of what prompted Clark 's arrest or whether DNA linked Clark to Le 's murder .

He said Clark 's arrest warrant was sealed , so he was prohibited from discussing the evidence .

Yale President Richard Levin said the school 's administration is `` relieved '' by the news of an arrest , but warned , `` We must resist the temptation to rush to judgment . ''

CNN 's Eliott C. McLaughlin , Mary Snow , Tom Foreman and Larry King contributed to this report .
