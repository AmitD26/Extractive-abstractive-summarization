-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We 're just going to put it out there : Behind closed doors , whites talk differently about blacks .

At least that 's what two sociologists found after conducting a study of college students across the country .

One of the researchers , Joe Feagin , said that 's why it comes as no surprise to him that a powerful politician such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would talk about Barack Obama 's skin color and use the term `` Negro dialect '' in what he considered a private conversation .

Speaking not of Reid but of his conclusions drawn from his research , Feagin said , `` Most whites have sharply reduced the blatantly racist stuff they do in public , while they still do huge amounts in private . ''

`` It 's just social correctness in the front stage . The scale of this is gigantic on the backstage , which is why the notion of a post-racial America is laughable , '' said Feagin , a professor at Texas A&M University .

`` And I think most whites know it because they 've been to Thanksgiving dinner with Uncle Jim and have heard the n-word jokes . ''

Feagin and Leslie Picca of the University of Dayton compiled their research in a book called `` Two-Faced Racism '' published in 2007 . They surveyed 626 white students at 28 colleges and universities across the country . They asked the students to keep diaries and record any racial events they came across during the course of a day .

The students recorded 9,000 accounts , of which 7,500 were `` blatantly racist '' events ranging from private jokes and conversations to violent incidents , Feagin said . About 100 accounts stood up against racism , he said .

The majority of racial events were directed at African-Americans , but Latinos and Asians also came under attack . Feagin and Picca also surveyed African-American students , but that research is still being compiled .

`` In these 7,500 blatant accounts , most of them are accounts of what we call backstage racism -- that is they 're doing these performances and skits with friends and relatives , '' Feagin said .

Does it surprise him that someone with such political clout as Reid would use a term such as `` Negro dialect '' ?

`` No , '' Feagin said , `` not after looking at our student diaries . ''

He said Reid `` felt safe making '' the comment about Obama because he was in a private setting .

`` It 's a great teaching moment , '' Feagin said . `` It shows the difference between the front stage and the backstage . He thought he was saying that in the backstage , and now it 's been brought out in the public for all to see and discuss . ''

The controversy is centered on remarks published in the book `` Game Change '' by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann . The book cites Reid as saying privately in 2008 that Obama could succeed as a black candidate partly because of his `` light-skinned '' appearance and speaking patterns `` with no Negro dialect , unless he wanted to have one . ''

Reid , D-Nevada , apologized to the president after excerpts from the book were released , and Obama said he considered the issue closed .

Your take : iReporters sound off on the issue

`` This is a good man who 's always been on the right side of history , '' Obama said Monday in a sit-down interview with CNN political contributor Roland Martin . `` For him to have used some inartful language in trying to praise me , and for people to try to make hay out of that , makes absolutely no sense . ''

Reid has received the support of the Congressional Black Caucus . On Monday , he said numerous prominent African-American officials , including NAACP Chairman Julian Bond and Attorney General Eric Holder , called to offer their support .

Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , head of the GOP 's Senate campaign arm , has called for Reid to give up his leadership post after the `` embarrassing and racially insensitive '' remarks . Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele also called for Reid to step down .

Duke University political science professor Kerry Haynie said he does n't dispute that attitudes toward race may be viewed differently in private than in public . But he said he does n't feel that came into play with Reid 's remarks .

`` Many of us who work in areas of race and politics asked these same kinds of questions , about whether Obama is different for whites than other black politicians , '' Haynie said . `` I do n't think Sen. Reid was expressing sentiments he would not have expressed publicly . ''

Boyce Watkins , an associate professor at Syracuse University , said the country should n't let this moment pass .

`` The takeaway is that there is a teachable moment , but we ca n't allow politicians to do all the teaching , '' Watkins told CNN 's `` American Morning . '' `` If you watched President Obama 's interview with Roland Martin , the conversation tends to be let 's sweep this under the rug and throw the baby out with the bath water and move on .

`` But the truth is that they are trying to get health care passed , and that 's good , I respect that , but I want to have the conversation on race . ''

Added Dawn Turner Trice , a columnist and blogger with the Chicago Tribune : `` For me , it 's that we have to continue to talk about this . We ca n't only talk about it when we have these national flare-ups . This takes time and nuanced conversations . ...

`` The country is changing . In a couple decades , we will have a country with a very different racial makeup . And we will have to have these conversations , and it 's to our peril if we do n't . ''

Feagin , the sociologist , said he agrees . He said Democrats and Obama should come forward to talk openly about the national climate on race .

`` We ca n't keep ducking this racism stuff , '' he said .
