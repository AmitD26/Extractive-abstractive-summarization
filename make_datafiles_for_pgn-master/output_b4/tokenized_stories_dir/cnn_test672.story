ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Abdul Qadeer Khan , the Pakistani scientist who admitted leaking nuclear secrets to North Korea , Iran and Libya and then recanted his confession , has been released from house arrest after it was declared illegal by the Islamabad High Court , his attorney told CNN Friday .

Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan meets the media outside his residence Friday .

`` What the court declared is that he is a free citizen which means effectively ... the basic human rights are available to him like any other citizen , '' said attorney Syed Ali Zafar .

The Pakistani government was slow to acknowledge the high court 's ruling . A spokesman said the Interior Ministry has n't received the official court ruling , but will comply with whatever decision was made .

Government attorneys said they expected an official announcement to be made by Saturday .

But evidence of the end of Khan 's house arrest seemed clear outside his home in an upscale part of Islamabad . Where a government security detail previously stood guard with machine guns , cars were parked and reporters roamed the area scratching for details .

Khan made a brief appearance , saying he was outside because of the court 's ruling , but gave few other details .

In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she is `` very much concerned '' about Khan 's release .

Separately , acting deputy State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said : `` This man remains a serious proliferation risk. , '' he said . `` The proliferation support that Khan and his associates provided to Iran and North Korea has had a harmful impact ... on international security and will for years to come . ''

Khan is widely regarded as a hero in Pakistan for his part in helping the country to develop nuclear weapons .

In 2004 , Khan was placed under house arrest following his admission on Pakistan television that he had been involved in a clandestine international network selling nuclear weapons technology from Pakistan to a host of nations including Iran and North Korea .

Pakistan has so far refused to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency and the U.S. access to Khan to quiz him on the extent of the nuclear secrets he sold .

`` Even if they had asked me I would n't have answered , '' he said last year .

In May 2008 , Khan denied his involvement with the spread of nuclear arms outside Pakistan . He explained in an interview with ABC News that the Pakistani government and then-President Pervez Musharraf forced him to be a `` scapegoat '' for the `` national interest . ''

He also denies ever traveling to Iran or Libya and said that North Korea 's nuclear program was well advanced before his visit .
