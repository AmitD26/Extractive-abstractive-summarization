Port-au-Prince , Haiti -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- So many doctors are answering Haiti 's call for medical aid that the largest hospital in Port-au-Prince has a new problem : organizing and finding good use for them all .

`` I think there is a lot of confusion , '' said Marivittoria Rava , a longtime volunteer with the charity Friends of the Orphans , which runs a children 's hospital caring for some post-operative patients from the general hospital .

Rava said that medical supplies and resources have improved , but the crush of volunteer doctors in Port-au-Prince can complicate treatment in the city while there is great need for help in other places hit by the earthquake .

The general hospital has nine operating rooms , but a near platoon of volunteer surgeons . That leaves many standing by for work , though there are relatively few nurses .

CNN 's Dr. Sanjay Gupta learned medical teams are taking their first steps to organize and see how many of them are needed . Representatives from each volunteer doctor group at the general hospital gathered for a quick , to-the-point meeting over the weekend .

`` We are all well-staffed , '' Dr. Paul Auerbach of Stanford University told the group . `` The issue is coordinating . ''

Auerbach is the point person to try and control the surge of doctors . Over the weekend , he and volunteer groups started tackling some basics of treatment : how to ID patients , keep records and make rounds .

Among the problems with the large number of doctors , Auerbach said , is that patients can have their dressings opened three or four times in close succession as one and then another crew of doctors come to evaluate their wounds .

To change that , charity groups have set up shifts and literally drawn lines , sketching maps on hospital walls showing who is working where . They are also identifying medical centers outside Port-au-Prince , where there is need for the booming supply of doctors in the capital .

Space is also an issue . A team from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is carefully assessing the buildings that survived on hospital grounds , trying to find a stable place for post-operative care . Patients now recover in tents or are taken to other hospitals .

As the city 's main hospital is brimming with doctors , it is in need of nurses and physical therapists .

Thousands of amputees will need significant , specialized help from physical therapists , but few are available .

Nurses are in short supply . A nursing school on the grounds of the general hospital was crushed in the earthquake , killing some of the people who would be giving care now . The flood of outside volunteers is mostly doctors , not nurses .

At one point over the weekend , a mass of 12 medical workers gathered around a tiny premature infant . Someone called out , `` If you 're not a doctor , step away ! '' Immediately someone else responded , `` We 're all doctors ! ''

Even as they juggle an abundance of doctors , many volunteers said they worry the general hospital in Port-au-Prince could again face dire need after this first wave of medical staff rotates out of Haiti over the next two weeks .

Those on the ground advise doctors who want to help Haiti to wait and volunteer in a few weeks or months .
