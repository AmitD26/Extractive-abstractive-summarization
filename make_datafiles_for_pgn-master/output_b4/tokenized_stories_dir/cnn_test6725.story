Smolensk , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When I found the first piece of fuselage , I was shocked . It was flimsy , the thin metal easily twisted back on itself .

Gray on one side , some yellow on the other , it sat in a small puddle of mud a few feet from the road . I was half a mile from the runway , the tall silver birch trees nearby broken like so many matchsticks .

Somehow I thought planes were supposed to be stronger than this , but what I was confronted with was an object lesson on the precarious nature of flying . The evidence of what had happened was clear . The plane struck the trees , at first just grazing their uppermost branches and then their slender boughs and trunks . It was enough to rip the plane apart .

What feels almost invincible as it powers through takeoff and thrusts upward through the skies at hundreds of miles an hour had been reduced to shreds of metal , little more than a discarded tin can .

These are the thoughts that flashed through my mind in those first moments of discovery .

And that 's when the horror of it sinks in . The last tragic moments for all aboard ; it 's impossible to imagine the awfulness of those final seconds . I am swept by another emotion , sadness for the families , and I feel captured by an undefined grief . I knew no one aboard , but to see how their lives ended is to know a tiny fraction of the pain their loved ones must bear .

But I have come to work , to tell the story of what happened , to piece together the small bits of information we 'll get , to make some sense of our corner of this huge tragedy . So that is what my team and I do .

Tommy Evans , my producer , and Luis Grahame-Yool , our cameraman , get to work and set up the first live shot . It 's cold in Smolensk -- there are still piles of snow here and there . None of us have had much sleep . Luis arrived 12 hours ahead of us , Tommy and I flew in from Macedonia . All of us took the 400-kilometer drive from Moscow to get here . Each of us intent on our job , each of us grappling with the enormity of the day .

No day is ever normal at CNN , but this defies even that logic . A president , his wife , many of the country 's top military , political and religious leaders killed in a country that 's not their own . The implications could be huge .

As the day wore on and more details emerged , it seemed clear Russia wanted to make it known it was not at fault . Evidence pointed toward the pilots rather than a mechanical error .

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who is leading Russia 's investigation , was on course to lay blame at Poland 's door . He has a reputation as a tough autocrat , and it seemed to me that 's what we are seeing here .

But we got to see another face of Putin , too : The stony-faced solemn friend of Poland . There seemed little doubting his grief and seriousness as he stood at the foot of the Polish president 's casket during the long sombre repatriation ceremony we witnessed that afternoon .

Having stood among the wreckage and broken trees as he has , it is not hard to imagine that this iron man of Russian politics was moved by what he saw . For who among us , however familiar with tragedy , could fail to be touched by the scale and nature of Poland 's loss .
