MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal prosecutors on Wednesday filed murder charges against two men suspected in the deaths of a charter boat crew , authorities said .

The Joe Cool charter boat was found abandoned last month in the Florida Straits .

Kirby Archer , 34 , and Guillermo Zarabozo , 19 , are scheduled to appear in court Thursday afternoon .

The men are being held without bail on suspicion of killing the four-member crew of the Joe Cool fishing boat last month .

`` Four individuals were killed in this case , '' Alex Acosta , U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida , told reporters Wednesday in announcing the charges . `` Four families have been torn apart . '' Watch what led to the charges ''

Archer and Zarabozo paid $ 4,000 in cash for a one-way trip to the Bahamas on the pleasure boat .

The U.S. Coast Guard found the abandoned vessel about 160 miles south of the island of Bimini on September 23 . It was unmanned , and its contents were in disarray . Zarabozo and Archer were found a few hours later on a life raft 10 miles from the boat .

Missing are the boat 's captain , Jake Branam ; his wife , Kelly ; and crew members Scott Gamble and Samuel Kairy .

Zarabozo reportedly told a Coast Guard agent that three armed Cuban men hijacked the boat as it headed toward Bimini .

Zarabozo , a licensed security guard , said the hijackers shot the crew members and forced him to throw their bodies overboard .

But , according to court documents filed in the case , Zarabozo and Archer gave inconsistent stories during interviews with authorities regarding what occurred .

Statements given by the pair were not consistent with physical evidence , according to an affidavit supporting the murder charges .

Zarabozo , for instance , told federal authorities he did not own a gun , but an investigation showed he had bought a lock box for a gun he kept at his home . That lock box contained various documents , including a receipt for a February 2007 purchase of a Glock 9 mm magazine and four boxes of bullets .

`` Little of the defendants ' story rings true , '' Acosta said .

At a bond hearing last week , the Coast Guard agent said two bullet casings and suspected blood were discovered inside the Joe Cool 's cabin . A third bullet casing was found outside the cabin , he said . All three casings were 9 mm .

A fourth 9 mm casing was found on the boat later by family members , who turned it over to the FBI , a relative said .

`` Now you have four casings and four people -LSB- presumed -RSB- dead , '' said Jeffrey Branam , the uncle of the boat 's captain .

Archer is charged with unlawful flight on an Arkansas warrant , accused of stealing more than $ 90,000 in cash from a Wal-Mart where he once worked .

Last week , a judge said he believes circumstantial evidence shows four homicides took place .

`` Your theory is -LSB- Archer and Zarabozo -RSB- killed the four ? '' the judge asked the assistant U.S. attorney at the bond hearing . `` Yes , your honor , '' the prosecutor replied .

The Coast Guard spent five days searching for the crew before giving up .

Acosta said it is unlikely their bodies will ever be found . Jake Branam and his wife leave behind two small children , he said .

`` It 's difficult , '' Jeffrey Branam said last week . `` Some relatives still think the four are alive and are still searching for them . ''

He said the name of the boat has been removed from the stern , and the name will be retired from the charter fishing business . The boat probably will be retired , too .

Referring to Archer and Zarabozo , Branam said : `` I 'd like to use them as shark bait . '' E-mail to a friend
