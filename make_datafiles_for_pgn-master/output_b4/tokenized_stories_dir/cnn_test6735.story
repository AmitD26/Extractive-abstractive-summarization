MOSCOW , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- They headed to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow after news broke that Michael Jackson had died . And they 're still coming .

Alexandra Belayeva , left , and Zhenya Iordanskaya visit the Michael Jackson memorial in Moscow .

Young Russian fans , some of whom do n't even speak English , bring homemade signs , pictures and drawings of Jackson , Russian religious icons , candles , teddy bears -- all signs of how much they loved the singer .

`` At first I could n't believe it had happened , '' 23-year-old Zhenya Iordanskaya said . `` I thought it was another rumor . My friend told me about it , and then I saw it on TV , on every channel . I was really in shock . And I still ca n't believe it . ''

Iordanskaya was standing in the rain Sunday with her friend Alexandra Belayeva , 20 , looking at the shrine Jackson 's fans have erected along the fence in front of the Embassy .

Iordanskaya says she was 8 when she first heard `` Black or White . ''

`` I did n't understand English , but the faces of all the different people really inspired me . And the fact that he dealt with all these issues , you really have to give him credit for that , '' Iordanskaya said .

Belayeva says she became a fan about three years ago .

`` The way he lived his creative live really inspired me , '' she said . `` I really got into him as a person . Because you can really see the soul of a person in their creativity , ca n't you ? It was such a shame that people put him down so much . ''

Belayeva says she 's still in shock over Jackson 's death at his California home on June 25 . `` When I heard he had died , I really could n't believe it . He was so close to us . Not one of us , but so close . He was unbelievably kind .

`` It 's so sad to lose a person like him . It 's also so sad that he was so alone at the end of his life . People did n't understand him . But at least they recognized his genius during his life . Sometimes that does n't happen . ''

Iordanskaya and Belayeva love to dance , and when they saw `` Dangerous , '' they knew they had to try it out . `` We studied his moves in that for days ! We practiced . We really loved it ! ''

I ask the women to name their favorite Jackson songs . They roll their eyes . Where do you start ? Iordanskaya starts with `` Liberian Girl . '' `` Also ` Earth Song . ' ''

`` It 's really powerful , '' she said , `` the energy and the lyrics ! ''

On a rainy , cold day in Moscow , Iordanskaya and Belayeva say they still cry thinking that Jackson is no longer on Earth .

In the garden of flowers and mementos that sprouted almost overnight in front of the U.S. Embassy , next to eight flickering votive candles that make you feel as if you are in a Russian church , one fan has written a poem : `` You 're an angel flying into the distance , you 're an angel , a carefree angel , flying into the distance .
