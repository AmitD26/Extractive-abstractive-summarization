STONE MOUNTAIN , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rosa Foster sat down at the kitchen table with a plate of fried chicken and a salad . Before taking a bite of food , she bowed her head and prompted her grandchildren to say the blessing .

Rosa Foster is a single parent raising four grandchildren under age 19 .

Foster , 54 , of Stone Mountain , Georgia , does n't just see the kids on weekends and holidays . They live with her full time .

Foster is one of 2.5 million grandparents around the United States who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren .

In Foster 's case , she 's a single parent , raising four grandkids under age 19 . `` It has not been a picnic all the time , '' Foster said . `` It 's been hard . ''

Hard may be an understatement , according to Nadine Kaslow , chief psychologist for Grady Health System in Atlanta , Georgia .

`` There are many challenges for grandparents taking on grandchildren , '' Kaslow said . `` Many grandparents are older when they take on grandchildren , so you may not have the energy you had as a parent in your 20s and 30s to be running around after toddlers . ''

Foster did n't have a choice . She said she was awarded custody of her daughter 's 2-year old son , Rakim , in 1991 .

That was 17 years ago . She 's since taken in his twin sisters , Rosea and Ronea , now 17 , and 12-year-old Raquel .

`` Some days I became a little sad and depressed and I would cry through baby feedings , but I still knew I had to keep the babies together . They did n't have anybody else , '' Foster recalled .

The unexpected demands of caring for grandchildren full time may have health consequences , Kaslow said .

`` You often see people having aches and pains or headaches or stomach aches , '' she said . `` It can be associated with more serious physical problems like elevated blood pressure or things that put you at risk for heart disease or stroke . '' Health Minute : More on grandparent stress ''

Foster remembered sleeping only one or two hours a night while she worked two jobs trying to pay the bills .

Kaslow said it is common for grandparents to feel the stress of financial demands when they 're a parent the second time around .

`` Oftentimes you 're at a place in your life where you 're ready to take care of yourself , have more fun , plan for your own retirement , '' Kaslow noted . `` Monies you were trying to save for your own future , you are now having to spend on your grandchildren . ''

She suggested that grandparents set priorities when it comes to their own career and work . While resources may be limited , she recommended trying to find financial help from state agencies , religious groups or other relatives .

For those who may feel overwhelmed , she added , `` You do n't need to be the sole caregiver . It 's really important for you to reach out to other people in your support network , your immediate family , to get their assistance . ''

She also stressed the need for grandparents to take good care of themselves . Find time to exercise and eat a healthy diet .

`` I recommend if you can , get someone to baby-sit the kids once a week or every other week , '' she said . `` You really need time alone . ''

Does Foster ever get time for herself ?

She chuckled , explaining that she has put her own life on hold for 17 years . But , she added , `` I would n't have it any other way . ''

Foster has some serious advice for other grandparents who may be in a similar position : `` Make sure you 're up for the challenge , because if you 're not , you 're going to break some kids ' hearts . If those kids are torn up a second time , they 're really going to be destroyed . ''
