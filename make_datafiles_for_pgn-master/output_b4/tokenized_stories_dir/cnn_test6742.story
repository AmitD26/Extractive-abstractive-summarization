-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fueled by hot , dry conditions , a wildfire near Flagstaff in northern Arizona grew to 10,000 acres , city officials said late Monday .

The blaze spread so quickly , it caught some locals off guard . Flagstaff city spokeswoman Kimberly Ott said the source of the fire was an abandoned campfire .

The Schultz Fire ignited late Sunday morning , shutting down part of U.S. Route 89 and causing the Coconino County Sheriff 's Office to evacuate at least 748 properties , including two residential neighborhoods , an animal shelter and the Sunset Crater and Wupatki National Monuments . The sheriff 's office is recommending that nearby residents put together evacuation kits .

`` It 's something that unless you 've lived through it , I do n't think you can imagine , '' evacuee Patti Vorhees told CNN affiliate KTVK as she packed up her pets and left . `` You literally take your prescriptions , your animals and the clothes on your back . ''

The Red Cross has set up a shelter at Mount Elden Middle School in Flagstaff .

The Coconino County website says the U.S. Forest Service and several fire departments responded with about 300 firefighters , eight air tankers and five helicopters to put out the blaze . A Type One Incident Management Team also was sent to the scene . The U.S. Fire Administration website says that 's a self-contained team of 35 to 50 highly trained personnel deployed to manage incidents of `` national significance . ''

High winds in the area Sunday did n't help . The winds both stoked the flames and caused emergency crews to ground the air tankers for 5Â 1/2 hours Sunday afternoon . CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said gusty southwesterly winds , from 20 to 30 mph , will blow through the area through Tuesday , then calm by Wednesday morning . There 's a slight chance of showers and thunderstorms in the area beginning on Thursday , Morris said .

Government fire spokesman Eric Neitzel told CNN affiliate KPHO that higher humidity and lower temperatures overnight allowed firefighters to `` make some good progress on the line '' and protect structures .

KTVK 's website , www.azfamily.com , says authorities shut down part of Highway 89 Sunday because of visibility issues , as the Schultz Fire was producing a huge plume of smoke that could be seen for miles . But by Monday morning , Neitzel told KPHO the cooperative overnight weather , including calmer winds , were making the smoke '' -LSB- lay -RSB- down ... so you do n't see the big tower of smoke . ''

The Schultz Fire was the second large wildfire to break out in the Flagstaff area this weekend . The Hardy Fire started early Saturday afternoon . But the Hardy Fire is much smaller , at 300 acres , and firefighters have been able to contain 30 percent of it .

The Flagstaff Fire Department initially had ordered evacuations of two neighborhoods and the Cococino Humane Society because of the Hardy Fire , but those evacuation orders have been rescinded , said the Coconino County website .
