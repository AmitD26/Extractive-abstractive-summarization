Okaloosa Island , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If you could have painted the day , it would have been a Monet . A white sandy beach , blue sky and a green ocean that you may have only seen in dreams .

Florida 's Emerald Coast , on a Sunday .

The only thing out of place were the BP contractors in green shirts and yellow rubber boots , with shovels , rakes and of course , the oil .

`` I think it 's fantastic that they have a community of people out here trying to clean up , '' said Matt Minardi of Athens , Georgia .

`` If I see anything out there that concerns us , we may rethink that , but so far it looks good , '' he told CNN .

Matt Minardi and his family came from Athens for the beach , not the tar balls . They 're getting a lot of the beach , and fortunately , only a few tar balls .

Just feet from their umbrella , beach cleanup workers were busy scooping up the pea-sized oil fragments that seem to come in and out with the tide on a semi-regular basis , all along Florida 's Panhandle from Pensacola in the west to Panama City in the east .

`` We 're going to keep an eye on the weather . Where the oil is , where it came in from , '' said Okaloosa County Commissioner John Jannazo .

`` And we 're cleaning up . We had some oil ... and we picked it up , just like that , '' he said .

Most of the oil is in very small amounts of weathered oil . It 's small and scattered . Florida has not seen or felt the pain that comes with the arrival of thick , black crude on the shoreline .

Is there oil on the beach near you ?

`` It definitely takes a little away from it , but we 're here and we 're going to try and enjoy ourselves , '' said Mike Werkmeister of St. Louis .

`` We did n't feel like trying to arrange something else , and we also felt like we should come down and support this community , too , cause they definitely are feeling the effects of this , '' he said .

Those effects are hitting the Panhandle right smack in the wallet . Tourism is down about 30 to 40 percent , according to state tourism officials . More and more cancellations are coming in each day , throughout the state , where 80 million visitors brought in $ 60 billion dollars in 2009 .

`` If you say oil or tar ball to a tourist , they mentally see Louisiana , '' said Carol Dover of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association , referring to the thick molasses-like oil that has soaked Louisiana 's wetlands .

That 's why local officials are quick to get the cleanup crews to those limited places where the weathered crude has come ashore .

`` It 's an ongoing fight . We 're anticipating continuing to find and fight oil in places it rises to the surface , for the foreseeable future , '' said Lt. Matthew Anderson of the U.S. Coast Guard .

`` Our operations are deployed to support this on a wartime footing , '' he told CNN .

But on Crab Island , the only thing on people 's minds was enjoying a day on the water , while they still can .

Boaters flock to this sandbar in the Destin Pass , to hang out and listen to the floating band . And , while they were n't overly distracted by oil , the thought of BP CEO Tony Hayward on his yacht this past weekend raised the blood pressure of some and was a bit of a head scratcher for others .

Tony Hayward goes yachting

`` He 's probably in some really clean water . No oil . So , he 's not trying to stop the oil leak , '' said one man .

Johnny Springfield has lived here for 20 years . He says his boating business is down 60 to 70 percent , but his anger is a little on the high side .

`` You kind of have to look at that two ways , '' he explained . `` One . He was relaxing and he was out on his boat , and we hate that . But on the good side of things , he was n't down here runnin ' his mouth . ''
