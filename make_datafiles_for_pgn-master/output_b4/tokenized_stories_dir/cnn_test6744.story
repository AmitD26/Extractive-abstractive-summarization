-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seattle 's character and history are closely linked to its waterside location , so it makes sense to start your sightseeing at the Waterfront .

Experience the Experience Music Project/Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame .

Pioneers first settled in Elliott Bay in the 1850s and these days the Waterfront area is buzzing with restaurants , bars and tourists . Kids will love the Seattle Aquarium -LRB- Pier 59 , 1483 Alaskan Way -RRB- , while adults will want to head straight to Pike Place Market -LRB- Pike Street -RRB- .

More than just an outstanding farmers market , Pike Place is in many ways the beating heart of Seattle . Browse the farm-fresh produce and traditional crafts , and banter with the infamous salmon-tossing fishmongers , whose tourist-pleasing antics mix market trading with street theatre .

After stocking up on snacks and souvenirs , venture further into the historic Pioneer Square neighborhood and check out the totem poles in Occidental Park . There 's another totem pole in Pioneer Square Park , carved by the Tlingit natives in 1938 , as well as a bust of Chief Sealth of the Duwamish tribe , after whom Seattle is named .

Nearby , the Seattle Central Library -LRB- 1000 Fourth Avenue -RRB- is an astonishing glass and steel construction by Rem Koolhaas . Only slightly less imposing is the pink granite structure that is Seattle Art Museum -LRB- 1300 First Avenue -RRB- and the 48-foot `` Hammering Man '' that guards its entrance .

The museum is known for its collections of Native American and African art , while Asian art is showcased at the Seattle Museum of Asian Art -LRB- 1400 East Prospect Street , Volunteer Park -RRB- in Capitol Hill . The Olympic Sculpture Park -LRB- 2901 Western Avenue -RRB- is a nine-acre waterfront offshoot of the Seattle Art Museum , with free admission .

The city 's skyline is dominated by the incongruous , spindly Space Needle , part of the Seattle Center , built for the 1962 World 's Fair . To get there , take the monorail , another World 's Fair remnant , from the Westlake Center -LRB- Pine Street at 4th Avenue -RRB- . Ride a glass elevator to the 160-meter-high observation deck for an incredible view of the city and its surroundings .

While you 're at the Seattle Center , take a look at the Experience Music Project / Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame . The colorfully bizarre building by Frank Gehry looks like a three-dimensional cubist collage of smashed electric guitars , and is Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen 's eccentric gift to the city .

Originally a museum dedicated to Seattle native Jimi Hendrix , the Experience Music Project now has all kinds of rock memorabilia and loads of interactive exhibitions . Tickets include admission to the Science Fiction Museum , which has enough sci-fi movie props to satisfy the most obsessive trekkie .

Finally , make time to stroll around the Capitol Hill and Fremont neighborhoods for a taste of the non-conformist `` alternative Seattle '' that brought the world Grunge and made plaid shirts fashionable .
