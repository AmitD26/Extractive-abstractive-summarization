Berlin , Germany -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The German Cabinet met Wednesday to discuss ways of tackling child abuse in the Catholic church and other institutions as a new allegation surfaced against a suspended priest .

Government ministers discussed the makeup of a round table on child abuse and prevention , set to meet April 23 .

The government also named a special representative for child abuse matters . Christine Bergmann is a former minister for family affairs and her post should now be a go-to point for victims of child abuse , the government said .

The new allegation is against the Reverend Peter Hullermann , who was convicted of abusing minors in 1986 . Hullermann 's case made headlines in Germany last week when it emerged the archdiocese ignored warnings to keep him away from children when it was headed by Pope Benedict XVI , who was then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger .

A news release from the Archdiocese of Munich identified him only as `` suspended Reverend H '' and says the abuse allegedly happened in 1998 in the town of Garching , near Munich , but Hullermann was the only one serving there at the time who has now been suspended .

The statute of limitations on the case has not expired , the archdiocese said . The alleged victim was under age at the time , it said .

After his conviction in 1986 , Hullermann was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a fine of 4,000 deutschmarks -LRB- about $ 2,000 at the time -RRB- . But he was then allowed to resume his priestly work and he continued to work with children , even though a psychoanalyst who had examined him demanded that Hullermann never be allowed to interact with minors again .

The psychoanalyst , Werner Huth , had regularly done psychoanalytical evaluations for the church and had Hullermann in therapy from 1980 to 1992 . Huth told CNN last week he does not believe Pope Benedict was ever aware that Hullermann had returned to service , but Huth said he warned other church officials about the priest 's pedophilia many times .

Garching Mayor Wolfgang Reichenwallner told CNN the archdiocese never informed him that Hullermann had a history of pedophilia .

The archdiocese said the case has been sent to the state prosecutor 's office and that no further information will be given .

Hullermann was suspended earlier this month as information about his past started coming to light .
