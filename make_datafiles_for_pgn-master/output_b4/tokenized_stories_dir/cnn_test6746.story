Osh , Kyrgyzstan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The flow of refugees fleeing southern Kyrgyzstan has gone from a flood to a trickle , the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry said .

Uzbekistan authorities said even though the flow of people had slowed down they were still dealing with an estimated 120,000 refugees . Aid workers were calling the fallout from ethnic clashes in Kyrgyzstan a humanitarian crisis .

No one from Kyrgyzstan 's interim government had made official contact with them since refugees flooded into their country , the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry said .

Foreign Ministry officials said they were surprised and concerned that they have not had official contact with their neighbor during this crisis .

The violence between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks had calmed down earlier this week after more than 170 people were killed and more than 1,400 were wounded .

But gunfire was heard Thursday from the center of Osh , Kyrgyzstan , a sign that the violent ethnic clashes may be intensifying again . Gunfire in the hard-hit city had been heard only at night . Thursday was the first time CNN producers on the scene have heard daytime gunfights .

The clashes , which started last week , were part of the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Soviet republic since 1990 , when hundreds of people died in skirmishes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in Osh .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Uzbekistan 's President Islam Karimov from London on Wednesday , thanking Karimov for his help with the humanitarian situation , according to a statement from Ban 's office .

The secretary-general promised assistance to affected people in southern Kyrgyzstan and those seeking refuge in Uzbekistan , and said he intended to consult with key members of the U.N. Security Council upon his return to New York later Wednesday .

One U.N. plane , loaded with tons of tents , landed in the area Wednesday and others were on the way . Several countries , including the United States , Germany and Russia , have also sent aid .

The International Committee of the Red Cross said along with refugees there was an estimated 60,000 internally displaced people in Kyrgyzstan .

Francois Blancy , deputy head of the Red Cross regional office in Uzbekistan , said more aid is needed .

`` We are now at the peak of the humanitarian crisis , '' Blancy said .
