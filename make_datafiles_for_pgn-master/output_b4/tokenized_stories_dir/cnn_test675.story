MEXICO CITY , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A killer bug is spreading like wildfire .

Armed guards stand outside the Mexico City Respiratory Hospital to control the flow of people .

Streets of one of the world 's biggest cities are eerily empty . Bars and restaurants have been shuttered for days .

The president goes on TV to tell workers to stay at home for their own safety .

Those who venture outside are clad in surgical masks . Once healthy people are suddenly falling sick and dying from a new disease , H1N1 swine flu .

The government swears the situation is under control . But down at the hospital , medics scurry around behind the glass door of an isolation ward . They 're clad from head to toe in biohazard suits , goggles and two pairs of gloves .

At the airport , officials set up a barrage of thermal imaging machines . If the picture flashes up red or orange , would-be passengers are whisked off to medical facilities . See where the virus has been confirmed ''

It may sound like a sci-fi movie . It 's not . Welcome to Mexico City .

It 's a nightmare scenario and despite twice-a-day news conferences featuring Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova , people on the streets fear the virus may be out of control and that the real death toll may be greater than anyone is letting on . Watch how the city has been shut down ''

`` The measures we 're taking are working and are helping us to slow the spread of the virus . But the situation continues to be serious , '' Cordova said at a news conference this week .

Government orders to its citizens are clear : wash frequently , do n't shake hands or kiss , and stay away from crowded places .

That 's easier said than done .

The doors on the subway car snap open at Hidalgo station . Dozens more passengers clad in surgical masks stream on .

It 's rush hour deep below the streets of downtown Mexico City .

The subway system is the veins of the capital , ferrying millions of people from all social classes to and from work . It 's hot and humid down there and there 's little fresh air . It 's just the kind of crowded place that Mexican authorities say could be a prime breeding ground for swine flu .

`` I 'm pretty nervous of this whole virus thing , '' welder Frontino Valdez mumbled through one of the masks . Watch passengers packed onto trains trying to protect themselves ''

Sitting one carriage down , Berta Hernandez , a product demonstrator , tries not to show her panic and applies eyeliner like any other morning . But today she has a problem , she has no intention of lifting her mask to paint on lip gloss .

`` I 'm nervous of those people who are n't wearing masks . Maybe they will suddenly sneeze or cough , '' she said . In these days of swine flu paranoia , just coughing , or worse sneezing , in the subway , or `` metro '' as they call it here , brings black looks from fellow passengers .

This has been a strange epidemic since the outset . So far , the Mexican government has been unable to pinpoint where or when this outbreak started .

Authorities admit there was an outbreak of influenza in a village in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz in early April . But only one patient -- 5-year-old Edgar Hernandez -- was diagnosed as having swine flu . Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta ask the boy about his symptoms ''

The international media have taken to calling him `` Patient Zero . '' He made a full recovery .

So far there 's no evidence a pig farm near his home reported any problems with its livestock . The family has n't explained how little Edgar could have infected a capital city let alone the world .

The authorities have n't drawn up a genetic map of Edgar 's illness nor compared it to the lethal strain that swept through Mexico City and other parts of the country .

Lethal it is . But getting to the truth of who has really died from the virus is tough .

Since midweek , the government abandoned its initial reporting and began to speak only of confirmed swine flu cases and confirmed deaths due to the H1N1 virus . Previously it had also tallied suspected cases and others under observation .

In practice , it is taking days for the government to get test results from autopsies and tests . By the time a case is confirmed the patient may be long buried .

One afternoon this week , at a cinder block home perched on a hillside in a poor northern neighborhood of Mexico City , a coffin was mounted on the living room table . A steady stream of neighbors filed in to pay their final tribute to a dead 24-year-old .

Biting back tears , a young man said his brother had died of `` respiratory problems . '' When asked what kind of a person his brother was , he said simply : `` He was an honest man . He never got in any trouble . ''

The man seemed to be feeling an underlying sense of shame . Suddenly there was a huge stigma attached to swine flu -- like in the early days of AIDS-related deaths -- and Mexican families were keen to dispel notions their loved ones had died of the mutant virus .

They did n't want the prying eyes of the media near their home . We wanted to tell their story , observe the wake and follow the funeral .

But death is a rite of passage . They had a right to mourn in private .

The following day came a tip-off that a 5-year-old girl , Maria Fernanda Garcia , had died . The modest side street outside her home in eastern Mexico City was swarming with police , health workers and civil protection officials . Watch how armed guards were part of Maria Fernanda 's funeral ''

Little Maria Fernanda 's father appeared briefly and told us we were n't welcome . He was curt when he told us his daughter had died from pneumonia .

A medic confirmed the specific cause of death was indeed pneumonia . But he added the hospital was still waiting for test results to confirm whether the underlying cause was swine flu . He conceded that process could take days .

But judging by the heavy security , local authorities certainly feared this was another case of the virus .

`` These are the prevention measures we must take . This case is still not confirmed but we must take these steps to protect citizens , '' said Victor Luna , a member of the public security detail for this district of Mexico City .

A few minutes later , the hearse with Maria Fernanda 's body pulled out of the housing complex where she lived . Her dad was clutching a Winnie Pooh cuddly toy as he rode up front .

Police and health officials shadowed the funeral cortege to the graveyard . Police guards only permitted immediate family and close friends through the iron gates .

Through the bars silent , tearful mourners could be seen weaving through a labyrinth of headstones .

Later that afternoon , the family had left Maria Fernanda 's grave -- a tiny patch of newly dug dry earth , not much more than 3 feet long .

It was covered with sweet-scented white flowers . The plaque on the grave was a simple hand-painted affair :

`` Maria Fernanda . 2004 to 2009 . We love you . ''
