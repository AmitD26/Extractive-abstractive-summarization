-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police say a Camden , New Jersey , man had the audacity to return to the jail where he posted a $ 400 bond with counterfeit bills , demanding a refund .

Ronald T. White was charged with shoplifting July 7 , but his bail was incorrectly written up . When he found out , authorities say , he returned to the Cinnaminson , New Jersey , jail the following week to demand his money back .

White appeared in Burlington County Superior Court on Thursday , and this time his bail was set far higher .

According to Cinnaminson Police Chief Steven Fowler , the department issued a warrant for White 's arrest after his counterfeit bail posting of $ 400 , but because he was a Camden resident , it was out of jurisdiction .

Though Camden police were alerted to the claims , they were n't exactly banging down his door .

`` Even though it was a $ 5,000 warrant for his arrest , they have bigger issues over in Camden , being the murder capital of the world , '' Fowler said .

White had posted bail using at least two bills bearing identical serial numbers , police say , and the serial numbers also matched those on one of the bills found on him when he returned to the Cinnaminson jail to reclaim his extra $ 200 .

Upon further inspection , Fowler said , the counterfeit bills White used to post bail were of poor paper quality , although the printing appeared very accurate . The duplicate serial numbers were the giveaway , he said . `` He was surprised that he was discovered , '' Fowler said .

Burlington County prosecutor 's office representative Joel Bewley said that because White did not produce the counterfeit bills but merely attempted to purchase goods with them , the official charge was theft by unlawful taking .

On Thursday , at White 's first appearance in Superior Court , his bail was set at $ 7,500 , because of outstanding charges from Camden County added on to the Burlington County charges .

White 's case will be presented before a grand jury within six weeks . In the meantime , until he can post bail with legitimate bills , he will be held at Burlington County Jail .
