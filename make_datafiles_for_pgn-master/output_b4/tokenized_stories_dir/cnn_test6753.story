PLACERVILLE , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A California couple charged with a combined 29 felony counts in connection with the kidnapping and rape of Jaycee Dugard appeared in court for a bond hearing Monday .

Phillip and Nancy Garrido appear in court in Placerville , California , on Monday .

Phillip and Nancy Garrido , wearing red jail coveralls , were flanked by their attorneys . They appeared to glance at each other only briefly . Phillip Garrido wore a bandage on the side of his nose .

The Garridos are accused of kidnapping Dugard in 1991 , when she was 11 , and keeping her in a well-hidden compound behind their home in Antioch , California , for 18 years . Phillip Garrido fathered two children with Dugard during her captivity , authorities have said .

The couple had been held without bail , but Phillip Garrido 's defense attorney requested that bail be set for him Monday . El Dorado County Superior Court Judge Douglas Phimister set his bond at $ 30 million . Watch the Garridos at the hearing ''

However , El Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson told reporters after the hearing that Garrido , a registered sex offender , is also on a `` parole hold , '' which carries no bond . A parole hold is placed on people on parole or under supervision when they are taken back into custody .

Nancy Garrido 's attorney told Phimister that she was not contesting her no-bond status , although she might ask that bond be set in the future .

Both defense attorneys told the judge they wanted to make clear that their clients are invoking the right to counsel and do not want to be questioned . Phimister noted that `` other agencies '' are interested in interviewing the couple .

Phillip Garrido will undergo a psychiatric evaluation , a common step for defendants . Nancy Garrido 's attorney said he was attempting to schedule one for her as well .

The two defendants spoke only once , answering `` Yes , '' when asked by the judge if they were willing to waive their right to a preliminary hearing within 60 days .

Both Garridos previously pleaded not guilty to the charges . They face a combined 29 felony counts ; 26 counts name only one of them -- 13 for each -- and both are named in three .

Phillip Garrido was convicted of kidnapping and raping a woman in 1976 , and was released from prison after serving 10 years of a 50-year sentence . He was required to register as a sex offender and placed on lifetime parole .

Pierson acknowledged Monday that `` very legitimate questions '' have been raised about Garrido 's release and supervision . `` Those are issues which I 'm confident will be addressed in a proper venue at a proper time , '' he said .

But Pierson praised Garrido 's current parole officer for helping to bring about his capture , breaking through his `` elaborate , well-planned cover story that was 18 years in the making . '' The parole officer summoned Garrido to his office after being tipped off by University of California-Berkeley police , who considered Garrido suspicious and questioned why he was on campus with two young girls . Those girls later were shown to be his daughters by Dugard .

As for Dugard and her family , Pierson released no details but said he echoed earlier comments , made by family spokeswoman Tina Dugard , that all family members are doing well under the circumstances . Professionals have been brought in to assist the family , he said .

Pierson pleaded with reporters to exercise `` basic human decency '' and leave Dugard 's family in peace . `` What this family has been through ... they have a lot to deal with right now , '' he said .

Asked about a possible statute of limitations on the Garridos ' alleged crimes , Pierson said it was complicated , but prosecutors have examined the issue and `` we 're confident we 're not going to have a problem in this case . ''

He said he did not know whether a grand jury would be convened in the case , and did not rule out additional charges against the Garridos . He would not speculate on when the two might stand trial , saying , `` in a perfect world , the criminal justice system would move much more quickly than it does . ''

Both the Garridos , if convicted , would face `` multiple life terms , '' he said .

After the couple was arrested in August , investigators used cadaver dogs to search their ramshackle home and the surrounding rural property for a possible connection to unsolved crimes .

A bone fragment that is `` probably human '' was found near the Garridos ' home , a sheriff 's spokesman said September 8 . The bone was found early in September on a neighbor 's property in an area to which Phillip Garrido had access .

The fragment , which was analyzed by an outside expert , will go on to the state DNA lab for testing , according to an e-mail from Jimmy Lee , director of public affairs for the Contra Costa County Sheriff 's Office .

`` The expert has determined that the bone fragment found in the backyard of Garrido 's neighbor is probably human , '' Lee said .

`` We will be requesting the state to see if it can develop a DNA profile on the fragment . It should be noted that it is not uncommon to find Native American remains in Contra Costa County , '' he said .

Police in Hayward , California , are trying to determine whether Garrido is linked to the 1988 kidnapping of Michaela Garecht , Hayward Police Lt. Chris Orrey said earlier this month .

Garecht and Dugard were of similar age and appearance , both were abducted in daylight , and a sketch of a suspect resembled Garrido , Orrey said .

In Dublin , California , investigators said earlier this month they were looking into whether Garrido was connected to the 1989 disappearance of Ilene Misheloff , who was 13 when she was abducted .

Garrido was convicted of kidnapping and raping Katie Callaway Hall in 1976 . He was released from prison after serving 10 years of a 50-year sentence . He was labeled a sex offender and put on lifetime parole .
