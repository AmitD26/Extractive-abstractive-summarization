-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Six-time champion Roger Federer has failed to make the title match at Wimbledon for the first time since 2002 after being dumped out in the quarterfinals on Wednesday .

Federer 's title defense came crashing to a halt in the face of an inspired performance from Tomas Berdych in London .

The Swiss star was knocked out at the last-eight stage of a tennis grand slam event for second successive time following his similar exit at the French Open a month ago .

Czech 12th seed Berdych triumphed 6-4 3-6 6-1 6-4 in front of a stunned crowd on Centre Court to set up a semifinal clash with No. 3 Novak Djokovic .

Federer , the top seed ahead of world No. 1 Rafael Nadal -- who reached the semis by beating sixth seed Robin Soderling -- later revealed that he had been hampered by injuries .

`` I am struggling with a little bit of a back and a leg issue . That just does n't quite allow me to play the way I would like to play . So it 's frustrating , to say the least , '' the 28-year-old star told reporters , as quoted by AFP .

`` The leg injury came in the finals of Halle . That never really went away , and the back 's been feeling really badly stiff for the last five or six days . When you 're hurting , it 's just a combination of many things . You just do n't feel as comfortable .

`` Under the circumstances , I think I played a decent match . But I 've been feeling bad for the last two , three matches now . It 's just not good and healthy to play under these kind of conditions . So if there 's anything good about this , it 's that I 'm going to get some rest , that 's for sure . ''

Federer was sluggish throughout the match , and though Berdych wobbled in the final games , he held his nerve to record the biggest victory of his career to date .

Berdych broke Federer 's serve in the seventh game of the opening set to take it 6-4 , but the world number two looked to have regained control as he powered to a 6-3 triumph in the second .

Wimbledon 's humble beginnings

But Federer 's game fell apart in the third set as Berdych took it 6-1 in just 27 minutes .

Another vital break in the fourth set took Berdych to the brink of victory , and he took his second match point to seal an impressive win .

It was only Federer 's sixth defeat on Centre Court , but the former champion was still afforded a huge ovation as he waved to the crowd upon leaving the arena .

Berdych reached his second grand slam semifinal , having also reached the last four in Paris earlier this month before losing to eventual runner-up Soderling .

`` It 's amazing to play in this stadium against such a great player and to leave as the winner is an amazing feeling , '' he told the BBC .

`` So far it was the toughest game in my career to serve to close out the match . ''

Earlier , Djokovic brushed aside the challenge of Yen-Hsun Lu to clinch a place in the last four .

The Serbian had little trouble dispatching Lu , from Taiwan , 6-3 6-2 6-2 in just one hour and 51 minutes on Court No. 1 .

Djokovic 's unseeded opponent , who beat American Andy Roddick in the previous round , did n't force a single break point in the entire match .

Djokovic told the BBC : `` Nothing is easy these days especially at this stage of the tournament but the way I played I deserved to win . I hit all the shots , played the rallies and was solid from all parts of the court and I am very happy .

`` I sincerely hope I can continue with this level of my game but you never know how you are going to wake up in two days but the way I am playing match after match is very encouraging .

`` You have nothing to lose in the semifinals and definitely this time I am physically fitter than in my last one three years ago . ''

Nadal , who beat Federer in the final in 2008 but missed out on last year 's event due to knee problems , was again too strong for Soderling as he followed up his Roland Garros triumph with another win over the Swede .

The Spaniard came from behind to win 3-6 6-3 7-6 -LRB- 7-4 -RRB- 6-1 .

He will now face Andy Murray after the British fourth seed beat French No. 10 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-7 7-6 6-2 6-2 .

Murray dropped the opening set on a tie-break but took the second by the same method .

After that , Tsonga capitulated and Murray wrapped up the third and fourth sets with the minimum of fuss .

Speaking of his clash with Nadal Murray told the BBC : `` It will be a great match , it 's always fun . I think we 've played four times in Grand Slams and won two each . I 'm looking forward to it . ''
