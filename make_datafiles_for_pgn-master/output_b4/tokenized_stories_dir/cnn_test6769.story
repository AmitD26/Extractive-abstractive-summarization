-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The group of wealthy businessmen planning to buy English Premier League champions Manchester United has ruled out making a bid until the end of the season .

The `` Red Knights '' consortium signaled their intention to buy out the American Glazer family on March 2 and have been recruiting new investors and working on a proposal .

In a press statement , however , they announced that they would not be making an offer until at least June to avoid providing a distraction from the club 's pursuit of the Premier League and Champions League trophies

`` In the next few weeks we will continue to work on our proposal , '' the statement said . `` We do not expect this to be finalized before the end of the current football season .

`` This will have the advantage of minimizing external distractions as the team enters the decisive period of the season . ''

The battle for Manchester United explained

Earlier this month , the Red Knights hired Japanese investment bank Nomura to help formulate their $ 1 billion move for the club .

The group has been working closely with Manchester United Supporters ' Trust -LRB- MUST -RRB- to help generate backing from the club 's international network of fans .

`` We have been speaking to and meeting many potential Red Knights who have contracted us since our interest was made public , '' the statement added .

`` These potential Red Knights have offered ideas and support and with the help of this input , our plans have been developed further . ''

The Glazers have been criticized for the levels of debt at the current English champions , with the latest accounts showing that United are more than $ 1 billion in the red . The owners recently launched a bond issue to raise $ 750 million to reduce the debt . They also own NFL side Tampa Bay Buccaneers .

United fans have shown their support for the bid with protests against the Glazer family at recent matches .

The green and gold scarves that have become a symbol of their disquiet now dominate the stands at Old Trafford , while banners declaring `` Love United Hate Glazer '' are commonplace .

Former United midfielder David Beckham gave the bid a lift when he donned one of the scarves as he left the field after AC Milan 's March 10 Champions League defeat at Old Trafford .
