-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Comedian and TV host Stephen Colbert has warned NASA to name a new wing of the international space station after him or he would `` seize power as space 's evil tyrant overlord . ''

Stephen Colbert threatened NASA that he might become `` space 's evil tyrant overlord . ''

A NASA spokesman said the U.S. space agency is aware of Colbert 's threat , issued Monday night on Comedy Central 's `` Colbert Report , '' but no decision will be made on the node 's name until next week .

Colbert topped NASA 's online poll soliciting names for the wing , with 230,539 of the more than 1.1 million votes cast , according to NASA spokesman John Yembrick .

The runner-up was Serenity , which Colbert said is not an appropriate name .

`` That 's not a space station , '' Colbert said . `` That 's an adult diaper . ''

Serenity was the name of a spaceship in the television series `` Firefly , '' which spawned a 2005 movie .

The contest rules spelled out that NASA reserves the right to `` ultimately select a name in accordance with the best interests of the agency . ... Such name may not necessarily be one which is on the list of voted-on candidate names . ''

NASA 's hedging prompted a Pennsylvania congressman to urge the agency to name the node after the comedian .

`` The people have spoken , and Stephen Colbert won it fair and square , even if his campaign was a bit over the top , '' Rep. Chaka Fattah said .

Fattah sits on the congressional committee that oversees NASA 's funding .

`` NASA , I urge you to heed Congressman Fattah 's call for democracy in orbit , '' Colbert said . `` Either name that node after me , or I , too , will reject democracy and seize power as space 's evil tyrant overlord . ''

NASA 's Yembrick said he watched Colbert 's show Monday , but he would not directly respond to his `` evil tyrant overlord '' threat .

`` We think it 's great that he and his audience are taking an interest , '' Yembrick said .

Several media outlets have reported that NASA is working on a compromise in which it would slap the droll Colbert 's name on a piece of `` mission essential '' equipment in the new wing : the toilet .

Colbert 's loyal fans , lovingly called the Colbert Nation , have in the past bombarded polls to have things named after their idol .

Thanks to them , the comedian out-polled every other name in a bridge-naming contest in Hungary . The country 's government later said it can not name the bridge after him because he does not speak Hungarian and is not deceased .

Colbert also tried to get himself on Democratic and Republican primary ballots in his home state of South Carolina in 2007 . The Democratic Party 's executive council voted against his inclusion , and he did not qualify for the Republican primary because he missed the deadline .

But ice-cream maker Ben and Jerry named a flavor in honor of him , Colbert 's AmeriCone Dream . And Virgin America named one of its planes Air Colbert .
