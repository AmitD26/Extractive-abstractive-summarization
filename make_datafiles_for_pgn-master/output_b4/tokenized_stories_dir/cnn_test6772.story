-LRB- InStyle.com -RRB- -- When `` The Mary Tyler Moore Show '' premiered on September 19 , 1970 , it was almost revolutionary : the first television series focused on an independent -LRB- read : unmarried -RRB- career girl . And Mary 's wardrobe was a little bit revolutionary too -- working women across the country were quick to copy her colorful dresses and wide-legged pantsuits . To celebrate the iconic program 's fortieth anniversary , InStyle takes a look back at five fashionable TV shows -- and characters -- that have influenced women 's at-work style .

`` The Mary Tyler Moore Show ''

Mary Richards lived in wintry Minneapolis and therefore had no shortage of cute cold-weather staples , including double-breasted coats , knee-high boots , and that famous blue tam . But it was her 70s work-wear that most women sought : colorful scarves , two-piece suits , and bright , office-appropriate dresses .

`` Dynasty ''

Okay , so the Carrington women were n't exactly your typical 9-to-5ers . Nevertheless , the big-shouldered , wasp-waisted creations worn by oil mogul Alexis -LRB- Joan Collins -RRB- and her longtime rival Krystle -LRB- Linda Evans -RRB- were popular enough with fans that the show spawned a signature fashion line , `` The Dynasty Collection '' which was designed by the show 's costumer , Nolan Miller .

`` Ally McBeal ''

In 1998 , shortly after the show 's first season finale , Ally McBeal 's disembodied head appeared on the cover of Time magazine along with the question , `` Is Feminism Dead ? '' Despite the conclusions reached by that article -LRB- is it really fair to compare a fictional character to activists and thinkers like Susan B. Anthony and Gloria Steinem ? -RRB- , women do owe something to the flighty young lawyer played by Calista Flockhart : She almost singlehandedly made the workplace safe for bare legs , freeing us from the tyranny of mandatory pantyhose .

`` Sex and the City ''

The amount of money that Carrie -LRB- Sarah Jessica Parker -RRB- , a freelance writer , spent on shoes was so improbable that it eventually became a plot point ; her clothes only got more prohibitively expensive as the show went on . Still , `` Sex and the City `` had an enormous impact on regular women 's style : Aside from all of those quickly knocked off -LRB- and forgotten -RRB- nameplate necklaces and oversized faux corsages , the ladies ' willingness to play with fashion inspired legions .

`` Mad Men ''

It 's set in the early 1960s , but the best ensembles on `` Mad Men '' for example , almost anything worn by Joan -LRB- Christina Hendricks -RRB- would look chic , virtually unaltered , in today 's offices . In fact , the show has heavily influenced fashion in the four years it 's been on the air . This fall 's runways were dominated by richly colored dresses , circle skirts and camel coats , straight from the `` Mad Men '' era .
