-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The International Cricket Council has pointed to a lack of `` compelling evidence '' to support match-fixing claims relating to a one-day match between England and Pakistan in September .

British newspaper The Sun claimed it had proof that bookmakers knew details of scoring patterns in Pakistan 's innings before the match at The Oval in London began .

That allegation prompted the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board , Ijaz Butt , to claim there was talk in bookmakers circles that England 's players had been paid `` enormous amounts of money '' to lose the match .

Butt later withdrew his comments after the England team threatened to take legal action against him .

Now the ICC 's anti-corruption and security unit -LRB- ACSU -RRB- has dropped its investigation into the match , saying there is n't strong enough evidence .

A statement on the ICC 's official website read : `` The ACSU has verified all the available information and concluded that there was no compelling evidence to suspect individual players or support staff .

`` The investigation is now complete but if new and corroborating evidence comes to light then clearly the ACSU will re-open the matter . ''

The ICC said they would not comment on the case featuring three Pakistan players -- Salman Butt , Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif -- who are currently suspended after claims of spot-fixing during the Test series with England , but they did maintain their determination to clean up the game .

ICC President Sharad Pawar said : `` We have stressed that we will not tolerate any form of corruption in cricket and that we will work tirelessly to root out those who have acted in a way which brings cricket into disrepute .

`` The future of our great sport depends on the public maintaining their confidence in the games they are watching . We owe it to every player , administrator , every cricket lover to win this battle against a very small minority who may wish to corrupt this game . ''

The ICC also said its Pakistan Task Team will work with the PCB to `` carry out any reforms which may be deemed necessary to restore confidence in the administration of the game in Pakistan . ''

The ICC also confirmed their intention to pave the way for a world Test championship starting in 2013 . It would mean a playoff between the top four ranked Test teams every four years .

`` We have agreed in principle to exciting and far-reaching proposals to tackle this most important issue , '' said ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat .

`` The proposals , especially introducing more meaningful context , means we now have the potential to follow international cricket that is even more exciting . ''
