-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tashard Choice recently had a great opportunity to pick up a nice present for his 3-year-old nephew . The Dallas Cowboys running back went up to Michael Vick after a game and asked for his autograph .

Well , that kind of blew up in his face . Here he was , just trying to do a nice thing for a child , and people get all crazy upset , just because Vick plays on the other team . In a sign of the times , Choice even felt it necessary to apologize on Twitter .

Here 's hoping that if you go out to get a sports memorabilia gift this holiday season you deal with a lot less criticism . But you might feel some heat . After all , there are some cool items , but they can be pricey , especially if someone like Vick signs his name to them .

We 'll help you sort through the many sites that sell sports items and point you toward a few things we might even include on our wish list .

It 's understandable why Choice 's nephew wanted Vick 's signature . He 's one of the hottest athletes in the country right now , likely leading Philadelphia to the NFL playoffs .

If you hunt around the internet , you can find several sites selling a jersey , even one selling one he wore during his college career .

The most popular jersey would be the one he wears now , No. 7 for the Philadelphia Eagles . Or you could go for the autographed Eagles ' jersey . That one is $ 592 at Fans Edge . Or you could save a little coin and get one from the Falcons -LRB- the team he played for until he went to prison for his role in a deadly dogfighting operation -RRB- for the sale price of $ 125 .

Want a less controversial quarterback ? Tom Brady 's New England top is $ 760 in blue and $ 1,049 in white .

If the person you are buying for digs historical baseball moments , he or she might like a ball autographed by pitcher Armando Galarraga and the umpire who cost him his perfect game , Jim Joyce . The grace each showed after Joyce 's blown call is an example of sportsmanship most fans will talk about for years . One ball , $ 573 . It 's a souvenir commemorating a moment that had n't happened before and probably wo n't again .

While neither of those men seem likely candidates for the Hall of Fame , Andre Dawson is one of the all-time greats and is part of the 2011 class that will be enshrined in Cooperstown . He was widely admired by all baseball fans during his 21-year career .

You can get an autographed Cubs replica jersey at Tristar Productions for $ 259 . -LRB- You 'll have to pay extra to get it in a frame . -RRB-

One of the most exciting moments of the sports year -- at least for U.S. soccer fans and even bandwagon fans -- came at the World Cup , when in its final group game the United States needed a goal to move into the prestigious round of 16 . All-time leading scorer Landon Donovan pounced in the last minute , sending bars and offices across the country into scenes of pandemonium .

SportsMemorablia.com has a few autographed photos of Donovan and his teammates celebrating what is one of the signature moments in U.S. men 's soccer history for $ 263 .

Hockey fans will long remember the exciting Olympics men 's final , won by Canada when Sidney Crosby scored in overtime . NHL Auctions has some Team Canada jerseys , including one signed by Ryan Getzlaf -LRB- $ 229 -RRB- . If you want one , bid soon , as that auction ends Monday .

NASCAR fans are fiercely loyal . But if you are giving to someone and you do n't know who his or her favorite driver is , you probably ca n't go wrong with a Jimmie Johnson die cast . Johnson won his fifth consecutive championship this season and die casts are cool small-scale replicas of the cars used in races .

If you go to Johnson 's Team Lowe 's site , there are many cars to choose from , including cars from previous years and cars with the various color schemes used throughout the year .

Want something that might make a cool addition to the home office or the man cave ? Consider seats from stadiums that met their demise . For instance a pair of seats from old Yankee Stadium will cost you $ 1,500 at Steiner Sports . Steiner also has seats -LRB- or parts -RRB- from the Meadowlands and Wrigley Field .

But let 's go big . Say you have a blank check , and the fan who has almost everything . Well , Babe Ruth collectibles are some of the most sought after sports items on the planet .

Sports Memorabilia offers five bats from the Sultan of Swat at $ 125,253 -LRB- and 50 cents -RRB- . They were used in games at the time he was being sold from the Red Sox to the Yankees and making the transition from pitcher to right field .

If that price is too steep , the company offers a store model bat for just $ 964 . Still too much ? They also have a Babe Ruth card by Topps from 2009 for $ 17 .

While we 're at it , everyone loves a good sports movie . Look how much bank the film `` The Blind Side '' took in at the box office .

So , while it may not qualify specifically as `` sports '' memorabilia , you could also buy a prop or costume from the hit film .

Premiere Props in El Segundo , California , offers more than 100 items from the film , including a green Crusaders jersey worn by Quinton Aaron for $ 799.99 . His stunt double 's uniform is just $ 599 .

Other items range from $ 14.99 to $ 1,599 .
