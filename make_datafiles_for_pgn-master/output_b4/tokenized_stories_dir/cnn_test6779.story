-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Portugal earned a satisfying 4-0 win over world-champion neighbors Spain on Wednesday night , while France continued to improve under Laurent Blanc with a 2-1 victory away to England in another friendly .

Spain won the last clash between the two teams in July on the way to winning the World Cup in South Africa , ending Portugal 's 19-match unbeaten run .

But Helder Postiga struck twice after Carlos Martins broke the deadlock before substitute Hugo Almeida settled the match for Portugal , who have put in a joint bid with Spain to host the 2018 World Cup and are celebrating the 100th year of the Portuguese Republic .

Midfielder Martins volleyed the opening goal right on halftime after Cristiano Ronaldo 's shot was only blocked by Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas .

Postiga doubled the lead four minutes after the interval with a clever backheel from Joao Moutinho 's low right-wing cross , and the Sporting Lisbon striker fired in the third with 22 minutes to play when Spain 's defense could not clear .

Almeida then beat the offside trap to collect Pepe 's throughball and beat the onrushing Casillas in the fourth minute of time added on to score his 12th international goal .

It was only Portugal 's second win in nine meetings with Spain , who have not won in Lisbon since 1934 .

France inflicted England 's first defeat at London 's Wembley stadium since Fabio Capello took charge in December 2007 , taking the lead through Karim Benzema and Mathieu Valbuena before substitute Peter Crouch 's late consolation .

Benzema fired the opening goal in the 16th minute with a low shot past goalkeeper Ben Foster at the near post following a smart interchange of passes with Florent Malouda .

Capello 's experimental young England team went 2-0 down in the 55th minute when fullback Bacary Sagna found space down the right and midfielder Valbuena volleyed in a low shot after teammate Sami Nasri completely missed his attempt .

Striker Crouch , who came on for the injured Steven Gerrard , guided in a clever volley at the far post from Ashley Young 's 85th-minute corner for his 23rd goal in 43 England appearances , but it was not enough to prevent his team being booed off .

France , who also beat England in Capello 's second match in charge , have now won four successive matches under coach Blanc -- who suffered two defeats after taking over from Raymond Domenech following Les Bleus ' first-round World Cup exit .

Italy were held 1-1 by Romania in Austria as Ciprian Marica scored at both ends .

The striker put Romania ahead in the 34th minute after the Italian defense failed to clear , but headed past his own goalkeeper with seven minutes to play after Italy substitute Fabio Quagliarella touched on a corner by halftime replacement Andrea Pirlo .

Germany drew 0-0 away to Sweden in Gothenburg in a match of few chances as both teams ' coaches experimented with their line-ups .

Norway won 2-1 away to the Republic of Ireland , World Cup dark horses Slovakia lost 3-2 at home to Bosnia-Herzegovina , while Serbia won 1-0 in Bulgaria with an 80th-minute goal from striker Nikolai Zigic -- who was later sent off .

Russia , who also hope to host the 2018 World Cup , lost 2-0 at home to Belgium as highly-rated young striker Romelu Lukaku scored both goals in Voronezh .

The Netherlands , bidding jointly for 2018 with Belgium , beat Turkey 1-0 in Amsterdam as striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored the winner in the 52nd minute with his ninth goal in the last five internationals .
