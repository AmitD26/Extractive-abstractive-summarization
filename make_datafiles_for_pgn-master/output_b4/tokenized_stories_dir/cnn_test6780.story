New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani was acquitted Wednesday of all but one count of conspiracy-related charges in a landmark civilian trial involving the first Guantanamo detainee to be tried in civilian court .

Ghailani was convicted by a federal jury on a charge of conspiracy to destroy buildings and U.S. property in connection with his role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania .

The trial had been widely considered a testing ground for the Obama administration , which has said that it could try some terrorism suspects outside military tribunals and in civilian courts .

Ghailani 's lawyer , Peter Quijano , said Wednesday 's verdict was `` a reaffirmation that this nation 's judicial system is the greatest ever devised . ''

`` It is a truly a system of laws and not men , '' he said .

The U.S. Justice Department responded in a written statement , referring to the one guilty finding by saying , `` We respect the jury 's verdict and are pleased that Ahmed Ghailani now faces a minimum of 20 years in prison and a potential life sentence for his role in the embassy bombings . ''

U.S. Attorney Prett Bharara in a statement that he would seek the maximum sentence of life without parole at sentencing , which is scheduled for January .

Ghailani faced charges of conspiracy and murder in the 1998 attacks on U.S. embassies in Nairobi , Kenya , and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania . The bombings , for which al Qaeda claimed responsibility , killed 224 people , including a dozen Americans , and wounded thousands of others .

Federal Judge Lewis Kaplan had rejected a defense plea for a mistrial on Monday after a juror claimed to have been chastised by fellow jurors for disagreeing with their conclusions .

Kaplan read aloud a note that he received from the juror , who asked to be `` excused or exchanged '' in the trial of the 36-year-old Tanzanian , telling his defense attorneys that it was not grounds for a mistrial .

Ghailani 's attorneys had maintained that he was exploited by al Qaeda for his knowledge of Tanzania , but was not a conspiring member of the group that later claimed responsibility for the attacks .

Wednesday 's verdict raises broader questions regarding those being held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba and their prospects of facing civilian courts .

`` The greater relevance has been the debate in this country of whether -LSB- alleged -RSB- terrorists held in Guantanamo can effectively be tried in a federal district court even though there may be problems with government witnesses , '' said Scott Silliman , executive director for the Center on Law , Ethics and National Security .

Kaplan previously had ruled that prosecutors could n't call a key witness in the trial because Ghailani was coerced into disclosing the witness ' identity .

Reaction to the verdict was quick in coming .

Liz Cheney , daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a co-founder of the group Keep America Safe , joined in a statement from the group lashing out at the Obama administration for having `` rolled the dice in a time of war '' with a civilian trial .

The statement called on Obama to `` end this reckless experiment . Reverse course . Use the military commissions at Guantanamo that Congress has authorized . ''

Meanwhile , human rights advocates lauded Wednesday 's verdict as evidence of a fair trial , which they said signals `` the -LSB- Obama -RSB- administration should move forward with other detainees they wanted to try , '' according to Dixon Osburn , spokesman for Human Rights First -- a New York-based advocacy group .

`` Those that said -LSB- the trial of Guantanamo detainees in civilian courts -RSB- would be a circus were proven wrong , '' he said .

By contrast , Rep. Peter King , R-New York , said he was `` disgusted at the total miscarriage of justice today in Manhattan 's federal civilian court . ''

King , who is the House 's incoming Homeland Security Committee chairman , blamed Attorney General Eric Holder for the trial 's outcome .

`` He assured us that ` failure is not an option , ' '' King said in a written statement .

The prosecution , which made its closing arguments November 8 , had accused Ghailani in a total of 285 counts of conspiracy and terrorism-related charges .

Ghailani was captured in Pakistan in 2004 and moved to Guantanamo two years later . He was transferred last year to a federal prison in New York .
