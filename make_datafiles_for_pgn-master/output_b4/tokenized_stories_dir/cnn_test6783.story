-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice for Real Madrid as they won 3-1 in Marseille on Tuesday to top Group C of Champions League qualifying .

Real 's victory meant AC Milan went through in second place in the group despite held 1-1 at FC Zurich , owing their draw to a second half penalty from Ronaldinho .

Former World Player of the Year Ronaldo scored in the fifth and 80th minutes in a comfortable win for the Spanish giants and showed he is back to his very best after an injury layoff .

The Portuguese star opened his account with a blistering 30 meter free kick , but Marseille midfielder Lucho Gonzalez leveled from close range six minutes later .

Real 's Raul Albiol put them ahead on the hour mark before Lucho hit the crossbar from the penalty spot soon afterwards .

Ronaldo added his second in the 80th after a mistake by home goalkeeper Steve Mandanda left him with a conversion into an open goal .

Swiss side Zurich tested Milan and after dominating the first half went ahead in the 29th minute through a Milan Gajic free kick from outside the area .

Zurich had shocked Milan 1-0 in the San Siro in October , but were reduced to 10 men in the 64th minute when Marco Borriello was hacked down by defender Alain Rochat , who was sent off .

Brazilian ace Ronaldo converted the spot kick to grab a precious point for his side against the group 's bottom side .

Chelsea had already clinched top spot in Group D but put on a lackluster display to be held 2-2 at Stamford Bridge by APOEL Nicosia .

Marcin Zewlakow 's early opener for APOEL gave the Cyprus side a shock lead before Michael Essien and Didier Drogba put Chelsea ahead before half-time .

But Chelsea , who had gone into the game off the back of two defeats , were made to pay for a defensive error by John Obi Mikel as Nenad Mirosavljevic scored a late equalizer .

The other qualifiers Porto rounded off their campaign with a 3-0 win over third-placed Atletico Madrid .

Bruno Alves headed Porto into the lead after two minutes with Falcao scoring the second on 14 minutes .
