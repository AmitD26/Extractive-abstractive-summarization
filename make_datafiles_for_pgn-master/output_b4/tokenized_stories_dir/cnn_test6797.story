Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the wake of the Arab Spring protests across the Middle East and North Africa , President Barack Obama will pledge U.S. economic assistance to Egypt and Tunisia on Thursday in a speech highlighting his administration 's revised policies toward the changing region .

The highly anticipated address at the State Department will touch on all the Middle East-North Africa flash points -- the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , Libya , Syria , Iran and the recent killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden -- with a focus on Obama 's plan for how the United States can help the region develop through political and economic reforms , according to administration officials .

Obama `` will be laying out a vision tomorrow for the region of what it can be long-term and its role in the world , and as part of that , we 'll be announcing a series of initiatives to support that long-term vision , '' a senior administration official said Wednesday . He was one of three senior administration officials who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified by name .

The speech comes nearly two years after a 2009 address in Cairo , the Egyptian capital , by Obama that called for `` a new beginning '' between the United States and the Muslim world .

Now many in the Middle East and North Africa consider the Cairo speech a collection of lofty ideals that lacked sufficient follow-through , and they want Obama to signal substantive and concrete policies that support the aspirations of the region 's people .

Marwan Muasher , a former Jordanian foreign minister and longtime advocate of Arab reform , said the Middle East is a new environment now , where young men and women are laying their lives on the line for democracy throughout the region . They need to be told their cause is just and how the United States will support them .

`` If this is going to be another Cairo speech , forget it , '' said Muasher , now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . `` It was great two years ago , and even then the feedback was mixed because people wanted to see what he would do . If he does n't have much to add this time , people will not be fooled by it . ''

Obama 's do-over on the Middle East

Gigi Ibrahim , a 24-year-old Egyptian activist and blogger , said that Obama 's words will have little impact in her country .

`` At this point , whatever President Obama will address will really be irrelevant to what the situation is now because we 're really building democracy from the bottom up , '' Ibrahim said , adding that `` America is not the model of democracy that we are striving for . ''

She called U.S. policy on the Middle East `` hypocritical '' because , she said , the United States `` will support a dictatorship if it 's aligned with its interests . ''

That attitude is rife throughout the Middle East and North Africa , noted CNN senior political analyst David Gergen .

With Egypt facing economic crisis , the Libyan conflict at a stalemate , an ongoing harsh crackdown on demonstrators in Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process at a standstill , there is little belief in the region that Obama or the United States can do much to help , Gergen said .

`` I think it 's going to be very difficult in the near term to generate excitement about his policies in the Middle East , '' Gergen said .

What 's next for the Arab Spring

In an effort to start changing such perceptions , the Obama administration on Wednesday imposed tough sanctions against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and six other senior Syrian officials in an effort to stop the regime 's fierce crackdown on anti-government protests .

The sanctions also target two top Iranian officials whose unit was a `` conduit for Iranian material support '' to Syrian intelligence , according to a copy of the executive order issued by the White House .

According to the senior administration officials , Thursday 's speech will focus on the opportunity for the United States to help people in the Middle East-North Africa region gain a say in their future governance through the changes they have launched .

Obama will emphasize U.S. principles such as freedom of assembly , the right to self-determination and respect for human rights while promoting economic development as a significant contributor to helping people of the region realize their aspirations , the officials said .

`` It 's important to note that some of the protests in the region are deeply rooted in a lack of individual opportunity and economic growth , as well as a suppression of political rights , '' one of the senior administration officials said . `` We also know from our study of the past that successful transitions to democracy depend in part on strong foundations for prosperity , and that reinforcing economic growth is an important way of reinforcing a democratic transition . ''

That means that `` one of the most important areas for us to focus on is supporting positive economic growth that again can incentivize and reinforce those countries that are transitioning to democracy , '' the official continued . `` We see this as a critical window of time for the United States to take some concrete action to demonstrate our commitment to their future and to again reinforce their democratic transition with support for a broader base of prosperity , '' the official added .

In particular , the senior administration officials focused on economic aid for Tunisia and Egypt intended to bolster the democratization and economic development efforts of two countries at the vanguard of political reform .

Will there be aid for Arab Spring nations ?

Obama will announce several programs intended to increase U.S. and international investment , create jobs and spur economic growth in the two countries , the officials said . The goal is for Tunisia and Egypt to serve as models for a region undergoing change , so that other countries have incentive to undertake similar reforms , according to the officials .

Specific programs include relieving Egypt of up to $ 1 billion in debt over the next two to three years so the money can be invested by the Egyptian government in economic development plans , and providing $ 1 billion in loan guarantees to finance infrastructure development and job creation , the senior administration officials said .

In addition , programs through international banking and funding organizations such as the World Bank , the African Development Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will be worth a few billion dollars , the officials said .

`` One of the most important things we can do is empower positive models '' in Egypt and Tunisia , one of the officials said . `` That will have a positive impact beyond their borders . ''

The United States also will work with international groups and allies to help Middle East-North African countries modernize and integrate trade policies , according to the senior administration officials . Currently , nations in the region of 400 million people export about the same amount of goods as Switzerland , a country of 8 million people , if oil is removed from the equation , said a White House background document on the speech .

Obama 's speech comes in a week when the White House has focused on Middle East issues . He met Tuesday with Jordan 's King Abdullah II at the White House and will meet Friday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .

After his talks with King Abdullah , Obama said it was `` more vital than ever that both Israelis and Palestinians find a way to get back to the table and begin negotiating a process whereby they can create ... two states that are living side by side in peace and security . ''

However , former Sen. George Mitchell unexpectedly submitted his resignation as the president 's Mideast envoy Friday , and deadly clashes broke out Sunday between pro-Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces .

Ongoing Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and Palestinian steps toward a unilateral declaration of statehood have driven the two sides further apart since Obama took office . They have also placed new obstacles in the path of the administration 's push for a mutually acceptable two-state solution .

Arab Spring not good for Israel ?

Additional doubts about the viability of the stalled peace process were raised this month in the wake of a formal reconciliation agreement between the two largest Palestinian factions : President Mahmoud Abbas ' party , the West Bank-based Fatah ; and the Islamist group Hamas , which rules Gaza .

Both Israel and the United States consider Hamas a terrorist organization and have voiced strong opposition to the inclusion of the group in any unity government , demanding that it first renounce violence , recognize the state of Israel and abide by all previous agreements .

Netanyahu has called on the Palestinian Authority to pull out of the deal , saying it jeopardizes prospects for a peace agreement .

The Obama administration has `` made it clear that Hamas must stop its outrageous use of terrorism and must recognize Israel 's right to exist , '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday . `` Any participation in a Palestinian government would require that it abides by those standards in our view . ''

In other engagement in the region , Obama helped push Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from office in February and subsequently committed U.S. forces to a NATO air campaign in support of the rebel movement in Libya . The administration has repeatedly called for an end to strongman Moammar Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule .

The White House has been much less vocal , however , in dealing with allies such as Bahrain , a small Persian Gulf state that is home to the U.S. Navy 's Fifth Fleet .
