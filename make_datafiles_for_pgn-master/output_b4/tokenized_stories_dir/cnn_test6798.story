Seoul , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Returning from a trip to Pyongyang , former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il ready for a summit with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak at any time .

Carter did not personally meet with Kim , but he said that as he and his delegation of former heads of state were on the way to Pyongyang airport to depart for South Korea , they were summoned back to their guesthouse , where a senior official read out a written message from the reclusive leader .

`` Chairman Kim sent word that he is willing to negotiate with South Korea or United States ... on any subject at any time and without any preconditions , '' Carter told a news conference . `` He specifically told us he is prepared for a summit directly with President Lee Myung-bak at any time to discuss issues between the two heads of state . ''

The dramatic declaration puts Lee on the spot : Seoul is currently declining official dialogue with North Korea until it takes responsibility for two fatal incidents last year .

In 2010 , 50 South Koreans were killed in the two separate incidents : South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010 , killing 46 sailors . In November , North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island , killing two South Korean marines and two civilians .

North Korea denies the torpedo attack on the warship Cheonan , though a Seoul-led international investigation has found a North Korean mini-submarine responsible .

Following a range of nuclear and missile tests , and Pyongyang 's exposure last November of a uranium-based nuclear program -- a separate program from its earlier plutonium-based program -- the Obama administration is sanctioning Pyongyang and has also put official contacts on hold .

Asked if he expected Pyongyang to apologize to Seoul , Carter said ; `` My own assessment is that talks should begin without preconditions on either side . My opinion is North Koreans will not admit culpability for the sinking of the Cheonan and will not apologize . ''

Carter , 86 and his group had met North Korea 's de facto head of state Kim Yong Nam , as well as its vice defense minister and foreign minister and other officials . The visit had been intended to promote North-South dialogue , revive a denuclearization process , and assess food shortages .

The delegation included former president of Finland , Martti Ahtisaari , former Prime Minister of Norway , Gro Brundtland , and former president of Ireland , Mary Robinson . They are all members of `` The Elders '' a group of retired leaders founded by former South African leader Nelson Mandela who undertake peace-building initiatives and non-state diplomacy .

Regarding Kim 's offer of dialogues , Carter said : `` The Elders ' desire is that under some circumstances , these offers will be accepted by the leaders of South Korea , the United States and other leaders of the six-party talks . ''

The six-party talks are a Beijing sponsored initiative to denuclearize the peninsula ; the parties are China , Japan , North Korea , Russia , South Korea and the United States . Following North Korean nuclear and missile tests , they have been in limbo for two years .

As for why he had not been able to meet Kim Jong Il personally , Carter responded : `` We did request a chance to meet with him , and we did request an opportunity to meet with the president of South Korea . Neither were available to meet with us . ''

With North Korea suffering major food shortages , the Elders strongly suggested South Korea and the United States resume food aid to the ultra-nationalist state .

`` We would urge you here in South Korea as we will urge the EU and the U.S. to realize there is a very severe crisis , '' said Robinson . `` The humanitarian issues must be disconnected from matters of political concern . It is a matter of life and death urgency . ''

There had been criticism of Carter in South Korea for not raising human rights issues with the North , even though he did exactly that with South Korean leaders of the authoritarian governments of the 1970s and 80s .

Asked by a South Korean reporter if he had raised this issue with the North , Carter took a swipe at South Korean and U.S. policies .

`` There are human right issues that relate to the policies of the North Korean government that I do n't think any of us on the outside can change , '' he said . `` But one of the most important human rights is to have food to eat and for South Korea and Americans , and others to deliberately to withhold food aid for North Korean people because of military or political issues unrelated is indeed a human rights violation . ''

Carter added that he believes that there are no longer any impediments to food aid monitoring . In the past , some governments and non-governmental organizations have criticized Pyongyang for not permitting them to monitor their aid deliveries , raising suspicions that shipments could be going to the military , rather than to the most vulnerable populations .

Brundtland , who is an ex-World Food Programme director , noted that one third of North Korean children are stunted due to malnutrition , and one in five is underweight .

Ahtisaari suggested that the resumption of dialogue is essential . `` I think it is extremely important that we as Elders can recommend that there is , as early as possible , a resumption of dialogue on all outstanding issues , '' he said . `` I sincerely hope that parties can agree on a time frame in which to resolve these problems instead of a process that can last forever . ''

In South Korea , where North Korean defectors have alleged the existence of concentration camps , torture and the imprisonment of family members , Carter 's message on human rights and his linkage to food aid is likely to raise hackles .

`` For the South Korean audience , we need to hear that he raised the human rights issue with North Korea as he did in South Korea during the 1970s and 80s , that would bring more credibility , '' said Won Jae-chun , a director general at Seoul 's National Human Rights Commission of Korea . `` I do n't think his message will go far in -LSB- South -RSB- Korea . ''

Carter and his delegation will be hosted at a banquet by South Korea 's foreign minister Thursday evening .

However , a representative of the Blue House , the South Korean presidency , said Wednesday that it considered Carter 's trip that of `` private individuals . ''

Carter has a history of private diplomacy on the peninsula .

In 1994 , after Pyongyang had expelled international nuclear inspectors and threatening to turn Seoul into a `` sea of fire '' and with the United States mulling air strikes on North Korean facilities , Carter flew into Pyongyang to meet Kim Il Sung . That set the scene for the so-called `` Agreed Framework '' in which North Korea would give up its nuclear facilities in return for light water reactors from the international community .

That deal foundered after Washington accused North Korea of having a secret uranium based nuclear program . North Korea denied it at the time -- only to publicly reveal a uranium-based program last year .

Last year , another Carter visit to Pyongyang resulted in the freeing of an American citizen held there . However , he had no opportunity to discuss strategic issues , because he was not met by Kim Jong Il .
