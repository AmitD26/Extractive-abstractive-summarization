-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The European Union slapped sanctions on 13 top Syrian officials , including President Bashar al-Assad 's brother , for `` violence against demonstrators , '' it announced Tuesday .

Maher al-Assad , the president 's youngest brother , is commander of the army 's 4th Division and `` principal overseer '' of the crackdown against protesters , the EU said .

The head of Syrian intelligence , Ali Mamlouk , and Interior Minister Mohammad Ibrahim al-Chaar were also sanctioned , along with 10 other intelligence , security and business officials .

Their assets in Europe are being frozen , and they 're now subject to an arms embargo and travel ban .

Syria has been cracking down forcefully for weeks on anti-government protesters inspired by the `` Arab Spring '' sweeping across the region .

Protesters have demanded the immediate release of political prisoners , lifting of emergency and martial law , and withdrawal of intelligence forces from Syrian cities .

Syrian officials describe the protesters as `` conspirators '' promoting `` sedition . ''

On Tuesday , Syrian presidential adviser Bouthaina Shaaban told The New York Times that she believed the government had gotten the upper hand . `` I hope we are witnessing the end of the story , '' she said . `` I think now we 've passed the most dangerous moment . I hope so , I think so . ''

State-run news agency SANA reported on the interview with the headline : `` Dr. Shaaban : We are witnessing the end of the story . ''

The Times said that for the story , a reporter was allowed into Syria for only a few hours .

SANA also reported Tuesday that 2,684 `` rioters '' had `` surrendered '' and been released after pledging `` not to repeat any action against the security of the citizen and the homeland . ''

Also , four `` martyrs from the army forces , who were targeted by extremist terrorist groups in Homs , '' were buried , SANA reported Tuesday .

Last month , al-Assad lifted the country 's 48-year-old state of emergency and abolished the state security court , both of which were key demands of the demonstrators . But anti-government protests have continued , with activists alleging massive human rights abuses and calling for political and economic reforms .

Security forces have relied heavily on the army and the regime 's guard to disperse demonstrations .

Syrian security forces have been using soccer stadiums as makeshift prisons in at least two cities -- Banias and Daraa , the center of the uprising -- after raiding homes and arresting hundreds of residents , the directors of two human rights organizations said Monday .

In addition , security forces burst into homes and took residents into custody in the Damascus suburb of Modemiyah , where there were reports of gunfire Monday , said Rami Abdul-Rahman , director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights .

And in the city of Homs , a doctor said tanks were dispersed and security checkpoints were set up at the entrance to each suburb , with security forces , often backed by secret police , searching anyone passing through . The security presence was so heavy that people were afraid to demonstrate , the resident said .

The witness in Homs said he knew several people killed in demonstrations Friday who could not be buried , because security forces were not allowing funerals out of fear they might turn into demonstrations .

The doctor said he has seen several public buildings , including two health centers and a school , transformed into command and control centers for the Syrian security forces and military . Dozens of people have `` disappeared , '' and their families believe they have been arbitrarily detained , the doctor said .

A U.N. humanitarian assessment team due to enter Syria was stopped , despite having previously been given permission by authorities , a U.N. spokesman said Monday . The mission was set to visit the southern city of Daraa .

U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said Monday the United Nations was trying to clarify why it was n't able to enter .

More than 400 people have been arrested in Banias since Saturday , Abdul-Rahman said , adding that authorities had converted the Mediterranean city 's soccer stadium into a prison to house them .

In Daraa , another human rights organization observed a similar situation .

`` In Daraa , there have been so many arbitrary arrests in recent days that the army and security forces are using schools and the city 's soccer stadium as makeshift prison facilities , '' said Ammar Qurabi , chairman of the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria .

The heads of both organizations are not in Syria but remain in close contact with activists and protesters there .

CNN has not been granted access into Syria and is unable to independently verify witness accounts .

Amnesty International said Friday that more than 540 people have been killed by Syrian security forces and that many activists in pro-reform protests `` have been forced into hiding after receiving threats from Syrian authorities . '' On Monday , Amnesty said at least 48 people were killed by security forces in Syria `` in the last four days , '' according to local and international human rights activists .
