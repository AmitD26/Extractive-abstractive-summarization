Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A company that Chinese authorities say is controlled by dissident artist Ai Weiwei challenged tax evasion allegations Thursday .

An attorney ; Ai 's wife , Lu Qing ; and an accountant were to represent the design firm at the hearing .

Pu Zhiqiang , a famous human rights lawyer in China , told CNN that the Beijing tax bureau declined to have an open hearing and provided no reason .

Ai said he disagreed with plans to have a closed hearing .

`` If we wish the modern society to function effectively , cases like this should be conducted openly with transparency and public witness , '' Ai said . `` Otherwise a lot of problems would emerge . ''

Pu said that if the evidence is valid , he will advise Ai 's company , which includes a studio , to pay the back taxes of 5 million RMB -LRB- US $ 770,000 -RRB- and the punishment fee of 7 million RMB -LRB- US $ 1 million -RRB- , which is in accordance with Chinese regulations .

If he does not find the evidence valid , however , Pu said that the company will appeal .

Ai , considered China 's most famous artist , was originally detained in April on grounds of tax evasion . However , his family and human rights advocates believe that the real reason for his imprisonment is his outspoken criticism of the Chinese state .

After three months in jail , Ai was released on bail in June , possibly for medical concerns .

Most famous for designing the Bird 's Nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics , Ai later called for a boycott of the games because he said China was using them as propaganda .

Ai also has accused the Chinese government of trying to silence dissidents .

Also Thursday , Ai confirmed he had received an invitation from the Berlin University of the Arts to accept a professorship there .

`` I wo n't be allowed to leave the country for at least a year so I 'll have to wait until I 'm free to have a clear plan about my future and my work , '' he said .

The president of the university , Martin Rennert , said the institution will welcome Ai whenever he can make it .

`` We will wait for him to come when he feels the time is right , '' Rennert said .
