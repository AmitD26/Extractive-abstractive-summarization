-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The end of the line for three fugitive siblings came Wednesday on a rural stretch of Colorado interstate . With guns scattered around their wrecked white Subaru , the suspects made their play .

One brother stayed in the car . Another brother stumbled off through the brush to a couple of nearby businesses , only to be picked up after a citizen spotted him , authorities told CNN .

The sister , who wrote on her Flickr profile that she liked `` causing mayhem with my siblings , '' tried to reload her automatic pistol , officials said . A police officer shot her in the leg .

In custody Wednesday evening , the `` Dougherty family '' survived a dramatic final scene that seemed foreshadowed .

`` It was going to happen somewhere , '' Pueblo County Sheriff Kirk Taylor said .

Last week , Ryan Edward Dougherty , 21 , texted , `` There 's a time for all of us to die '' after he was sentenced in Florida on a criminal charge , according to a Florida sheriff 's office .

With that , authorities said , Ryan Dougherty , sister Lee Grace Dougherty , 29 ; and half-brother Dylan Dougherty Stanley , 26 , began a crime spree that included a bank robbery in Georgia and the attempted murder of a Florida police officer .

According to Taylor , the trio spent Tuesday night in the San Isabel National Forest about 10 to 12 miles west of Colorado City . The Colorado Springs Gazette quoted a store employee as saying the three apparently purchased a tent at a recreation supply retailer in the city on Tuesday .

Their run ended Wednesday morning on Interstate 25 between Colorado City and the town of Walsenburg , authorities said .

A deputy spotted the suspect vehicle at a gas station after it left the campground , officials said . It was now bearing Texas tags , Taylor said .

Officers were preparing to apprehend the occupants when the car pulled away . A 20-mile high-speed chase ensued .

Reaching speeds of more than 100 miles per hour , the fugitives shot at officers , who did not return fire , authorities said .

Colorado state troopers deployed a tire-deflation device , and that was the beginning of the end . A MAC-11 machine pistol , a handgun and two AK-47 rifles came flying out when the vehicle flipped and landed on a guard rail , Taylor said .

All three of the Doughertys suffered injuries . They were treated and put in custody .

They were being held Wednesday evening in Pueblo County as state , federal and local officials discuss when the trio may be returned to Georgia or Florida . The Colorado State Patrol sent a Twitter message indicating each was being charged with four counts of first-degree assault on a police officer .

The suspects are wanted for a bank robbery in Valdosta , Georgia , and the attempted murder of a Florida police officer .

`` I am proud to say today we won , '' said Sheriff Chris Nocco of Pasco County , Florida , where one incident occurred earlier this month .

`` The three Doughertys were speeding , '' Nocco told reporters . `` It 's ironic they did n't learn their lesson . The Colorado State Patrol attempted to pull them over . In that attempt to pull them over , the Doughertys went back to their MO and started shooting at law enforcement . ''

On Tuesday , a U.S. magistrate issued warrants for the siblings ' arrest in connection with the August 2 bank robbery , where an AK-47-type assault rifle and a machine pistol were used .

They are also suspects in the attempted murder of a Zephyrhills , Florida , police officer that took place the same day -- but five hours earlier and 200 miles away .

The officer was n't injured , though occupants in the getaway vehicle fired numerous rounds during a chase that reached up to 100 miles per hour , according to the Pasco County , Florida , Sheriff 's Office . One round struck a tire , disabling the police vehicle , the sheriff 's office said .

Since then , the siblings had been the subject of an interstate manhunt , with their faces plastered on hundreds of digital billboards from Florida to Kentucky to Texas .

According to a timeline of events that officials provided , Ryan Dougherty was sentenced August 1 in Volusia County , Florida , to 10 years ' probation and two years of community control monitoring for convictions on two counts of sending harmful information to a minor .

After the sentencing , he sent his mother a text message : `` There 's a time for all of us to die , '' according to the sheriff 's office .

At 6:30 a.m. August 2 , a witness saw all three siblings leave in a white four-door vehicle from their Lacoochee home . At 6:59 a.m. , Ryan Dougherty cut off his GPS monitoring ankle bracelet near Zephyrhills , the sheriff 's office said .

At 7:12 a.m. August 2 , the shooting with the Florida police officer occurred , after which 20 high-caliber casings were found at the scene , the sheriff 's office said . The five-mile pursuit began after the officer tried to pull the vehicle over for speeding on State Road 54 in Zephyrhills , 30 miles northeast of Tampa , authorities said .

Then came the armed bank robbery at a CertusBank in Valdosta , at 12:24 p.m. the same day , the FBI said .

During that robbery , three people dressed in black with masks entered the bank 's front entrance , the FBI said . Shots were fired at the ceiling , and everyone was told to get down , the bureau said . At least two of the robbers were armed , and the third obtained an undisclosed amount of cash , the FBI said .

The two brothers have been living in the same rented residence the past three years in Lacoochee , which is located in Pasco County , the sheriff 's office said . Their sister , who had been living with her boyfriend in Orlando , just began staying with her brothers , the sheriff 's office said .

With the most extensive record of the three , Ryan Edward Dougherty has had 14 felony arrests since 2007 , including for alleged burglary , destroying evidence and probation violation , according to the sheriff 's office .

Lee Grace Dougherty 's criminal background includes five felony charges . Three of them are pending , all of them hit-and-run offenses in Cocoa Beach , Florida , the Pasco County Sheriff 's office said . Her record also contains six misdemeanor charges , the sheriff 's office said .

Dylan Dougherty Stanley 's criminal record shows a possession of marijuana charge , the sheriff 's office said .

The sheriff 's office did n't have information on the disposition of the past charges against the brothers and sister .

It released photos of Lee Grace Dougherty , with a description of tattoos . Public information officer Douglas Tobin confirmed the photos were taken from the suspect 's Flickr page , which was established in September 2010 .

Photos , many from March 2011 , show Dougherty in various poses .

`` I have a huge crazy family . I 'm 28 but act like I 'm 17 most of the time , '' the profile reads . `` I love to farm and shoot guys and wreck cars . I 'm a redneck and proud of it . I like milk and German engineering and causing mayhem with my siblings . ''
