-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Six children ages 1 to 7 have been hospitalized for severe gastrointestinal illnesses after swimming this month in an Alabama indoor water park , a state health official said Friday .

The children got sick after visiting the Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatic Center between June 12-18 , said Dr. Mary McIntyre , medical officer of the Bureau of Communicable Disease at the Alabama Department of Public Health .

The indoor splash park was closed Friday but the park 's other facilities remained open , a park official said .

Environmental officials will test chemical levels before the splash park will re-open , according to McIntyre . `` We are continuing to work with the medical community to identify the extent of the problem , '' she said .

Five of the children have been transferred from East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika to the Children 's Hospital of Alabama in Birmingham , where they were being treated with antibiotics , the official said .

In a statement , the department of public health urged parents whose children who may have visited the park to contact the health department if they suffer symptoms of nausea , vomiting or severe diarrhea .

Seven day-care centers took children to the Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatic Center for a day camp during the time frame officials have identified as when the water may have been contaminated , the health department said .

`` We 're recommending any children who did attend the splash park , until we can determine the full extent of the infection , not to swim in inflatable pools , '' McIntyre said . She added that such swimming could risk exposing other children to the bacteria .

Illnesses linked to pools are commonly caused by germs spread through contact with contaminated water , the department said in a news release . E. coli infections are caused by bacteria that can be found in foods and stool . Children often become infected after being exposed to others who are not toilet-trained .

`` It 's not uncommon for recreational water illnesses to occur , particularly in the summer , because a lot of people are in the pools , '' McIntyre said . `` Children have a tendency to swallow water which is probably why we 're seeing it in a younger group . ''

The health department warns people not to swim if they have diarrhea ; to avoid swallowing pool or lake water ; and to shower with soap before swimming so that germs and bacteria do not end up in pool water .
