-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- English Premier League team Manchester City unveiled plans for a new training academy on Tuesday , as the club looks to build on its recent on-field success .

City were taken over by taken over by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan in August 2008 , and have invested heavily their playing squad since .

Manager Roberto Mancini guided City into the European Champions League for the first time in their history with a third-place finish in England 's top division last term , as well as leading them to an FA Cup triumph -- the club 's first trophy in 27 years .

Now the Etihad Stadium outfit are hoping to maintain their push for honors with the development of a brand new academy complex a mere stone 's throw from their 47,000-seater home in east Manchester .

Man Utd 's dominance a sign of EPL weakness

A planning application for the project , which would boast 15 full-size and two half-size football pitches as well as accommodation for 40 youth-team players , was lodged by the two-time English champions on Tuesday .

`` Manchester City has entered a new phase in the long term strategy set out by the club 's owner three years ago , '' read a statement on the club 's official website .

`` Whilst the club already has a strong pedigree of nurturing young talent ; the limits of what can be achieved with the existing facility have been achieved . ''

The site will also contain a 7,000-capacity stadium for youth team matches , a separate building for the first team and a bridge linking the Etihad Stadium to the area -- which will be known as the Etihad Campus .

`` The development and recruitment of youth talent is at the heart of our long term strategy of building a sustainable football club for the future , '' City 's chief football operations office Brian Marwood said .

`` The opportunity to build a world class facility supported by a well researched youth development plan would be a significant step in the realization of that strategy . ''

Gavin Hamilton , editor of World Soccer magazine , told CNN that despite the City 's financial investment in their youth set-up , only time will tell whether it will change their current strategy of signing big-name stars such as Argentina striker Sergio Aguero and Spain midfielder David Silva .

`` I 'm always slightly suspicious when big clubs start investing in youth policies , '' said Hamilton . `` Chelsea did it a few years ago and very few young players have come through the youth system there . ''

Hamilton also cast doubt on City 's ability to match the set-up of European champions Barcelona , who have brought a number of first-team regulars through their famous La Masia academy .

`` I 'm always suspicious as well when clubs say they 're going to copy Barcelona , because they are the great team of the moment and it 's very fashionable to copy what they 're doing .

`` But what Barcelona have been doing goes back decades , you ca n't just buy it overnight . Even if you 're talking about a long-term development plan it 's going to take decades . ''

Hamilton also said that the successful development of young players is not necessarily achieved through financial investment , but through adopting the correct attitude to nurturing emerging talent -- citing Dutch champions Ajax as a perfect example of the right approach .

`` The clubs that are successful with youth policies are the clubs that do n't necessarily spend a lot of money , but believe in youngsters and believe in putting youngsters into the first team at an early age .

`` So a club like Ajax , which is famed for its youth academy , would n't spend a huge amount more than other clubs . But what they do have is a commitment to putting youngsters out ; blooding them at an early age and believing that if you 're good enough you 're old enough . ''
