Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bob Barker , the former host of `` The Price Is Right , '' made an impassioned plea Wednesday for an end to what he described as an ugly side of entertainment : the mistreatment of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses .

At a Capitol Hill news conference , Barker noted that traveling circuses rely heavily on animals that are trained to do tricks , which he said is accomplished with acts of cruelty .

`` How do they train them ? They have to dominate the animal , '' Barker said . `` How do they dominate the animal ? They beat it , with clubs , fists , black jacks , ax handles , golf clubs . They shock it with all sorts of electric devices . They use bull hooks on them they even deprive them of food and even water in order to make them do these tricks . ''

Barker , who is well known for promoting the cause of animal protection , is championing the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act . The bill , which would amend the existing Animal Welfare Act , has attracted bipartisan support .

The bill would affect only traveling shows . It specifically exempts zoos , aquariums and research labs and rodeos .

Rep. Jim Moran , D-Virginia , said that although the issue is not the most pressing concern of the day for Americans , `` how we treat animals is a reflection of our nation 's moral character . ''

Dr. Mel Richardson of Animal Defenders International lent his perspective from more than four decades of veterinary practice on the conditions of most , if not all , lions , tigers and elephants in traveling shows : `` Imagine living all of your life on a queen-size or king-size bed . ''

But the concerns are not confined to their housing . Jan Creamer , president of ADI , said there is sufficient documented evidence -- gained from workers planted in some traveling circuses -- that many of the animals suffer from violent training and severe punishment .

Barker 's celebrity co-host was actress Jorga Fox of `` CSI '' and `` The West Wing , '' who echoed the call for setting up more permanent residences for circus animals , and taking them off the road .

`` Our kids look to us for what is right and our kids look to us for what is fun . ... If our kids knew how cruel and violent these events were , I think they 'd actually be very disappointed in us , for -LSB- going -RSB- to these places , '' Fox said .

A recent incident in Ohio in which privately kept wild and exotic animals were released by their owner and ultimately killed by authorities , and a recent lawsuit against SeaWorld alleging the exploitation of orcas , have drawn attention to the mistreatment of show animals . Barker and his fellow advocates say the public is attuned to the nature of the proposed legislation .

Similar measures have been passed in at least 20 countries , including Bolivia , Peru , Portugal and India . And , according to the panel , more than a half-dozen countries are soon likely to follow suit .

`` It is time for the United States to join this parade of nations that is doing the right thing , '' Barker said .
