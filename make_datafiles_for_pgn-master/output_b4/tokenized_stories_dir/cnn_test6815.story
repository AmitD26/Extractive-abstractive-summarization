-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Friday proved a good evening for some major European football nations , with the Netherlands , Italy and France all claiming away victories in their Euro 2012 qualifying groups .

However , it was the Dutch who were most impressive coming away from their Group E match in Hungary with a thumping 4-0 success .

Tottenham forward Rafael van der Vaart set the visitors on their way with an eighth minute opener and Barcelona midfielder Ibrahim Afellay added a second on the stroke of half time .

Liverpool 's Dirk Kuyt made it 3-0 early in the second half and Arsenal striker Robin van Persie completed the scoring on the hour .

The victory maintained Netherlands ' 100 % group record . They have won all five of their matches , conceding just two goals in the process , and are now six points clear of second-placed Hungary .

Meanwhile , Italy continue to set the pace at the top of Group C after a late goal from Brazilian-born Inter Milan midfielder Thiago Motta gave the Azzurri a narrow 1-0 success in Slovenia with a fine strike from the edge of the area .

That result puts Italy on 13 points from their five games , six points clear of Slovenia who remain in second .

Serbia are up to third place , level on points with Slovenia , after coming from behind to beat Northern Ireland 2-1 in the evening 's other group match .

Meanwhile , goals in each half from Philippe Mexes and Yoann Gourcuff gave France a 2-0 win in Luxembourg to consolidate their position at the top of Group D .

The result leaves France on 12 points , four clear of Belarus , and well on course to qualify for next year 's finals .

There was also an away success in Group A , where Axel Witsel scored both goals in Belgium 's 2-0 victory against Austria .

The victory lifts Belgium above Austria into second in the table , but the pair are five points adrift of runaway leaders Germany .
