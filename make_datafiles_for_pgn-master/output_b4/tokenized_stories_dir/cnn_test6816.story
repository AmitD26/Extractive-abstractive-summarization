TAIPEI , Taiwan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian was convicted Friday on corruption and money laundering charges , and was sentenced to life in prison , according to officials at Taipei City Court .

Former Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian walks inside the Taipei Detention Centre in Tucheng on Friday .

He was fined 200 million New Taiwan dollars -LRB- U.S. $ 6.1 million -RRB- as well .

Chen 's wife , Wu Shu-chen , who earlier had been convicted of lying to prosecutors , also was convicted on similar charges . She received a life sentence and was fined 300 million New Taiwan dollars -LRB- U.S. $ 9.1 million -RRB- , according to the Central News Agency , Taiwan 's official news agency .

The former president was not at the courthouse when the verdict was read . He had asked to be excused and was being held at a detention center .

Supporters of Chen gathered outside the courthouse hours before the verdict , wearing bright-green shirts , and carrying yellow balloons and banners . Riot police stood by in case the crowd got out of control as they protested the verdict .

The former president 's corruption trial began in March . It is the first for a former head of state , and has gripped the island for months . He has denied wrongdoing and has said the charges are politically motivated .

Prosecutors say Chen embezzled 600 million New Taiwan dollars -LRB- U.S. $ 17.7 million -RRB- , took bribes , laundered money and illegally removed classified documents from the president 's office .

Chen has countered that the bribe money was actually political donations . He has also said that a special presidential fund from which he is accused of embezzling does not clearly say what the money can and can not be used for .

Ahead of Friday 's verdict , the island 's former first lady was sentenced to a year in prison for lying in her husband 's corruption case . Wu was convicted on charges that she helped her son , daughter and son-in-law provide false testimony .

Prosecutors said the former first couple 's son has a Swiss bank account with $ 22 million they think are illegal proceeds .

The challenge for prosecutors was to prove that Chen handed out political favors in exchange for money . The former president said he was being persecuted politically by his successor .

Chen 's party favors independence for Taiwan . His successor , President Ma Ying-jeou , favors closer ties with mainland China .
