Liberia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of young men shouting , driving in pick-up trucks and taking control of the streets of Monrovia was , only a few years ago , a reason to flee .

They are scenes reminiscent of the 14-year civil war that devastated Liberia and left an estimated 250,000 people dead .

But today , these young men and women are thronging the streets of the capital in excitement - supporting their preferred candidates in the last day of campaigning in the nation 's elections .

The front-runner : the first African female president , grandmother of three and newly-awarded winner of the Nobel Peace prize .

But what President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf really wants is to win re-election for a second term in office .

`` Just to consolidate the gains , preserve the peace , to keep bringing the development - we 've put in the fundamentals , the foundation - the possibility to reach our accelerated growth and development , fix our infrastructure , the potential and chances are so high , '' she said .

But President Johnson-Sirleaf has already broken one major promise - that she would not run for a second term .

And many Liberians believe she has not fulfilled many of her first term campaign promises - with up to 80 % of Liberians unemployed and a majority living without basic necessities such as water and electricity .

And there has been plenty of campaigning going on for Tuesday 's election , some of it a little unorthodox - I saw one car handing out money to crowds as it drove through town !

The main opposition party - the Congress for Democratic Change - is drawing big crowds with their popular vice-Presidential candidate , Liberia 's most famous international football star - George Weah .

`` Madame Johnson-Sirleaf - all the promises she made , she has never kept them - and the people are ready , you can see the excitement - that they 're ready for a change , '' he said .

Forty percent of Liberians are under the age of 14 and many believe that , at 72 , President Johnson-Sirleaf is out of touch with the needs of the average Liberian .

`` I promise them a good life , a life that is affordable . I want to see Liberians not suffering and to have light and water and healthcare , '' Weah added .

Desirable , but difficult promises to keep for any incoming administration in a country where many buildings in the capital are still riddled with bullet holes .

The voters themselves are split : `` The process she started - we need a person who will finish that peaceful process , '' one said .
While another said : `` She promised and she did n't do it - she promised and she never delivered . ''
