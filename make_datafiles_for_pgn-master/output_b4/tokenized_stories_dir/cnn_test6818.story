-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Amnesty International is demanding the United States stop allowing the export of arms and riot-control material to Egypt , where security forces have cracked down on protests .

`` U.S. arms shipments to Egypt 's security forces must be stopped until there is certainty that tear gas and other munitions , weaponry or other equipment are n't linked to bloodshed on Egyptian streets , '' Amnesty 's Brian Wood , who monitors conventional weapons and arms control , said Wednesday .

An American company shipped supplies that feature chemical irritants and riot control agents , Amnesty International said in its statement , with arrival on November 26 .

The organization said another shipment in August had the `` product code of bullets , cartridges and shells , but the latter was also described as ` ammunition smoke , ' '' which Amnesty said includes tear gas .

It cited three shipments since the revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in February .

Amnesty called on Egyptian security forces , including riot police , to be trained in the use of force and firearms .

Mark Toner , State Department deputy spokesman , told reporters Wednesday , `` We 've condemned the use of excessive force against protesters during the recent period of civil unrest in Cairo . We do take allegations of misuse of tear gas very seriously . ''

He said an ongoing export license has recently expired , but a shipment of tear gas was delivered to Egypt last week . `` But beyond that , there are no additional shipments that we 're aware of and no additional licenses that we 're aware of . ''

The department is monitoring the security situation in Egypt , Toner said .

Protesters have been upset at the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces , which has ruled Egypt since Mubarak was forced from office .

On the front lines of a street battle in Cairo in late November , protesters took turns hurling stones at helmeted riot police . Every few minutes , the police fired canisters of tear gas back at the demonstrators .

As journalists walked through the melee , demonstrators ran up wielding spent shotgun shells and tear gas canisters .

One of the tear gas canisters had markings clearly identifying it as having been manufactured in Jamestown , Pennsylvania . `` Made in USA , made in USA , '' several of the young men yelled .
