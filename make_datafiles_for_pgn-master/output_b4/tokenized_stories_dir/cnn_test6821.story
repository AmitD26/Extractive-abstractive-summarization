Honolulu , Hawaii -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In her own right , Ann Dunham , the mother of U.S. President Barack Obama , lived an accomplished , international life that began in white-bread Kansas , weaved through Asia-light Hawaii and wound up in Indonesia .

Now an exhibition celebrating her life in the world 's most populous Muslim nation is opening in Hawaii featuring her personal art and artifact collection .

Across the east-west palette , Dunham 's family and friends paint her as an ardent anthropologist , early maven of microfinance and a cultured , curious explorer .

Her daughter , Maya Soetoro-Ng , proudly wrote of her mother 's anthropological work in Surviving Against the Odds : Village Industry in Indonesia , a book based on Dunham 's original dissertation from the early 1990s .

`` She had so much respect for the communities where she conducted her research . Always logical and rigorous , our mother 's scholarship was made truly meaningful by the fact that she loved the people she wrote about and hoped others would hear their song . ''

Alice Dewey was one of Dunham 's first mentors to help compose that tune . Now Professor Emeritus at the University of Hawaii Manoa , she served as Dunham 's anthropology adviser in the 1970s . She remembers their connection as an instant match .

`` I want her ! '' recalls Dewey after seeing Dunham 's resume on her work in Indonesia .

As it turned out , the pair shared a distinct passion for local Indonesian markets and wares on the central island of Java . As a student herself , Dewey had studied local Javanese markets in the 1950s . Dunham would later extend those studies from the markets to the makers of woven bamboo baskets , tie-dyed batiks and open-fired iron blades .

In a testament to her topical thirst , Dunham pitched Dewey a very broad research plan .

`` When she submitted her research proposal to me she wanted to focus on not just one -- but five -- areas of Indonesian trade : batik , bamboo , ceramics , shadow puppetry and blacksmithing . ''

Dewey forced her to choose one . Dunham settled on blacksmithing , the craft of firing and bending hot iron into such things as knives and cooking utensils .

`` But she got us back with a 1,000-page dissertation . The norm was about 300 to 500 . ''

Bron Solyom describes her friendship with Dunham as a bond forged through blacksmithing . Now curator of special collections at the University of Hawaii Library , she and Dunham met as fellow graduate student in the 1970s .

`` We had this common , strong interest . Ann saw blacksmithing from an economic aspect -- in how people made a non-agrarian living . And she built up this body of knowledge that was really remarkable . ''

And Dunham 's desire to learn seemed to be unflappable -- even in the face of danger .

Solyom recounted the story of when the two were working in Bali in the early 1990s . After checking in to one hotel , Dunham `` was gone for ages '' while Solyom waited in the lobby .

When Dunham finally emerged she apologized saying she had had to evict a green -- and likely poisonous -- snake from her room . But before she did that , she had done a photo shoot as the serpent swayed to itself in the mirror .

`` She was just calm about things -- and forever curious , '' remembered Solyom .

That insatiable curiosity also led to copious note-taking -- some of which is just being found .

Dewey recently opened up an old trunk in her home and saw the name `` Dunham '' written inside . Daunted at the thought of poring over more work from her former student , she says she quickly shut the lid and has not opened it since .

According to her daughter , most of Dunham 's notes and other personal effects -- those known and those rediscovered -- will find a final home in the archives of the Smithsonian in Washington , D.C. by next year .

Besides the obvious field notes Dunham left behind , Soetoro-Ng adds that something more intangible is something she thinks of often .

`` I do think about her delight . In one photo , her eyes are shut and she 's just really letting go with some of her staff and colleagues . That was overlooked at times and in the years since she passed away I 've been burdened with the sadness of missing her -- and she died so young . And even though she did n't succeed in marriage and longevity there are many ways her life is a model of success that we can aspire to . ''

In 1995 , just before her 53rd birthday , Ann Dunham died after a short battle with ovarian cancer . In traditional Hawaiian fashion , her ashes were scattered into the waters of the islands . A pre-presidential Obama and his sister Maya Soetoro-Ng performed the honors .

Dewey says Dunham 's life poetically concluded the way she lived it `` traveling forever around the world , '' a fitting final journey for an explorer who lived between the east and west for much of her life .

Through Her Eyes : S. Ann Dunham 's Fieldwork in Indonesia runs through January 8 , 2012 at the East-West Center Gallery , University of Hawaii Manoa . It includes photographs taken during Ann Dunham 's years of field research in Indonesia as well as personal artifacts which include examples of metal smithing , jewelry and basketry made in the villages of Indonesia . Dunham 's personal art and artifact collection has been augmented by recent purchases to give wider context to her work in Indonesia .
