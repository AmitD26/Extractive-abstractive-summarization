-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the wake of a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis linked to bacteria-tainted cantaloupe , authorities assured the public that cantaloupe grown in places other than Colorado 's Jensen Farms is safe .

But if in doubt about a fruit 's origin , they said , it 's best to throw it out .

The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12 . As of Wednesday , it had grown to 72 cases in 18 states and had killed 13 people , officials with the Centers for Disease Control said . The number of cases is expected to rise , as it can take one to three weeks for a person who ingests the bacteria to show symptoms .

All of the tainted cantaloupes were grown at Jensen Farms in Granada , Colorado , although they were shipped to 17 states -- Illinois , Wyoming , Tennessee , Utah , Texas , Colorado , Minnesota , Kansas , New Mexico , North Carolina , Missouri , Nebraska , Oklahoma , Arizona , New Jersey , New York and Pennsylvania .

`` It 's important to know that if you know the cantaloupe that you have is not Jensen Farms , then it 's OK to eat , '' CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters during a conference call Wednesday . `` But if you 're in doubt , then throw it out . ''

The recalled cantaloupes may bear a green-and-white sticker that says , `` Product of USA-Frontera Produce-Colorado Fresh-Rocky Ford-Cantaloupe , '' or a gray , yellow and green sticker that says , `` Jensen Farms-Sweet Rocky Fords . ''

But not all cantaloupes may have a sticker , Frieden said . Consumers are urged to ask the supermarket or supplier if they know where the cantaloupes came from . If the cantaloupe 's origins remain unconfirmed , it should be disposed of , he said .

However , the likelihood of tainted cantaloupes in the nation 's food supply is decreasing , thanks to the fruit 's short shelf life -- about two weeks , officials said . The recalled cantaloupes were shipped from July 29 through September 10 , `` so we really are nearing the end of the shelf life of the product in addition to its recalled product , '' Sherri McGarry , a senior adviser with the Food and Drug Administration -LRB- FDA -RRB- , told reporters .

The recall itself should be removing the cantaloupes from shelves , she said , but the shelf life means the tainted cantaloupes will not be edible much longer . `` But consumers do have their own practices so we need to be cognizant some folks may hold that a little bit longer than we might expect , '' she said .

If consumers do have a cantaloupe from Jensen Farms , authorities recommend they do n't try to wash off the bacteria . `` We want you to throw that product away , '' McGarry said .

The fruits should be disposed of in a closed plastic bag and placed in a sealed trash can , to prevent people or animals from eating them , the CDC said .

Refrigeration will not kill the Listeria bacteria , which can grow even at low temperatures , officials said . And the longer a contaminated food is stored in the refrigerator , the more opportunity the bacteria has to grow .

`` It is very important that consumers clean their refrigerators and other food preparation surfaces '' in order to minimize risk , the FDA says on its website . After washing refrigerators , cutting boards and countertops , the agency recommends sanitizing them with a solution of one tablespoon chlorine bleach per gallon of hot water and drying them with a paper towel or cloth that has not been previously used .

Jensen Farms has now ended its cantaloupe harvest for the season , so no new contaminated fruit will be entering the market , FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said Wednesday .

Although Jensen Farms does produce other products , there is no concern for any other product from the company , McGarry said .

Listeriosis causes fever , muscle aches , diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms . It rarely is a serious concern for healthy children and adults , the CDC said , but can be dangerous for older adults or those with weakened immune systems . It can be treated with antibiotics .

The source of the outbreak -- the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998 -- remained under investigation . Officials could not give a figure Wednesday for the number of cantaloupes recalled .
