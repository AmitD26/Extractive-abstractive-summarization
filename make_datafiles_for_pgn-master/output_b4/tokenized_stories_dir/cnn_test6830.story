Bangkok , Thailand -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The central business district of Bangkok dodged severe flooding Saturday afternoon , but surrounding areas of the bustling capital faced further inundation at the next high tide .

A dreaded tide on Saturday spurred residents ' fears that it would overwhelm defenses along the Chao Phraya River and its many canals .

Bangkok 's outer suburbs were already submerged , but the central city has been largely spared the misery Thailand has been suffering for months in the nation 's worst flooding since 1942 .

In the east and the north of the city , water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods .

But the city -- which sits barely above sea level -- still faces two converging threats .

Massive runoff was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok , as high tides pushed the water in the opposite direction .

`` The challenge is to manage the huge runoff from the north passing via the city on its way to the Gulf of Thailand , '' a Red Cross bulletin said .

Bangkok 's Chinatown area -- normally hopping with activity on a Saturday afternoon -- was largely desolate , with few passers-by wading in knee-deep water .

Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered work crews Friday to cut channels in roadways to allow faster drainage , according to the MCOT news agency . But the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps , the Bangkok Post reported .

Health concerns were rising with the water .

Bangkok residents plodded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within , the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials . The government sent out crocodile hunters after reports of crocodiles and snakes in the filthy floodwater .

`` We were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters , and every day we see children playing in the water , bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground , '' said Annie Bodmer-Roy , spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Save the Children .

As floodwater entered homes , some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave .

Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was going to stay with relatives outside the city .

`` Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded , '' said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company , which was shut after it also was flooded . `` The water level is 2 meters -LRB- six feet -RRB- high and smells very bad , '' she said .

The Bangkok Post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs , and would pick up residents of the capital on Saturday and take them out of Bangkok . As of Saturday , an estimated 1 million of the city 's 12 million residents had left .

Another Bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house , which has been flooded for five days , and would not leave .

Panic buying has led to a shortage of food and bottled water in the capital , residents said .

And the worst might not yet be over .

Another high tide -- expected to reach about 4 meters -LRB- 13 feet -RRB- high -- is forecast for Sunday morning .

Officials urged tourists to steer clear of Bangkok , while noting that many of the other tourist spots , such as Phuket , remained dry and open for business .

Thailand 's Ministry of Public Health had transferred 280 of the capital 's 520 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals upcountry , the MCOT news agency reported .

The remaining 240 patients will be taken to hospitals in other provinces by Sunday , it said , citing Permanent-Secretary for Health Paichit Varachit .

Health Minister Witthaya Buranasiri said that , after months of flooding , 107,101 Thais have been diagnosed with stress , 6,214 with depression and 878 at risk of suicide . In all , 1,356 people were under observation by health officials , the minister said , according to MCOT .

The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert on Thursday , recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas . It noted that most tourist destinations , such as Phuket and Chiang Mai , were unaffected .

U.S. Ambassador Kristie Kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next .

The floods , caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers , have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people ,

The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas .

The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide , and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge in them .

Overall damage from the floods could exceed $ 6 billion , the Thai Finance Ministry said .
