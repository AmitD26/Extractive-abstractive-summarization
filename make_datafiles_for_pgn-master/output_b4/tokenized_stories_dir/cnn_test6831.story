San Francisco -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Executing a successful remake of a video game can be like shooting blindfolded , and that 's especially true when you 're dealing with the fervent following behind Microsoft 's `` Halo '' series .

Longtime fans look for any reason to balk at attempts to repackage their beloved games , and for `` Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary , '' people who follow its development closely have reasons to be skeptical . It 's the first game wholly developed without intervention from Bungie , the company that created `` Halo '' but which has since severed ties with Microsoft .

`` Halo Anniversary '' is available only for the Xbox 360 starting Tuesday , the 10th anniversary of the original `` Halo , '' which launched alongside Microsoft 's first home gaming console .

The game adds high-definition graphics and a big-production musical score to the original , without changing much else .

Producers often look at remakes as a way to add their signature to a well-regarded work , but the team shepherding `` Halo '' went to extraordinary lengths to preserve the feel of its decade-old model .

Frank O'Connor , a development director for 343 Industries , the division Microsoft created to specifically handle the `` Halo '' franchise , stressed that `` Halo Anniversary '' was created to appease fans .

The $ 40 price tag , versus the standard $ 60 price for new games , fits with that model . `` This is a celebration of the past . ''

O'Connor leads a team of a few people within 343 Industries that 's tasked with making the final say about whether a storyline for new games , books and other media fits with `` the Halo canon , '' he said .

With several bestselling books and more products in the works , this is a fragile process .

Sometimes O'Connor has to temper his own instincts in order to stay true to precedents set by earlier games . For example , he wanted to hide a rocket launcher behind a waterfall in the second level of `` Halo Anniversary '' as an Easter egg for explorers . His team challenged him on it , and so he conceded : no rockets , he lamented as he motioned to the waterfall while demonstrating the game .

Designing a familiar but unique ` Halo 4 '

The team within 343 Industries that 's working on `` Halo 4 , '' the major new game scheduled to be released late next year , has been given more creative freedom than the external group that 's programming `` Halo Anniversary . ''

Kiki Wolfkill , the executive producer for `` Halo 4 , '' said that being able to consult with O'Connor 's team makes it `` incredibly easy '' to keep their stories straight . But Josh Holmes , the creative director for the game , said that despite the help , the breadth of the `` Halo '' franchise creates a minefield for storytellers to traverse .

`` There are times when we 're thinking about all of the different interconnected storylines , '' Holmes said . `` That 's really important to us , because we believe in the universe and want to keep the universe consistent . ''

They declined to talk much about `` Halo 4 , '' but they said it will strike a delicate balance between keeping up with innovations in other first-person-shooter games and keeping the mechanics familiar to fans of the series .

The game will have a familiar control scheme , using two analog sticks for movement , rather than doing a drastic departure with , say , Kinect camera navigation , 343 Industries executives said . It may incorporate limited Kinect functions for throwing grenades or toggling settings using voice commands , like those in `` Halo Anniversary , '' they said .

`` One of the things that 's really important to us is that the game feels , at its core , like ` Halo , ' '' Holmes said . `` It feels like ` Halo , ' yet it feels new and unique . ''

Staying true to ` Halo ' in ` Anniversary ' edition

That same criteria are not what 's driving `` Halo Anniversary . '' The primary concern for developers was that it feel almost identical to the original `` Halo . ''

One roadblock that Saber Interactive , the team behind the single-player element of `` Halo Anniversary , '' ran into was a result of running an old game on the Xbox 360 's faster hardware , O'Connor said .

The game just felt smoother and speedier , he said .

So the team tweaked the code in order to reproduce glitches found in the original .

`` If things like that happen with physics or animation , and we go change it , then we 're changing the game , '' O'Connor said after watching an alien in the game make an unintentional , jittery movement . `` Some things we had to go back and break to make it authentic . ''

But like O'Connor 's failed attempt at hiding a rocket launcher , Saber wanted to do more . O'Connor and his team had to talk the developers out of overreaching .

`` They just wanted to put their own stamp on it , '' O'Connor said . `` But we said , ` This is n't about putting your stamp or our stamp . ' ''

New features for ` Halo Anniversary '

While the characters and scenes from the first `` Halo '' have been re-created with an attention to detail that takes advantage of the Xbox 360 's processor , `` Halo Anniversary '' players can switch to the vintage look at any time , except during video sequences . This results in a brief pause , but it can be a welcome distraction throughout the game .

The feature lets players compare today 's standards to what was cutting edge a decade ago . At some points , like in grassy environments , the original holds up surprisingly well , but the aesthetic changes in `` Halo Anniversary '' are n't just for show . Lighting effects and brighter textures on walls were used to guide the player along in places where it was once difficult to navigate . These changes are not likely to upset even sensitive fans .

Perhaps more controversial , the developers made some significant alterations to a particular character and added video terminals throughout the game . Both were done for the purpose of broadening the plot and for relating it to games and books that have come out since the first game , O'Connor said .

The floating blue-and-metallic orb named 343 Guilty Spark , which Microsoft 's 343 Industries took its name from , has received a sort of makeover . The wisecracking robot , which guides players through certain levels but was known to stray , has been made more visible and talkative . His lines have been updated to hint at story elements from books and future games , O'Connor said . Likewise , the terminals placed throughout the levels , another element not found in the original , let players watch short clips that hint at events in `` Halo 4 '' and other `` Halo '' media , O'Connor said .

The online multiplayer component in `` Halo Anniversary '' has more in common with `` Halo : Reach '' than it does with the original . It uses the same `` Reach '' game engine that was designed by Bungie . Certain Affinity , an Austin , Texas , game developer , rebuilt versions of a few maps and weapons from the first `` Halo '' to be played with friends . `` Halo : Reach '' owners will be able to access the modes for free .

The true test : Fan appraisals

You can never quite gauge how fans will react to seeing one of their beloved entertainment artifacts recreated for a new generation .

Remember when George Lucas remastered `` Star Wars '' in the late 1990s ? `` Han shot first , '' a reference to a particular scene from the original movie that was changed , remains the bane of many geeks .

Eagle-eye followers of `` Halo '' have begun grumbling over the addition of metallic fins lining the bottom of the ring that surrounds the planet in the game . Execs from 343 Industries initially said the fins were present in the first game but not visible due to the low graphic resolution . In fact , the fins are an important element of the plot in the Greg Bear novel `` Halo : Primordium , '' which is set to come out in January , O'Connor said . Without them , the game would be inconsistent with the book .

As `` Star Wars '' fans nervously await the three-dimensional remakes that are in the works , `` Halo Anniversary '' players with television sets that support the feature will get to play in 3-D glory .

`` Halo Anniversary '' and `` Star Wars '' have one more thing in common . The musical score for the new `` Halo '' game was recorded using Lucas ' Skywalker Symphony Orchestra . `` Halo Anniversary '' includes the ability to switch back to the music from the original game , `` though I do n't see why you 'd want to , '' O'Connor said .
