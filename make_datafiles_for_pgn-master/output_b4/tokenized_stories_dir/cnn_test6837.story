-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Europe 's leaders warned 2012 was likely to be tougher than 2011 , when spiralling borrowing costs forced political change in Italy and Spain and threatened the survival of the euro .

In a sombre address on national television Nicolas Sarkozy , president of France , said the gravest crisis Europe has faced since the second world war `` is not over '' and Angela Merkel , German chancellor , told German voters `` next year will no doubt be more difficult than 2011 '' .

The euro crisis in 2011 forced borrowing costs higher for Italy and Spain and led to the dismissal of Silvio Berlusconi 's centre-right government in Rome and the fall of the Socialist administration of JosÃ © Luis RodrÃguez Zapatero in Madrid .

It also undermined sentiment in the euro which had a second consecutive year of losses against the dollar and fell to its lowest level in a decade against the yen .

Speaking on national television on Saturday , Ms Merkel said Europe was experiencing its `` harshest test in decades '' but would ultimately be made stronger by the crisis .

Mr Sarkozy , who is facing a tough re-election campaign later this year , said French voters were more anxious at the end of the year than they were at the beginning .

`` This extraordinary crisis , without doubt the gravest since the second world war , is not over ... you are ending the year more anxious for yourselves and your children . ''

Europe 's political leaders will begin talks later this month to amend the intergovernmental pact agreed by all 27 members of the European Union , except the UK , at a summit in Brussels last month .

Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel are due to meet on January 9 to discuss a series of amendments to the proposals , including the creation of a `` road map '' for commonly-issued eurozone bonds in a new European treaty on fiscal discipline .

The state of Italy 's public finances were at the centre of Giorgio Napolitano 's New Year address . The president of Europe 's third-largest economy urged Italians to make sacrifices to rescue the country 's public finances .

`` Sacrifices are necessary to ensure the future of young people , it 's our objective and a commitment we can not avoid , '' he said .

`` No one , no social group , can today avoid the commitment to contribute to the clean-up of public finances in order to prevent the financial collapse of Italy . ''

Italy , the world 's third-largest bond market , is seen by many investors as the barometer for the eurozone debt crisis and faces a crucial opening to the year with auctions of more than â ` ¬ 100bn in the first quarter alone .

Mario Monti , the new prime minister of Italy , said in his end-of-year address last week that Italy had hauled itself back from the `` edge of the precipice '' but he said more needed to be done to reform labour markets and the service sector to restore competitiveness to the stalling economy .

In Greece , Lucas Papademos , the new technocratic prime minister , also warned of a difficult year ahead .

`` We have to continue our efforts with determination , so that the sacrifices we have made up to now wo n't be in vain , '' he said in a televised address on Saturday .
