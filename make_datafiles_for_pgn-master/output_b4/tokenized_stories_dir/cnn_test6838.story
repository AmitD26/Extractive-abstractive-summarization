LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Famed for her opulent theatrical style in films like `` Strictly Ballroom '' and `` Moulin Rouge ! , '' production designer Catherine Martin is probably the last person you might expect to find in the remote Outback of Australia knocking up a film set .

Catherine Martin created costumes for `` Australia '' with trademark wit and whimsy .

But this is exactly where the two-time Oscar-winner ended up in her role as co-producer of her husband Baz Luhrmann 's latest film , `` Australia , '' which stars Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman .

`` I am certainly not a girlie girl , '' says Martin who worked in the role of production and costume designer on the film , which is the first identifiably Australian epic ever made . But she admits that she was grateful for help with the `` mammoth '' task of the film 's logistics which she describes as an `` eye-opener . ''

`` Australia '' was filmed in various locations across the huge country -- Vaclause New South Wales , Bowen , Queensland where Martin and her team constructed a huge exterior set to look like 1930s-era Darwin , and finally the remote East Kimberley region of Western Australia .

This is where they set about building `` Faraway Downs , '' the sprawling cattle ranch in the middle of an inhospitable wilderness . In the film it belongs to Lady Sarah 's husband and saving it from a takeover plot becomes the focus of the feisty aristocrat 's epic journey across Australia with rough hewn cattleman , Drover -LRB- Jackman -RRB- .

`` We brought everything up there , '' says Martin of the film 's main set which was situated in Carlton Hill , an isolated location in an area famed for its natural beauty .

It was so remote that the team had to build roads , and when Martin explains 36 huge trucks were needed to transport all the equipment and raw materials required to build `` Faraway Downs '' from scratch on the site , the scale of the production becomes clear .

`` Logistically , ` Australia ' was a mammoth task , '' says Martin , `` Moving those number of people , and we had to build roads to get equipment in and ship things weeks in advance so they 'd actually get there . ''

In the flesh she is a petite and blonde with a wide-eyed enthusiasm that causes her to stress-every-syllable when she talks . She 's hugely garrulous , hugely engaging and is , in fact , wearing a very girlie jacket .

But it 's also clear she 's made of pretty steely stuff , which she needed to contend with some of the problems that beset the production . There were , as she puts it , some `` pretty crazy times . ''

Like when it started raining in East Kimberley during the `` dry , '' an apparently rare occurrence that , even more unusually , carried on for a number of days . Martin was in Sydney anxiously awaiting news from her team .

`` I got sent a photo of `` Faraway Downs '' and it was just an open field , the house was under water .

`` I just said to myself ` do n't panic . ' Anyway , three days in a row I got -LSB- the same -RSB- photos and I thought , ` I 'm going to have to come clean , we 're never going to be able to shoot in two weeks because everything will have gone moldy , the turf will be dead , the trees will be dead . ' ''

Martin decided to move the production back to Sydney where they would concentrate on stunt work with the horses , only to find out that an outbreak of equine flu had struck the Sydney area .

`` I remember being in a car and hearing it on the radio at the very , very moment we 'd decided to got back to Sydney .

`` It meant we could n't move the horses from the Northern Territory . And then we had the entire horse team running around trying to find doubles for our horses in Sydney . ''

Despite the pressures , Martin was still able to find the time to do what she does best -- create costumes with trademark wit and whimsy . She concentrated particularly on Kidman 's costumes which Luhrmann felt were so central to the film 's narrative that he wrote them into the script .

In one of Lady Sarah 's most sartorially absurd moments , she wears a safari-style outfit complete with pith helmet , gauze netting and wire spectacles for the three-day journey from Darwin to `` Faraway Downs '' with Drover -LRB- Hugh Jackman -RRB- .

To come up with the costume , Martin went to town , researching every possible picture she could find of women in safari suits in the 1930s -- from Jane in a Tarzan movie to a woman in Africa in 1932 .

`` It really gave me the key to the character , that Baz had her in her mind thinking this was completely appropriate .

`` She was still on African safari in her head , that she was totally a fish out of water , that she had no concept of where she was coming to or the nature of the place , not one iota , she was costuming herself for the the experience and I loved that idea and that really helped me in thinking about the other costumes . ''

Martin is sometimes considered to be the creative brains behind her 16-year partnership with Luhrmann which began with camp classic `` Strictly Ballroom '' in 1992 , but this is something she vigorously denies : `` The reality is Baz sought me out when he first started working professionally and he has always been focused on the visual aspect . ''

But , she says , `` I do think it is serendipitous that somehow we really do spark off each other . ''
