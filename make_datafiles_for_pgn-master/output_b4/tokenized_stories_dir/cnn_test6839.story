German Cup holders Schalke failed to reach this season 's quarterfinals after losing 3-1 at Bundesliga high-flyers Borussia Monchengladbach .

Young Gladbach striker Marco Reus netted two goals on 57 and 88 , while Schalke had Dutch forward Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and U.S. midfielder Jermaine Jones sent off at the start and end of the second half respectively .
