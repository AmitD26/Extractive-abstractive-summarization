New Delhi , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Exiled Tibetan lawmakers are set to hold a historic debate on the Dalai Lama 's offer to shed his political role , the speaker of their parliament said Monday .

The statement came after the speaker read to the legislators the spiritual leader 's proposals to accord greater powers to their elected representatives .

`` The essence of a democratic system is , in short , the assumption of political responsibility by elected leaders for the popular good . In order for our process of democratization to be complete , the time has come for me to devolve my formal authority to such an elected leadership , '' the Dalai Lama said in his message to Tibet 's parliament-in-exile , which is meeting at Dharamsala , India .

`` The general lack of experience and political maturity in our democratic institutions has prevented us from doing this earlier , '' he added .

Penpa Tsering , the speaker of the exile unicameral chamber , told CNN that its lawmakers would now debate the Dalai Lama 's motion . `` We should get a sense of the house by tomorrow -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- afternoon , '' he said .

The assembly , he explained , will primarily have three options -- accept all his proposals , reject them completely or recommend what he called a middle course by giving more executive powers to the elected leadership of Tibet exiles .

In case the lawmakers agree to the Dalai Lama 's proposals in totality , they will be required to set up a special drafting committee to amend their present constitution or the charter , he said . The whole process then may take months , possibly beyond the next session slated for June , Tsering added .

`` But to me , the first option -LRB- of accepting all his proposals -RRB- seems difficult , '' the speaker cautioned . `` This will have many ramifications , including those related to the Dalai Lama-led dialogue with China . '' According to Tsering , the Dalai Lama could be requested to retain political leadership of the community while devolving his ceremonial powers into elected representatives as a middle ground .

In his message , the Tibetan community 's global figurehead cited democracy as a key means to the success of his movement . `` No system of governance can ensure stability and progress if it depends solely on one person without the support and participation of the people in the political process . One man rule is both anachronistic and undesirable .

`` We have made great efforts to strengthen our democratic institutions to serve the long-term interests of the six million Tibetans , not out of a wish to copy others , but because democracy is the most representative system of governance , '' he wrote .

The final vote for a new prime minister of his government-in-exile is due on March 20 .

The Dalai Lama fled China 52 years ago on March 10 , 1959 , after a failed uprising . The exile group is headquartered in Dharamsala .

He told CNN in October that he would like to retire at some point . `` I 'm also a human being . ... Retirement is also my right , '' he said while on a speaking tour of North America . Without saying exactly when , he said , `` Sooner or later , I have to go . I 'm over 75 , so next 10 years , next 20 years , one day I will go . ''
