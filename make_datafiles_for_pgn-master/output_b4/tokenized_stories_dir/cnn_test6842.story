Anchorage , Alaska -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a competition that brings out some of the toughest , hardiest , most ferociously determined athletes in the world . In fact , most of the competitors in this sport are n't even human .

It 's a race boasting more mileage and fur coats than perhaps any other on the planet -- worn by both participants and spectators bundled from head to toe to face a punishing 2012 Alaska winter . Dubbed the `` Last Great Race '' by organizers , the Iditarod sled dog trail in Alaska is legendary . The race is currently celebrating its 40th running , now under way on the trail between Anchorage and Nome .

This year , Iditarod spectators had to brave near-record snowfall in Anchorage just to get a glimpse of their favorite teams -- howling at top of their lungs in anxious anticipation of their turn at the starting point . The nearly 1,000-mile race covers some of the most extreme terrain on Earth , each team powered by 64 booted paws and a musher 's dogged desire to be the first to reach the finish line on the Bering Sea Coast .

The Iditarod has been an annual Alaskan sporting event since 1973 , drawing spectators and competitors from across the world . Each year , hundreds of spectators travel to Alaska hoping for some personal interaction with the mushers and their four-legged teammates . There are many opportunities for visitors to meet their favorite mushers along the trail , but it takes some advance planning to get the most out of an Iditarod vacation .

The 2012 trail covers approximately 945 miles , so spectators must first determine which portion of the race they aim to see . The ceremonial start of the race is , by far , the most popular choice of fans seeking access and convenience . There are a number of events in and around Anchorage leading up to the Iditarod start , such as the Mushers ' Banquet , various Iditarod educational seminars featuring mushers and race officials , and even a competing annual festival and parade in Anchorage , the Fur Rondy .

On the first Saturday of March , thousands of Iditarod enthusiasts line Anchorage 's historic Fourth Avenue to participate in the celebratory send-off . Race officials personally introduce each team as they depart `` the chute , '' announcers struggling to be heard over a cacophony of howling dog teams . Mushers and their dogs often don festive regalia at the noncompetitive ceremonial start while also toting warmly bundled `` Iditariders '' in their sleds .

Iditariders are fans who bid on a ceremonial sled ride as part of a program which helps to support the race financially . The chance at a ceremonial 11-mile Iditarod sled ride begins at $ 500 and can cost as much as $ 7,500 for the opportunity to experience the event in a sled driven by a popular race champion .

Following a Saturday ceremonial start , mushers quickly regroup their dog teams and reorganize trail necessities for the following day 's `` official start '' of the race in Willow , Alaska , 79 miles north of Anchorage . Spectators who travel to Willow by car or shuttle bus can once again line `` the chute '' on Sunday afternoon to cheer on mushers as the race clock officially begins .

For most spectators , the next eight to 12 days involve closely monitoring the race online with the assistance of real-time GPS tracking and video coverage from the trail checkpoints -- available on www.Iditarod.com .

However , for those seeking a more intensive race experience , travel operators offer various `` flightseeing '' and snowmobile excursions in order to catch mushers crossing through some of the more than 20 remote checkpoints . The price to travel across the diverse Alaskan landscape by bush plane can be expensive during the Iditarod , but the experience is almost always described as unforgettable .

The Gold Rush-era town of Nome is the end of the trail where the famous Iditarod `` burled arch '' forms the finish line . Crowds of spectators line narrow , snow-packed Front Street to greet the winner . Last year 's Iditarod Champion , John Baker , made it to Nome with a record-setting pace -- 8 days , 18 hours and 46 minutes . A loud siren sounds day or night throughout Nome announcing the arrival of teams nearing the finish line .

Hotels in Nome , however , are scarce and must be booked months in advance for die-hard fans and visitors hoping to be present when the leaders arrive . For other spectators happy to simply get any glimpse of the remaining teams ' arrivals at the finish line , opportunities continue for approximately a week .

While the Iditarod may be known as `` The Last Great Race , '' there 's no sign it 's coming to an end anytime soon . If you 're unable to witness this year 's race at points along the trail , 2013 promises to deliver yet another compelling Iditarod -- a truly Alaskan experience .
