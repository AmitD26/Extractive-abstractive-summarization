-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Second seed Roger Federer stayed on course for a first French Open title after coming from two sets to one down to defeat Argentine Juan Martin del Potro in another five-set epic , securing a place in Sunday 's final at Roland Garros .

Roger Federer screams in joy after beating Juan Martin del Potro to reach the French Open final .

The Swiss world number two , bidding to complete his haul of grand slam titles , recovered from a slow start to claim a 3-6 7-6 2-6 6-1 6-4 victory in three hours and 28 minutes -- and will now meet Robin Soderling in Sunday 's final .

Swede Soderling , who earlier this week caused a sensation by knocking out defending champion and world number one Rafael Nadal , defeated Fernando Gonzalez 6-3 7-5 5-7 4-6 6-4 in another thrilling five-setter to continue his remarkable run in Paris .

It was Federer 's second five-set win this tournament -- he was also taken the distance by Tommy Haas in the fourth round -- and he has squeezed through to his fourth straight Paris final without hitting top form .

Federer , installed as title favorite after Nadal 's defeat , had won all his previous five meetings with Del Potro , not even dropping a set .

But he was broken in the fifth and ninth games to lose the first set as Del Potro dictated the rallies , feasting off Federer 's weak and short backhands .

Fifth seed Del Potro played a poor second-set tie-break , sending four shots into the net to gift the Swiss the leveller , but he still held the whip hand and sped through a 36-minute third set during which he broke Federer 's serve twice more .

However , as the South American tired , Federer found an extra gear -- as he has done so often this past fortnight -- and suddenly began to dominate Del Potro 's serve .

Two breaks were sufficient to win the fourth set convincingly and he broke early in the fifth too . Del Potro grabbed one himself as the light started to fade on Philippe Chatrier court , but he double-faulted in game seven to put Federer back in front . This time , the Swiss did not falter and served out to win .

Federer is now just one win away from becoming the sixth player to complete a sweep of the Majors . The title here would also move him level with Pete Sampras on a record 14 grand-slam crowns .

`` That 's one more step and I am so happy to have comeback like that , '' a delighted Federer told reporters . `` For a moment there Juan Martin was playing so well , but I had some luck on my side and I fought hard .

`` Soderling played a great match against Gonzalez to be in the final . He deserves to be there because he also beat Nadal and he was the man to beat in this tournament . ''
