-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- Through the years , there have been many unforgettable and sometimes unfortunate hairstyles .

Recording artist Travis Barker of Blink 182 was topped by a mohawk at an event in 2005 .

-LRB- 1 -RRB- MOHAWKS

The Style : Originally sported by warriors of various Native American tribes , the hairstyle was adopted by a squad of the U.S. Army 's bad-to-the-bone 101st Airborne Division during World War II , before being commandeered by punk rockers in the 1970s .

The Story : Up until a few years ago , no one would have questioned the mohawk 's roots . However , in 2003 , an Irish peat harvester made a discovery that would change the hairstyle 's history forever -- a 2,300-year-old corpse , remarkably well preserved by the unique chemistry of a peat bog , sporting a bonafide ` hawk .

The Shocker : The ancient Irish punker , dubbed Clonycavan Man , had gel in his hair , which archaeologists determined was made from vegetable oil mixed with a resin from southwestern France or Spain . Imported hair product ? Today , scientists are still working hard to determine whether Clony was a prehistoric punker or just an Iron Age metrosexual .

-LRB- 2 -RRB- POMPADOURS

The Style : If the word brings to mind images of pink Cadillacs and bouffant ` dos , you 're on the right track . But in the same way America borrowed rock 'n' roll from the blues and method acting from the Russians , the key to those 1950s locks lies in 18th-century France .

The Story : The Marquise de Pompadour was King Louis XV 's Ã¼ber-fashionable mistress , and her elaborately teased , upswept hair was imitated by high-society women throughout the country .

While 20th-century pompadours were considerably tinier than those of its namesake 's , the modern version claims one definitive advantage : technology . Where today 's science has yielded hair wax , putty , glue , and paste to cement them into place , pomps of yore depended on beef tallow , bear grease , and other artery-cloggers .

The Shocker : Not surprisingly , slathering one 's hair with animal remains tended to attract animals -LRB- insects and other nasties -RRB- , which occasionally turned the original pompadour into , quite literally , a rats ' nest .

-LRB- 3 -RRB- BEEHIVES

The Style : Speaking of rats ' nests -LRB- and the Marquise de Pompadour , for that matter -RRB- , the beehive of the 1960s is itself a 200-year throwback to the 1760s Big Hair Days .

The Story : There 's more to those 18th-century bouffant styles than meets the eye . Whereas the modern beehive is nicknamed `` the B-52 '' for its uncanny resemblance to the B-52 bomber 's distinctive nose , Marie Antoinette and her gal pals stowed actual warships in their hair -- or at least miniature replicas of them .

The Shocker : Like precursors to the Cracker Jack box , these 18th-century ` dos served as treasure troves , housing exotic prizes like tiny caged birds , cupid dolls , and other bulky curios . Of course , not every hairdo was a winner . When millions of hungry peasants revolutionized France , the over-the-top hairstyle quickly fell out of fashion -- landing in that little basket just below the guillotine .

-LRB- 4 -RRB- QUEUES

The Style : When the Manchu invaded China in the 17th century , they brought over a killer fashion trend killer as in , adopt it or else .

The Story : The Manchu sported the queue , a shaved-in-front , ponytail-in-the-back haircut , and forced the Han Chinese to do the same . The effect ? Quite a lot of protest .

The Shocker : While much of China eventually submitted to the do-or-die trend , many thousands bravely chose to keep their hair -- and lose their heads . So what was the big deal with getting a little shave ? Aside from the queue not being such a flattering cut -LRB- even compared to , say , the mullet -RRB- , it also happened to be against the religion of millions of long-haired Confucian Chinese , who believe that one 's skin and hair are sacred .

-LRB- 5 -RRB- MULLETS

The Style : A fad gone bad or the most reviled haircut in history ? Popularized by David Bowie and others during the glam ` ol days of the 1970s , the mullet was adopted -LRB- and expanded voluminously upon -RRB- in the 1980s by hard rockers and their headbanging army of fans . As hair metal gave way to grunge and alternative music in the early 1990s , a term was coined to describe those who still clung to the headbangers ' signature cut -- `` mullet heads . ''

The Story : According to the Oxford English Dictionary , which inducted `` mullet '' into its venerable lexicon in 2001 , the word -LRB- as it refers to a hairstyle -RRB- was `` apparently coined , and certainly popularized , by U.S. hip-hop group the Beastie Boys '' in their 1995 song `` Mullet Head . ''

The Shocker : Since making it into the OED , ridicule of the bemulleted has grown increasingly vocal and , judging from a random sampling of anti-mullet Web sites , rather virulent . The mullet is the one haircut Americans love to hate -- and give funny names to . To list a few : The Tennessee Top Hat , The Kentucky Waterfall , and The Camaro Crash Helmet . Our personal favorite , however , is The Missouri Compromise , which manages to reference both the haircut 's `` business in the front , party in the back '' policy , as well as the shameful Compromise of 1820 , which regulated slavery in developing U.S. territories .
