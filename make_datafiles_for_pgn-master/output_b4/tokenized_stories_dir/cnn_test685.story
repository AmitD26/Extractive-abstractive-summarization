EL PASO , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- CNN Hero Maria Ruiz has been changing the lives of children and their families in Juarez , Mexico , for more than 12 years . But lately , it 's been Ruiz 's own life that 's been changing .

Crews prepare to demolish Maria Ruiz 's home as part of ABC 's `` Extreme Makeover : Home Edition . ''

In November , `` CNN Heroes : An All-Star Tribute '' honored Ruiz for crossing the Texas border to Juarez several times a week to deliver food , clothing and toys to impoverished children and their families . Months later , Ruiz and her family received another surprise , courtesy of ABC 's `` Extreme Makeover : Home Edition . ''

Ruiz , her husband and their two children were sent on a five-day vacation to the Bahamas while thousands of volunteers built the family a custom-designed home .

`` When Ty Pennington came to our home and said , ` Ruiz family , come on out , ' we all just ran out and could n't believe that we were chosen , '' Ruiz said . `` It 's a blessing to us , but we were n't expecting all of this at all , and it has been overwhelming . ''

Pennington is the host of `` Extreme Makeover : Home Edition , '' which selected Ruiz and her family from thousands of applicants throughout Texas . Pennington said the idea was to give Ruiz what she needed most : the tools to do more . Watch Ruiz and her family react to their new home ''

In addition to bringing supplies to the people of Juarez , Ruiz and her family are completing construction of a complex there , which includes a community kitchen , an orphanage and a trade school . Read more about Ruiz 's work

In order to devote their time to the Juarez community , the family put construction of their own home on hold in 1996 , Ruiz said , leaving many parts unfinished . They were also using much of their living space as a warehouse for all of the donations for the Juarez families , she said .

`` A home is somewhere you can go after a long day 's work and relax and where the family can get together and be able to sit down and talk about our day , '' Ruiz said . `` When we had the things in the living room , we could n't do that there . ''

Upon returning from the Bahamas , Ruiz and her family were surrounded by thousands of volunteers and community members who blocked them from seeing the changes by the show 's large bus . After chanting the show 's coined phrase -- `` Move that bus ! '' -- Ruiz and her family were introduced to their new home .

`` For us , it is a new beginning , and it 's going to change our lives , '' Ruiz said .

With her new home , Ruiz will be able to continue -- and even expand -- her family 's work for those in need .

According to Executive Producer Anthony Dominici , both an additional kitchen and storage space were built in the new home for Ruiz . And `` through the generosity of the community , '' enough donations of food , clothes and toys were collected to fill a 20-foot shipping container and a 16-foot cube truck -- including more than 75,000 cans of food , Dominici said .

`` That 's the whole point here , '' Pennington said . `` To give her what she needs to make her life easier to literally spread dreams and hope to people who have absolutely none of either one of those . ''

For Ruiz , it 's about teaching young minds so they can in turn give back to their community .

`` If you teach them and train them as a child and they go out and do the same , we would live in a much better world . ''

`` CNN Heroes : An All-Star Tribute '' introduced Ruiz to the world when it premiered on Thanksgiving on the global networks of CNN . Actress Selena Gomez introduced and presented Ruiz with her CNN Hero award . Each of the top 10 CNN Heroes also received $ 25,000 . Watch Ruiz accept her CNN Hero Award ''

Nominations for 2009 CNN Heroes opened January 1 and can be submitted at www.CNN.com/Heroes .

The Ruiz family episode of `` Extreme Makeover : Home Edition '' is scheduled to air March 15 .
