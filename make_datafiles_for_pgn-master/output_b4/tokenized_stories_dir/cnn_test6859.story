-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More U.S. troops have died in Afghanistan this year than in any year since the U.S. invaded the country following the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .

Soldiers at a U.S. base in Afghanistan on Thursday honor the victims of September 11 , 2001 .

According to numbers CNN has compiled from military statements , 112 American troops have died in Afghanistan in 2008 , compared with 111 in all of 2007 .

The death toll has sparked concern among the U.S. military and its allies .

Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told a congressional committee Wednesday that the U.S. is `` running out of time '' to win the war in Afghanistan .

Mullen said the U.S. needs better nation-building initiatives and a stronger cross-border strategy with Pakistan to ensure victory over Islamic militants in the poor Asian country .

`` We ca n't kill our way to victory , and no armed force anywhere , no matter how good , can deliver these keys alone . It requires teamwork and cooperation , '' Mullen told the House Armed Services Committee .

In addition to those killed in Afghanistan , the military also includes troops who died outside the country if they were part of Operation Enduring Freedom , the war launched nearly seven years ago in and around Afghanistan .

The broader count includes two Americans who died in Djibouti in 2008 . The 2007 count includes two Americans who died in Ethiopia , two in the Philippines , one in Mali , one in Pakistan and one at sea near the Horn of Africa .

According to CNN numbers , 585 Americans have died in the course of Operation Enduring Freedom , 506 of them in Afghanistan . The numbers include hostile and nonhostile incidents .

Both the U.S.-led coalition and the NATO command announced three more deaths Thursday -- a British soldier in southern Afghanistan on Wednesday and two others in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday . The nationalities of the latter two have not been disclosed .

The British death brings the country 's toll to 118 . Other countries , including Canada , Germany , France and Spain , also have lost troops in Afghanistan .
