WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Bush administration misused intelligence to build a case for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a report issued Thursday .

President Bush did n't request intelligence reports about the post-war situation , the Senate panel 's report says .

The White House exploited its ability to declassify intelligence selectively to bolster its case for war , the committee chairman , Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV , D-West Virginia , said in the report .

Senior officials disclosed and discussed sensitive intelligence reports that supported the administration 's policy objectives and kept out of public discourse information that did not , he said .

The report also found that the administration misled the American people about contacts between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda .

`` Policymakers ' statements did not accurately convey the intelligence assessments '' about contacts between the then-Iraqi leader and Osama bin Laden 's group , `` and left the impression that the contacts led to substantive Iraqi cooperation or support of al Qaeda , '' the report said .

`` Statements and implications by the president and secretary of state suggesting that Iraq and al Qaeda had a partnership , or that Iraq had provided al Qaeda with weapons training , were not substantiated by the intelligence , '' according to the committee 's exhaustive report on prewar intelligence .

The top Republican on the committee dismissed its findings as `` partisan gamesmanship . ''

`` It is ironic that the Democrats would knowingly distort and misrepresent the committee 's findings and the intelligence in an effort to prove that the administration distorted and mischaracterized the intelligence , '' said Sen. Christopher Bond of Missouri .

The White House also rejected the report as old news .

`` I know this is another report , and I 'm sure that they put a lot of considerable thought into it , but this is a subject that has been gone over many many , many times , and I do n't know of anything that 's particularly new in it , '' said spokeswoman Dana Perino , who said she had not yet read it .

She said the White House relied on the same information as the rest of the world , admitting that it was wrong but denying that Bush had set out to mislead the country .

White House claims that Hussein was seeking weapons of mass destruction were partially backed by available intelligence , the report found , but did not reflect disputes within the intelligence community .

The CIA , among others , believed Iraq was trying to acquire nuclear weapons , but the Department of Energy disagreed , the report said .

No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq after the invasion .

The report also took the administration to task for its predictions about the aftermath of the invasion , including Vice President Dick Cheney 's assertion that U.S. troops would be greeted as liberators .

Bush and Cheney did not request intelligence reports about the post-war situation , and their public statements did not reflect doubts and uncertainties in the intelligence community , the report said .

The report comes days after former White House press spokesman Scott McClellan published a book saying Bush decided on war with Iraq soon after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .

`` Bush and his advisers knew that the American people would almost certainly not support a war launched primarily for the ambitious purpose of transforming the Middle East . Rather than open this Pandora 's Box , the administration chose a different path -- not employing out-and-out deception , but shading the truth , '' McClellan wrote in his memoir , `` What Happened . ''

Current and former White House officials have dismissed McClellan 's accusations , saying he was not in a position to know about top-level White House decision-making before the war when he was deputy press secretary .

The Senate committee chairman slammed the White House in a statement marking the release of the long-awaited report .

`` Before taking the country to war , this administration owed it to the American people to give them a 100 percent accurate picture of the threat we faced , '' Rockefeller said Thursday .

`` Unfortunately , our committee has concluded that the administration made significant claims that were not supported by the intelligence . In making the case for war , the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated , contradicted or even nonexistent . As a result , the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed , '' he added .

The report picked apart three speeches by Bush , including his 2003 State of the Union address two months before the invasion , one by Cheney and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell 's U.N. presentation about Iraq in the run-up to the war .

The report was approved by a 10-5 vote , with some Republicans dissenting .

Some GOP members of the committee had wanted the report to examine prewar statements by Democrats , including Sen. Hillary Clinton .

Democrats on the committee blocked the suggestion and limited the report 's purview to administration statements only .
