LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The conviction of a terrorist doctor in the UK exposes how any section of society can become radicalized , a top police officer said Tuesday .

Bilal Abdulla is shown being arrested after the attack at Glasgow Airport .

Bilal Abdulla was well-educated and working as a doctor when he carried out his plot to plant car bombs in London -- rather than unemployed or with feelings of being outside or abandoned by society as has been seen before in the UK .

Born in southern England , his family moved to Iraq when he was a child . He grew up in the capital during Saddam Hussein 's rule and went to the University of Baghdad before returning to Britain to attend Cambridge University .

The Cambridge-educated graduate became a doctor working in the National Health Service where the maxim is to treat anyone regardless of the ability to pay .

Deputy Assistant Commissioner John McDowall , who heads the Counter Terrorism Command , said Abdulla and Kafeel Ahmed -- who died from burn injuries after he crashed a jeep into Glasgow International Airport , Scotland -- reveal a new type of terrorist .

He told the UK 's Press Association : `` These individuals were not on our radar and that in itself is very interesting . When you look at the profile of these individuals they are very different from the terrorists we have dealt with in this country before - being professional people .

McDowell added they were probably inspired by al Qaeda in Iraq but developed their plan in Britain without help from abroad .

`` I think this was a group that was largely self-motivated , came up with the ideas themselves , tutored themselves through the Internet . I do n't think they received significant training elsewhere , which is unusual from what we have had in the past , '' he told PA. .

Abdulla 's motive , prosecutors said , was revenge for the bloodshed in Iraq . Prosecutor Jonathan Laidlaw said : ` There is no longer a conventional approach to terrorism . There are no rules to be broken any more , nothing can be taken for granted . ''

Abdulla was found guilty Tuesday of conspiracy to murder and conspiring to cause explosions . He will be sentenced to Woolwich Crown Court , London , on Wednesday .

The jury rejected his defense that he had planned only to set fire to cars in central London as a way of highlighting the plight of Iraqis .
