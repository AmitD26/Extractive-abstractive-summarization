LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Coca-Cola , the world 's largest soft drinks group , has bought a minority stake in Innocent , the British fruit drink and `` smoothie '' maker that boasts of its ethical stance .

Coca-Cola faces allegations about labor abuses as well as health and environmental concerns .

Innocent said on its Web site the U.S. firm had paid £ 30 million -LRB- $ 44 million -RRB- for a stake of `` between 10 and 20 percent '' to fund plans to expand in Europe .

Innocent employs 275 people , has a turnover of more than £ 100 million and sells about two million smoothies each week .

Its three founders , who set up the company 10 years by selling smoothies at a London music festival , insisted its ethical stance would not be compromised and they would continue to run and manage the business . Are ethics and business compatible ? Tell us what you think

`` Every promise that Innocent has made -- about making only natural healthy products , pioneering the use of better , socially and environmentally aware ingredients , packaging and production techniques , donating money to charity and having a point of view on the world -- will remain , '' co-founder Richard Reed said .

`` We 'll just get to do them even more . ''

Coca-Cola `` has been in business for over 120 years , so there will be things we can learn from them . And in some small ways we may be able to influence their thinking too . ''

James Quincey , group business unit president for Coca-Cola Europe , said : `` We are delighted to have the opportunity to invest in Innocent 's future . We have long admired their brand , their products and their unique approach to business . ''

But the investment is sure to open up Innocent to charges that its ideals are being diluted .

Coca-Cola has been criticized over negative health effects resulting from consumption of its products . It has also faced allegations about labor abuses in Colombia and environmental concerns in India , among other places .

Sales of Coke are holding up well amid the global economic crisis thanks to strong growth in China and India . In February the company reported a 4 percent rise in sales volumes in the last three months of 2008 and a 10 percent increase in comparable earnings .
