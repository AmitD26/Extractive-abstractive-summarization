-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The heady days of New York epitomized by Wall Street excess and rampant wealth may seem a far-flung memory , but the city still retains its buzz , its high-octane spirit that is the essence of its magical personality as a place where anything can happen .

The original 24 hour city , but still the best ? You can turn a trip to NYC into anything you want it to be .

New York remains firmly in first place as the world 's 24 hour city , with nearly anything accessible at any hour . There is a frustratingly vast number of sights to see , places to eat , shopping , partying and serious cultural gems dotted throughout the place .

So many films , books , television shows and musicians have personified New York that it 's hard not to feel you already know it before you arrive . While many of those stereotypes ring true , entering the city -- whether the first or twentieth time -- with an open mind will make each visit seem an adventure .

At first , the glittering , noisy and even rude aspect of the city may send timid visitors running . Look below the surface and you may see more than just shimmering skyscrapers and neatly manicured inhabitants but a multifarious bunch of people somehow co-existing astonishing well within the city 's grid structure . Despite their sometimes alarming candor , New Yorkers are as much a part of the city 's entertainment as catching a Broadway show .

A starting point for 24 hours in the city should begin with breakfast or brunch New York style : eggs -LRB- however you 'd like -RRB- and some good strong coffee to charge you up for the day . Almost every corner of Manhattan has a local diner , otherwise head downtown to breakfast stalwarts Bubby 's or Kitchenette in Tribeca , or more recent favorite New French in the West Village .

Continue south to Lower Manhattan , with an excursion on the free , 25-minute -LRB- each way -RRB- Staten Island ferry . The views of downtown , the Statue of Liberty , and Ellis Island give a closer glimpse of what it must have been like to arrive in the city as an immigrant in days past .

Next head up to lively Chinatown to shop and bargain for knock-off designer handbags and various tat around Canal Street . If feeling peckish , have dim sum at New Green Bo Restaurant , known for its no-frills decor and delicious dumplings . Or continue on to Nolita -LRB- via Little Italy -RRB- to lunch at cool , low-key Café Gitane , or in SoHo at the beautiful French restaurant Balthazar -LRB- often a hangout of celebs -RRB- . Shoppers will want to save time for the boutiques of Nolita and the higher-end designer shops in SoHo .

If strolling is your thing , do n't miss the opportunity to wander the leafy , village-like streets of the West Village . Loads of tiny boutiques -LRB- many of which have gone high-end in years past -RRB- , inviting sidewalk cafes and the general laid-back style of the place seem the perfect antidote to otherwise hectic areas of town .

Art enthusiasts should head straight to West Chelsea next , where there are enough galleries to spend several days . The Chelsea Gallery District is home to New York 's contemporary art scene and sits over near the Hudson River , spanning several streets going north .

Outdoor lovers will also be enticed to the West Chelsea neighborhood as the New York High Line is opening in June 2009 . The former elevated railroad has been converted into a park including floating ponds , sundecks and lookout spots over the Hudson River and Manhattan . One of the city 's most exciting recent projects , the public park will span 22 blocks -LRB- once it 's all open in 2010 -RRB- , a huge accomplishment after many locals fought for years to turn it into green space .

After a rest in the park , take in Midtown for its neck-wrenching skyscrapers . Admire the Chrysler Building , the city 's homage to art deco , and gape up at the city 's tallest building , the Empire State Building . Stop in Grand Central Terminal , taking note of its Beaux Arts beauty and its constellation-inspired ceiling , where you may have time to sneak a drink in the tucked away , wood-paneled Campbell Apartment bar . Then admire the nineteen buildings comprising Rockefeller Center , before glimpsing at St. Patrick 's Cathedral across the street . -LRB- Shoppers beware : the temptations of Fifth Avenue shops and department stores may pull you off schedule here -RRB- .

If your feet can still keep up the pace , stroll up to Central Park , for a glimpse of New Yorkers oasis of green . A variety of activities in the park will amuse you , from sporty rollerbladers dancing around to the peaceful Conservatory Gardens where you can rest .

Cultural buffs should head up the park 's east side to the Metropolitan Museum of Art . It could easily command several hours if not days , but if short on time choose one section . All nearby , the Frick Collection , Guggenheim Museum and Whitney Museum are each possible on their own in an hour or two .

Time for a tea or coffee break ? Visit the pretty Viennese Café Sabarsky inside the Neue Galerie , or stop in for a chi-chi cocktail at the Carlyle Hotel nearby .

For a classic New York dining experience in an elegant setting , end the perfect New York day at Gramercy Tavern before retiring to a nearby bar for a nightcap .

Otherwise , if a Broadway show is on the agenda , visit Times Square by night , taking in the dazzling lights and mayhem of New York 's entertainment district . For cheap theater tickets , visit either the TKTS booth in Times Square at 47th Street and Broadway , or call ahead to the selected theater to see if last-minute `` rush '' tickets are available .

Another option , head downtown to hear some jazz in Greenwich Village at the Village Vanguard or the Blue Note , or take in some drinks in one of many of New York 's watering holes . A few favorites include Simone Martini Bar in the East Village , Sunita in the Lower East Side or Epistrophy in Nolita .
