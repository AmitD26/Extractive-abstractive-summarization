-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- Owning a professional sports franchise is my dream job . -LRB- I 'm willing to relocate . -RRB- Of course , I could never afford my own team . There 's a better chance I 'll miraculously develop an unhittable slider , or learn to punt .

NFL team owner Robert Kraft got his start in the paper business .

You obviously must be exceedingly wealthy to become an owner .

Did you ever wonder how all these people made all that money ?

I sure hope you did , because we went and did all this research .

Here 's a list of nine billionaire owners and how they built their fortunes .

1 . Rich DeVos , Orlando Magic -LRB- NBA -RRB-

In 1959 , DeVos and high school friend Jay Van Andel started selling all-purpose cleaner .

Their business grew to become Amway , which now brings in $ 6 billion each year under the ominous-sounding Alticor name .

Whether you see Amway as an empowering direct sales company or a something resembling a cult , it sure was good to DeVos .

Forbes estimates his wealth at $ 3.5 billion , making the paltry $ 85 million he spent on the Magic in 1991 a minor investment .

2 . Robert L. Johnson , Charlotte Bobcats -LRB- NBA -RRB-

Lower on my list of dream jobs is running a cable network that caters to urban youth .

So I 'm all kinds of envious of Robert L. , who founded BET and sold it to Viacom for $ 3 billion in 2001 .

His fortune was depleted by an expensive divorce , but Johnson 's estimated net worth is still $ 1.1 billion .

His resume is full of firsts BET was the first African-American owned company traded on the NYSE .

He was the first African-American billionaire in the U.S. And , in 2002 , he became the first African-American majority owner of a professional sports franchise .

3 . Robert Kraft , New England Patriots -LRB- NFL -RRB-

I 'd never given it much thought , but I 'd always assumed Kraft bought the Patriots with big cheese money he 'd inherited .

But Kraft got his start in the paper business . His wife , Myra , is the daughter of Massachusetts philanthropist Jacob Hiatt .

After Kraft finished Harvard Business School , he went to work with his father-in-law 's packaging company .

In 1972 , Kraft founded International Forest Products , which is now part of the Kraft Group -- a diversified collection of companies ranging from Gillette Stadium to the New England Revolution -LRB- Major League Soccer -RRB- to Carmel Container Systems -LRB- Israel 's largest packaging plant -RRB- .

Kraft is seen as a savior in New England -- before he bought the team in 1994 , the Pats seemed destined for relocation to St. Louis . Plus he 's made them really , really good , winning three Super Bowls this decade .

Another reason I 'm so keen on owning a team is the access to foreign heads of state .

In 2005 , Kraft met Vladimir Putin , who walked off with one of Kraft 's Super Bowl rings .

Kraft now claims it was a gift , but that might just be what you say when a Russian leader steals your jewelry . Mental Floss : How ex-presidents and prime ministers make ends meet

4 . Hiroshi Yamauchi , Seattle Mariners -LRB- MLB -RRB-

Despite America 's strong resistance to Japanese ownership -- and despite his admitted lack of interest in baseball -- Hiroshi Yamauchi became majority owner of the Seattle Mariners in 1992 .

Yamauchi is the man credited with transforming Nintendo from playing-card company to video game giant .

His 55-year tenure saw incredible growth . But that does n't mean there were n't a few bumps along the way . Forays into instant rice , taxi service and short-stay hotels -LRB- also known as `` love hotels '' -RRB- did not pan out .

5 . Jerry Jones , Dallas Cowboys -LRB- NFL -RRB-

Jerry Jones built an oil empire in the early 1970s , striking gas in the first thirteen wells he drilled . His father had given him a head start ; Pat Jones sold the Modern Security Life Insurance Company for millions .

An undersized guard , Jones was captain of the 1965 Cotton Bowl-winning Arkansas Razorbacks .

Future Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson was a teammate , and Johnson 's successor , Barry Switzer , was a Razorbacks assistant .

Jones bought the Cowboys for an estimated $ 140 million in 1989 .

He immediately made waves by firing Tom Landry -- the only coach in Cowboys history -- and replacing him with his college buddy -LRB- the aforementioned Jimmy Johnson , who was coaching the University of Miami -RRB- .

After a rocky 1-15 start in 1989 , the Cowboys went on to win three Super Bowls in the 1990s . Mental Floss : A brief history of stadium naming rights

6 . Malcolm Glazer , Tampa Bay Buccaneers -LRB- NFL -RRB- , Manchester United -LRB- English Premier League -RRB-

Malcolm Glazer inherited a small jewelry repair business from his father .

But it was Malcolm 's investments in Florida trailer parks that started his financial ascent .

He went on to become president and CEO of First Allied Corporation , which now owns 6,700,000 square feet of retail space . He was also chairman of Gilbert/Robinson , Inc. , which managed over 100 restaurants , including Houlihan 's and Darryl 's .

Today , the Glazer family oversees strip malls and nursing homes throughout the land .

Glazer also has a large stake in Zapata , an oil company founded by George H.W. Bush .

Glazer made five previous attempts to join the elite ranks of NFL ownership , including a failed 1993 bid to bring an expansion team to Baltimore .

The New York Times said Glazer had `` a reputation as a franchise window shopper , one who looks at virtually every team that comes up for sale . ''

But in 1995 , he outbid George Steinbrenner for the downtrodden Tampa Bay Buccaneers .

Under his leadership , the franchise was righted , earning a Super Bowl title in 2003 .

Glazer also bought Manchester United , and fans were n't exactly pleased .

7 . Stanley Kroenke , Denver Nuggets -LRB- NBA -RRB- , Colorado Avalanche -LRB- NHL -RRB- , St. Louis Rams -LRB- NFL -- partial owner -RRB-

Kroenke is a self-made man who also married mega-rich .

He earned his estimated $ 2.1 billion fortune in real estate , developing shopping centers across the country .

Then he went ahead and married a Walton -- Ann Walton . Sam 's niece . She 's worth another $ 3 + billion .

A sports junkie , Kroenke also owns Major League Soccer franchise Colorado Rapids and a share in Premier League 's Arsenal F.C.

8 . Daniel Gilbert , Cleveland Cavaliers -LRB- NBA -RRB-

With $ 5,000 he 'd earned delivering pizzas -- and after a stint as a TV reporter -- the future Cavs owner started a small mortgage company called Rock Financial in 1985 .

In 1999 , the company was bought by Intuit for $ 532 million .

Three years later , Gilbert bought it back for $ 64 mil , renaming the company Quicken Loans .

He purchased the Cavaliers for $ 375 mil in 2005 .

He also owns Fathead , which makes wall decals and tiresome ads .

On the side , Gilbert is working to beat Michigan 's steroid-free bench-pressing record .

9 . Stephen Bisciotti , Baltimore Ravens -LRB- NFL -RRB-

At 48 , Stephen Bisciotti is one of the NFL 's youngest owners .

He made his money in staffing -- specifically , finding talented engineers for the aerospace industry .

With Jim Davis , Bisciotti founded Aerotek in 1983 -LRB- he was 23 -RRB- .

Their staffing company , now known as the Allegis Group , had revenues of $ 4.4 billion in 2005 .

Bisciotti bought 49 percent of the Ravens in 2000 , and purchased the rest from Art Modell in 2004 . Mental Floss : What your favorite teams were almost called
