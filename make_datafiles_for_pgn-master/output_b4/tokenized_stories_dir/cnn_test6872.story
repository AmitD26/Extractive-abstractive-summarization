-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The possibility of engine fires has prompted General Motors to recall nearly 1.5 million passenger sedans manufactured between 1997 and 2003 , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Monday .

The recall involves certain GM vehicles in which oil apparently can leak and ignite .

The recall covers certain mid - and full-size passenger sedans under GM 's Chevrolet , Buick , Oldsmobile and Pontiac brands .

The affected vehicles have naturally aspirated 3.8 liter V6 engines -- that is , engines that use atmospheric pressure rather than a mechanical blower to bring in air for combustion -- according to documents that GM filed with federal regulators last week .

On Friday , the federal government acknowledged the filing and agreed to the plan .

The problem involves a potential for oil to leak on the exhaust manifold during hard braking . When a car operates under normal conditions , the manifold can get very hot .

Oil that runs below the manifold 's heat shield could ignite and spread to plastic channels that hold spark plug wires .

As a solution , the company recommends a change in the bracket that holds spark plug wires , which will be done free of charge .

Owners and dealers affected by the recall will be notified by letter next month with details .

The vehicles involved are : • 1997-2003 Buick Regals . • 1998-2003 Chevrolet Luminas , Monte Carlos and Impalas . • 1998-1999 Oldsmobile Intrigues . • 1997-2003 Pontiac Grand Prix .

GM issued a recall on a similar engine in 2008 , according to the company 's filing with the government . That problem was traced to a faulty gasket on the engine rocker cover .
