CNN 's Campbell Brown says nonemergency legislation needs time to be read by the public and Congress .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Whether by omission or commission , both the White House and Congress get a dose of blame for not living up to the new era of transparency promised by President Obama .

The president 's old campaign Web site still has this commitment there for all to see :

`` As president , Obama will not sign any nonemergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House Web site for five days . ''

Well , the president broke that promise barely a week after taking office when he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Bill dealing with equal pay for men and women .

A good bill , and certainly one that could have survived a five-day comment period . So , maybe the White House folks just forgot ?

But then there is Congress and the Stimulus Bill . How fast could you get through it ?

According to the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation , lawmakers had just 13 hours to read 1,100 pages of material that would cost the American taxpayer $ 787 billion .

That 's less than a minute and a half per page , with no time for bathroom breaks . No wonder so many of our lawmakers did n't seem to notice that last-minute exemption clearing the way for bailed-out companies like AIG to pay out big bonuses .

So , the House tried to clean up the mess last week by rushing through another bill -- a tax on AIG bonuses . That bill was just 11 hours old before it went on the floor to be argued and then quickly approved .

And the list goes on well before the president took office .

The bank bailout got all of 29 hours , the rescue of Fannie and Freddie was only available for 19 hours . This is how bills could literally become , to borrow a phrase , too big to fail -- and too fast to stop .

The Sunlight Foundation is calling on Congress to allow the American people three days , 72 hours , to read a nonemergency bill online before debate begins . We strongly agree .

And yes lawmakers , you can have three days to read it over , too , before taking a stand . As for President Obama 's promise of a five-day public review once a bill leaves Capitol Hill headed for his desk , it would be nice if he kept his word on this going forward .
