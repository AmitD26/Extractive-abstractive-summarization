HO CHI MINH CITY , Vietnam -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- To feel the vibrancy of Ho Chi Minh City , all you have to do is step out onto a bustling city street .

Step to it : Walking through the city 's streets is the best way to see it .

Negotiating the roads , chock full of motorbikes and an increasing number of cars , can be daunting . But copy the fearless locals -- they do n't break stride and never retreat -- and put your fate in the hands , or throttle , of the city 's drivers who seems masterful at avoiding each other .

A good place to kick off a visit is on one of the main drags , Le Loi , a street that runs through the heart of the city . Near one end is the picturesque Opera House , as well as the majestic City Hall or `` People 's Committee Building '' -LRB- this is still a communist country of course -RRB- .

You should n't have to do too much motorbike dodging down Lei Loi and after just a 15 minute stroll from City Hall is the famed Cho Ben Thanh Market . However give yourself more time to stop into galleries or buy a classic piece of communist propaganda along the way .

The hundreds of stalls at Cho Ben Thanh offer a mix of traditional culture and tourist kitsch . You can sit with the locals and sip a solid jolt of Vietnamese coffee then move on to shopping for touristy T-shirts and `` authentic chopsticks '' . Many of the stalls feature signs saying the prices are fixed . But if you 're prepared to drive a hard bargain , or buy in bulk , that idea can be amended .

It 's also worth a return trip later on in the evening when the market closes and street side restaurants spring up , offering great meals at cheap prices .

If you 're looking to get away from the strip of Western hotels in the city center , hail a cab and head over to Cholon , or Ho Chi Minh City 's Chinatown . In the late 18th century , this enclave was actually a separate city from old Saigon but the two were united in the early 1930 's .

Today Cholon is home to the Binh Tay Market , which the locals call `` Cho Lon . '' Just do n't confuse it with Ben Thanh , or you 'll be right back where you started . The area is filled with plenty of local color and is a photographer 's dream .

Despite mass consumption of bottled water and the finest sunscreen , you 'll need to find a way to beat the heat in Ho Chi Minh City . One of the best ways is to make regular stops at any restaurant or caf√© for a refreshing lime soda . A bowl of the traditional Pho -LRB- pronounced `` fuh '' -RRB- is also a must .

It 's said that this simple dish -- consisting of noodles , beef and broth -- was created at food stalls in Hanoi nearly a century ago . But even in Ho Chi Minh you need to walk only a few feet before coming across a food joint claiming to serve the city 's best Pho .

In a place with stifling heat and the motorbike madness , an afternoon rest is a wise move , especially if you want to partake in the nightlife . Another dose of Vietnamese coffee will surely have you revived in no time . Or , if you 're in need of some pampering , try a foot massage at any of the countless establishments -- to play it safe and avoid `` additional services '' get a suggestion from any hotel concierge .

Is Ho Chi Minh City the most exciting city in Asia for a short break ? Have you say in the `` Sound Off '' box below .

If you 're keen to try to play foreign correspondent -- or at least see where they gathered during the days of the Vietnam War - look no further than the Rex Hotel on Nguyen Hue Boulevard . The drinks are wildly overpriced and the crowd seems to be on the `` 5 Asian Cities in 7 Days '' tour , but its large rooftop does offer a great bird 's eye view of the lively streets below .

The nearby Temple Club on Ton That Thiep Street offers a quieter setting for a cocktail . Diners also give great reviews for the food . Afterwards , stroll over to Vasco 's on Hai Ba Trung Street . The French colonial style building features bands playing away upstairs with large lounges on the veranda , while downstairs you can settle in for a more mellow night .

If your 24 hours in Ho Chi Minh City happens to turn into 36 or 48 , arrange a day trip to the Cu Chi Tunnels , about 70 kilometers Northwest of the city . The Viet Cong built this maze of passageways , which served as supply lines , during the Vietnam War . The narrow tunnels snake underground for a staggering 200 kilometers . Not only can you take a stroll , or crawl , through a few parts of it , you 'll also be served a unique dose of communist propaganda .

Most trips to Cu Chi also include a stop at the very colorful and unique Cao Dai Temple in Tay Ninh .

If these options do n't hit the mark , you can always accept an offer from one of the countless `` moto drivers . '' They 'll have you on the back of their bike and whizzing through the streets in no time . Just hold on tight . And maybe close your eyes .
