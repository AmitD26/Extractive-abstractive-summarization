-LRB- Oprah.com -RRB- -- It came as no surprise to a woman we 'll call Joan when , after 16 years of marriage , she and her husband started discussing the possibility of divorce . Deep down she 'd never believed her marriage , or any marriage , could be genuinely happy . Still , the reality was crushing . `` I was desperate , '' she says . `` I thought , ` I 'd do anything to feel better . ' ''

How about singing every day , making lists of things that made her happy , and getting a `` joy buddy '' ?

Those are among the suggestions given in Awakening Joy , a class taught by James Baraz , a meditation instructor and founding teacher of Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre , California . A series of exercises , lectures , and meditations stretched over 10 months , Awakening Joy is designed to bring more happiness to people 's lives .

Like some participants , Joan , who heard about the program while attending a meditation retreat at Spirit Rock , initially balked at the idea of singing . `` I thought James wanted me to join a choir , '' she says , `` but I took it on faith that the singing was going to work . '' So she started trilling along with the `` Hairspray '' soundtrack while driving . `` It seemed ridiculous , but that 's what initially helped me the most . ''

`` The course uses practices that lead the mind toward states of happiness and well-being , '' says Baraz . `` In other words , it teaches you to focus on how it feels to feel good . '' The first and most important step , he says , is intention : making the decision to be happy .

Robert Holden , Ph.D. , author of `` Happiness Now ! Timeless Wisdom for Feeling Good Fast '' and director of the Happiness Project in the United Kingdom , agrees that this is key . `` Intention is another word for focus . Whatever you focus on will become more apparent and will grow . For centuries , optimists and pessimists have argued over who 's right , and the answer is they both are ; each sees what they 're looking for . If you focus on happiness , that 's what you become more aware of . ''

Once participants have made up their minds to be happier , Baraz gives them the tools -- delivered in lectures to the live class he teaches in Berkeley and in twice-monthly e-mails sent to participants in other areas -- to teach them how to cultivate a positive state of mind . Among them :

• Writing what the word joy means to you

• Doing some form of physical movement -- such as yoga , dance , or walking -- a few times a week

• Making a `` nourishment list '' of activities you enjoy , checking off those you do regularly and circling the ones that could be done more often

• Checking in with your `` joy buddy , '' a kind of running partner in the pursuit of happiness .

`` That 's important , '' says Holden . `` One of the major blocks to happiness is a sense of isolation . If you 're alive , you need help . ''

There are also guided meditations , including instructions on how to be mindful -- being present for whatever you 're doing and , as Baraz says , `` simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different . ''

For Joan , that turned out to be a bigger challenge than singing -- especially when her husband suggested that they begin the separation process .

`` Awakening Joy is n't about being a happy little do bee , '' she says . `` You 're taught that when feelings arise , no matter what they are , you stay with them . When my husband said we should contact a mediator , I cried years of tears . But by accepting those painful feelings , I had a watershed moment : I realized that I really wanted this marriage . ''

Rather than assuming divorce was inevitable , Joan started to see other possibilities . `` From that day to this , it 's been a whole different experience , '' she says . `` My husband and I are still together , and in a way that I honestly did n't think was possible . ''

For Baraz , the best testimonials come from former skeptics ; he admits that he himself would n't be the best case study . `` I 've always been a relatively joyful , celebratory kind of person , '' he says . He found his spiritual path in Buddhism , but when his studies became very serious , so did he .

`` Then I realized that the Buddha was called the Happy One , and he said , ` Go for the highest happiness . ' That became the focus of my teaching . '' -LRB- Baraz points out that one need n't be a Buddhist , or of any particular faith , to reap the benefits of Awakening Joy . `` Ministers , rabbis , and secular experts have successfully used these basic principles , '' he says . -RRB-

The idea for the course began eight years ago , when Baraz 's wife , Jane , gave him a book called `` How We Choose to Be Happy , '' by Rick Foster and Greg Hicks . `` The instructions made a lot of sense , but they did n't have a spiritual dimension , '' Baraz says . `` So I added that and presented it as a series of talks with my weekly meditation group for about three months to see what would happen . '' The results : `` We got happier and happier ! ''

Baraz then turned Awakening Joy into a six-month class and found that participants maintained a positive attitude even after it ended -LRB- as long as they practiced the exercises ; as with diets or working out , continuity is essential -RRB- .

Word of mouth about the course that could make people happier began to spread : The first round of Awakening Joy meetings consisted of about 40 members . The next numbered 100 ; the next , 200 , and then 500 . It went international when its members began e-mailing their monthly homework assignments from the lectures to friends . Baraz was thrilled to receive messages from strangers in Europe , Africa , and New Zealand . `` It works ! '' they wrote . Apparently , you did n't have to be there to get the joy .

Nor do you have to be the type who can deftly turn a frown upside down . `` I 'm the person who walks into a nicely designed room and notices only that the painting was hung too high , '' says Gretchen , age 56 .

In addition to being a `` serious '' woman from a depressive family , Gretchen also found herself in chronic pain after sustaining a back injury . `` It was horrible , '' she recalls . `` Medication made me sick . I felt guilty about not being able to work , and I thought people were judging me . '' Though a specialist was able to alleviate some of her physical discomfort , Gretchen fell into a deep depression .

She heard about Awakening Joy after taking Baraz 's meditation classes at Spirit Rock . `` The first thing I was hit by was the instruction to notice what it feels like when you 're happy , '' she says . `` I loved the walks I took to help my back , but before , I just plodded down the street , not noticing anything . Now I 'm aware of how I feel when I 'm walking , which enhances my enjoyment . ''

Writing lists of things she 's grateful for was also a big help . `` A lot of my seriousness has lifted , '' she says . `` I have a lighter heart . I still have chronic pain , but I know there 's a lot to feel good about . ''

Baraz is writing a book about Awakening Joy and the people who now routinely roll up the windows in their cars so they can sing as loudly as they want to . `` More than 2,000 people have tested it , so it 's not some airy-fairy idea , '' he says . `` I 've learned that it 's possible to change , no matter what your history or the limiting beliefs you 've held on to . If you have the intention to be happy and you do the practices , if you give it your best shot and are very patient , it works . ''

We 're all so used to thinking that we 'll finally be content when we find the perfect partner , lose weight , or get our dream job . Is it really possible to become happier just by deciding you can ?

`` We use the language of having , getting , and chasing to describe happiness , rather than being , '' says Holden . `` What we 've learned about happiness is that it is n't an it or a thing . Research has proven that there is no one set of circumstances that makes someone happy ; it 's more about having a healthy mental attitude toward whatever you 're experiencing . So , you can either chase happiness or you can choose to be happy . It really is that simple . ''
