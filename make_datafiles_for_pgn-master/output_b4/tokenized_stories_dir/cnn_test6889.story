SATSUMA , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The father of a missing 5-year-old Florida girl made a renewed plea Thursday for the return of his daughter .

The search continued Thursday for Haleigh Cummings , 5 , who went missing from her home near Orlando .

`` If you have my daughter and you 're watching this , drop her off somewhere safe , '' Roland Cummings said of his daughter Haleigh .

`` I 'm not out for revenge , I 'm not out for nothing else . I want my daughter back , '' Cummings said , with his girlfriend , Misty Croslin , at his side .

He said he could think of no reason Haleigh would be taken .

`` Why would anybody be sick enough '' to abduct a child ? he asked .

Cummings , 25 , said earlier that he and Croslin had passed lie detector tests .

Croslin , 17 , was the last person to see Haleigh when she put the girl to bed Monday night in their Satsuma , Florida , home . She said she awoke in the middle of the night to find Haleigh gone and the back door to the double-wide trailer propped open with a brick .

Putnam County authorities on Thursday continued working with the FBI and state investigators to search a five-mile area for Haleigh .

Police have no official suspects , but say they are treating everyone they interview as one .

`` All the world 's a suspect '' now , a sheriff 's spokesman has said .

Cummings said earlier that he was surprised when he arrived home from work at 3 a.m. Tuesday to see his girlfriend awake , and he asked her why she was up .

`` She said , ` Your back door 's open and your daughter 's gone , ' '' Cummings told Nancy Grace on her show on CNN 's sister network HLN on Wednesday night . Watch Cummings describe his shock ''

Croslin waited until Cummings came home to phone 911 about the girl 's disappearance , though it 's unclear how long that wait was . Watch the father describe what happened ''

Police said Wednesday that Croslin had tucked the girl and her 4-year-old brother into bed at 8 p.m. before going to sleep at 10 .

Croslin told police she woke up around 3 a.m. to use the bathroom and returned to find the girl missing . The boy was still in bed , Cummings told CNN .

A brick was propping the trailer 's door open , Croslin told a 911 dispatcher . Hear the frantic 911 call ''

The father said he has used the back door only two times since he 's been living in the trailer .

Police say they believe the girl was abducted .

`` There 's no longer any reason to believe that the child simply wandered outside , '' Maj. Gary Bowling of the Putnam County Sheriff 's Office said Wednesday .

The police must `` assume abduction , '' he said , adding , `` All the answers to why you 'd want to take a 5-year-old are ugly . ''

Haleigh 's mother , Crystal Sheffield , shook as she spoke Thursday near the search area . Sheffield 's mother , Marie Griffis , said that she and her daughter are devastated . `` It 's like I 've got a hole in my body , and she feels helpless because she ca n't do anything but sit here . ''

A nationwide Amber Alert says the girl was last seen wearing a pink shirt and underwear .

Croslin is staying with relatives as the investigation continues , said Bowling , describing the girlfriend as a `` child herself . ''

Griffis said that her daughter and Ronald Cummings had a `` rocky relationship '' and that the two took turns spending weekends with their daughter . Watch mother 's tearful plea ''

It 's unclear if Sheffield and Cummings were ever married , but they are `` legally separated , '' police said Thursday . Authorities were unable to answer media questions about how and why Cummings had custody of Haleigh .

Sheffield lives near the Florida-Georgia line and has been interviewed by law enforcement , according to police .

Investigators are looking into various angles of the case , including finding out the location of 44 registered sexual offenders who live within a five-mile radius of the Cummings home , said Lt. Johnny Greenwood of the Putnam County Sheriff 's Office .

Police are offering but not requiring all those interviewed in the case to take polygraph tests .

A familiar face from the Caylee Anthony case is involved in the search . Bounty hunter Leonard Padilla joined the hunt Tuesday and is offering a $ 25,000 reward for the girl 's return .

Padilla initially bonded out Caylee 's mother , Casey , who has been charged with first-degree murder in the toddler 's death , and then helped launch one of several searches for Caylee .

Anyone with information is encouraged to call the Putnam County Sheriff 's Office at 386-329-0800 or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement 's Missing Endangered Persons Information Clearinghouse at 888-FL-MISSING .
