WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.S. Marine videotaped throwing a puppy over a cliff while on patrol in Iraq has been kicked out of the Corps , and a second Marine involved has been disciplined , according to a statement released by the Marines .

YouTube.com removed the video for violating the Web site 's terms of use .

Lance Cpl. David Motari , based in Hawaii with the 1st Battalion , 3rd Marine Regiment , is being `` processed for separation '' and received non-judicial punishment , officials said in the statement Wednesday night . The Marine Corps would not specify what that punishment was because of privacy regulations .

The statement said Motari received the punishment for his role in the `` episode which generated international attention . ''

The incident appeared on the Internet web site YouTube in March , sparking outrage from animal rights groups around the world .

In the video , Motari is seen throwing the dog off a cliff as it yelps .

A second Marine , San Diego-based Sgt. Crismarvin Banez Encarnacion , received non-judicial punishment as well .

Janice Hagar , a spokeswoman for the Marines in San Diego , said Encarnacion shot the video .

Marine officials at the Pentagon would not disclose the severity of the disciplinary action against Encarnacion , also because of privacy regulations .

CNN did not receive a response from the Marine Corps in San Diego to questions about the case .

The statement said the Marines conducted an investigation as soon as the YouTube video came to the attention of commanders .

`` The actions seen in the Internet video are contrary to the high standards we expect of every Marine and will not be tolerated , '' according to the statement .

On the video , Motari smiles as he is holding the puppy and then hurls the dog over a cliff . An unknown person operating the video cameras is heard laughing and another voice saying `` that 's mean , Motari . ''

In a statement , the Humane Society of the United States applauded the Marine Corps ' decision to punish those involved .

`` The bad actors in this case have been dealt with by the Marine Corps , which rightly recognizes that harming animals is unacceptable conduct , '' said Dale Bartlett , the group 's deputy manager for animal cruelty issues . `` Now , the Department of Defense and the Congress must step up protection from cruelty for all animals under the law governing military conduct .
