LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The sponsor of a proposal to rein in aggressive celebrity photographers is meeting resistance from Los Angeles ' top cop , who says the law is not needed when celebrities just behave .

Photographers swarm a car carrying Britney Spears after a Los Angeles court appearance in October 2007 .

City Councilman Dennis Zine wants to require photographers to stay a safe distance from celebrities .

His proposed ordinance is nicknamed the `` Britney Law '' for the hordes of paparazzi that swarm around pop star Britney Spears , sometimes costing the city thousands of dollars for escorts and other enforcement .

`` They act like a pack of wolves stalking their prey , creating havoc in the streets , and are nuisances to innocent bystanders , '' Zine said at a task force hearing he convened Thursday . Watch how paparazzi spy on Hollywood stars ''

The proposal gained exposure last month when officials from around Southern California asked former independent counsel Kenneth Starr -- whose investigation of former President Clinton spawned its own share of tabloid headlines -- to help craft a law that would protect celebrities without infringing on freedom of the press . iReport.com : Share your celeb stories and photos

Critics of the plan include Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton , who argues that it would be difficult to enforce . He also says existing laws can keep unruly packs of photographers in check .

The chief said the city 's tabloid darlings could help by providing photographers less to work with .

`` If celebrities behave themselves , that solves about 90 percent of the problem , '' Bratton said . `` Britney , the last couple of days , has started wearing clothes again . The paparazzi are leaving town because she 's not as interesting when she 's not running around without her underwear on . ''

He said actress Lindsay Lohan `` evidently found a new love life , so she 's probably in New York hanging out '' and that `` God knows '' where billionaire heiress Paris Hilton had been .

`` She 's thankfully disappeared from the scene , '' Bratton said .

At the hearing , members of the paparazzi also said the law would be impossible to enforce .

`` Unless every celebrity has a chaperone of a police officer with a 6-foot tape measure , how are you going to enforce it ? '' said photographer Nick Stern .

Those attending included musician John Mayer , actor Eric Roberts , sheriff 's officials , representatives of the Screen Actors Guild and officials from West Hollywood , Beverly Hills and Malibu .
