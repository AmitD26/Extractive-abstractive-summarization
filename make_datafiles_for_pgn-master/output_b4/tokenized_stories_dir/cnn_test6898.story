-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Philadelphia Eagles welcomed Michael Vick back into the National Football League on Friday after the quarterback spent almost two years in federal prison on a felony dogfighting conviction .

Michael Vick speaks at a Philadelphia Eagles news conference on Friday .

Vick , formerly with the Atlanta Falcons , has signed a two-year deal with the Eagles .

`` I think everybody deserves a second chance , '' Vick said at a news conference in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , on Friday . `` Now I want to be part of the solution and not the problem . ''

The league suspended Vick indefinitely in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia .

Vick , 29 , was freed from federal prison at Leavenworth , Kansas , on May 20 and returned to his Virginia home to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement . iReport.com : Is this a good move ?

`` Everything that happened at that point in my life was wrong , '' Vick said of his involvement with the dogfighting ring . Watch bloggers discuss Vick 's return to the NFL ''

`` I had to reach a turning point . Prison definitely did it for me , '' he said .

Flanked by Eagles coach Andy Reid and former NFL coach Tony Dungy , who acted as a mentor to Vick after he was imprisoned , the newest Eagle vowed `` to do all the right things . ''

`` I want to be an ambassador to the NFL and the community , '' he said . `` I 'm glad I got ... a second chance . I wo n't disappoint . ''

Dungy said that he thinks Vick can revive his career and turn his life around in Philadelphia but that the quarterback will be tested by fickle Eagles fans .

`` He is gon na have a lot of people who do not think he should be playing . He 's got to prove them wrong on the field and off the field , '' Dungy said . Watch why Dungy thinks Vick will be a positive force ''

Earlier reaction to Vick 's signing was mixed .

The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said Thursday night in a statement that it was `` incredibly disappointed '' at the news .

`` Philadelphia is a city of dog lovers and , most particularly , pit bull lovers , '' said Susan Cosby , the organization 's chief executive officer . `` To root for someone who participated in the hanging , drowning , electrocution and shooting of dogs will be impossible for many , no matter how much we would all like to see the Eagles go all the way . ''

However , Ed Sayres , president and CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , said in a statement that '' -LSB- NFL -RSB- Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Philadelphia Eagles have granted Michael Vick a second chance , and the ASPCA expects Mr. Vick to express remorse for his actions , as well as display more compassion and sound judgment this time around than he did during his previous tenure with the NFL .

`` We hope that Mr. Vick uses his stature for the betterment of the community and the advancement of the issue of animal cruelty , '' Sayres said .

Reid said he knows that there are some fans who will not accept Vick .

`` I understand how that works , '' he said . `` But there 's enough of them that will , and then it 's up to Michael to prove that that change has taken place . I think he 's there . That 's what he wants to do . ''

He said Vick `` seems very focused , and he wants to get his career back on track . ''

It is unclear what role Vick will play in the Eagles ' offense . But it was clear that the move had the blessing of Eagles starting quarterback Donovan McNabb .

`` I pretty much lobbied to get him here , '' McNabb said . `` Because everybody deserves a second chance . ''

The NFL reinstated Vick on a conditional basis last month . Vick `` will be considered for full reinstatement and to play in regular-season games by Week 6 based on the progress he makes in his transition plan , '' the league said in a statement last month .

Week 6 of the NFL season is in October .

Vick may participate in practices , workouts and meetings and may play in his club 's final two preseason games under the conditions of his reinstatement , the league said last month .

`` I fully understand that playing football in the NFL is a privilege , not a right , and I am truly thankful for -LSB- the -RSB- opportunity I have been given , '' Vick said in a statement last month upon his reinstatement .

Goodell said last month that Vick underwent tests , including a psychiatric evaluation , after requests from animal rights groups .

Vick has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . At a hearing in that case , he told the judge he earned 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor while in prison .

Court documents released in Vick 's case showed that two of his co-defendants , who also pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal , said that Vick helped kill dogs that did n't fight well and that all three men `` executed approximately eight dogs '' in ways that included hanging and drowning . The dogs were killed because they fared poorly in `` testing '' sessions held at Vick 's property .

The Humane Society of the United States has said Vick offered to work with the organization on anti-dogfighting campaigns . Wayne Pacelle , the organization 's president , has said Vick was to work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting and on programs to assist youths who have been involved .

In November , Vick pleaded guilty to a state dogfighting charge and received a three-year suspended sentence .

The Eagles are scheduled to play Vick 's former team , the Falcons , in Atlanta on December 6 .
