-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There 's a photo of the Jackson family on the cover of the September 24 , 1971 , issue of Life magazine . In it , Joseph and Katherine Jackson stand at the foot of a set of stairs , their star children -- known as the Jackson 5 -- arrayed behind them .

The Jackson brothers , here in the 1970s , were driven to be great by their father , Joseph .

They appear to be the all-American clan , gold records arranged behind them , the boys loose and smiling , the parents more awkward and serious in their demeanor .

Over the years , that fa√ßade crumbled . The brothers bickered ; some made accusations of abuse . But the group remained tight-knit through crises , including Thursday 's tragedy , when Michael Jackson collapsed at his house and later died at UCLA Medical Center .

The journey began with music in Gary , Indiana . Joseph Jackson , the patriarch , played in a short-lived band called the Falcons -LRB- no relation to the Detroit-based group featuring Wilson Pickett -RRB- in the 1950s . His primary job , however , was as a crane operator at U.S. Steel .

Katherine Jackson , the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949 , tended to the couple 's large family : Rebbie , Jackie , Tito , Jermaine , La Toya , Marlon , Michael and Randy , all born between 1950 and 1961 . Daughter Janet arrived in 1966 .

By that time , the three oldest boys -- Jackie , Tito and Jermaine -- had started their own group , which Marlon and Michael eventually joined . Joseph Jackson saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he 'd found elusive .

Joseph Jackson admitted being a harsh taskmaster . He drove his sons hard , forcing them to rehearse with a James Brown-like intensity . He was n't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child , Michael .

`` My father teased me and I just hated it and I cried every day , '' Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993 . He said his father also beat him : `` He was very strict , very hard , very stern . ... There 's been times when he 'd come to see me , I 'd get sick , I 'd start to regurgitate . ''

He quickly said , imagining his father 's reaction , `` Please do n't be mad at me . ''

Joseph Jackson disputed the word `` beat , '' but did n't question Michael 's account .

`` I whipped him with a switch and a belt , '' he told the BBC in 2003 . He added , `` I never beat him . You beat someone with a stick . ''

In a 2005 interview with CNN 's Larry King , Jermaine defended his father 's actions .

`` We grew up like any other black family . You did something , you got your butt tore up , and it was n't tore up , it was just , you got a spanking , '' he said . `` I will say this . He kept us off of the streets . He kept us away from drugs . He kept us away from gangs and ... we 've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world . ''

By 1968 , when Michael turned 10 , the Jackson 5 was a professional musical machine . They 'd won an Apollo Theater talent night the previous year and were working the `` chitlin circuit '' of black clubs when producer Bobby Taylor urged Motown to sign the group . Motown founder Berry Gordy was impressed and made them `` the last big stars to come off my assembly line , '' according to a biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Web site .

The group shot out of the gate with four No. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base , along with an animated TV show . But success took its toll , particularly when it was n't so easy to come by .

In the mid-1970s , the band -- minus Jermaine , who 'd married Gordy 's daughter Hazel -- moved to Epic Records , where they were produced by the Philadelphia soul-funk team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff . The two remember nothing but good times from the sessions , which produced two albums and the Top 10 hit `` Enjoy Yourself . ''

`` It was a collaboration , '' Gamble said . `` They all participated in creating . Tito was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians . ''

Huff said he visited the Jackson compound during a trip to California and remembered a warm family setting , complete with a `` fantastic meal '' cooked by Katherine Jackson .

`` I 've got nothing but respect for the father , '' added Gamble . `` He 's a great man . He made something out of nothing . ''

Even during that era , however , Michael was standing out . Gamble and Huff recalled him taking a keen interest in recording technology and the way he sounded . Going solo with Quincy Jones producing , as he did in 1979 , was the right move , Gamble and Huff said .

The family dynamics kept changing as the siblings grew older . After Michael 's `` Thriller '' became the biggest album of all time , the brothers -- including Jermaine -- regrouped for a new album , `` Victory , '' and accompanying tour . But Michael , now the undisputed draw , disagreed with some of the tour plans and ended up donating his earnings to charity .

Michael 's brightened spotlight boosted the careers of his siblings ; even Rebbie had a hit . But it was Janet who broke out with the most success , including the No. 1 singles `` Miss You Much , '' `` Black Cat '' and `` Again '' in the 1980s and '90s .

With the increased interest in the Jacksons came tabloid scrutiny of the family 's every move . When La Toya appeared nude in Playboy magazine , the story made headlines . She later criticized Michael and was on the outs for several years .

Jermaine put out a song called `` Word to the Badd , '' an attack on Michael , in 1991 ; he later changed the lyrics . Janet 's relationships were probed in detail , as were the brothers ' marriages .

And Michael , of course , was seen as increasingly eccentric , his personality overwhelming his music .

But for all their own bickering , the family closed ranks when a member was attacked . In 1992 , Jermaine co-produced `` The Jacksons : An American Dream , '' a TV miniseries based on Katherine Jackson 's memoir , which chronicled their rise to stardom . When Michael faced molestation allegations in the early '90s and was tried in 2005 , the family rallied around .

`` The Jackson family was groomed to be a team , '' said Linda Johnson Rice , president and CEO of Ebony and Jet magazines ' Johnson Publishing and a longtime family friend . `` As you can see through their performances , they were always there for each other . ''

In recent years , La Toya has appeared on the reality shows `` Armed and Famous '' and the UK `` Celebrity Big Brother . '' She originally had a scene in the forthcoming Sacha Baron Cohen movie , `` Bruno , '' but CNN confirmed the scene has been cut , `` out of respect for Jackson 's family , '' the studio told The -LRB- UK -RRB- Guardian .

Jermaine , who converted to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Abdul-Aziz , appeared on `` Celebrity Big Brother '' in 2007 . Jackie runs a record label , Tito remains involved in the music business , and according to a 2008 article in the New York Post , Marlon and Randy have struggled financially .

In the hospital emergency room Thursday , Randy and Jermaine were witnessed hugging and crying over their late brother .

`` We 're a family , '' Jermaine told Larry King in the 2005 interview . `` We 're no different than any other family who has feuds and problems . ... But at the same time , we 're united , and we have a united front that is very , very strong , and it 's supported by God .

`` My mother and father did a great job in instilling the morals and principles in us from the very beginning . We feel that with that , that 's all you need to go through life . ''
