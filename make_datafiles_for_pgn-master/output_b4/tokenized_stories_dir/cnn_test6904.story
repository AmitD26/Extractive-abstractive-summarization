CONYERS , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Your daughter is a walking time bomb . '' We have been told this more times than I like to remember . We have lived every day not knowing if the next breath she takes will be her last .

After 22 years in the dark , Mandy Young is grateful to finally have a name for her condition .

Her illnesses come so quickly . It 's a daily battle of fear , worry , misery , faith and hope . She has been in the hospital more than 100 times . She has suffered one life-threatening infection after another .

We share her story , our story , in hopes of helping others .

We make sure that Mandy knows this is not just her illness .

It 's our families ' life , our journey . She is not in this alone . It 's extremely hard living a life so mysterious that doctors and scientists named her rare disease after her . It 's our story about `` Mandy 's Disease . ''

Mandy was a healthy , nine pound , green-eyed beauty -- until the day she was diagnosed with Spinal Meningitis .

Hours and days crept by , waiting every four hours for our ICU visit , 10 minutes of torture .

`` Your daughter is very sick . Her mind is surely in a vegetated state from the seizures she continues to have . The stroke that she suffered has caused the left side of her body to be paralyzed , '' the doctors said .

`` She is in a coma and we see no way she will wake up . We really do n't think she will live through the night . It 's time to tell her goodbye , '' they continued .

Mind spinning , stomach churning , feeling like I 've had the breath knocked out of me , I whispered , `` NO . '' `` No . We wo n't tell her goodbye . And you ca n't either . She has to fight . She has to know that we want her to fight . ''

At 13 months , her left eye turned red . Allergies , Pink Eye , minor infection ? All easily treated , and cured .

By day five , after six trips to doctors and emergency rooms , when her eye was swollen beyond seeing and looked like a piece of raw meat , we were finally able to beg her doctor for more aggressive testing .

Surgery , biopsies and a diagnosis . Nisseria Meningitides . Her eye would be replaced with a glass eye . But only if she lived .

At 21 months . Spinal Meningitis again . The same promises of certain death . ICU . Seizures . A 106 degree temperature raged . `` There is no way that she has the strength to fight off another infection of this magnitude . It 's time to let go . We 're losing her by the minute . ''

After the first bout of meningitis we were told , `` No one gets it twice . Live your life and enjoy your child ! '' Then , bout two . Although not the same type of meningitis , it was the same family .

It 's rare to have it twice . But impossible to have it three times . But time three did come . `` You have to find out why this keeps happening . She ca n't go through this again . What can you do ? '' we pleaded with the doctors .

They told us it could possibly be immune deficiency . This was the first time we heard this term .

Mandy was discharged and our journey for a reason began . Our lives were changed forever . Twice a week for the next two years , we handed her over for blood to be drawn . She went into isolation . Daily preventative antibiotics .

But nothing stopped the madness of these infections . One fever blister on her lip turned into hundreds during a nap . She was hospitalized on oxygen as the blisters took over her lungs . Double Pneumonia . Scarlet Fever . Ear infection after ear infection .

Surgically implanted tubes in her ears , infection , tubes out , surgery , tubes in . 11 times . An abscess the size of a cantaloupe in her abdomen .

The grueling , sometimes gruesome , immune studies continued . The only clue continued to be her low white blood count . Everything else , normal . The turmoil in my heart was insane .

Years passed . Mandy 's illnesses continued . Immune studies continued . Still we had no answers . We traveled the country begging for someone to study her . `` Her body is further advanced than medicine . The test has n't been invented yet to define her deficiency . '' This was the standard answer .

But , someone had to have a new test that could give us our answers . And then the time bomb that we had only been warned about exploded .

Gas Gangrene and Clostridia Septicemia . A combination not seen since WWII . `` She 's fighting to stay alive . Five percent chance to live , '' the doctors said . ICU . And then , in an attempt to save her life , they began to amputate her leg . Before they stopped the spreading , her leg and hip were gone .

As she lay in a coma , we prayed for help . Our search for a research specialist intensified . That 's when we found Dr. John Gallin at the National Institutes of Health -LRB- NIH -RRB- in Bethesda , Maryland .

Mandy is 27 now . Her immune studies began when she was two in 1983 . And in May 2003 , we received an email that said , `` At long last we have discovered the basis of Amanda 's problem . ''

Mandy has a genetic defect , called IRAK-4 . Her body does n't recognize infection and does n't produce the cells needed to fight it off .

She is still studied at the NIH in hopes of finding a treatment or cure for her disease . And although finding a cure for her would be the ultimate gift , knowing that we have a name for her illness is the prize .

We searched for a name for twenty years for Mandy disease . We spent weeks and months with her , in hospital after hospital , praying for her to live through her sickness . And to know that we have Dr. Gallin and his team in the background working on her behalf is incredible !

Dr. Gallin did what he said he would do and stayed with Mandy until her diagnosis was made . Now the journey continues as we search for a treatment or cure .

But in the meantime , Mandy is beginning a career in motivational speaking .

Of her doctors at the National Institutes of Health she says : `` They are like my family too , and I get excited about seeing them . NIH , or ` the House of Hope , ' is just that .

`` A place for families to find hope , just like we did . ''
