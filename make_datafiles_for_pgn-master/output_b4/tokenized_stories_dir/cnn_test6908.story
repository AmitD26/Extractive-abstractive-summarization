NEW DELHI , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While many now recognize the scientific explanation for a solar eclipse , the phenomenon is still marked with tradition and sometimes suspicion in Hindu-majority India .

People test the `` sky watching telescope '' at the Gujarat Council of Science City in India .

The `` exceptionally long '' eclipse that will cross half the planet Wednesday will be able to be seen by virtually all of the population of China and India .

For beggars in India , the occasion means an extra day of receiving alms and food .

The panhandler in Sandeep Jaggi 's neighborhood normally visits the block every week on Tuesdays and Saturdays , as well as the days of a new and full moon .

And because his patrons mark an eclipse with alms-giving , prayers and bathing , he rarely misses the chance to meet them on this day as well .

`` It 's a family tradition and I follow it , '' says 34-year-old Jaggi . He will fill the beggar 's small steel pail with mustard oil and coins and his disheveled sash with lentils .

For others in the country , the eclipse is not a reason to celebrate , but a more ominous phenomenon . Send us your photos of the eclipse

Most pregnant women hope to avoid giving birth during an eclipse .

`` None of the expectant mothers under my treatment are willing to have deliveries on Wednesday , '' Shivani Sachdev Gour , a gynecologist at New Delhi 's Fortis La Femme hospital , told CNN .

In fact , there are critically ill patients who do not want to be in the hospital on the day of the eclipse , she said .

Indian astrologers even advise expectant mothers to stay indoors when this celestial event occurs .

`` It may not cause any physical harm to the baby , but it may affect the child 's overall personality , '' said R.K. Sharma , who describes himself as a `` remedial astrologer . ''

A solar eclipse , he says , weakens the sun god temporarily because of an encounter with dragon Rahu and leaves some cascading results everywhere .

`` Bathing in holy rivers and ponds during this time thus helps protect health and develop positivism and greater will power , '' he explained .

About 1.5 million people are expected at one such pond -- the Brahmsarovar , or the pool of Hindu god Brahma -- in northern India on Wednesday .

`` They offer prayers to the sun god and take holy dips during an eclipse , '' said Ashok Kumar Bansal , the sub-divisional magistrate of Kurukshetra , an ancient Hindu city .

But the century 's longest total solar eclipse is not just about the dragon-sun combat , it also means business for some .

Travel firms in India have plans in place to cash in on the phenomenon .

Cox and Kings India has a planeload of eclipse watchers heading for the eastern state of Bihar , one of the most preferred locations for sighting the event .

The plane will hover over Gaya in Bihar and return to New Delhi the same day , company spokesman Thomas C. Thottathil told CNN .

Passengers were given two options : to book a `` sunside '' seat facing the eclipse for about $ 1,640 , or reserve an `` earthside '' seat for about $ 610 , Thottathil added .

`` And it 's a sold out flight now ! '' he said .
