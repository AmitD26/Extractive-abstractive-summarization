WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of Muslims gathered Friday on Capitol Hill for a day of prayer that organizers said was intended to inspire American Muslims and non-Muslims alike .

People traveled from all over the United States to attend the Capitol Hill event , organizer Abdul Malik said .

`` America is not perfect , '' Abdul Malik , an organizer of the event called Islam on Capitol Hill , told the crowd .

`` But I will say something it took me my whole adult life to come to : America is not perfect , but I want to tell the truth : It is one of the best places in the world to live . ''

Organizers had hoped that 50,000 people would show up for the Friday afternoon prayer session , which took place at the foot of the U.S. Capitol .

There were also anti-Muslim protesters near the event .

Earlier , Malik said , `` This is not a protest , it is a day of prayer , of devotion , hoping that we can work ... for the betterment of the world community . ''

He added , `` We can come together and work together for the common good . ''

He said that Muslims in the United States have a `` unique responsibility '' and that the event seeks to inspire Muslims and all Americans .

`` America represents , still , a beacon of hope , '' he said .

Malik said conversations about the event began only a few months ago .

`` It 's amazing , '' he said . `` The Web site has gotten more than 3 million hits already . ''

Friday 's event was focused on a 1 p.m. prayer , and a reception and banquet were planned afterward .

Malik said attendees were traveling from all over the United States -- including Texas , Florida and Georgia -- as well as from other countries , such as Britain and Canada .

`` The beautiful thing ... about this , is that we have a good representation of the uniqueness and beauty of what Islam stands for , '' he said .

Besides the protesters , the event drew other criticism . Malik said he had received some `` very nasty e-mails . ''

And one Christian leader warned of a strategy to `` Islamize '' American society .

`` It is important for Christians to understand that Friday 's Muslim prayer initiative is part of a well-defined strategy to Islamize American society and replace the Bible with the Koran , the cross with the Islamic crescent and the church bells with the Athan -LSB- the Muslim call to prayer -RSB- , '' the Rev. Canon Julian Dobbs , leader of the Convocation of Anglicans in North America 's Church and Islam Project , said in a written statement .

`` The time has come for the American public to call Islam to account , '' he said .
