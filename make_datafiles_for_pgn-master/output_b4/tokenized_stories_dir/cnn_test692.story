WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Questions surrounding Judge Sonia Sotomayor 's past speeches generated more controversy in the final day of her Supreme Court confirmation hearings Thursday , as Democrats again called her a mainstream jurist and Republicans portrayed her as a liberal activist likely to legislate from the bench .

Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor greets Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , Thursday .

One GOP senator said Sotomayor 's most controversial speeches `` bug the hell out of me , '' an expression of frustration as Republicans tried -- with little success -- to get Sotomayor to reveal more about her personal views in her fourth and final day of questioning .

GOP critics also summoned New Haven , Connecticut , firefighter Frank Ricci , who was the lead plaintiff in perhaps the most controversial case in Sotomayor 's appellate career . Ricci testified that her 2008 rejection of his reverse discrimination claim had undermined the concept of a merit-based civil service system .

In a potential sign of Sotomayor 's strong political momentum , however , Senate Republicans indicated they do not intend to filibuster her nomination on the Senate floor . They also indicated their belief that the full Senate would vote on her nomination before breaking for its August recess .

Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , said he plans to put a confirmation vote for Sotomayor on the committee 's calendar for next Tuesday .

The committee 's questions once again touched on a range of hot-button issues , including gun control , abortion , same-sex marriage , the death penalty , and the role of international law in American jurisprudence .

`` I think you 're a walking , talking example of the best part of the United States of America , '' Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-California , told Sotomayor . `` It is my belief that you are going to be a great Supreme Court justice . ''

South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham was less complimentary , telling Sotomayor that she has `` said some things that have bugged the hell out of me , '' but he quickly conceded that her judicial record has `` been generally in the mainstream . ''

`` Your speeches are disturbing , particularly to conservatives , '' Graham said . `` Those speeches to me suggested gender and racial affiliations in a way that a lot of us wonder , will you take that line of thinking to the Supreme Court in these cases of first precedent . ''

But , Graham conceded , `` to be honest with you , your record as a judge has not been radical by any means . ... You have , I think , consistently , as an advocate , took a point of view that was left of center . ''

Graham defended the importance of probing Sotomayor 's political beliefs by highlighting the high court 's 1955 landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education , which mandated the desegregation of schools . The ruling was `` instructive in the sense that the court pushed the country to do something politicians were not brave enough to do , '' he said . Watch Graham talk about Sotomayor 's record ''

The personal views of Supreme Court justices matter , he argued , because `` you 're not going to find a law book that tells you '' how to rule on contentious social issues such as same-sex marriage or whether there is a `` fundamental '' right to bear arms .

Sotomayor later fired back at the Republican line of questioning , asking Sen. Tom Coburn , R-Oklahoma , if he wanted a judge who pre-decided cases before hearing the evidence and facts . Watch Sotomayor 's record on discrimination ''

`` Would you want a judge or nominee who came in here and said , ` I agree with you , this is unconstitutional , ' before I had a case before me ? '' Sotomayor said , adding : `` I do n't think that 's a justice I can be . ''

She noted that the Supreme Court spends considerable time on cases , including Second Amendment cases involving gun control -- an issue Republicans have repeatedly emphasized during her confirmation hearings .

The National Rifle Association , unswayed by Sotomayor 's assertion earlier in the week that she recognizes an individual right to bear arms , announced Thursday that it is opposed to her nomination .

`` We believe any individual who does not agree that the Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right and who does not respect our God-given right of self-defense should not serve on any court , much less the highest court in the land , '' said a joint statement by Wayne LaPierre , the NRA executive vice president , and Chris W. Cox , executive director of the NRA 's Institute for Legislative Reform .

Sotomayor repeatedly said she recognizes an individual right to firearms in the wake of the Supreme Court 's decision in the 2007 case District of Columbia v. Heller . The high court in that instance ruled that a sweeping handgun ban in the nation 's capital violated the constitutional right to `` keep and bear arms . ''

Sotomayor refused to say , however , whether she believed the right is `` fundamental , '' which in legal terms refers to whether a federal statute applies to the states .

On gun control , as in other issues , Sotomayor repeated that the Constitution and facts of the case would be the basis of her rulings .

The highly charged issue of affirmative action surfaced most prominently later in the day , when Frank Ricci testified before the committee .

Ricci was one of a group of 20 mostly white firefighters who sued the city of New Haven after the city threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions .

The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals -- including Sotomayor -- backed the city in the 2008 case Ricci v. DeStefano . The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court .

The `` belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed , '' Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee .

`` It only divides people who do n't wish to be divided along racial lines . The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics , discrimination , and nepotism . Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed . ''

Ricci also criticized the 2nd Circuit for disposing `` of our case in an unsigned , unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph . ''

Sotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke . She told committee members earlier in the week , however , that her ruling in the Ricci case was decided on the basis of `` a very thorough , 78-page decision by the district court '' and followed a firmly established precedent . Watch Ricci testify at hearings ''

The Supreme Court applied a new standard , she claimed , based on a different area of law . If she were ruling on that case today , she said , she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court .

Ricci was one of a long list of witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor .

Linda Chavez , head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity , which opposes affirmative action , argued that `` it is clear '' from Sotomayor 's record `` that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics . '' It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge , Chavez claimed , when she has `` shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her . ''

Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor 's behalf , arguing that her opinion in the Ricci was case , in fact , an example of judicial restraint . It followed a string of legal precedents , he claimed , dating back almost three decades .

FBI Director Louis Freeh and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also testified in favor of Sotomayor . Bloomberg told committee members that she is an `` independent jurist '' with `` sharp and agile mind '' who would bring `` a wealth of unique experience '' to the high court .

Committee Republicans , unswayed by such assertions , once again examined Sotomayor 's controversial statement that a `` wise Latina '' could reach a better decision than a white man .

Asked what she would say to people offended by her remarks , Sotomayor said that she regrets that she has `` offended some people . I believe that my life demonstrates that that was not my intent to leave the impression that some have taken from my words . ''

Sotomayor was also asked to explain her remarks from a 2001 speech in which she said she agreed that `` there is no objective stance but only a series of perspectives -- no neutrality , no escape from choice in judging . ''

She told the committee that , in every case , the two opposing parties view the facts from vastly different perspectives . `` You ca n't just throw up your hands and say I 'm not going to rule , '' she said . There is a choice in judging , which means `` you have to rule . ''
