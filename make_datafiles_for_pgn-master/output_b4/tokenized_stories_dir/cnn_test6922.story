NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of America 's pre-eminent political power couples made a rare joint appearance Friday , when Bill and Hillary Clinton took the stage at the former president 's Clinton Global Initiative conference .

Bill Clinton says his wife Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the `` best public service our family has ever produced . ''

`` I want to begin by expressing my extreme indebtedness to the Clinton Global Initiative , to all of you who participated , for giving me the first chance I have had in a week to see Hillary , '' Bill Clinton told the audience of social activists and business leaders at the closing session of CGI , a week-long conference designed to find solutions to global problems through public and private partnerships .

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was at the session to unveil a new State Department initiative on food security .

As he introduced her , the former president was effusive in his praise for his wife , saying that her approach to food security -- helping farmers around the world grow their own food to earn income and alleviate poverty -- was much smarter than the decades-long policy of simply giving humanitarian aid and food to countries .
