New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The teen who mysteriously turned up in New York with apparent amnesia emptied her bank account and left behind `` everything '' before she left her home in Washington , police told CNN .

The woman , now identified as Kacie Aleece Peterson , 18 , of Hansville , Washington , withdrew about $ 400 from her Bank of America account , said Scott Wilson , spokesman for the Kitsap County Sheriff 's Office in Washington .

But Peterson `` left everything , '' including her wallet , identification , cell phone , clothes and even her bike , which was secured outside a Wal-Mart , Wilson said .

Police still do not know how Peterson traveled cross-country to New York City .

The woman mysteriously turned up in Manhattan two weeks ago , claiming to have no memory of her family , her home -- or even her own name .

There 's no indication that she 's feigning her memory loss , said Paul Browne , deputy commissioner of the New York Police Department .

At the same time , because Peterson is an adult , authorities have not ruled out the theory that she left home to re-establish herself elsewhere , Wilson said .

The teen 's father , Henry Peterson of Colville , Washington , told Kitsap County authorities his daughter had occasional memory lapses , Wilson said .

In May , Kacie Peterson was found lying on the ground next to a creek at the family farm , Wilson said . She had blacked out and did not remember who she was , he said . Kacie Peterson was briefly hospitalized after the incident , he said .

Her father also told investigators that in another incident his daughter was found unconscious on her bedroom floor , Wilson said .

Henry Peterson reported his daughter missing on October 2 , Wilson said , after the family friend she lived with told him that the last time she saw Kacie Peterson was September 30 . Kacie Peterson moved in June from eastern Washington with her father to western Washington to live with a friend of her mother , who died when she was 7 , Wilson said . Henry Peterson told police he agreed to the transition , Wilson said .

The teen 's father described their relationship as `` difficult '' and `` that he had put too much pressure on his daughter to do well and get good grades , '' Wilson said .

Kacie Peterson , a high school senior , started anew at Kingston High School in Kingston , Washington , but only attended for three weeks , said Chris Case , director of community relations for North Kitsap school district . Enrolled in the Running Start program there , Kacie Peterson had two advanced placement classes at the school and also classes at Olympic College in Poulsbo , about 10 miles away , Case said .

Kingston high school officials said Kacie Peterson was quiet , shy and that `` she had no friends , '' Wilson said .

The last time she showed up for class was on September 29 , Case said .

The next time some employees of the school saw the student she was sporting a new look .

`` The school here is telling me she had long hair past her shoulders , '' Case said . In the photo New York police showed of the teen during their investigation to identify her , Kacie Peterson had hair that looked only about a couple of inches long on top and tapered low on the sides .

Police asked for help identifying the teen after she was found in midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. on October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter . The organization had said she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility .

A security guard for the shelter noticed her walking around on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her . Finding her unresponsive , he called police .

Officers interviewed her , but it became clear that she could n't provide authorities with any information about herself .

A photo of the then-unidentified woman aired on CNN , and a viewer in Maryland who was familiar with Kacie Peterson alerted authorities . Police established a positive identification .

Police say they do not know how she lost her memory .

She is still in New York and receiving care from the city agency , Browne said .
