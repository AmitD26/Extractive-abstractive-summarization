Tehran , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tehran 's Revolutionary Court sentenced 11 people to death after convicting them of participating in post-election riots , state media reported Thursday .

Two of the sentences have been carried out ; the rest are under appeal , the Iranian Students News Agency said , quoting a court official .

These are the first executions known to be related to the post-election violence that erupted across Iran in June and has continued since , Amnesty International said in a statement condemning the hangings .

But a lawyer for one of the men executed on Thursday disputed a key part of the official report .

`` Both of these men were arrested two months before the elections and they were in prison until their sentences were carried out . So how can someone who 's in prison take part in protests ? '' asked Nasrin Sotoudeh , a Tehran-based human rights lawyer who represented Arash Rahmanipour , one of two men hanged Thursday .

His father had been scheduled to visit Rahmanipour on the day of the execution , and learned only from a TV report that his son was dead , Sotoudeh said , describing the family as `` extremely upset and shocked . ''

`` Arash called his home two nights ago -LRB- Tuesday night -RRB- -- two nights before the sentence was carried out , and at that point Arash had no idea that his sentence was about to be carried out , '' she said .

She said the hanging violated Iranian law .

`` The entire process , the investigation , the trial , the handing down of the sentence and the carrying out of the sentence , were done illegally and in secret , '' she told CNN by phone . `` Arash 's family and I did not have his case file . A sentence must first be announced to the defendant and his lawyer and only then can it be carried out , but this sentence was never announced to Arash or myself . ''

She said he had been forced to confess .

`` He told me his pregnant sister had been arrested , too , '' she said . `` In two sessions where he was interrogated , they placed his sister in front of him and told him if he wanted to see her free he had to admit to things he did n't do . ''

Rahmanipour 's sister was later released from prison but lost the baby due to stress , Sotoudeh said .

Rahmanipour , 20 , was charged with being a mohareb , or enemy of God , and being a member of Anjoman-e Padeshahi-e Iran -LRB- API -RRB- , a banned anti-regime monarchist group , his lawyer said .

Amnesty International condemned the execution of Rahmanipour and the other man executed Thursday , Mohammad Reza Ali-Zamani .

`` These men were first unfairly convicted and now they have been unjustly killed . It is not even clear they had links to this group , as their ` confessions ' appear to have been made under duress , '' said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui , Amnesty International 's Middle East and North Africa deputy director .

The court said the defendants were convicted of `` waging war against God , trying to overthrow the Islamic government '' and membership in armed and anti-revolutionary groups .

Anti-government demonstrations began after the disputed June 12 presidential vote , which re-elected hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over main opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi .

Late December marked the deadliest clashes in Iran since initial protests broke out in the summer .

At least seven people were killed and hundreds were arrested , witnesses said , as they took to the streets on Ashura , which occurred on December 27 .

The Iranian government has denied that its security forces killed anyone and has blamed reformists for the violence .
