-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A slightly higher number of Americans will travel Thanksgiving holiday weekend compared with last year , but those traveling by air is expected to decline , AAA said .

The association , which surveyed 1,350 American households , projects that 38.4 million Americans will travel over the holiday weekend , up from 37.8 million last year .

However , the number traveling by air is expected to decline to 2.3 million , the automobile association said . In 2008 , 2.5 million Americans traveled by plane for Thanksgiving .

`` We do this every year , '' said Mindy Potter of Atlanta , Georgia , who was flying with her husband and 6-year-old son . `` It 's insanity every year . ''

Potter said she and her family were headed Wednesday to Hot Springs Village , Arkansas , to see her husband 's family .

She said they were allowing themselves plenty of time at the airport . `` My husband 's a stickler for going early , '' she said . `` If I was in charge of it , we 'd probably have a frenzied rush . ''

AAA said the slight increase in the number of Thanksgiving travelers from last year reflects improved consumer confidence as well as `` a growing sense among many consumers that the worst of the global economic crisis is behind us . ''

Travelers are still concerned about the economy , said AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom , and the numbers remain well down from two years ago .

`` Clearly , there was a huge drop-off in the number of people traveling last year , '' he said . According to the association , Thanksgiving travel dropped 25.2 percent last year , compared with 2007 .

Still , Sundstrom added , `` We are encouraged that the numbers have stabilized and turning up from what they were a year ago . ''

The bulk of Thanksgiving travelers -- about 33.2 million -- will be traveling by car , AAA said .

Jennifer Burrell of Tucker , Georgia , said she , her husband and their two daughters were driving Thursday morning to the Asheville , North Carolina , area , and will return Sunday .

She said she was n't expecting traffic on the way there but `` it always gets heavy '' on the return trip .

In addition to those traveling by car , some 2.9 million will travel by train , watercraft , bus or a combination of transportation modes , and 2.3 million will travel by air , the automobile association predicted .

Citing excess baggage fees and surcharges for jet fuel , along with delays and flight groundings , Sundstrom said that it 's `` not a very friendly environment this decade for the airline industry or the airline traveler . ''

As in earlier years , the Federal Aviation Administration said military airspace will be opened to commercial flights along the East and West coasts and in the Southwest in an attempt to alleviate congestion .

The airspace will be opened from Tuesday to Monday , spokesman Paul Takemoto said .

As of Tuesday afternoon , the FAA Web site was reporting slight delays because of `` weather/wind '' at New York 's LaGuardia Airport .

Of course , some Americans are not traveling at all .

Heather McKinnon of Broomfield , Colorado , said she is staying home with family for Thanksgiving .

`` I do n't like to fly and really rarely like flying on holidays , '' she said , adding that she would consider driving .

`` I know what it 's like going through the airport , '' she said . Plus , she added , `` Everything I love is here . ''
