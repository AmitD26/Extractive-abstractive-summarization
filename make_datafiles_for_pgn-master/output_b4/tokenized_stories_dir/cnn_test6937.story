-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Environmental saviors can turn up in the most unexpected places . For the answer to our global waste management crisis , we need only look as far as our back gardens , for example .

Forty million manure worms are being put to use in Sydney to treat its sewage .

That 's what proponents of vermicomposting will tell us , anyway . Vermicomposting is the art of composting using worms -- and it is worms , apparently , who could save us yet .

Worms are nature 's waste disposal units . Or rather , it is more accurate to call them waste renewal units , as they do n't simply consume the waste -- they turn it into something far more useful : nutrient-rich compost .

Earthworms are by any definition incredible creatures -- particularly , in this context : The Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus rubellus , which are the two breeds of worm commonly used in vermicomposting , according to CityFarmer.org . Not only can they eat their own body weight in organic waste every day , but they actually remove -- or neutralize -- many of the toxins in that waste in the process , according to The Ecologist .

There are a lot of them , too . You will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land , according to NatureWatch , their population doubling in size every one-two months . And they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves , stems and dead roots in one year , ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process .

What they end up producing is ready-to-go plant soluble nutrients . According to NatureWatch , earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen , seven times as much phosphorous , 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more `` beneficial bacteria '' than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place . Literally speaking , what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out .

Utilizing ` black gold '

It is no surprise why these worms ' byproducts are often referred to as `` black gold , '' this knowledge being particularly pertinent at a time when nearly 40 percent of the world 's agricultural soil has become `` seriously degraded , '' according to the UK Soil Association .

Worm compost :

Just one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days , according to ScienceDaily . And plants love it . Research has shown that plant yields experience a significant boost from vermicomposting , by as much as 40 percent for broccoli , 80 percent for tomatoes and as much as 259 percent for carrots , according to The Ecologist .

According to the World Waste Survey , compiled by Veolia Environmental Services , we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste in 2004 . And a high proportion of that waste was organic matter which could have been composted . Around 32 percent of the European Union 's annual municipal waste -LRB- around 120 million tons -RRB- is food and garden waste , according to Waste Management World . And 30 percent of U.S. waste could have been composted in 2000 , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- -- representing 92 million tons of organic waste that otherwise sat rotting on a landfill , emitting methane into the atmosphere .

As local governments and companies grapple with the issue of how to safely dispose of waste , vermicomposting is finding new fans -- some in unusual places . In Hong Kong , none other than fast-food chain McDonald 's has signed up to a vermicomposting program that will have 80 million worms feasting on between 50 and 200 tons of organic waste a day , according to the Reuters news service . McDonald 's aims to decrease the amount of waste it sends to Hong Kong 's rapidly filling landfills by 80 percent , Reuters reports .

Other companies to have experimented with worm composting include Ikea in the U.S. state of Illinois , where , according to Treehugger.com , it is conducting vermicomposting trials . If all goes well , it aims to use worm composting to boost its 70 percent recycling rates to 90 percent , the site says .

As it happens , we have had this knowledge for centuries . Aristotle himself was even said to have called worms the `` intestines of the soil , '' according to The New York Times , which also points out that Cleopatra was another devotee , bestowing sacred status on them and ordering them protected . Charles Darwin admired their land-tilling abilities so much that he wrote a book on them . `` It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world as have these lowly organized creatures , '' he mused , according to The New York Times .

Greenhouse gas emitters

What Darwin , Cleopatra or Aristotle could not have known however , is that worms could also have the potential to save us from toxic waste .

Scientists in India have found that worms ' digestive systems and regenerative abilities are so remarkable that they can actually absorb toxic materials yet expel toxic-free manure . According to the Indian newspaper , India Together , researchers in Gujarat have found that worms can `` detox '' the organic parts of the industrial sludge which results from the effluent treatment of industrial or hazardous waste .

The method is ideal for industries -- such as paper , food processing , oil , textiles , dairy , distilleries and agro-chemicals -- where there is large enough organic components in the industrial sludge , Indian researchers say .

But even with vermicomposting , something that looks like one of the most environmentally sound ideas around , there 's a downside -- and it 's a rather large one .

It turns out that worms used in composting emit a greenhouse gas -- nitrous oxide -- which is hundreds of times more powerful than carbon dioxide . Unfortunately , in terms of greenhouse gas emissions , large-scale composting plants could be just as damaging to the environment as landfills of the same size , reports the UK 's Telegraph newspaper .

`` The emissions that come from these worms can actually be 290 times more potent than carbon dioxide and 20 times more potent than methane , '' the Telegraph quotes Jim Frederickson , an Open University research fellow .
