-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Cervelo 's Xavier Tondo won the toughest stage of this year 's Paris-Nice cycling classic as Alejandro Valverde finished second to ratchet up the pressure on race leader and their fellow Spaniard Alberto Contador .

It was the biggest victory of Tondo 's fledgling career and reward for a solo break with just under 40 km remaining of the 220 km ride from Peynier to Tourrettes-super-Loup .

The whittled down chasing bunch closed fast in the final kilometers but Tondo had five seconds to spare with Valverde leading the charge to claim six bonus seconds .

It left him 14 seconds adrift of reigning Tour de France champion Contador ahead of a difficult final day in the south of France .

Young Slovakian Peter Sagan , who claimed his second stage win of the race in dramatic style pm Friday , finished third to retain the green jersey of points leader .

Tondo was delighted to win in his debut year for Cervelo , with his main duties this season set to be as a helper for Carlos Sastre in the Giro d'Italia and other major tours .

He felt he was ready to challenge on Friday , but suffered bad luck with a mechanical problem , dropping over two minutes to lose his chance for the overall crown .

`` It gave me a chance to go in the breakaway today and I felt very good on the climb , '' he told the official Web site www.letour.fr .

`` It 's incredible for me , in my first year with Cervelo . It 's my 10th victory as a pro , but in the past I only rode for small teams , '' he added .

Sunday 's final leg is a 119 km stage based around Nice with several tough climbs where Contador has predicted he will seal his final victory .

Meanwhile , last year 's winner Michele Scarponi claimed the fourth stage of the Tirreno-Adriatico to take the overall lead .

Scarponi was in a small elite group who forged clear about 4 km from the finish of the 243-km route from San Gemini to Chieti .

He now leads Benoit Vaugrenard of France by 18 seconds in the overall classification .
