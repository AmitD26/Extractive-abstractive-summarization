LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If treating heroin addicts by giving them heroin seems counterintuitive , having the government fund that addiction to the tune of more than $ 22,000 per patient per year comes across as downright radical .

A heroin addict identified as Sarah says the program had an almost immediate affect on her life .

A newly released British study , however , found that daily heroin injections given to hard-to-treat addicts as part of a comprehensive program succeeded in treating those addicts and reducing crime . The use of street heroin was reduced by three quarters and the crimes committed trying to get drugs were cut by two-thirds , the study found .

`` The intensity of the program is quite striking , '' said John Strang , who led the research team at Britain 's National Addiction Centre , associated with King 's College in London . `` The bond that is formed and the commitment that 's established between the patient coming in for treatment and the staff is far greater than you would ever ordinarily see . ''

Taking heroin off the streets seems to be making a difference . Researchers injected heroin in a safe , stable environment at medically supervised clinics . They crucially paired that with intensive counseling and addiction treatment .

The researchers reported that benefits were evident just six weeks into treatment among users who had failed at other kinds of treatment .

One of those participants was `` Sarah , '' who said that after coping with her addiction for more than 20 years , she lost hope that anything would work . Watch Sarah describe the program ''

Sarah described how the program had an almost immediate affect on her life . She said she was able to keep a schedule , stop buying drugs on the street and gain an appreciation of what her life could be like if she was n't so consumed by getting high .

`` You 'll always be an addict basically ; it 's about managing it and leading a positive life '' said Sarah , adding , `` It quickly became , well , I actually do want to stop . I do n't really want to have to stick needles in me all my life . ''

Her biggest fear now is that the program will be cut or shut down if the government deems it too controversial .

Another patient , who asked to be identified as `` Emma , '' said , `` The morality of it was taken out of the question . I was n't being condemned for it and at last I could start taking responsibility in a rational way . ''

Emma described being chaotic , confused , emaciated and always dreaming about her next fix . By contrast , she said , the program made her feel cared for , supported and , above all , confident that she could kick the heroin habit .

`` This thing that was the meaning of your life is becoming the thing that is getting in the way of your life and it becomes very unattractive , '' she said .

Strang said the stubborn nature of heroin addiction is proof that getting addicts into treatment is really a shallow achievement , because many will eventually turn to drugs again . He believes this promising approach could change the way hard-to-treat addicts are treated and convince the government that the initial high cost offers good value .

`` From the cost point of view , if you actually look at the bigger picture , cheap treatment is n't always good treatment . If cheap treatment does n't deliver any benefit then it 's particularity bad value , '' Strang said .

The reduction in crime found by the study mirrors results in a handful of studies in other countries .

The treatment is relatively expensive , about $ 22,000 per patient , per year . But in Britain many are coming to terms with the fact that keeping a person in prison can cost three times that .

If the encouraging results continue , Britain could one day set up permanent clinics around the country , dispensing heroin for its most hard-to-treat addicts .
