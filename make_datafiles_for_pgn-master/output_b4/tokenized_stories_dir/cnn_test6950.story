-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities believe that a registered sex offender who this month admitted killing two California teenagers attempted to follow an 11-year-old girl walking home from school the day before one of the teens disappeared , according to documents filed in the case .

John Albert Gardner , 31 , pleaded guilty April 16 to killing Chelsea King , 17 , and Amber Dubois , 14 . He also pleaded guilty to a charge of assault with intent to commit rape in a December incident involving a third woman .

King was last seen leaving Poway High School in suburban San Diego , California , on February 25 . Her car , with her cell phone inside , was found at Rancho Bernardo Community Park . King was known to run on the park 's trails . Her disappearance triggered a massive search that ended a few days later , when King 's remains were found in the park .

Dubois disappeared in February 2009 while walking to school in Escondido , California . She was considered a missing person for more than a year until her remains were found in March . Prosecutors said Gardner led police to Dubois ' body after being assured that it would not be used against him in court .

Gardner avoided the death penalty with his guilty plea but will be sentenced June 1 to two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole , under terms of the plea deal with prosecutors .

On February 24 , a day before King went missing , an 11-year-old girl reported that she was walking home from school when she heard a vehicle slowly approaching her from behind , according to an affidavit requesting a police search of Gardner 's home , posted on the website of CNN affiliate KTLA-TV . The documents were unsealed Monday , KTLA reported .

The girl told police the vehicle drove past her and then parked about 30 feet in front of her , the documents said . The driver stayed in the vehicle , the girl said , and did not attempt to speak to her . But a woman pulled up next to the girl and told her the person in the vehicle `` seemed very suspicious '' and offered to follow her home , according to the affidavit .

The man , who was in a black car , then made a U-turn and left , and the woman followed the girl the remaining two blocks to her house , the documents said . The girl 's mother called police after her daughter told her what happened .

The girl 's mother told authorities that after seeing a photo of Gardner following his arrest in the King case , her daughter said Gardner was `` the guy in the car , '' the affidavit said . Gardner 's girlfriend drives a black 2002 Nissan Sentra , according to the documents .

The documents also detail the December assault on the third woman near where King 's car was found at the park . She told authorities she was on a hiking trail and a man walked past her , the affidavit said . She told him , `` Good morning , '' and he returned the greeting , but then tackled her from the side as he passed her , knocking her to the ground on her back .

The man pinned her to the ground , and she screamed while struggling with him , the affidavit said . He told her to `` shut up , '' and she said , `` You 're going to have to kill me . ''

`` That can be arranged , '' he responded . The man then demanded money from her , the affidavit said .

She was able to sit up and used her elbow to strike him in the nose , telling police she felt `` the crunch of cartilage . '' The man let go of her and grabbed his nose , she said , and she ran .

A woman also told police that she saw Gardner on the jogging trails near the park on the day King disappeared , the affidavit said . She said he was sitting and drinking a beer and had several empty beer cans around him . He warned her about a rattlesnake that was nearby , and they spoke briefly .

The woman said she ran past the man and then talked to him some more on her return trip . The man was wearing blue jeans and a Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt , she said , according to the affidavit .

A second woman also recalled seeing a man in the Hard Rock Cafe shirt on a trail that day about 3 p.m. , about an hour and a half after the first woman said she saw him , the affidavit said . The same woman believes she saw King on the trail as well . Both women told police they were 100 percent sure the man they saw was Gardner , the affidavit said .

The area where the second woman recalled seeing Gardner was `` 300 yards from where the panties of Chelsea King were found and about a mile from where the body of Chelsea King was found , '' the affidavit said .

At the time of his arrest , Gardner was a registered sex offender . In 2000 he was convicted of two counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14 and a count of false imprisonment , according to a probation officer 's report . The victim in that case was a 13-year-old girl , who was molested and beaten when she tried to resist , the report said .

`` The defendant ... manifests marked predatory traits and is not seen as a suitable candidate for sex offender treatment insofar as he refuses to accept any responsibility for what he has done , '' according to the 2000 report .

Gardner knew the girl and was a former neighbor of hers , the report said . `` The fact that he would try to force himself on her sexually is indefensible but then to beat her as he did out of frustration ... represents a qualitative leap to extremely serious criminal behavior . ''

The report recommended that Gardner be sentenced to six years in prison . KTLA reported that he served five years before being paroled .
