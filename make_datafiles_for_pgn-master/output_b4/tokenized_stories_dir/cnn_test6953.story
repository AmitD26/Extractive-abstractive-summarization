-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- During a recent commencement address at Hampton University in Virginia , Barack Obama described the way today 's internet-powered media environment `` bombards us with all kinds of content . ''

He warned students that iPads , Xboxes , and other popular digital gadgets can turn information into `` a distraction , a diversion , a form of entertainment '' rather than a means `` of empowerment . ''

As soon as the president 's remarks were made public , knees began jerking throughout the blogosphere .

One online pundit said that Obama sounded `` like a grumpy old man . '' Another suggested that in criticizing technology he was acting like an `` old fogy . '' Even the normally restrained Economist magazine rushed out an editorial accusing Obama of `` technophobia '' and `` Luddism . ''

By the reaction , you would have thought our BlackBerry-toting president had called for a return to horse-drawn carriages , outhouses , and whalebone corsets .

Instead of drawing ridicule , Obama 's words should have drawn our attention -- and our concern .

Over the past decade , most of us have been dramatically ratcheting up the time we spend surfing the web , exchanging electronic messages , and hanging out in social networks like Facebook and MySpace . At the same time , we 've been showering our kids with laptops , iPods , PlayStations and smartphones .

The average American today spends more than eight hours a day peering into a screen -- TV , computer , or cell phone -- and the average teen sends or receives well over 2,000 text messages a month .

But even as we 've been enjoying the seemingly endless bounties of the net , neurobiologists and psychologists have been carrying out studies which suggest that the way we gather information online impedes comprehension , weakens understanding , and in general hinders learning .

Worse yet , the ill effects of heavy web use appear to continue to afflict us even when we turn our computers off .

The cognitive penalties can be particularly severe for students . In one revealing experiment , researchers at Cornell University divided a class into two groups . One group was allowed to use their laptop computers to surf the web during a lecture . The other group attended the same lecture but had to keep their computers closed .

Immediately afterward , the students took a test measuring how well they remembered the lecture 's content . The students who used their laptops performed significantly worse on the exam . It did n't matter , moreover , whether they surfed sites related to the subject of the lecture or unrelated sites . All the surfers performed relatively poorly .

Other researchers have found that students who read text with hyperlinks , as you routinely find online , end up with a weaker understanding of the material than students who read the same text in a traditional , linear format , as you 'd find in a printed book .

Each link appears to act as a little distraction , breaking the reader 's concentration . As the number of links mounts , comprehension diminishes further .

The multitude of messages and other bits of information that the Web fires at us , from emails to tweets to Facebook updates , have also been found to interrupt our thoughts in a way that impedes the formation of memories and the building of knowledge . The more information we juggle , the less able we are to make sense of it all .

Last year , a team of Stanford researchers reported that heavy media multitaskers have trouble concentrating even when they 're not online . They 're considerably less able , for example , to distinguish important information from trivial information than are people who engage in multitasking less frequently .

`` Everything distracts them , '' one of the researchers said of the heavy multitaskers .

Patricia Greenfield , a leading developmental psychologist who teaches at UCLA , warned in a 2009 Science article that a growing body of scientific evidence indicates that spending a lot of time with computers , smartphones , and other such devices weakens people 's ability to think deeply , critically , and creatively .

As we rush around the web gathering little pieces of information , we seem to be training our brains to be quick but superficial .

Only a curmudgeon would deny the many benefits that our computers and electronic networks have brought us . The internet and related technologies have made it much easier to stay in touch with friends and family members , to discover interesting and useful information , to express ourselves , and to collaborate with others .

Since the World Wide Web was invented two decades ago , we have been celebrating these benefits -- and rightly so . But we 've been paying much less attention to the negative consequences of our online lives .

The time has come for us to take a more balanced view of the net , looking at its costs as well as its benefits . That 's particularly true when it comes to educating our children . Sticking a kid in front of a computer screen is probably not the best way encourage the development of a strong , creative , and supple mind .

As President Obama implied , information should be a source not of distraction but of enlightenment .

As important as it is to be able to find lots of information quickly , what 's even more important is to be able to think deeply about the information once we 've found it . We need to slow down .
