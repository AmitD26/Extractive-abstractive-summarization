Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan 's confirmation hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded Thursday with witnesses for and against the solicitor general , including former military members who slammed her handling of military recruiters on the Harvard University campus .

Twenty four witnesses testified about President Barack Obama 's pick to replace the retiring Justice John Paul Stevens on the high court . Kagan herself was not there , having concluded her participation in the committee 's hearing Wednesday after three days of testimony .

Democratic senators have openly predicted Kagan would win confirmation as the 112th high court justice , perhaps by the end of July . Her addition to the high court would mean the nine-member panel would include three women for the first time .

The 50-year old Kagan has come under criticism from Republican senators who say that as dean of Harvard Law School , she actively tried to block military recruiters because of the Pentagon 's `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy that bars openly gay and lesbians from military service .

`` Dean Kagan 's clearly unlawful actions estranged the campus , '' said former U.S. Army Capt. Flagg Youngblood . He called Kagan 's actions `` double dealing , '' and a `` condescension to the American rule of law that harmed the interests of the military . ''

Youngblood attended Yale University as an ROTC member , and is now director of military outreach for conservative Young America 's Foundation

Capt. Pete Hegseth of the Army National Guard said Kagan `` encouraged students to oppose and protest the presence of military recruiters on campus . '' Hegseth now heads the private group Vets for Freedom .

The nominee and the White House have strongly defended her actions , saying that while she opposed the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy , Kagan never kept recruiters off the university and never sought to sidestep the law .

Another former military member invited by Republican senators to testify did not appear . Retired Gen. Jerry Boykin , who has been criticized for speeches comparing the war on terror as a Christian fight against Satan and suggesting Muslims worship idols , was disinvited by committee Republicans earlier this week .

`` Although General Boykin 's prior comments concerning the war on terror are unrelated to his scheduled testimony on Dean Kagan 's nomination , it is clear that these comments would be used to distract from the very important issues surrounding Ms. Kagan 's actions at Harvard Law School , '' said Stephen Boyd , spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama , the committee 's ranking Republican .

As Harvard Law School dean , Kagan supported other schools challenging a federal law -- known as the Solomon Amendment -- requiring that recruiters be given equal access or face the loss of federal funding . The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the law on March 6 , 2006 .

Just four months after taking the job as Harvard 's dean , in October 2003 , Kagan offered students her thoughts in a campus-wide e-mail , saying that to give recruiters equal access to the campus `` causes me deep distress . ''

`` I abhor the military 's discriminatory recruitment policy , '' she said then , calling it `` a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order . ''

Kagan received support Thursday from the head of the Harvard Law Armed Forces Association , Capt. Kurt White . Still a student at the Ivy League school , White told lawmakers he saw firsthand Kagan 's support of veterans and the military .

Her outreach and graciousness `` made a big difference in the lives of the small group of us veterans , '' said White , who was critical of other military members that opposed Kagan 's nomination .

Among other witnesses invited by the Senate committee 's Democratic majority were two people who sued their employers , claiming age and sex discrimination on the job .

Lilly Ledbetter said she hoped Kagan would be a sympathetic ear to those who bring legitimate workplace suits .

`` I learned who is on the Supreme Court makes all the difference , '' she said .

The onetime tire company manager alleged she was paid less than her male counterparts for equal work about two decades , but did not find out about the discrimination until she was about to retire . The high court in 2007 ruled against her , saying existing federal law did not allow such lawsuits to be filed so late . Most workers had 180 days to file a claim after the first discriminatory pay decision .

Obama , in the first bill he signed when taking office in January 2009 , enacted the Lily Ledbetter Act . It nullified the high court decision , and said every new paycheck received over the years based on a discriminatory act -- regardless of when the first discrimination occurred -- would extend the statute of limitations 180 days .

`` If one more person like -LRB- liberal -RRB- Justice -LRB- Ruth Bader -RRB- Ginsburg or Justice Stevens were on the court , '' Ledbetter said , `` then my case would have turned out differently . ''

Jack Gross lost his Supreme Court appeal last year , after he alleged he was a victim of age discrimination when he was passed over for a promotion . He criticized the current conservative court for reading federal laws in a way that makes it more difficult for people like him to claim wrongdoing by employers .

Other witnesses included leaders of advocacy groups on opposite sides on the abortion rights debate . A number of notable legal conservatives also voiced contrasting views of Kagan 's qualifications .

Jack Goldsmith was hired by Kagan in 2004 to be a law professor , and said Kagan showed her openness by hiring several right-leaning faculty members at a campus with a liberal reputation .

The American Bar Association told lawmakers why it gave Kagan its highest `` well qualified '' rating , following a detailed evaluation of her to be a justice .

`` Almost all of the experienced , dedicated and knowledgeable sitting judges , former solicitors general from both parties , legal scholars from top law schools across the country , and lawyers who have worked with or against the nominee in government or court , describe the nominee as outstanding in all respects and cite specific evidence in support of that view , '' said Kim Askew , who coordinated the ABA evaluation panel .
