WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sen. Arlen Specter woke at 4 a.m. one day last week with an excruciating headache , a side effect of chemotherapy . Ninety minutes later , he was on the squash court , playing a partner less than half his age . That 's the way Specter faces cancer and chemo . Borrowing a phrase from Winston Churchill , he calls it the `` never-give-in '' approach .

Sen. Arlen Specter on May 7 , early in his chemotherapy for Hodgkin 's disease .

As he battles a recurrence of Hodgkin 's disease , Specter , 78 , a Pennsylvania Republican , plays squash nearly every day , as he has for decades . He calls the games `` deposits in the health bank . '' He also continues his rigorous work schedule .

`` Doc , '' he told CNN 's Dr. Sanjay Gupta , `` I do n't have time to think about Hodgkin 's . ''

Hodgkin 's disease is a rare but curable form of lymphoma . But the treatment feels , as Specter puts it , `` like a war of the worlds raging inside your body . ''

Early this month , just after CNN was granted exclusive access to follow Specter 's treatment , his colleagues would stop him in Senate hallways to tell him how good he looked . He would always fire back : `` In a few days , I 'll be thin and pale and bald . '' Watch Dr. Gupta 's behind-the-scenes coverage of Specter 's battle with cancer ''

His prediction is already coming true as he reaches the halfway point in his three-month-long regimen of weekly chemotherapy .

Specter has been through one major health crisis after another over the past 30 years .

At age 48 , he was told he had Lou Gehrig 's disease , an incurable degenerative condition . Several months passed before he was told that the diagnosis was wrong and that a mild case of childhood polio had produced a false positive .

Then , in 1993 , Specter was told that he had a cancerous brain tumor and had just a few weeks to live . Another misdiagnosis . The tumor was benign and safely removed . It returned three years later and was removed again .

Two years after that , in 1998 , he had heart bypass surgery , after which he nearly died in the hospital . Watch more from Dr. Gupta and Specter ''

And then , in 2005 , after a stressful battle to win the powerful chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee , he began suffering from extreme exhaustion , fever and night sweats . Doctor after doctor told him he had a virus . Yet another misdiagnosis .

Finally , after several months , a blood test indicated something more serious . Specter had Hodgkin 's disease , a cancer of the lymphatic system that 's diagnosed in only about 7,500 patients in the United States each year . Specter 's was in the most advanced stage . He beat it . But it 's back .

Specter is 78 . But his oncologist , Dr. John Glick of the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania , stresses that chronological age is not the key determinant of how he 's treating Specter . Watch more on Specter 's treatment ''

Because of Specter 's physical conditioning and his mental attitude , Glick found the senator to be a strong candidate for aggressive treatment . `` The same treatment we would give somebody half his age , '' Glick said . Watch more from Dr. Glick ''

Specter 's continued hard work throughout treatment may be beneficial , his cardiologist says . Specter should `` keep on working as aggressively as he always has , says Dr. Howard Weitz of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . `` I think for the hard worker who ceases working , their stress level increases . '' Watch more from Dr. Weitz ''

When Specter learned that his Hodgkin 's had returned , it was a different shock '' from the first time , he said . `` I knew what to expect , and I thought to myself , ` Oh , for Christ 's sake , I have to do this again ? ... And I said to myself , ` Arlen , what is , is . You got it . ' And on Week Two , I was dealing with it . ''

Specter does not sugarcoat anything . Although he continues his squash routine , he notes that on the court `` my breath is much shorter , I 'm perspiring more , and I ca n't play as long . '' He adds , `` I think there 's a vitality in that which is healthy . '' And although he does n't cut back on work at all , he does retreat to his Senate hideaway office for extra naps .

And given all the misdiagnoses he 's been given in his life , he has one more piece of advice : `` Get a second opinion . ''
