-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fifteen years ago , representatives from every nation came together to voice one common goal : to advance the global status of women in the spirit of equality .

We were there in Beijing , China , when women broke their silence and a resounding message burst forth from the walls of the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women : No longer would it be acceptable to separate women 's rights from human rights .

Today , we are seeing a powerful momentum materialize as women in diverse regions raise their voices to claim their rights and inspire change while leading neighborhoods , villages , parliaments and nations forward .

As the world navigates through an unprecedented financial crisis , economists and leaders are increasingly turning their attention to the greatest untapped reserve of innovation and resilience -- women .

Progress on women 's equality is reaching different regions at different paces , but we can see improvement in girls ' education , workforce participation and political representation . The global net rate of primary school enrollment for girls is up to 89 percent ; the number of women holding nonagricultural , paid jobs continues to increase worldwide ; and women 's global share of parliamentary seats is rising , now at 18.4 percent .

Something much harder to measure , but maybe the most significant of all indicators , is a widespread shift over the past 15 years in the global conversation about women .

Our campaign for equality has come out from the darkness of the periphery . We are moving into an age that enables progress and an environment that sustains it .

For Rebecca Lolosoli , the light of change is an unsteady flicker . In her home in rural Samburu , Kenya , women who are abused or raped are cast out of their homes ; the concept of women 's rights is as novel as it is dangerous . She was beaten for raising her voice in dissent , kicked to the ground for promoting a woman 's right to live free of violence .

Out of injustice that sought to tear her down , she emerged as a courageous voice of change . Rebecca formed Umoja Uaso Women 's Village , a cooperative where once-forsaken survivors of violence find healing and independence as artisans who produce vibrant jewelry .

Hers is one voice among the millions threatened by a global increase in violence against women -- one in three women will experience violence in her lifetime . We are confronted with a pandemic of violence , and must address it with commensurate force and urgency .

Rebecca carries the weight of unrealized human rights on her shoulders . It is our duty to help lessen her load .

We must support women like her as equal partners in economic , social and political development , and recognize their ability to practice collaborative leadership and carry their communities forward with each step they take . Recently we honored Rebecca at the 2010 Vital Voices Global Leadership Awards , recognizing her strength and vision as she empowers women and shapes a future free of violence against women .

If we want to promote peace and prosperity , we must begin with women . We have seen that in societies where women 's rights are respected , economies are stronger , civil societies thrive and political institutions are more open and free .

Our progress in the past 15 years is tenuous if it 's not shared , reinforced and expanded in all spheres . We must recommit ourselves to women 's equality worldwide . Now is the time to build on the momentum and advance positive change .
