NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The second of two men who last month pulled off a daring escape from a county jail in New Jersey was taken into custody Wednesday , authorities told CNN .

Otis Blunt , 32 , was arrested in Mexico City , according to the U.S. Marshals Service . He will be transported back to the United States as soon as possible , probably within 24 hours , authorities said . Mexico has no extradition proceedings .

On Tuesday , local and federal authorities captured Jose Espinosa , 20 , who broke out of Union County Jail on December 15 along with Blunt .

Espinosa and Blunt escaped by digging a hole through the cinder block wall of their adjoining cells , and hid the hole by using posters of bikini-clad women .

The two then jumped onto a roof and over a 25-foot-high razor wire fence onto a railroad bed . Authorities said Espinosa might have injured his foot making those jumps .

Authorities traced Blunt to Mexico City , where he was hiding in a $ 10-a-night hotel , said Commander Lenny DePaul of the New York/New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force . They spotted him when he looked out a window . Marshals and Mexican authorities then converged on the hotel room , DePaul said .

A written statement from marshals identified the hotel as the Hotel Zomara .

Blunt , who was arrested without incident , was in a holding cell Wednesday afternoon , DePaul said .

Marshals said Blunt was in the custody of the Mexican immigration agency and is awaiting its determination about his deportation . `` Since the day of his escape , right through the holidays , apprehending this guy has been the highest-priority case , '' DePaul said in the statement .

In recent days , Blunt had spoken with the Rev. Al Sharpton , the civil rights activist , to help negotiate his surrender .

Sharpton traveled to Mexico City , where he said he was led to believe Blunt would give himself up Tuesday . But that surrender did not occur , and Sharpton left the country Wednesday morning .

Police believe it took two weeks for Espinosa and Blunt to chisel out two cinder blocks -- one between the cells and a second to the wall outside , using a valve wheel one of the men took from a pipe .

Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow said it is n't clear why no one heard the digging , as a reenactment conducted by his office showed it would be loud . When the men made the jumps , they were wearing flip-flops and had wrapped their feet in sheets , the prosecutor said . The sheeting strips were found by authorities later .

Acting on a tip , authorities found Espinosa about 9 p.m. Tuesday in an apartment six blocks from the jail , said James Plousis , a U.S. marshal for New Jersey . Espinosa was alone in the residence and was lying on a couch with his foot raised .

Investigators said they also arrested a `` female associate '' of Espinosa . They identified her as 19-year-old Odalys Cortez of Hazleton , Pennsylvania , and said in a news release that they plan to file criminal charges against her .

During their escape , Blunt and Espinosa left behind dummies in their jail beds , along with a note naming prison guard Rudolph Zurick . It thanked him `` for the tools needed , '' and said , `` You 're A real Pal ! Happy Holidays . ''

Zurick committed suicide last week at his home in Sayreville , New Jersey . His attorney , Michael Mitzner , said Zurick had not been charged in the jail break and was cooperating with investigators .

`` It 's possible that his name being associated with the escape was more than he could take , despite his lack of involvement , '' Mitzner said .

As Espinosa , wearing a sleeveless black T-shirt , khaki pants and slippers , was led into Union County police headquarters Tuesday night , a reporter asked him about the guard 's death . `` It was n't our fault , '' he said .

Espinosa recently pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was to be sentenced January 25 , authorities said . He faced a minimum of 17 years in prison . Blunt was in prison in lieu of $ 75,000 bail for weapons and robbery charges .

Both men were being housed in the multilevel jail 's high-security area , officials said . E-mail to a friend
