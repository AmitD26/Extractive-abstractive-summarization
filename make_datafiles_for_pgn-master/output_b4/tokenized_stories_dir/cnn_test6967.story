Clarksdale , Mississippi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The soul man howled into the microphone , his voice busting through the ceiling of the dimly lit Mississippi juke joint . He sang of love and sex , cheating scoundrels and lying fools .

'' ... Doin ' the booooom booooom ! ... ''

He danced , he grooved . At times , his voice hit notes so high , the walls of the ramshackle place shook . `` Cat got lungs ! '' shouted one in the small crowd .

Soul wannabes enter juke joints with caution : Stabbings and flat-out beatings have befallen artists who do n't meet expectations .

Yet on this night , not far from the fabled crossroads where , according to legend , bluesman Robert Johnson gained guitar mastery in exchange for his immortal soul , there was a most unexpected surprise : A Massachusetts Yankee tore it up at one of the toughest joints in the Mississippi Delta .

Eli `` Paperboy '' Reed sang for more than three hours for an audience of no more than 15 . Men named Red , Bubba and Sledge nodded with approval . And word on the street was out : Been a long time since somebody like the Paperboy has come through !

It 's been more than 18 months since that performance . The Paperboy is now hitting the big stage .

Signed by Capitol Records last year , he and his band , the True Loves , released their first album under a major label last week . The album , `` Come and Get It , '' combines soul-ratcheting spunk with 1960s-style ballads . At its core is an age-old R&B tradition : lyrics of love and being driven wild by women .

When he hits stride , Reed unleashes raw sexual energy through deep-bellied hollers , explosive bursts from his band and auctioneer-like rapidity . '' ... There 's gon na be an explosion , baby . Gon na be a - , gon na be a - , gon na be a - ... Owwwwwwwwwwwwwww !!! ... ''

Kicked back in his apartment in Brooklyn , the 26-year-old Reed laughs about how far he 's come . `` There was a lot of very lucky coincidences that I fell into , '' he says .

And he 's got big-time backing .

Mike Elizondo , who has produced stars like Eminem , Dr. Dre and 50 Cent , is the producer for `` Come and Get It . ''

While Elizondo is best known for his hip-hop music production , he is ecstatic about this new gig . He first heard of Reed from a business partner about two years ago and then watched him on YouTube . `` My jaw was on the floor . ''

`` I played it for Justin Timberlake and a couple other people . I was like , ` Dude , you 've got ta check this kid out . ' ''

Blues , gospel and the ` strange cat '

The son of a former music critic , Reed got into music at an early age . By the time he was 13 , he was practicing the harmonica eight hours a day . He 'd cut up around the house with his father , who strummed the guitar while his son belted out .

In high school , instead of poring over algebra books , Reed studied the likes of Sam Cooke and other R&B greats , listening to their tone , as well as the heart and soul they put into their music .

He played saxophone and guitar in a jazz band in high school . When he performed , he wore his grandfather 's hat , and soon got dubbed `` Paperboy '' for his 1950s newsboy looks . The name stuck .

Shortly after high school graduation , at the age of 18 , the Jewish kid from Brookline , Massachusetts , set out from his parents ' home to the heart of the nation 's blues country .

He was heading to the Mississippi Delta to work for a jumpstart blues radio station . But shortly after he arrived , his partner went broke . He was soon on stage at local juke joints , fronting a band and playing four hours a night .

`` I found myself thrust into it from the word go , playing all the time , '' he says . `` I pretty much immersed myself in this culture 24 hours a day . ''

He stayed in Mississippi for about a year before heading to the University of Chicago . But his real education was n't at the university ; it came on the South Side , where he teamed up with gospel singer Mitty Collier and began singing at her church .

He says his skin color -- he was often the only white guy performing for crowds in Mississippi and Chicago -- was never a hindrance . In fact , he says , African-Americans often respected him more than whites did .

`` Once people see that you 're enthusiastic and love the music and that I could sing ... everybody was very forgiving of it . ''

At juke joints , he says , the audiences were working-class folks `` just there to have a good time . '' They never got out of hand with him or the band , he pauses , `` unless they 're really drunk . '' When he gets a chance , he still goes back to Red 's , the first juke joint he ever played in Clarksdale .

Along the way , Reed has picked up fans from Natasha Bedingfield to Nick Lowe to Daryl Hall of Hall & Oates .

Earlier this year , Hall had Reed perform on his Web show `` Live from Daryl 's House , '' where musicians play along with Hall at his place in New York . Hall ranks Reed in the top 5 of those who have played on his show . `` I look for unique people and I look for really talented people , and he fits that bill all the way , '' Hall says .

`` The guy is a strange throwback of the time , but he does n't do it like an Elvis impersonator . He 's the real thing . ''

Reed has since traded in his paperboy hat for a pompadour . His outfits now more resemble characters out of the hit TV show `` Mad Men . ''

Hall says he was so stunned by Reed 's looks that he pulled out pictures from his youth to show the budding musician . `` He was dressed in almost identical clothing as me , '' Hall says , laughing . `` He 's a strange cat . ''

But , he adds , of Reed 's authentic style : `` I do n't know how he does it , to tell you the truth . He 's a musical time traveler . ''

Producer Elizondo agrees . `` He 's doing something that nobody his age is doing . ''

The new album -- with most of its songs written by Reed -- was recorded live in Boston over 12 days . Six days were spent tracking the rhythm section , and another six days to track the band 's horns and strings .

`` Sonically , it stands up to anything that 's out there , '' Elizondo says .

Like everything in the music business , the verdict is still out on if Reed catches on in the mainstream . To that end , Hall says that `` there is no mainstream that matters '' anymore .

`` It 's all about enthusiasm and fanaticism to your particular thing , '' Hall says . `` And that 's more important than being mainstream . It always was , really . ''

And there 's no doubt about Reed 's soul . Hall and Elizondo say his audience will grow at the grass-roots level as more and more people hear his stuff .

When they see him live , Elizondo says , `` it 'll be a party from beginning to end . ''

Boston Red Sox fans will get their first taste of that next Tuesday , when Reed sings the national anthem at Fenway Park .
