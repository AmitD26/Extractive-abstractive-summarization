MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An internationally known Catholic priest who was shown in photographs last week embracing a bathing-suit-clad woman on a Florida beach has admitted they had a two-year affair .

The Rev. Alberto Cutie was removed from his duties after pictures showed him bare-chested with a woman .

The Rev. Alberto Cutie -- sometimes called `` Father Oprah '' because of the advice he gave on Spanish-language media -- said Monday on CBS ' `` Early Show '' that he is in love with the woman and is considering his options : Whether to break up with her or leave the priesthood and marry her . The woman , who has not been publicly identified , wants to get married , Cutie said .

The priest was removed from his duties last week at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach , Florida , and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace networks .

`` I take full responsibility for what I did , and I know it 's wrong , '' he said Monday .

The photos of the Cuban-American priest , also known as `` Padre Alberto , '' appeared on the cover of last week 's TV Notas magazine and on eight inside pages . The cover says in Spanish : `` Good God ! Padre Alberto . First photos of a priest ` in flagrante ' with his lover . ''

Other media outlets throughout Latin America , including the official Notimex news agency in Mexico , picked up the story , and it became an Internet sensation . Cutie has millions of followers in the Spanish-speaking world .

In a message posted on the Miami , Florida , archdiocese Web page last week , Archbishop John C. Favalora apologized to parishioners and radio listeners for what he called a `` scandal . ''

`` Father Cutie made a promise of celibacy and all priests are expected to fulfill that promise with the help of God , '' Favalora said . `` Father Cutie 's actions can not be condoned despite the good works he has done as a priest . ''

Cutie expressed his regret in an online statement last week and again Monday on the CBS program .

`` I deeply apologize to the Catholic community and especially to my bishop and to my brother priests who are faithful and who are committed to celibacy , '' Cutie said .

The priest said he believes in celibacy but thinks it should be optional . He said he had never had a sexual relationship with anyone other than the woman since leaving the seminary 15 years ago . Watch Father Cutie question the celibacy requirement ''

`` I do n't support the breaking of the celibacy promise , '' Cutie said . `` I understand fully that this is wrong .

`` I do n't want to be the anti-celibacy priest . I think that 's unfortunate , '' he said . `` I think it 's a debate that 's going on in our society , and now I 've become kind of a poster boy for it . But I do n't want to be that . I believe that celibacy is good , and that it 's a good commitment to God . This is something I 've struggled with . And something that I never expected to become a public debate . ''

He also talked about the woman , saying they have been friends for a long time and the attraction was there from early on , but it was not acted on until a couple of years ago . They have `` both struggled '' with the relationship , he said .

`` She 's also a woman of faith , '' Cutie said . `` She 's also somebody who cares about the priesthood , who cares about these things . So it has n't been easy . And those who have helped me through this process know it has n't been easy . Obviously , you know , through the photos , it looked like a frivolous thing on the beach , you know , and that 's not what it is . It 's something deeper than that . ''

Cutie was the first Catholic priest to host a daily talk show on a major secular television network , his information on the LinkedIn online professional network says .

In addition to his TV and radio appearances , he has written newspaper advice columns and a self-help book , `` Real Life , Real Love . ''

Before being removed , he was president and general director of Pax Catholic Communications , home of Radio Paz and Radio Peace in Miami .
