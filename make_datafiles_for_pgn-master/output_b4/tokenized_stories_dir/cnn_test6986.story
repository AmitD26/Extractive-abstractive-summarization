-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- MetroPCS , the fifth-largest U.S. wireless carrier , appears to be moving to bring more smartphones to lower-income consumers -- and also to capitalize on the FCC 's new `` open internet '' rules which exempt wireless carriers from key net neutrality requirements .

This mixed news could set a precedent that might eventually constrict the kind of mobile internet options available to all U.S. mobile users .

Specifically , on January 3 MetroPCS announced three tiers of plans for its new 4G LTE network . Here 's how The Washington Post summarized these flat-rate-per-month offerings :

• $ 40 `` for unlimited talk , text , 4G Web browsing with unlimited YouTube access ; ''

• $ 50 `` for unlimited talk , text , 4G Web services and unlimited YouTube ; also international and premium text messaging , navigation , mobile instant messaging , corporate e-mail and 1 GB of additional data access . With Wi-Fi , customers also get audio capabilities to listen and download music and access to preview and trial video content ; ''

• $ 60 `` for the same premium features as the $ 50 plan , plus unlimited data access and MetroSTUDIO premium content such as 18 video-on-demand channels and audio downloads . ''

On the bright side , these MetroPCS plans cost considerably less than most smartphone plans currently offered by Verizon , AT&T , T-Mobile , and Sprint -- which tend to cost at least $ 90 per month , with a two-year contract and high early termination fees . Plus , the fact that these are no-contract plans means that customers have more flexibility to switch phones , plans or carriers at will to suit fluctuating budgets .

Such benefits might significantly influence the phone choices of many U.S. mobile users .

But on January 10 , a coalition of public interest groups -- including Free Press , Media Access Project , and the Center for Media Justice -- sent a letter to the FCC asking the agency to investigate whether the MetroPCS plans violate the few substantial net neutrality provisions which do apply to wireless carriers .

Under the new rules , mobile providers are forbidden to block access to lawful sites , as well as applications and online services that compete with the carrier 's voice or video telephony services . Wireless carriers are permitted to slow delivery of certain content for the purposes of network management . However , they are required to be transparent with the FCC , consumers , and others about how they make these decisions -- and such transparency is so far lacking from the new MetroPCS plans .

In the big picture , the MetroPCS plans might deepen the mobile digital divide by normalizing the practice of charging users more to get full mobile access to a free choice of internet services and content . This would disproportionately affect lower-income mobile users and people of color , who are more likely to rely more heavily on mobile devices for internet access .

As the coalition explained : `` Being forced to pay an additional monthly fee for access to new or competing services creates barriers to consumer choice and experimentation , and jeopardizes the social and economic benefits associated with the Internet . ''

MetroPCS denies that its new plans will limit users ' online access . In a statement to The Washington Post , CEO Roger Lindquist wrote :

`` The complaints about our new , pro-consumer , pro-competitive 4G LTE rate plans are erroneous . We continue to offer consumers a full service , unlimited data plan . We increased consumer choice by adding two new rate plans that are less expensive and enable consumers to select the service and content they want at a price point they can afford . These new rate plans comply with the FCC 's new rules on open mobile Internet . ''

This year , I expect to see this mobile drama play out on the streets of my own city , Oakland , California .

My recent survey of Oakland mobile users indicated that MetroPCS is the most popular carrier in this economically challenged city -- used by nearly half of those surveyed . Only 30 % of respondents used smartphones -LRB- a figure that reflects the national average -RRB- , yet 80 % of respondents reported accessing the Web from their phones daily or most days . This indicates a strong drive for mobile internet access .

Just under 40 % of those surveyed reported paying less than $ 50 per month for their phone . -LRB- The MetroPCS `` $ 40/everything '' plan is especially popular around here . -RRB- And according to recently released U.S. Census data , Oakland has a lower median per-household income than the national average . Also , 17.5 % of Oakland residents are officially living in poverty .

Internet access connects people to much more than YouTube , LOL Cats , and Skype . It 's a portal to opportunity , learning , and much-needed services -- and these days it 's necessary in order to apply for many jobs or to interact with social service agencies .

Last December , MetroPCS launched its 4G network in the San Francisco metro area -- and it 's reportedly live in Oakland now . I suspect that if the smartphones that go along with the new MetroPCS plans cost less than about $ 80 , many Oaklanders will upgrade -- probably unaware of the limitations carefully built into these plans .
