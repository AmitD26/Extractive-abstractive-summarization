Consumers today have more power than ever before . The large and diverse selection of media available on newsstands means that customers know what they should be getting , and if they are n't satisfied with the service there 's a host of Web sites and forums on which they can let everyone know .

In response , organizations are seeking ever more innovative ways of understanding their customers ' needs , and are even turning to anthropologists and sociologists to help them .

`` Whereas before a lot of services were designed from the inside out , now , because consumers are so much more empowered , they are having to think about designing from the outside in , '' says Fran Samalionis , global practice leader for service design and innovation at IDEO . `` They have to think much more about the customer experience and then figure out how to make sense of that for the business . ''

IDEO , a global design firm , is already well-known for designing the first mouse , for Apple , and the first notebook computer , for GriD , but the company is also causing a stir with its innovative approach to design conception , where the wishes and observations of the consumer hold powerful sway .

While it employs what one would call `` conventional '' designers , IDEO also uses what it terms a `` human factor '' team -- people trained in anthropology , sociology and political sciences -- who shadow consumers , observe their everyday habits and relationship with a product , and even give them cameras to record photo journals , in a bid to understand what is really needed for a product to push through the barrier and provide true satisfaction for its customer base .

A case in point is Marriott 's TownePlace Suites . The hotel chain approached IDEO for ideas about how to launch an extended-stay brand . IDEO followed guests and employees around , monitoring their habits and probing them with questions about every aspect of their experience at Marriott 's hotels . Their conversations taught them that extended-stay guests were mainly on the road because of work commitments ; they were away from home through necessity rather than choice and therefore wanted an experience from a hotel that was closer to what they were accustomed to at home -- a `` home from home . ''

IDEO recommended that Marriott install a `` map wall '' in the lobby , with recommendations from fellow guests , such as where to find the best coffee shop or restaurant and where to go jogging in the local area .

But they also found that while guests were looking for familiar home comforts , they were also there to work . With that in mind , they drew up prototypes for guest rooms that more closely resemble live/work areas , with an office incorporated into the layout of the bedroom .

Market research is not a new concept . Organizations have been bringing their potential customers together for decades to understand what they want from their services . But Samalionis argues that it is by sending its cohorts into the field to observe customers in their natural environments that IDEO gains the real insights and results .

She says that while some customers might struggle to articulate their needs -- or even fully comprehend what they are looking for in the first place -- simply by looking at their daily routines IDEO 's researchers can gain significant understanding of what can be done to improve customers ' relationships with a particular product or service .

Such was the case when IDEO worked with Bank of America to develop a new credit card . The card was targeted at young mothers and IDEO 's observation team set about following a selection of moms around as they went about their daily business : taking their children to school , shopping , even balancing their checkbooks .

They discovered that many people round up their transactions to the nearest whole number for speed and convenience . At the same time , many of the moms were struggling with the discipline of saving , even though they wanted to .

The solution IDEO came up with was to introduce a credit card , `` Keep The Change , '' which would instantly transfer the amount customers would usually round up into a separate savings account . Samalionis argues that this is an excellent example of where in-field research ultimately inspired an idea that could be transposed to a real-world scheme .

`` Just by being able to be with them , empathize with them and observe them you get to see the stuff they ca n't tell you , '' she explains . `` We saw all these habits about putting pennies in jars and rounding things up in checkbooks . If you had asked somebody , they would say they just wanted to save money . ''

All this could be interpreted as just a glossy way of rehashing a construct that has already existed within marketing and design for years -- the market research questionnaire . But Samalionis argues that the human-centered approach is just one cog in their approach to problem-solving ; trained designers , engineers , business heads and the client must also have their input .

`` It 's not enough going out into the world and coming up with a point of view about that world , '' she says .

`` You need to make those insights actionable . Really , the magic dust in the process is in synthesizing all those perspectives into something that can help you generate amazing ideas . ''

Ultimately , the effectiveness of an approach can be best measured by its financial returns . Bank of America 's `` Keep The Change '' credit card scheme generated 2.5 million new , and presumably happy , customers .

This willingness by designers to open themselves up to public consultation is becoming increasingly popular . In England , Bath 's Theatre Royal took opinions into consideration from a panel of local schoolchildren when designing their new children 's theatre , The Egg . A panel of nine - to eighteen-year-olds even had a say in the choice of architect and the menu for the cafe .

Innovations derived from the consultation include knee-high glass panels on the doors so that smaller theater-goers can see where they are going and a sound-proofed room so that parents with crying babies can sit and watch the show without disturbing the rest of the audience .

In Italy , car maker Fiat opened itself up for suggestions from the public during the design of its relaunched Fiat 500 . Under the project title `` 500 Wants You , '' the hitherto inward-looking manufacturer invited ordinary people to submit ideas for designs on its Web site .

IDEO , and other design firms like it , are changing the way large organizations interact with their customers . They are learning about new ways to keep consumers satisfied , and boosting their bank balances in the process . But in the end it 's the consumer who is profiting the most from this new approach .
