-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Southeast is among the areas of the United States with the highest concentration of cases of HIV and AIDS , according to a new online tool called the National HIV/AIDS Atlas .

In this map of AIDS prevalence rates in the Southeast , red represents the highest -LRB- 0.593 percent or greater -RRB- .

AIDS experts in the region say that access to health care , especially when it comes to screening , is a major problem in rural communities .

In the Southeast , people with HIV tend to get tested late , after they have become sick , partly because of stigma , said Kathie Hiers , executive director of AIDS Alabama in Birmingham .

`` If you look at access to health care and almost any kind of health care report card , the South is the worst , '' she said .

With little or no public transportation , people in non-metropolitan areas are at a disadvantage when they need to see a particular kind of doctor , experts say . There is also a shortage of doctors who deal with HIV in the region , Hiers said .

These problems also resonate with Georgia 's rural communities , which represent 39 percent of the HIV/AIDS burden in the state , said Raphael Holloway , director of the HIV Unit at the Georgia Division of Public Health . The remaining 61 percent of people living with HIV or AIDS are in the metro Atlanta area .

`` In some districts , for example , there may be 10 counties within that health district but only one infectious disease doctor that people can access for care and services , '' he said .

It is also difficult to get HIV education to people in rural areas , he said .

Of the 29 states reporting county-level data for the National HIV/AIDS Atlas , Georgia had more counties than any other state with the highest levels of HIV and AIDS prevalence .

Although this does not represent a comprehensive national assessment , Georgia ranked fifth in reporting of new AIDS cases in 2007 , behind Texas -LRB- fourth -RRB- , Florida -LRB- third -RRB- , New York -LRB- second -RRB- and California -LRB- first -RRB- , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

The Northeast also has a heavy burden of HIV/AIDS cases nationally , atlas collaborators said . Other states with high numbers of counties with high HIV prevalence included Florida , New York and South Carolina .

The atlas , the first of its kind to map out HIV and AIDS at the level of counties , launched in time for Saturday 's HIV/AIDS Testing Day . The National Institutes of Health is encouraging everyone age 13 to 64 to get tested for HIV as part of routine health care .

`` Not knowing one 's HIV status endangers one 's health and the health of one 's sexual partners . By getting tested for the virus and learning one 's HIV status soon after infection , treatment can begin early , substantially delaying the development of HIV-related illness and prolonging life , '' said Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health .

The National HIV/AIDS Atlas allows users to explore the prevalence of HIV and AIDS in any region of the United States . The map , a project of the National Minority Quality Forum , encompasses all 50 states , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands .

The more red a region appears , the greater the prevalence , which is the ratio of the number of people living with the disease at a given time to the total number of people living there at that time .

Users can look at rates of disease by gender , race/ethnicity and age group in regions where this information is available . The map also has different settings for HIV and AIDS , the more severe illness caused by the HIV virus . They can also zoom into counties and , for New York City only , ZIP codes .

About 33 million people have HIV/AIDS worldwide as of 2007 , according to the World Health Organization . The CDC estimates that 1.1 million Americans have HIV and that 56,300 new infections occurred in the United States in 2006 . Nearly 75 percent of HIV/AIDS diagnoses among adolescents and adults in that year were for males .

People who worked on the atlas project were surprised at how concentrated HIV and AIDS are in certain U.S. counties .

`` Being able to look at all the data in this way reminds us that the HIV epidemic is not uniformly distributed throughout the U.S. , '' said Patrick Sullivan , associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University , who collaborated on the atlas .

The atlas also reflects the disproportionate number of African-Americans who have HIV and AIDS .

`` You can see at the level of the national map that there 's so much variation in the U.S. about which groups have been impacted , '' Sullivan said .

Demographics and county-level data are not available for some states , or parts of some states , because of the way these places report data by region , researchers said . These areas appear as gray when users zoom in . Some places also appear gray because the disease case count is so low .

The atlas is based on data from public health departments from 2006 , the most recent available . Collaborators say they hope to update the maps when new data become available .

The atlas , which launched Monday morning , had about 100,000 visitors by Tuesday afternoon , and more than 10,000 people completed the free registration in that time , said Gary Puckrein , executive director of the atlas project .
