-LRB- The Frisky -RRB- -- You do n't have to be Jennifer Aniston to think that the four women who Krazy-Glued a cheater 's penis to his stomach were way harsh and beyond psycho .

If your ex 's loved ones ask why you broke up , it 's OK to admit he cheated on you , writer says .

But in our less scrupulous/mature moments , many of us want to punish a particularly nasty ex , especially if he was a cheater .

Ladies , let 's keep it legal -LRB- and Krazy Glue-free -RRB- , OK ? Here are 10 ideas :

1 . Email his crappiest crap e-mail to Jezebel.com 's Crap E-mail From A Dude and when they publish it , discreetly post the link as your GChat away message .

2 . Call up your hottest platonic male friend , grab your digital camera and go do something adorable together . Now it 's time to create a Facebook photo album full of pics of you looking smiley . -LRB- Bonus points if your ex was slightly paranoid that this guy had a thing for you -RRB- .

3 . Permanently adopt that comfy sweatshirt he left at your place . Especially if he 's the one who caused the breakup , he probably does n't have the cojones to ask for it back now .

4 . Gain that extra 10 lbs that fills you out nicely , like Joan Holloway on `` Mad Men '' ...

5 . ... or lose that extra 10 lbs so you can fit into your sexy jeans again . Either way , this also requires a Facebook photo album . The Frisky : How Joan Holloway gives me confidence

6 . You might hear from his mom , sisters , or other family members you were close to after the breakup , especially if you dated for a long time .
