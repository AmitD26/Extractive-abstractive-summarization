-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has stood by his post-match tirade against officialdom after his side lost 2-0 to bitter rivals Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal tie Wednesday .

Mourinho spoke of a `` scandal '' and favoritism towards Barca as both he and central defender Pepe were sent off in the second half .

Down to 10-men , Barcelona brilliantly exploited the advantage in the Bernabeu and scored two late goals through Lionel Messi .

UEFA said Thursday that it had started a disciplinary inquiry into the unsavory incidents which marred the clash of the Spanish giants .

Barcelona are also lodging an official complaint to the European governing body after Mourinho 's comments .

But Mourinho told gathered reporters Friday that he would have no more to say on the subject , claiming pictures of the incidents would back up his claims .

`` An image is worth more than a thousand words . I said what I said and I have nothing to add , '' he told the official Real Madrid website .

`` Whoever criticizes my words must criticize the images and think that the photos have been edited by photoshop and that the video was staged . ''

Mourinho said he would be resting key players for this weekend 's Spanish league match against Real Zaragoza ahead of the return tie in the Nou Camp Tuesday .

Despite his pessimism about the eventual outcome after Wednesday 's defeat , the Portuguese coach refused to write off Real 's season .

`` Our morale is good in all aspects . The season is not over and only finishes at the end of May , '' he claimed .
