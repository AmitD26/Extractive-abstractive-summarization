Along The Libya-Tunisia Border -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A green flag fluttering in the wind designated Libyan territory . A short distance away , a red flag flew for Tunisia . In between , a mass of humanity waited in no man 's land , desperate to flee escalating rebellion in one nation and cross into another that has already succeeded in toppling a dictator .

Periodically , a ripple flowed through the crowd of thousands of refugees as men took turns passing forward dazed and unconscious travelers , overwhelmed by a treacherous journey to the border and exposure to the elements .

Tunisian emergency workers rushed with fluorescent orange stretchers to evacuate the sick .

Chaos reigned along Libya 's western border Tuesday as Tunisian police attempted to hold back a tide of people , mostly foreign workers caught in the storm of change blowing through the region .

There were simply too many people crossing too fast , overwhelming Tunisian authorities , aid agencies and volunteers trying to get a handle on what the United Nations called a humanitarian catastrophe in the making .

The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people have crossed over from Libya into Tunisia and Egypt .

A majority are Egyptians -- more than 1 million Egyptian citizens were working in neighboring Libya . But the fleeing foreigners also include citizens of Bangladesh , Thailand , Vietnam , Ghana , Sudan , Mali and other countries who traveled far from home in search of economic salvation .

Now , many of them said they had everything stolen from them on the road to the border and are left with nothing but the clothes on their back .

`` No money ! Gadhafi 's militia took my money , '' said Mohammad Ataye , an Egyptian who spent the last year working as a hairdresser in Libya . He was referring to troops still loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi .

Ataye said he tried to catch a flight out of Tripoli 's airport to Egypt , but was forced back by thousands of people waiting there . When he and a friend decided to make a run for the Tunisian border , Libyan soldiers robbed him of his savings and his two mobile phones on the way .

Now what for the Egyptian refugee ? `` I do n't know . I do n't know , '' he said .

Some of those fleeing Libya do not possess passports and other travel documents , which are often confiscated by the companies that employ them until their contracts are fulfilled , said Mathieu Luciano of the International Organization for Migration .

Luciano , deployed to the Egyptian border town of Sallum to help shuttle people out , said his agency was working with the embassies of nations involved as well as the companies that hired the migrant workers to return them home safely . The agency is paying for a charter flight from Bangladesh that is scheduled to arrive later Tuesday .

The Egyptian government has reported 69,000 people crossing into that nation . One of them is Mohamed Sohel .

Sohel , who had been working for a Korean construction company in the eastern Libyan city of Durna for three years , was anxious to board a plane back home to Bangladesh . He said he has been surviving by sharing one piece of flatbread with two other men since arriving at the Egyptian border town of Sallum six days ago . His passport was locked up at the company 's Libyan headquarters in the western town of Misrata .

`` We called the Bangladeshi embassy a thousand times , '' Sohel said . `` We never got any advice , or help . ''

It 's easier for Egyptian workers to make it back home , Luciano said , but nonetheless , they face a difficult situation .

They were the breadwinners , supporting families in rural Egypt . They are returning with no livelihood in a time of uncertainty in their own homeland . Some said they were frustrated with their interim military government for not doing more to help them .

`` As we know , Egypt is also under a lot of stress now politically , '' said Hovig Etyemezian , a field officer with the U.N. refugee agency . `` So any country that is able to provide air lift or sea movement should pick up the ball so that more people leave , more Egyptians are able to go back to their country . ''

On Libya 's border with Tunisia , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staff erected 500 tents . All of them are full .

The global body appealed to member nations to help evacuate the stranded .

`` The biggest priority is to take people out of the country , '' Etyemezian said . `` Now the -LSB- border -RSB- crossing is anywhere between 10 to 13,000 people a day . And the outgoing is 3 to 4,000 . So we need to have a bigger capacity of people leaving the country . ''

Police and soldiers watched , as young Tunisian volunteers used sticks to beat back people trying to jump over a wall next to the border gate into Tunisia . Volunteers threw bread and bottles of water into the no man 's land between the red and green flags . Thousands of people have been waiting there for as many as three days , enduring bitter cold without shelter .

Staff members with the U.N. refugee agency described the water and sanitation situation as precarious .

Tunisian authorities told the agency that about 75,000 people have streamed into Tunisia . Up to 15,000 more people are expected to arrive Tuesday and the agency said it was `` becoming critically important that onwards transport becomes quickly available to avoid a humanitarian crisis . ''

The refugee agency said it was particularly concerned about a large number of sub-Saharan Africans who are being denied entry into Tunisia . They may be targets for retribution after reports that embattled Gadhafi recruited mercenaries from those nations to suppress the uprising in his country .

CNN 's Ivan Watson reported from the Libya-Tunisia border and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta .
