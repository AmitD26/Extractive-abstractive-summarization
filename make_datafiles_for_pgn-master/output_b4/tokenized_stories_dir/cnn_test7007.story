-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Japan 's national soccer team will not play as a guest nation at the Copa America tournament in Argentina after failing to secure the release of the earthquake-hit country 's Europe-based players .

The J-League has been so badly disrupted by the March 11 disaster that domestic clubs will not allow players to travel to South America .

However , the Japanese Football Association was persuaded to revise its April 3 decision to pull out of the July 1-24 tournament , and had hoped to participate with a squad made up of its overseas stars .

`` It is a great pity that we wo n't be able to take part in the tournament as the local people were preparing to welcome us , '' JFA president Junji Ogura told his association 's website on Wednesday .

`` We realized that we would not be able to form a squad good enough to play in the Copa America , and on that basis we had no choice but to give up the opportunity to play in the tournament . ''

JFA technical director Hiromi Hara met with officials at 11 clubs , but was told that they could not release the players because next season will start earlier than usual due to the mid-2012 staging of the European Championship in Poland and Ukraine .

`` Many of our players have become top players at these clubs , and that is something to be pleased about , '' Hara said .

`` Club officials told me they would understand if this was the Asian Cup or a one-off charity match , but they had a problem with it being the Copa America . ''

The JFA has made alternative plans to prepare for the 2014 World Cup qualifiers in September .

The Samurai Blue will play Peru and the Czech Republic in the Kirin Cup in early June , and then take on South Korea in August in a friendly .

Japan won the 2011 Asian Cup in Qatar in January , beating Australia in the final under the guidance of coach Alberto Zaccheroni .

`` This year has turned to be an exceptional year following the East Japan disaster , and we have been put into a situation where we have had to make a difficult decision , '' the Italian said .

`` However , we would like to move on to set our full focus on our preparations for our important World Cup qualifiers . ''

The Copa America tournament traditionally features two guest nations and 10 from South America .

Costa Rica will replace Japan , while Mexico will be the other team from outside the CONMEBOL federation .
