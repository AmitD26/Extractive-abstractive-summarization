KABUL , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two separate militant assaults Saturday in the southeastern Afghan province of Paktika led to the deaths of two U.S. soldiers and at least 42 insurgents , military officials said .

U.S. Marines , under fire from a building , move to take it Saturday in Helmand province , Afghanistan .

The soldiers died when Taliban fighters attacked a base in Zerok that houses members of the U.S. military , Afghan national police and Afghan National Army , said the provincial governor 's spokesman , Hamidullah Zawak .

He said the Taliban first detonated a truck full of explosives , then attacked the base with missiles and rockets .

The military responded by sending in aircraft and dropping bombs , killing 32 Taliban fighters and wounding many , Zawak said , without giving a number . Seven of the wounded Taliban fighters were arrested .

Zawak said one U.S. soldier was killed and another wounded . Sgt. Chuck Marsh , however , a U.S. military spokesman , said two U.S. service members were killed and four wounded . Two soldiers from the Afghan National Army were also hurt , Zawak said .

A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to a CNN stringer in Kabul .

Several hours later , at least 10 militants were killed and one detained in an assault on a combat outpost in the province .

Insurgents attacked with indirect fire , including multiple rockets and mortars -- at least one of which contained white phosphorous -- small-arms fire and a car bomb , according to a statement from NATO 's International Security Assistance Force -LRB- ISAF -RRB- .

Soldiers from ISAF and the Afghan National Army fired back , aided by planes and attack helicopters . No civilian casualties were reported .

In other developments in and around Paktika :

• On Saturday , a suicide car bomb detonated near a private security company in Lashkar Gah city in Helmand province . One person was killed and five were wounded , said Assadullah Sherzad , Helmand provincial police chief .

• The U.S.-led Operation Khanjar , or Strike of the Sword , is targeting Taliban militants in Helmand province , near Paktika in southern Afghanistan . Thousands of U.S. Marines and Afghan soldiers are trying to rout the Taliban from strongholds in the Helmand River Valley . The operation began early Thursday .

Helmand 's poppy crop produces more than half of the opium cultivated in Afghanistan , the source of 90 percent of the global supply , according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime . The revenues help support the Taliban .

• On Tuesday , a U.S. soldier was abducted in Paktika province . The Taliban claimed responsibility . A senior U.S. military official later said the soldier was being held by the militant Haqqani clan , a Taliban-affiliated network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani .

The Haqqanis -- who operate on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistani borders -- are well-known to the U.S. military , which said it was using all means to locate the soldier , whose name has not been released .
