Barack Obama , president : `` Tonight , the momentum against the Gadhafi regime has reached a tipping point . Tripoli is slipping from the grasp of a tyrant .

VENEZUELA

Hugo Chavez , president : `` Today we are seeing images of how the democratic European governments are practically demolishing Tripoli with their bombs and the supposedly democratic government of the United States , because they feel like it .
