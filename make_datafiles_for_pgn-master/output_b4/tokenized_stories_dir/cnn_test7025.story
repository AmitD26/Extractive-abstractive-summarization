-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For a good part of her career , Martina McBride 's success has largely been due to relying on Nashville songwriters and approaching arrangements in a pop-country fashion .

While hits like `` Wild Angels , '' `` A Broken Wing '' and `` Wrong Again '' solidified her position as country radio royalty , McBride 's shaking things up these days . She 's ditched both of those early crutches and now is exploring writing on her own and injecting a more roots-oriented sound into her instrumentation .

Such is the case with `` Eleven , '' McBride 's 11th studio album , which drops today . These days , she 's working with new management , has a new label in Republic Nashville and wrote six of the 11 songs that appear on her latest project

As the 45-year-old singer soldiers on , what about this moment inspired change , and how 's her own songwriting coming along ? CNN spoke with McBride recently as she was prepping for a concert in Minot , North Dakota .

CNN : `` Eleven '' comes with a lot of professional changes . Why is this ?

Martina McBride : You know , sometimes it 's just time to shake things up a little bit . When you 've been at a certain place and management for 18 years , I just felt like I really need someone around me with some fresh ideas , some new passion and energy .

CNN : As female country musicians age these days , are there pressures to stay youthful ? How does one age gracefully in Nashville ?

McBride : Oh , I think the same way you age gracefully anywhere else . Females have always had more of a focus on the way they look . No matter what business your in , if you 're in the public eye -- whether you 're an actor or a rock musician or even head of a corporation , it 's always been that way . You just try ... I do n't know , I try not to focus on it . I 'm still the same voice I had before , and I still have a lot to say .

CNN : `` Eleven '' was largely written by you -- something you 've taken on recently . What 's your writing process like ?

McBride : It 's different every time . Sometimes I 'll have an idea or a title . ... I 'm still growing as a writer .

One thing I think I bring to the table is having a certain type of lyric , in that I want the song to feel honest and real . I do n't do it 365 days a year , so I 'm fresh . I also do n't know a lot of the rules , which is probably a good thing . For me , it 's still about discovery . I 'm still in the stage of writing that I 'm discovering , getting confidence as a writer and that I do have some talent for it . It 's a good discovery at this stage of the game .

CNN : And sometimes songwriters who start out at 20 , by 30 they feel like they 're all tapped out .

McBride : I grew up admiring Linda Ronstadt , Pat Benatar , Reba -LRB- McEntire -RRB- . I did n't really grow up enamored only with singer-songwriters .

When I moved to Nashville , it was n't a big deal for me just to find songs by great writers and make them my own . But what I really found with this record was that it 's so nice to not have to wait for someone to write something . Obviously , I love every record I 've made , but I feel like this record is more authentic to me . I do n't know . It 's different than just singing a song after it 's already been written . I 'm excited about that .

CNN : On `` Eleven '' the first single 's called `` Teenage Daughters , '' which is about the trouble they can cause . Did you give your parents any heart attacks growing up ?

McBride : Oh , oh , yeah . So far , my daughter is much better than me . I grew up on a farm in really rural Kansas , where there was nothing to do . Out of boredom , the activities we found to do , were n't exactly the best for my parents to go through . But I think the song 's about -- the teenage experience and wanting that independence and rebelling against the rule is so common , no matter where you are in the world .

CNN : It seems harder these days to be a teenager .

McBride : It 's different . They have a lot of peer pressure . We all did , but they have a cavalier attitude about things . They do n't have the same caution about certain things and are more like `` whatever , it 's not that big a deal . ''

CNN : You were associated with the pop-country movement of the '90s , but listening to `` Eleven '' and looking at your recent output , it does n't seem like you 're interested in that anymore .

McBride : It 's interesting that you say that . I do n't know if I ever stood out to make a particular type of record . Before , I was so dependent on the songs I found and the songs that came in . I was drawn to certain types of songs but I did n't have the luxury of waiting around for years and years . I had a vision of `` Eleven '' being more organic , more retro , like a '70s rock record . It is less pop .

CNN : On the Grammys , you performed a tribute to Aretha Franklin with Christina Aguilera , Florence Welch , Jennifer Hudson and Yolanda Adams . Are there aspects of pop and rock these days you find intriguing ?

McBride : I love Train 's new record . And I love One Republic 's record . My daughter 's really into the Avett Brothers and Mumford & Sons , so I 've been listening to them recently . That 's a whole new type of thing ; I do n't know what you 'd call that .
