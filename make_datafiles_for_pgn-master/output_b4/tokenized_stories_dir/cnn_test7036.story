-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The 32-year-old Texas man who died in a shark attack over the weekend while scuba diving off Western Australia was remembered Sunday by his sisters as `` unique '' and `` one of a kind . ''

Sharon Wainwright of Panama City , Florida , identified the victim as her son , George Thomas Wainwright .

His sisters , Brenda Wainwright and Wanda Brannon , spoke to CNN affiliate WMBB-TV .

`` It 's devastating . It 's hard to even wrap your head around . I ca n't believe he 's gone . I think it was just wrong place , wrong time because he was very wise . I would trust him with anything to do with being on the water , '' said Brenda Wainwright .

She described her brother as `` unique ... that rare combination of incredibly intelligent , very kind , great sense of humor . ''

Police said Saturday the man was scuba diving with two friends near Rottnest Island , a popular tourist destination about 15 miles off the Australian mainland , when the attack occurred .

The man 's friends , who were not in the water at the time , noticed an abnormal amount of air bubbles rising to the surface in the area where he was diving , followed by a plume of blood , said police spokesman Michael Wear .

Moments later , the man 's body rose to the surface . Police said he succumbed to his injuries not long after the incident . Following a preliminary review of bite marks on the body , authorities said he is believed to have been killed by a great white shark .

`` He was in the water by himself , I believe , '' Sgt. Greg True of Western Australia police told CNN affiliate Channel Nine . `` There 's been some pretty massive injuries inflicted . ''

Sharon Wainwright told CNN her family was notified of the incident Saturday morning . Authorities said the man had been living in Western Australia .

Wainright 's relatives expect his body to arrive in Florida in about four days , Sharon Wainwright said .

Saturday 's attack was the second fatal shark attack in the past two weeks near the city of Perth , capital of the state of Western Australia .

`` He was one of a kind , '' the victim 's sister , Brannon , told WMBB .

`` He 's more than just a quick news spot . He was our brother and we loved him . He will be missed . ''
