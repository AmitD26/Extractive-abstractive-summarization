-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities have decided to call off a search-and-rescue mission for nine people who may have plunged into the Pacific Ocean off southern California after a Coast Guard C-130 plane and a Marine AH-1 Cobra helicopter collided Thursday night .

`` I 've reached the conclusion that hope is no longer viable , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Joseph Castillo said Sunday . `` We no longer believe there is any chance somebody could still be alive . ''

California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger offered his condolences to family members of the missing Sunday .

`` Together , we send our thoughts and prayers to their families and friends , '' Schwarzenegger said in a statement . `` Our hearts are with them during this difficult time . ''

Searchers had scoured the ocean for 60 hours without finding any sign of survivors . They reported Saturday that the search had covered 644 square miles . The Navy , Marine Corps and Customs Border Protection helped in the search .

The Coast Guard weighed the exhaustive nature of the search , the wreckage , the nature of the collision , the temperature of the water and the time elapsed . A Coast Guard captain said Friday that survivability could be up to 20 hours .

On Saturday night , relatives of the missing were briefed about the decision to call off the rescue effort . The order was to go into effect as soon as the planes involved in Sunday morning 's dawn search returned about 9 a.m.

Coast Guard pilots had been searching for a missing person in the water . That person was `` reported to have gotten in a dinghy and attempted to row to Catalina -LSB- Island -RSB- , '' Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Farris said Friday . `` We were searching in that area because of the drift that would have naturally occurred after that event . ''

The collision occurred about 7 p.m. Thursday , when the Coast Guard plane with a seven-person crew collided with a Marine AH-1 Cobra helicopter carrying two people .

A pilot not involved in the incident reported seeing a fireball about 7:10 p.m. Thursday near the crash site .

The two Marine pilots were conducting routine training about 15 miles off San Clemente Island when their helicopter collided with the U.S. Coast Guard plane .

Marine Corps Air Station Miramar identified them as Maj. Samuel Leigh and 1st Lt. Thomas Claiborne , both with Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469 .

The Coast Guard 's seven missing personnel were stationed at Coast Guard Air Station Sacramento , California , where their aircraft was based .

Castillo has said that an investigation was beginning with the Marine Corps . A large debris field has been located , and pieces have been collected , the Coast Guard spokesman said .

The Coast Guard identified its seven missing personnel as Lt. Cmdr. Che J. Barnes of Capay , California , aircraft commander ; Lt. Adam W. Bryant of Crewe , Virginia , co-pilot ; Chief Petty Officer John F. Seidman of Stockton , California , flight engineer ; Petty Officer 2nd Class Carl P. Grigonis of Mayfield Heights , Ohio , navigator ; Petty Officer 2nd Class Monica L. Beacham of Decaturville , Tennessee , radio operator ; Petty Officer 2nd Class Jason S.
