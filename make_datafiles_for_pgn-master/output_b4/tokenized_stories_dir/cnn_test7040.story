-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Good things come to those who wait .

And that 's exactly what viewers will be doing when TV 's best midseason offering , `` Good Christian Belles , '' aka `` GCB , '' debuts March 4 on ABC .

Reminiscent of `` Desperate Housewives '' in its less desperate heyday , `` GCB '' follows Amanda Vaughn -LRB- Leslie Bibb -RRB- , a woman who ruled in high school but has since been humbled by life when her marriage ends in scandal and she has to return home to Dallas .

Unfortunately for Amanda , a mother of two , her former `` frenemies '' - turned-socialites and their husbands have n't quite evolved , and they do everything they can to make her life miserable . Emmy - and Tony-winning actress Kristin Chenoweth stars as one of Amanda 's rivals , and Annie Potts steals scenes as Amanda 's meddlesome mother . The show is based on a best-selling book from Kim Gatlin .

While `` Good Christian Belles '' is the best , it 's not the only show to look forward to this winter .

NBC 's `` 30 Rock '' is returning at 8 p.m. ET Thursday for a sixth season , TNT 's gritty cop drama `` Southland '' will be back at 10 p.m. ET January 17 for a fourth season , and the 11th season of `` American Idol '' resumes at 8 p.m. ET January 18 and 19 on Fox .

There are also a slew of new offerings to sort through . For your channel-surfing pleasure , we 've selected the good , the bad and the forgettable :

The good

• `` The Firm '' -LRB- debuts 9 p.m. ET Sunday , NBC -RRB- : Based on the best-selling novel by John Grisham , this intense and sometimes cluttered courtroom drama , follows attorney Mitchell McDeere -LRB- this time played by Josh Lucas of `` The Lincoln Lawyer '' instead of Tom Cruise -RRB- a decade after he brought down a prestigious Memphis law firm . Every week , Mitch will fight for his clients but with a twist because the mob wants him dead as does a shadowy organization behind one of his controversial cases .

Do n't worry . It sounds more complicated than it is , and Lucas is a treat to watch .

• `` House of Lies '' -LRB- debuts 10 p.m. ET Sunday , Showtime -RRB- : Don Cheadle -LRB- `` Crash '' -RRB- and Kristen Bell -LRB- `` Veronica Mars '' -RRB- have undeniable chemistry in this testosterone heavy , raunchy comedy about a cutthroat business consultant -LRB- Cheadle -RRB- .

• `` Alcatraz '' -LRB- debuts 8 p.m. ET January 16 , Fox -RRB- : America 's most infamous prison becomes a time-travel portal in this trippy but fun new sci-fi drama from none other than J.J. Abrams -LRB- `` Lost '' and `` Fringe '' -RRB- . `` Alcatraz '' stars Sam Neill -LRB- `` Jurassic Park '' -RRB- and Jorge Garcia of `` Lost '' fame .

• `` Luck '' -LRB- debuts 9 p.m. ET January 29 , HBO -RRB- : The latest creation from David Milch -LRB- `` Deadwood '' -RRB- , `` Luck '' stars Oscar-winning actor Dustin Hoffman -LRB- `` Rain Man , '' `` Kramer vs. Kramer '' -RRB- as a gangster of sorts . Hoffman leads a stellar cast that includes Nick Nolte and Dennis Farina in this methodical and fascinating drama about horse racing and the troubled people who inhabit that world .

• `` Smash '' -LRB- debuts 10 p.m. ET February 6 , NBC -RRB- : Executive producer Steven Spielberg and NBC hope to steal the spotlight from `` Glee '' with this exciting new music-driven drama . `` Smash '' follows a Broadway musical from its planning stages to the big stage and stars Debra Messing and Oscar-winning actress Anjelica Huston -LRB- `` Prizzi 's Honor '' -RRB- .

The bad

• `` Work It '' -LRB- airs 8:30 p.m. ET Tuesdays , ABC -RRB- : Two unemployed men -LRB- Ben Koldyke and Amaury Nolasco -RRB- dress as women to get jobs in a sluggish economy . But `` Bosom Buddies '' was better when it debuted in 1980 .

• `` Are You There , Chelsea ? '' -LRB- debuts 8:30 p.m. ET Wednesday , NBC -RRB- : Based on comedic actress Chelsea Handler 's best-selling and mostly autobiographical books , this mildly funny new comedy follows a 20-something -LRB- Laura Prepon of `` That '70s Show '' -RRB- who parties as hard as she drinks . What 's even less appealing is that Handler stars in the sitcom too but does n't play herself . Good luck with that .

• `` Rob '' -LRB- debuts 8:30 p.m. ET Thursday , CBS -RRB- : This new sitcom is n't offensive because of its liberal use of stereotypes .

It 's offensive because it is unfunny and unoriginal . `` Rob '' follows a man -LRB- Rob Schneider -RRB- who marries a Latina and fails to fit in with her family .

• `` The River '' -LRB- debuts 9 p.m. ET February 7 , ABC -RRB- : Bruce Greenwood -LRB- `` Star Trek '' the movie -RRB- stars as an explorer and wildlife TV host who goes missing in the Amazon jungle . Leslie Hope -LRB- `` 24 '' -RRB- plays his wife , a woman determined to find him who heads to the Amazon with a reality TV crew and her son -LRB- Joe Anderson of `` The Crazies '' -RRB- . Instead , she finds lots of ghosts and questions .

The forgettable

• `` The Finder '' -LRB- debuts 9 p.m. ET Thursday , Fox -RRB- : Geoff Stults -LRB- `` Happy Town '' -RRB- and Michael Clarke Duncan -LRB- `` The Green Mile '' -RRB- star in this dull but well-intentioned spinoff of `` Bones . ''

• `` Fashion Star '' -LRB- debuts 10 p.m. ET March 13 , NBC -RRB- : In a lopsided attempt to imitate `` Project Runway , '' former supermodel Elle Macpherson has created this reality competition series that features celebrity mentors Jessica Simpson and Nicole Richie .

Yawn .
