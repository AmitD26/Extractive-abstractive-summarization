Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The father of actress Lindsay Lohan was arrested in connection with a domestic dispute , authorities said Tuesday .

Michael Lohan , 50 , was arrested late Monday , the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department 's West Hollywood Station said in a statement .

Deputies arrested him on suspicion of inflicting corporal injury on a cohabitant , false imprisonment and preventing the report of victimization , the statement said . All are felony charges .

Bail was set at $ 200,000 , the statement said , but authorities said Tuesday afternoon Lohan had not been booked . He was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after he complained of `` a medical condition not related to the incident '' following his arrest .

He will remain at the hospital on observation for at least 24 hours before he is booked at the West Hollywood Station , police said .

The sheriff 's department did not identify the alleged victim . But Kate Major , Lohan 's former fiancee , told CNN she was the victim . `` I can confirm but barely type , '' Major wrote in an e-mail . `` No other comment . ''

The alleged victim suffered minor injuries but refused medical treatment , the sheriff 's department said .

Lohan was arrested near West Hollywood Station following the incident when deputies saw him walking on Santa Monica Boulevard , the statement said .

The relationship between Michael Lohan and his 24-year-old daughter has been publicly strained for years , although the two did undergo family counseling together during her recent treatment at the Betty Ford Center .

Lindsay Lohan must decide by Wednesday if she will accept a plea deal that would send her to jail or move closer to a trial on a felony grand theft charge . She is accused of walking out without paying for a $ 2,500 necklace from Kamofie and Co. , a jewelry store in Venice , California , on January 22 .

If Lindsay Lohan decides to go to trial , a preliminary hearing will be held April 22 . The judge at that time would also consider the matter of her probation violation ; she faces possible jail time for violating her probation for a drunk-driving arrest because of the theft charge .
