-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Double world champion Sebastian Vettel suffered a disrupted second practice session ahead of Sunday 's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix , with McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton setting the pace on Friday .

Red Bull driver Vettel was back at the track where he claimed the first of his two world championships 12 months ago -- the youngest driver to achieve the feat -- but the German spun out on the first corner of the Yas Marina Circuit .

Vettel , who has won 11 of 17 races in 2011 , recovered to rejoin practice with 10 minutes remaining , but finished in sixth position on a track where he has won for the past two years . He ended the day half a second behind Hamilton 's leading time of one minute 39.586 secs .

Hamilton , world champion in 2008 but only fifth overall after a disappointing season , led second-placed teammate Jenson Button ahead of Saturday 's qualifying .

`` I lost the car on the entrance to turn one , '' Vettel , who clinched the 2011 championship with third place in Japan last month , told the sport 's official website .

`` I think I was too wide and too far on to the kerb , so I lost the rear and could n't catch the car anymore . I was lucky to get out again at the end of P2 ; there was n't much damage apart from the front wing . ''

British racer Hamilton was pleased with his form and was confident ahead of this season 's penultimate race .

`` It was a really positive day for me , '' the 26-year-old said . `` The track just got better and better today , so I slowly chipped away at the set-up .

`` The tires are behaving well -- at the last race I had degradation and did n't have the pace , so it feels much better this weekend . That 's a real positive for me .

`` When you come through a Friday without any problems , it definitely makes you feel confident for the rest of the weekend . ''

Button , the 2009 world champion and running second this year , admitted to experimenting during his practice run on a track where passing has traditionally been difficult .

`` I was playing around with overtaking on my long run , '' the 31-year-old said . `` But I still reckon it 'll be difficult to overtake people in the DRS zones .

`` So I think it 's going to be a bit of a struggle to make moves stick in the race -- which means it 's going to be important to qualify up at the front . It 's tricky around here , but we made some good progress here this afternoon and evening . ''

Ferrari 's Fernando Alonso also slid off having spent a short period leading the field . The double world champion eventually came home third ahead of Brazilian teammate Felipe Massa .

Vettel 's fellow Red Bull driver Mark Webber was fifth fastest , with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher seventh for Mercedes .

The 2011 campaign will finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Sao Paulo on November 27 .
