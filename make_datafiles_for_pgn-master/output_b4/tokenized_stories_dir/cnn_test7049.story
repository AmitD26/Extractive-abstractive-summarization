-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Need more evidence that Facebook 's real-name-only policy has its flaws ? Well , here you go :

A few days ago , Facebook allegedly kicked famous author Salman Rushdie off of its social network , and then asked him to change his posted name to Ahmed if he wanted to return .

Rushdie -- known for his outspokenness -- went on a rant about the incident on Twitter , where he has more than 100,000 followers . Facebook eventually `` buckled , '' he wrote Monday .

Here 's a play-by-play of what happened , according to Rushdie 's Twitter feed , which I condensed :

`` Amazing . 2 days ago FB deactivated my page saying they did n't believe I was me . I had to send a photo of my passport page , '' he wrote . `` Then they said yes , I was me , but insisted I use the name Ahmed which appears before Salman on my passport and which I have never used .

`` Now they have reactivated my FB page as ` Ahmed Rushdie , ' in spite of the world knowing me as Salman . Morons . @MarkZuckerbergF ? Are you listening ? ''

Facebook did not respond to CNN 's request for comment on the incident .

On Tuesday , his Facebook page , with `` Salman '' as his first name , appeared to have been reactivated by the social network .

Rushdie rose to international notoriety in the 1980s after his novel , `` The Satanic Verses , '' stirred protests throughout the Muslim world . The Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran issued a fatwa against Rushdie because of the book .

His recent tussle raises issues with Facebook 's policy of requiring people to use their real names when registering with the social network . People who do n't use their real names are found to be out of compliance with Facebook 's rules and can have their accounts deactivated .

`` Facebook users provide their real names and information , and we need your help to keep it that way , '' Facebook 's terms of service document says .

Rushdie 's situation shows how difficult it can be for people to prove who they are . He submitted his passport to Facebook , he wrote , and still had problems .

Supporters of democratic protests in the Middle East and elsewhere have criticized Facebook and other social networks like Google + for their real-name policies , saying they prevent people from organizing against authoritarian governments that could use a network like Facebook to crack down .

If they could use pseudonyms , they would be safer , some say .

`` There are myriad reasons why individuals may wish to use a name other than the one they were born with , '' Jillian York wrote on the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's blog in July . `` They may be concerned about threats to their lives or livelihoods , or they may risk political or economic retribution . They may wish to prevent discrimination or they may use a name that 's easier to pronounce or spell in a given culture . ''

Facebook always has maintained its position as an `` identity network . '' A core philosophy of the site is that people should be themselves -- and should be accountable for their posts with their real names .

Rushdie 's case shows how tricky enforcement can be , though .

`` This is the sort of thing that makes you wonder what real names policy is all about , '' Alexis Madrigal wrote on The Atlantic 's website . He added : `` Seriously , what is the point of forcing Salman Rushdie to go by Ahmed Rushdie ? How does this benefit the social Web ? ''

Rushdie taunted Facebook on Twitter before the site relented and reposted his page .

`` Dear #Facebook , forcing me to change my FB name from Salman to Ahmed Rushdie is like forcing J. Edgar to become John Hoover , '' he wrote . `` Or , if F. Scott Fitzgerald was on #Facebook , would they force him to be Francis Fitzgerald ? What about F. Murray Abraham ? ''

He later declared his win over the social network :

`` Victory ! #Facebook has buckled ! I 'm Salman Rushdie again . I feel SO much better . An identity crisis at my age is no fun . Thank you Twitter ! ''
