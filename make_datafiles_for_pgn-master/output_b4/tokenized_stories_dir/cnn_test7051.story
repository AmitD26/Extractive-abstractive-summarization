-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Manchester United 's hopes of retaining the Premier League title suffered a setback on Wednesday as the English champions slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Newcastle .

Superb strikes from Demba Ba and Yohan Cabaye plus a late Phil Jones own goal earned the home side a deserved victory and condemned United to a second successive loss following Saturday 's shock 3-2 home defeat by bottom club Blackburn .

The result , United 's first away reverse this season , left Alex Ferguson 's second-placed team three points behind rivals Manchester City , with Tottenham in third another three points behind with a game in hand .

Early season pace-setters Newcastle came into the match on the back of a poor recent run of just one win in eight matches , a sequence which had seen Alan Pardew 's side slump to seventh in the table .

Who are the top January transfer targets ?

But they were always the dominant side against a disjointed United , and it was no surprise when the hosts took a 33rd-minute lead when top scorer Ba superbly swiveled on the edge of the area before smashing home his 15th goal of the season .

Newcastle doubled the lead early in the second half with another spectacular goal , as Cabaye curled home a delightful long-range free-kick that hit the underside of the crossbar before bouncing over the goal-line of keeper Anders Lindegaard -- who was recalled in place of David De Gea .

United 's miserable night was complete in the final minute when a long ball from Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was turned into his own net by England defender Jones .

Newcastle remained in seventh place , though now just a point behind Liverpool .

In Wednesday 's other English Premier League match , Bolton moved off the bottom after recovering from a goal behind to win 2-1 at Everton .

The home side took a 63rd-minute lead in freak circumstances when Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard 's long clearance flew over his opposite number Adam Bogdan and into the net .

However , former Liverpool striker David Ngog leveled for the visitors just four minutes later before captain Gary Cahill -- who has been linked with a move to Chelsea during the transfer window -- smashed home the winner with 12 minutes remaining .

In Spain , Barcelona put one foot into the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey with a 4-0 victory at home to Osasuna in the first leg of their last-16 tie .

Cesc Fabregas netted twice in the first half and Lionel Messi came off the substitutes ' bench to add another couple after the break to give Pep Guardiola 's side a healthy advantage ahead of next week 's return match .
