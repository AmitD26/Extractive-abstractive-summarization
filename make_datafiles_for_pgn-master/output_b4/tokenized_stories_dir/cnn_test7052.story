-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Holy moly , America .

For the first time since Christmas weekend in 2008 , four movies debuted to more than $ 20 million each this weekend : `` The Vow , '' `` Safe House , '' `` Journey 2 : The Mysterious Island , '' and `` Star Wars : Episode I -- The Phantom Menace 3D . ''

The first three of those four films far exceeded industry expectations , helping to make this the biggest non-holiday February weekend ever . The box office was also up around 30 percent compared to the same weekend last year .

`` The Vow , '' starring Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum , led the way with a hearty $ 41.7 million -- the strongest opening so far this year . That also marks the best debut ever for the Sony-owned label Screen Gems -LRB- beating `` Dear John 's '' $ 30.5 million -RRB- , which produced the film with Spyglass Entertainment .

With Valentine 's Day around the corner , audiences were clearly in the mood for love , especially considering that `` The Vow '' was the first major romantic drama to hit theaters since November 's `` The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 . '' According to Sony , 72 percent of `` The Vow 's '' audience was female . The PG-13 movie , which cost $ 30 million to produce , received an okay `` B '' rating from CinemaScore graders .

Not too far behind was the Denzel Washington thriller `` Safe House , '' which took in $ 39.3 million . That represents the second-best opening ever for Washington , after 2007â € ² s `` American Gangster . '' According to CinemaScore , 72 percent of moviegoers said the actor was their reason for buying a ticket , confirming Washington 's status as one of the few performers who can guarantee a solid turnout .

The R-rated movie , which cost $ 85 million and also stars Ryan Reynolds and Vera Farmiga , attracted a diverse crowd . African Americans made up 38 percent of the audience , followed by Caucasians -LRB- 31 percent -RRB- and Hispanics -LRB- 23 percent -RRB- . The film 's audience was evenly split fifty-fifty between men and women , and CinemaScore participants gave it an `` A - '' rating .

`` Journey 2 : The Mysterious Island , '' which saw Dwayne Johnson take over leading-man duties from Brendan Fraser , surprised the industry with $ 27.6 million . By comparison , its 2008 predecessor `` Journey to the Center of the Earth '' opened to $ 21 million . Of particular note , the PG-rated sequel rose a massive 94 percent from Friday to Saturday , indicating that it was the movie of choice for family audiences . `` Journey 2 '' also performed particularly well in 3-D , with three-dimensional showings accounting for 74 percent of its gross . The $ 79 million film received an `` A - '' grade from CinemaScore moviegoers .

The only new movie that did n't overperform this weekend was the 3-D re-release of `` Star Wars : Episode I -- The Phantom Menace , '' which collected $ 23 million . The film was front-loaded , dropping 1 percent from Friday to Saturday as `` Star Wars '' enthusiasts rushed out to see it opening day . But family audiences clearly opted for `` Journey 2 '' over Jar Jar and company .

Still , $ 23 million is nothing to get upset about , Anakin , especially for a re-release . The figure tops last month 's 3-D re-release of `` Beauty and the Beast '' , which debuted to $ 17.8 million . And `` The Phantom Menace '' jumped past `` E.T. : The Extra-Terrestrial '' and Shrek 2 on the all-time domestic list . With a total of $ 454.1 million , the movie is now the fifth-highest grossing domestic release ever -LRB- not adjusted for inflation , of course -RRB- , and it will soon pass `` Star Wars '' -LRB- $ 461 million -RRB- to settle into the No. 4 spot .

Among holdovers , `` Chronicle '' dropped only 44 percent for $ 12.3 million . That 's an impressive hold for a `` found-footage '' film ; by comparison , `` The Devil Inside '' plummeted 76 percent and `` Paranormal Activity 3 '' slid 66 percent . The PG-13 movie has so far earned $ 40.2 million on a $ 12 million budget . And `` The Woman in Black , '' starring Daniel Radcliffe , fell 51 percent for $ 10.3 million -- a respectable decline for a horror film .

In limited release , the Woody Harrelson cop drama Rampart opened to a so-so $ 65,100 at five theaters . Two Oscar nominees , `` In Darkness '' -LRB- for foreign-language film -RRB- and `` Chico & Rita '' -LRB- for animated feature -RRB- , debuted to $ 27,600 and $ 21,700 , respectively .

1 . `` The Vow '' -- $ 41.7 mil

2 . `` Safe House '' -- $ 39.3 mil

3 . `` Journey 2 : The Mysterious Island '' -- $ 27.6 mil

4 . `` Star Wars : Episode I -- The Phantom Menace 3D '' -- $ 23.0 mil
