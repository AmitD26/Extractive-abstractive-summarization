LONDON , England -- Graffiti artist Banksy , famed for infiltrating museum collections without their knowledge and spray-painting public buildings around the world , is holding his first major exhibition in years .

A Banksy painting of the British House of Commons at England 's Bristol museum .

This time , however , the anonymous artist worked in tandem with the director of Bristol museum in the UK .

CNN 's Max Foster got a preview of his largest project to date .

The artist 's anonymity gained him notoriety and he became one of the art world 's biggest names with his works selling at auction for hundreds of thousands of dollars .

The exhibition 's range , while very varied , remained true to Banksy form with his usual unconventional take on art . See pictures from Banksy 's exhibition ''

`` I think we might have dragged them down to our level rather than being elevated to theirs '' Banksy , who is thought to be from Bristol , said about the museum .

He filled three stories of the building with his art in 36 hours under tight security , as only a few museum staff were aware of the shows ' imminent arrival .

His work is hidden among the museum 's usual exhibits and is split into different rooms , including installations , paintings and sculptures .

In one of the paintings , a character has been cut out and is instead sitting on the painting 's frame , perhaps taking a break from posing ?

Another piece , which at first glance , looks like a copy of an ancient classical statue , is in fact a woman over-loaded with countless shopping bags as she browses for yet another item .

Perhaps the most controversial , yet equally light-hearted piece , is a painting of the British Parliamentary House of Commons , filled with chimpanzees who are looking surprisingly `` ministerial . ''

`` You paint a hundred chimpanzees and they call you a guerilla artist , '' Banksy said .

While one of the more poignant installations is that of Tweety , the Warner Bros. animated character famous for his upbeat personality and energy , looking old and life-less .

`` This show is my vision of the future , '' the artist said .

Banksy is unlikely to show up at the exhibition as he attempts to retain his anonymity .

But while we may never know his identity , with this latest show , Banksy has definitely shown yet another facet of his personality .
