YANAGAWA , Japan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Wearing a Nashville School of Law T-shirt , Christopher Savoie walked into a second-floor police interrogation room . In one corner , a stopwatch was running to hold him to the 15 minutes allotted for the interview .

A Tennessee court awarded Christopher Savoie custody of his son , Isaac , and daughter , Rebecca .

`` I 'm so scared , '' he said .

Savoie chose his words carefully , lest police Officer Toshihiro Tanaka cut short the rare interview Savoie was granted with CNN on Thursday . There were so many rules : No recording devices . No tough questions . Speak only in Japanese .

`` I want Americans to know what 's happening to me , '' Savoie continued in Japanese . `` I did n't do anything wrong . Children have the right to see both parents . It 's very important for my children to know both parents . ''

But Japanese authorities disagree .

They have charged Savoie , 38 , a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen , with kidnapping his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his estranged wife , Noriko , was walking them to school Monday in Yanagawa , a rural town in southern Japan . Watch what else Savoie had to say ''

He headed for the nearest U.S. consulate , in the city of Fukuoka , to try to obtain passports for the children , screaming at the guards to let him in the compound . He was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil .

Japanese police , alerted by his estranged wife , arrested him .

The Savoies were divorced in Tennessee in January after 14 years of marriage .

Christopher Savoie had visitation rights with his children , but after he returned from a short summer trip , his estranged wife fled to Japan with the children , according to court documents . A United States court then granted sole custody to Savoie . Watch why the case is complicated ''

Japanese law , however , recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian , regardless of the U.S. court order . The law there also follows a tradition of sole custody divorces . When the couple splits , one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children .

Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan , because they never divorced there , police said Wednesday . And , police said , the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports .

A 1980 Hague Convention standardized laws on international child abduction . But Japan is not a party to that agreement . Savoie was out of luck .

If a child in Japan is taken against the wishes of the recognized Japanese parent , the person who took the child is considered an abductor .

`` Japanese people think she 's the victim here , '' Savoie said . `` In the States , my ex-wife is the one who 's in the wrong . ''

U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley recognized this case as a difficult one . Even though the United States has strong ties with Japan , on this particular issue , the two nations ' points of view could not differ more , he said .

In Yanagawa , those who have heard about the abduction case tend to side with the woman .

`` They belong with their real mother , '' said one woman , herself a mother of two children .

But most have not heard of the case , because it has not been reported in local newspapers or on television .

Savoie 's attorney , Tadashi Yoshino , knows the cultural divide will be hard to overcome .

`` He technically may have committed a crime according to Japanese law but he should n't be indicted , '' Yoshino said . `` He did it for the love of his children . ''

Savoie , a law student who already has a Ph.D. and a M.D. , will spend 10 days in jail while Japanese prosecutors sort out the details of the case .

In the interrogation room , Savoie appeared exhausted . Tears welled in his eyes . He glanced over at the police officer , then paused to regain composure .

`` I love you , Isaac , Rebecca , '' he said . `` Your daddy loves you forever . I 'll be patient and strong until the day comes that I can see you both again . I am very sorry that I ca n't be with you . ''

He was grateful be able to get the words out . Moments earlier , the interview had almost ended after Savoie blurted out in English : `` I love you , '' a message intended for his current wife , Amy , in Nashville .

Then , as is Japanese custom , he bowed . And from the other side of the glass barrier , he gave a thumbs up , mouthing the words , `` Thank you . ''
