To : Interested parties From : John King , CNN chief national correspondent Re : Monday Memo

Should the U.S. expand its forces in Afghanistan ? That will be the debate this week .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What you 'll see in Washington in this week is a White House focus on health care and jobs . What you wo n't see -- or see much of , at any rate -- is just as critical a challenge for the administration .

On Wednesday and then again on Friday , President Obama will meet with his national security team to continue deliberations about Afghanistan strategy , including whether to commit as many as 40,000 more U.S. troops to what not too long ago was `` the forgotten war '' but is now front and center .

`` Ideally , it 's better for military advice to come up through the chain of command , '' National Security Adviser James Jones told us Sunday when asked whether the very public request for more troops from the commanding general in Afghanistan had complicated the White House deliberations .

Significantly , Jones , a retired Marine Corps general , offered what sounded like a more optimistic asssement of the security challenges in Afghanistan than the commander asking for more troops , Gen. Stanley McChrystal .

`` I do n't foresee the return of the Taliban , '' Jones said .

As for al Qaeda and its strength within Afghanistan , Jones added : `` Very diminished . The maximum estimate is less than 100 reported operating in the country . No bases . No buildings to launch attacks on either us or our allies . ''

His comments left little doubt Jones is not only less than thrilled about McChrystal 's public appeals , he also is among those skeptical of sending more troops . Suffice to say those private strategy meetings warrant considerable attention .

Easier to see will be presidential and vice presidential events pushing health care reform and promoting the administration 's stimulus plan as , contrary to what Republicans say , a cushion keeping a sluggish economy from taking an even bigger toll on American workers and families .

Obama will make a new health care push Monday from the White House , joined by doctors from around the country . Vice President Joe Biden continues his role as stimulus cheerleader , from Connecticut on Monday . Also of note :

• The first new Supreme Court term of the Obama presidency kicks off , and Sonia Sotomayor gets down to official business as the nation 's first Hispanic high court justice .

• The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday discusses potential new sanctions against Iran , proof of congressional skepticism even though Iran over the weekend agreed to let international inspectors visit its recently disclosed uranium enrichment plant .

• Wednesday is the eighth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Afghanistan .

• Wednesday also brings the Federal Reserve 's latest report on consumer credit .

Enjoy the week .
