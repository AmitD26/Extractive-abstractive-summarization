-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A conservative billionaire businessman and a former center-left president will face off in a runoff election in Chile 's presidential race , based on official early results released Sunday .

With more than 98 percent of polling stations counted , billionaire businessman Sebastian Pinera led ex-president Eduardo Frei with 44 percent of the vote to Frei 's 30 percent , Chile 's interior ministry reported .

`` This is a victory for all the Chileans who want change , '' Pinera said Sunday night .

Frei began campaigning for the second-round immediately , asking in a speech for the supporters of the two other candidates who had their presidential ambitions dashed to join his cause .

Frei said if he is elected , women and young people will have an important role in his government .

He explicitly asked for those who voted for Marco Enriquez-Ominami and Jorge Arrate , who were eliminated in Sunday 's ballot , to vote for him in the runoff .

In a concession speech , Enriquez-Ominami said that he would not endorse either candidate .

The winner will follow the footsteps of a very popular president , Michelle Bachelet , who will be leaving office with high approval ratings for steering the country through the global economic downturn , and promoting progressive social reforms . Under Chile 's constitutional term limits , a president can not run for a second consecutive term .

Bachelet endorsed Frei , a member of her same left-leaning coalition , but another leftist candidate who ran as an independent -- Enriquez-Ominami -- made an impressive run , pulling in 20 percent of the vote and splitting votes for the ruling party .

Those who voted for him , `` have affirmed the desire for Chile to move forward and toward the future , '' he said .

If Pinera triumphs in the expected January runoff election , it would mark the first time since the fall of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship that a conservative wins at the polls . In the 19 years since Pinochet 's fall , all the presidents have come from the left-leaning coalition .

Pinera , 60 , is one of the country 's wealthiest businessmen who previously served as a senator and president of the National Renovation party .

Since completing one term as president , Frei returned to politics as a Christian Democrat senator who has campaigned on continuing Bachelet 's policies .

While Frei and Pinera were household names before the election , it was the 36-year-old Enriquez-Ominami who made a political name for himself in this presidential election .

He worked as a television director before being elected as a congressman for the Socialist party in 2005 . The son of a guerrilla leader from the 1970s , Enriquez-Ominami forged his own political path , breaking from the leftist coalition and running on his own .

A fourth candidate , Arrate of the Communist Party , garnered 6 percent of Sunday 's vote , according to the early vote figures .
