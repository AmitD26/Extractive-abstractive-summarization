RIO DE JANEIRO , Brazil -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An American man fighting for custody of his 9-year-old son has been invited to spend Christmas with the boy 's Brazilian family , the family 's attorney said Friday .

David Goldman has been locked in a legal battle over custody of his son , Sean Goldman , with the family of the boy 's deceased mother .

The family 's attorney , Sergio Tostes , said Friday that the legal battle had gone too far .

`` It is about time that Sean 's family , and I mean all Sean 's family , get together . I am authorized by Mrs. Silvana Bianchi to invite you , Mr. Goldman , to spend Christmas night at her house , '' Tostes said , referring to Sean 's maternal grandmother . `` This will be a long awaited family reunion ''

`` I hope you can accept and we can talk logistics , '' he said , with the boy 's grandmother standing next to him .

Tostes also said that the family would consider allowing the boy to go to the United States , perhaps for the holidays , if Sean wants to go . However , `` Sean must be heard in court , '' he said .

There was no immediate response from Goldman .

Earlier Friday , Goldman slammed a decision by a Brazilian Supreme Court justice Thursday that prevented the boy 's return to the United States . That decision had `` nothing to do with the merits '' of the case , he said .

On Wednesday , a lower court unanimously upheld a decision ordering that Sean be returned to his father in New Jersey . That decision was made in accordance with the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abductions .

`` Every day that my son is under that roof , he is being severely psychologically damaged , '' Goldman said . He insisted that there is the `` utmost urgency '' for Sean to be reunited with him .

`` My son is suffering , and he 's losing the innocence of ... a child , '' Goldman said .

The family argues that it would traumatize Sean to remove him from what has been his home since 2004 , when his mother took him to Brazil on what she said would be a vacation .

The family said Sean screamed with joy when he found out Thursday that he would not have to leave with his dad .

The custody battle began in 2004 , when Goldman 's wife , Bruna Bianchi , took their then-4-year-old son from their home in New Jersey to Rio de Janeiro for what was to have been a two-week vacation . She never returned , instead remarrying there and retaining custody of Sean . She died last year in childbirth .

Goldman has argued that as the sole surviving parent , he should at last be granted custody .

Instead of traveling to Brasilia , where the high court is , Goldman planned to stay in Rio de Janeiro on Friday , where he is just miles from Sean .

He has n't seen his son since February .

Rep. Chris Smith , R-New Jersey , who is traveling with Goldman , said three court-appointed psychologists tasked with determining the boy 's emotional and psychological well-being had unanimously concluded that he is being hurt emotionally `` by the continuance of this abduction . ''

Smith said Sean was previously put in front of a video camera as adults asked questions . The boy made remarks in that video that members of his mother 's family suggest indicate he should stay in Brazil .

If the court allows a child 's drawings or such a videotape to be used as evidence in a courtroom , Smith said , `` every kidnapper everywhere in the world -- every child abductor in the world '' would have the children make such things .

Goldman also addressed the videotape : `` What is he going to say ? ` No , I hate it here , ' knowing he 'll go back up under their roof ? What do you expect ? He is an innocent , helpless , vulnerable , defenseless child that needs to be freed from this circumstance . ''

Smith called on Brazil 's full Supreme Court to `` vacate this illogical and unjust stay on the rightful return of Sean Goldman to his only dad . ''

If the court does not do so , Smith said , he and Goldman hope Chief Justice Gilmar Mendes will .

Smith also said Brazil 's Central Authority , which represents interests of the International Court of Justice in the country , planned to appeal to get the justice 's stay lifted .

Brazil 's Central Authority did not immediately return calls seeking comment Friday .

Goldman described how he longed to bring his son home in time for Christmas , to play with him in the yard , to go to movies and eat popcorn .

Smith said that all the `` surveillance '' present at the time of the February visit -- including a psychologist that the family had `` almost right next to David and Sean the whole time '' -- made it `` an oppressive situation . ''

`` David ought to be with his son , not on a visit but permanently , '' Smith said .

The family has said Goldman can visit his son .

`` It 's not about going to a compound with a man standing over us , intimidating my son '' and `` making him nervous , '' Goldman said .

He added that when his son `` was abducted , '' he would cry , `` I want to be with my dad . ''

In separating the child from him , `` You poison the child 's mind , '' he said .

The case has drawn attention worldwide .

Smith called it a `` major embarrassment to the Brazilian government . ''

Goldman said he holds out hope that he will be able to take Sean home so the two `` can go on with our life as father and son . ''

`` I 'm ... begging for justice , begging , '' he said . `` Why is it so hard ? Why ? ''
