LAS VEGAS , Nevada -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The theater was packed as Garth Brooks shared stories about why he decided to officially step out of retirement after nine years .

Garth Brooks played two secret concerts in Vegas earlier this summer . Now he 's signed on for an engagement .

Camera crews and journalists filled the front section . Executives flanked the sides . And then smack dab in the middle of the audience was a row of chefs , enthusiastically applauding in their toques and kitchen whites .

Yes , the media was buzzing about the much-anticipated announcement , but hotel employees at the Wynn Encore in Las Vegas were equally excited -- maybe even more so , because of the part they played in persuading the country music superstar to enter into a five-year weekend residency at the establishment beginning December 11 .

This summer , as the media threw itself head-first into the death of Michael Jackson , the Oklahoma native quietly took the stage at the 1,500-seat Encore Theater in two hush-hush shows attended by hotel workers . One was an intimate acoustic performance ; the other a concert with his full band .

He sang . He charmed . He won over staffers who never thought they 'd be caught dead tapping their toes to country music . And that , ladies and gentleman , exemplifies the uncanny ability of Garth Brooks to connect with human beings , and explains why he -- not Michael Jackson -- is the best-selling solo artist of all time in any genre . -LRB- You can look it up . -RRB-

`` I think my gift truly is I 'm an average guy . What I like , an average guy likes . It 's that simple . The music that I love , I find that most guys around me love , too , '' he told CNN in his dressing room after Thursday 's news conference in Las Vegas .

There 's a big old-fashioned star on the door that says `` Garth Brooks . '' It suits him . Even though he 's pushed boundaries and rewritten rules in the music industry , he 's still an old-fashioned guy with old-fashioned values -- work hard , stay humble and family first . It 's the latter that led to his decision to hang up his mic and his Stetson in 2000 .

`` We were retiring because I got ta get back to Oklahoma and raise my girls . Sandy and I were getting a divorce at the time , so I could n't expect her to do my job for me any longer , '' he said . `` We told the people that 's what I 'm going to do , and the people -- 99 percent of them -- said , ` Go . Go do what you got ta do . We 'll be here when you get back , ' and we 'll see if they are . '' Watch Brooks talk about new course ''

Brooks ' three daughters -- Taylor , August and Allie -- are now 17 , 15 and 13 . When he retired , he famously stated that he wanted to be able to drive his kids to school every day . His new Friday-through-Sunday gig will allow him to keep his pledge of seeing them off to class until they head to college .

Of course , the commute from his farm in Owasso , Oklahoma , to Vegas will be made a little faster with his new private jet -- an 11-seat Challenger , courtesy of Steve Wynn , the billionaire CEO of Wynn Hotels .

`` I do n't know anything about jets , '' Brooks downplayed with a shrug . `` It 's got a cool interior , cool paint job , I do n't know . But it gets me here -LRB- to Vegas -RRB- , and it gets me home to see my girls . And so in that case , it 's fabulous . ''

`` He 's been happy being at home , attending every soccer game and knowing what his kids like to eat for breakfast , '' said singer Trisha Yearwood , whom he married in 2005 . `` We both came from a family where our parents were there every single day , and so we do n't know any other way . ''

On most weekends , Yearwood will be making the two-hour trip to Sin City -- and every now and again , she 'll make an appearance with her husband on stage .

`` It 's a ` Beauty and the Beast ' thing , you know ? '' said Brooks . `` I can start a song in one octave and end it up in three keys , not knowing that I 've changed . She 's precision -- perfect with feeling -- and that 's impressive to anybody you bring out . ''

From time to time , Brooks will bring out special guests , but for the most part , it 's a one-man show -- just him , an acoustic guitar and a bunch of great songs and intimate stories .

And , of course , there 's the audience .

`` As long as my gift is here , as long as I open my mouth and it works , '' he said , `` then I think my job is to keep doing it , you know ? ''
