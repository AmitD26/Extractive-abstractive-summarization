-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Did you know that there exists an all-natural remedy for memory loss ? Weight gain ? Macular degeneration ? Prostate enlargement ? These products are so successful that clinical testing has already begun ! Just listen to the following testimonial from an unidentified person ...

As these ads blare at you from your favorite AM radio station , perhaps you wonder : How can this be legal ? Since the late 1960s , aspirin makers have been trying to win the right to tell the public that a daily low-dose tablet can help prevent heart disease . They have been told no , and no , and no again .

Federal regulators are so nervous about over-selling aspirin 's benefits that they have restricted statements about aspirin to the most bland and basic . Yet while the statements about aspirin have to be cushioned in the vaguest generalities , snake oil flim-flam can be huckstered in the most truth-defying way , thanks to a 1994 law coaxed through Congress by the people who make these drugs .

The law bears the long title of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 . It was sponsored in House of Representatives by Rep. Dan Burton , R-Indiana , and in the Senate by Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , and Dick Durbin , D-Illinois .

The DSHEA law draws a line between synthesized medicines like aspirin and remedies made from herbs , minerals , vitamins and amino acids . This latter group was recategorized as `` dietary supplements '' -- that is , as foods rather than drugs .

`` Drugs '' are subjected to exacting scientific trial to prove them both safe and also effective . Sellers of dietary supplements are not required to prove that their remedies work . They are not even required to prove them safe -- as `` foods '' they are presumed safe unless shown otherwise . `` Drugs '' must disclose any risk of side effect . -LRB- That 's why those erectile dysfunction ads terrify TV audiences with their references to four-hour erections . -RRB-

Dietary supplements bear no such burden -- which is why St. John 's wort can be sold as an anti-depressant , without any mention of the disturbing indications that the herb weakens the effectiveness of birth control pills .

`` Drug '' advertising must be pre-approved by the Food and Drug Administration , which minutely reviews the ads ' accuracy . Dietary supplement advertising is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission .

So long as supplements avoid promises to cure a specific disease , their sellers can say pretty much whatever they want , provided only that they have some kind of supporting evidence on file .

That evidence does not have to meet any kind of scientific test : pretty much any pattern of ink on paper will do the job . I can not say , `` My rosemary-sage-thyme-and-oregano tablets cure AIDS . '' But if I pay my cousin $ 100 to do a few experiments , I can claim , `` My tablets boost the immune system -- and clinical trials are under way ! ''

-LRB- There is an exception to the permissive rules about advertising natural products : wine . There is substantial evidence that a glass of red wine a day reduces the risk of heart attack . The laws of most states forbid any hint or suggestion that moderate alcohol use might confer health benefits . Still , if you ask the scientists , wine has better grounds to call itself a health food than does , say , echinacea ! -RRB-

Fifteen years after receiving the favor of Congress , dietary supplements have grown into a $ 24 billion a year industry . Most of the products sold by the industry are merely useless .

For those who eat a balanced diet , scientists have found no quantifiable benefit from taking multivitamins . On the other hand , multivitamins probably wo n't do any harm . It would be better to give the $ 10 you spend on a jar of pills to the Salvation Army , but at least you are not poisoning yourself .

The same could not be said , alas , for the unfortunate customers of a Belgian herbal dispensary who bought a supplement that contained the herb Aristolochia fangi . The A. fangi herb is rich in aristolochic acid , a carcinogen -- and users experienced an outbreak of urinary tract cancers . A. Fangi has since been banned in the European Union . It remains legal in the United States .

As outrages go , Congress ' special favor to the herbal supplement industry might seem relatively small stuff : a splash in the torrent of the $ 2 trillion per year that Americans spend on health and wellness .

And yet in the midst of a great national debate over health care , this small outrage has some serious implications . Advocates for the herbal supplement industry justify their special sweet deal by championing the right of consumers to make their own `` health choices . ''

Individual choice certainly sounds like the American way . But the fact is that most of us are not well positioned to make intelligent health choices . If we try to play our own doctor , we are going to expose our health -- and our money -- to risk and exploitation .

As individuals , we have trouble distinguishing between anecdotes : `` My neighbor took zinc for her cold and she said it really helped , '' and data : Most colds last four days , so you could smoke yak-dung cigarettes on day three and feel better on day four .

We are poor balancers of risk : Look at the rising number of Americans who resist taking vaccines because of astronomically remote chances that something might go wrong .

We are vulnerable to placebos : `` Hey -- I took the 30-day free sample and I feel sure my vision did improve ! ''

We are swayed by prejudice and ideology : The film-maker Spike Lee wrote in Rolling Stone in 1992 : `` I 'm convinced AIDS is a government-engineered disease . ''

The reason we should defer to experts is not that the experts know everything . Of course they do n't . It 's just that they know more than non-experts do .

It 's not that science has all the answers . It does n't . It 's just that astrologers , shamans , and natural healers have none of them .

Americans spend over 50 percent more per person on their health than anyone else on earth . For all that extra money , Americans see very little benefit . Americans rank 42nd on earth in life expectancy , 29th in infant mortality .

Improving and rationalizing this costly and dysfunctional system is a gigantic , maybe impossible , task . But one small reform could strike a meaningful blow for reason and cost-effectiveness : Apply the rules governing the advertising of aspirin to the advertising of oregano tablets . Repeal the DSHEA law and give the Food and Drug Administration full authority over every manufactured substance that purports to promote health or relieve illness .
