FREDERICKSBURG , Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Shin Fujiyama 's life has been highlighted by second chances .

Shin Fujiyama 's organization , Students Helping Honduras , has raised more than $ 750,000 .

Born in a fishing village in Japan , Fujiyama , 25 , recalls a childhood dominated by health concerns . Doctors told his parents that he had a hole in his heart and `` they did n't think I had lot longer to live . '' But during a later visit to the doctor , Fujiyama says , his family learned the hole had closed .

`` Somehow I was cured and I became a normal kid , '' Fujiyama says . `` And I had a second chance . ''

During his sophomore year at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg , he volunteered in Honduras with a campus group and was struck by the extreme poverty he saw -- barefoot children collecting cans and sleeping in the streets . Fujiyama says he realized he could help give other children their own second chance .

Today , his organization , Students Helping Honduras , brings education and community projects to children and families in need through student service trips and fundraisers . Do you know someone who should be a CNN Hero ? Nominations are open at CNN.com/Heroes

`` Seeing the country and being able to make a difference really opened my eyes to a lot of things , '' he says . `` I saw such a great need . I wanted to keep helping . ''

He started by telling his friends about his experience and collecting spare change at his two campus jobs , but Fujiyama found that organizing other students did n't happen so easily .

`` When I had my very first meeting , I got all dressed up . And only two people showed up , '' he says . `` I knew I had to keep fighting . ''

He enlisted his younger sister , Cosmo , then a student at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg , Virginia , to the cause .

`` She 's dynamite , '' he says . `` When she talks in front of a crowd , she can move mountains . Knowing that she was behind it , I knew I could do anything . ''

Since 2006 , the siblings ' grass-roots campaign to help Honduras has grown to 25 campuses and raised more than $ 750,000 to fund projects , including the construction of two schools and the establishment of scholarships to help young women attend college .

Fujiyama says students are deeply committed to the organization because they are involved on every level : They raise money and then travel to Honduras to help build houses .

`` We make friends with all the kids , all the families -- no matter where we 're from . We 've had people from all over the world come to Honduras with us . And it 's a great network we 've made , '' he says . Watch Fujiyama and his group in action ''

While Fujiyama spends his summers in Honduras working alongside volunteers , he spends a large portion of the year on the road visiting colleges to organize chapters and raise funds . Cosmo Fujiyama , 23 , lives in Honduras full time to coordinate the group 's building efforts on the ground .

Students Helping Honduras is working with community members of Siete de Abril to build a new village . Many of the families lost their belongings to Hurricane Mitch in 1998 .

`` A lot of them are single mothers . They do n't own the land . They all live in cardboard houses . They do n't have access to clean water -LSB- or -RSB- health care , and they did n't have a school , '' Shin Fujiyama says .

Fujiyama 's group helped villagers purchase a new plot of land to rebuild . Its members have helped build 44 homes in the village that has been newly named Villa Soleada -LRB- `` Sunshine Village '' -RRB- . The organization also is raising funds to build a water tower , an eco-friendly sanitation system and a library and to help provide electricity . Watch Fujiyama describe how the village came to be ''

For Fujiyama , who deferred medical school to dedicate himself to his mission in Honduras , the lifestyle is a far cry from private practice , but he says he loves what he is doing . Watch Fujiyama describe how a second chance and a trip to Honduras changed his life ''

`` I feel like we 're making a huge impact . Some people might think that you have to be somebody famous or a millionaire or a doctor to do something , '' he says . `` But we 're just everyday students -- people in their 20s . We can do so much . We 've got so many things going for us . ... It 's just about leveraging what we have . And we have done a great job at that . ''
