-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It might be Oz , Kansas or simply somewhere over the rainbow .

While the destination may not be known , there 's no doubt the blue gingham dress wore by Judy Garland , as Dorothy in `` The Wizard of Oz , '' has a new home .

The price was not the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West , as the Wizard of Oz demanded from Dorothy to send her back home to Auntie Em in the classic 1939 movie . Rather , someone this weekend paid $ 480,000 for Dorothy 's dress , according to Julien 's Auctions .

The costume was one of several pieces of Hollywood history up for sale from Julien 's auction house in Beverly Hills , California .

Two of the auction 's biggest ticket items were traced to late actress and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe . A purple skirt worn in Canada by Monroe , as she was filming `` River of No Return , '' sold for $ 50,000 , while a gold blouse and matching Capri pants fetched $ 43,750 .

Buyers of the items were not identified .

Other signature clothing auctioned off included a Steve McQueen racing jacket for $ 50,000 , a dress Julie Andrews -LRB- as Maria -RRB- wore in `` The Sound of Music '' for $ 38,400 , and a black gown worn by Jaclyn Smith of `` Charlie 's Angels '' fame for $ 15,000 .

The `` Wizard of Oz '' was responsible for another big seller during the two-day event . One auction winner shelled out $ 33,750 for a collection of studio and publicity images tied to the MGM film .

It remains to be seen if Dorothy 's dress will be reunited with her ruby slippers .

The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures -- with the help of `` angel donors '' including actor Leonardo DiCaprio -- acquired one of four pairs of the iconic red shoes last February .

That set are called the `` Witch 's Shoes , '' because they were likely seen on the Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy 's house fell on her in the film , according to the Academy . They 're also likely the pair Dorothy , as played by Garland , had on in close-ups , such as in the memorable scene when she clicks the heels of the red shoes three times to head home .
