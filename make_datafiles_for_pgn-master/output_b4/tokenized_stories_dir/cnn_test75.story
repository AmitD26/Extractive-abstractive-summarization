-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney traded accusations on tax policy Thursday , with both claiming at campaign stops in battleground states that the other 's strategies have failed .

Romney used a rally in Golden , Colorado , to unveil a simplified campaign message called for by some Republican strategists , laying out a five-point plan that he said would put the nation back on the correct economic path .

The proposals are traditional conservative stances on domestic energy production , trade , job training , deficit reduction and boosting small businesses , with Romney promising that , if elected , he would deliver on them to unleash the full potential of the U.S. economy .

`` His policies have not worked . They have not gotten America back to work again , '' Romney said of Obama , citing 41 straight months of unemployment over 8 % . `` I 'm going to get America working again . ''

In particular , Romney challenged Obama 's call for extending lower tax rates , set to expire at the end of this year , only for income up to $ 250,000 for families or $ 200,000 for individuals , which would allow the rates on income above those marks to increase to 1990s levels .

Calling that plan a tax increase , Romney said it would inhibit the job creation needed for economic growth and described the Obama policy as being `` like a dog trying to chase its tail . ''

In Orlando , Florida , Obama attacked Romney 's call for more tax cuts as an example of long-standing Republican policy that was most recently enacted by his predecessor , helping bring the recession that was in place when Obama took office .

`` They have tried to sell us tax cut fairy dust before , '' Obama said . `` It is not a plan to move our economy forward . It takes us backward to a place we do n't need to be . ''

The president also made a campaign visit to Virginia , while Romney joined Republican governors -- including several potential running mates -- at an Aspen , Colorado , conference .

In a format resembling a celebrity `` roast '' -- but one with blue blazers and verbal bouquets instead of vulgar put-downs -- the seated governors rose one-by-one to praise Romney .

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called Romney a man of `` fabulous ingenuity '' and `` great integrity . ''

`` We need you , we 're looking forward to your services as president , '' said Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma .

`` I really appreciate your focus on middle class families , '' Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell told Romney .

In a hint that Romney 's decision on a running mate might come soon , his longtime adviser Beth Myers , who heads up the campaign 's search for a vice presidential candidate , will be traveling with Romney to Colorado .

Polls show that Romney and Obama are statistically even in Colorado and Virginia , while Obama holds a small lead in Florida . All three states are among the eight or so considered vital to the chances of both candidates in November .

Reviving the American dream of equal opportunity has been the central theme of Obama 's campaign , and Romney 's new five-point message Thursday was an effort to blunt the president 's middle class outreach .

In general , it rehashes Romney 's previously stated stances on energy , taxes , deficit reduction , trade and small business development but offers few details

For example , the energy component involves easing regulations to expand domestic production of oil , coal and natural gas . A conference call by Romney 's advisers made no mention of alternative sources such as solar or wind energy championed by Obama , but Romney included continued pursuit of such programs in his later remarks in Colorado .

The tax component came under heavy criticism from Obama , who cited a study by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that says Romney 's proposals would provide large cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the burden on the lower and middle classes .

Eric Fehrnstrom , a senior Romney campaign adviser , called the report `` a joke '' on Thursday 's conference call , while Romney economic adviser Kevin Hassett said it fails to include the projected revenue increase from an expanded employment base that Romney 's policies would bring .

`` Eliminating that from your analysis means you 're going to have a very , very biased result , '' Hassett said . Romney officials also complained that one of the study 's three authors was a former member of Obama 's Council of Economic Advisers .

In his Florida remarks , Obama ridiculed the Romney team 's criticism of the report , noting another of the co-authors was an economist in the administration of Republican President George H.W. Bush .

`` They said -LRB- the report -RRB- did n't take into account the economic growth that would result from tax cuts , '' Obama said , drawing laughter when he added : `` We all know how well that worked the last time they tried it . ''

Romney calls for cutting today 's rates by 20 % as well as eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax and limiting current deductions , exemptions and credits available to top-level income earners .

However , Romney has yet to say which specific tax breaks he plans to eliminate , and the Tax Policy Center report indicated the result of his plan would force the tax burden to shift toward lower - and middle-class Americans .

In its study , the Tax Policy Center did not score Romney 's plan directly , saying it lacked sufficient details . Instead , the center said the plan represented a number of Republican proposals .

The Romney campaign officials said Thursday that the specifics of the tax proposal remain to be worked out , with deputy policy director Jonathan Burks adding that Romney , if elected , `` would write a tax bill that would achieve those goals . ''

`` It 's not a question of today we have a 2,000-page tax plan , '' Burks said .

Tax policy has become a central economic issue , with Congress deadlocked over proposals to extend most or all of the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year .

House passes Republican tax-cut plan

Romney and Republicans want to extend all the Bush tax cuts for now to prevent any increase , while Obama says the lower rates should not continue for the wealthiest 2 % of Americans to bring more fairness to the system . Both sides call for comprehensive tax reform after the election as part of necessary deficit reduction steps .

The issue touches on the foundations of the nation 's political divide , with Republicans driven by their conservative base seeking to shrink government to reduce deficits while Democrats want a blend of spending cuts and more tax revenue in order to maintain what they consider essential services and entitlement programs .

With just over three months until the November election , the race has become a contentious struggle to convince voters that the other guy would take the country in the wrong direction .

In anticipation of Obama 's Florida trip Thursday , the Romney campaign released a new ad in the state that blames the president for a stalling economy there .

Romney ad hits Obama on Florida economy

Florida , currently rated a `` toss up '' on CNN 's Electoral Map , has been hard hit by a weak housing market . Its unemployment rate of 8.6 % is higher than the national average , but down from a high of 11.4 % in 2010 .

A Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll released Wednesday showed Obama with a 51 % -45 % lead in Florida , which has 29 electoral votes .

Another new Romney ad Wednesday hammered Obama over unemployment and other economic problems , saying : `` Americans need a change . We need a new president . ''

Campaigns turn to economy ahead of jobs report

Obama 's campaign responded to the ad by citing Romney 's opposition to the auto industry bailout .

`` Let 's get this straight -- the very person who argued for the U.S. auto industry to go bankrupt , something that would have caused more than a million jobs lost and utter economic devastation in the Midwest , is now trying to attack the president on how it was handled ? '' campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said in a written statement .

Meanwhile , the liberal group MoveOn.org will run a 30-second television spot in battleground states mocking the amount of money spent on Rafalca , the dressage horse competing at the London Olympics that is co-owned by Romney 's wife , Ann .

Looking a dressage horse in the mouth

The group said the ad to air in Nevada , Ohio and Pennsylvania is told from the perspective of the horse , pointing out that the Romneys spend $ 77,000 a year for its upkeep .

`` After Mitt Romney repeals health care and ships your jobs overseas , I daresay your life wo n't be nearly as pampered as mine , '' it concludes . `` After all , you 're not one of his horses . ''

In a statement , MoveOn.org 's executive director said the group was not lampooning the horse itself .

`` There 's nothing wrong with taking good care of a horse , but there 's something messed up about a millionaire who spends twice what most Americans make in a year caring for a horse , but wants to take away people 's health care and offshore their jobs , '' Justin Ruben wrote .

CNN 's Tom Cohen , Peter Hamby , Kevin Liptak and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .
