London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The twin brother of the man allegedly responsible for one of the worst massacres in recent British history was among 12 people killed before the gunman took his own life , police said Thursday . The series of drive-by shootings in northern England also left 11 people wounded .

David Bird , the 52-year-old twin brother of alleged shooter Derrick Bird , was found dead at his home in the English village of Lamplugh , police said . David Bird , they noted , was the father of three daughters .

Early Wednesday evening , British authorities identified four other victims .

Garry John Purdham , 31 , was found dead in a field on the roadside next to a pub . Darren Paul Rewcastle , 43 , was a local taxi driver . Cyclist Michael James Pike , 64 , was shot dead in the road . Jamie Michael Dennis Clark , 23 , was found dead in his car .

Earlier , authorities named three other people killed in the shootings : 60-year-old solicitor Kevin Commons , who was found in his driveway ; 57-year-old Susan Hughes , a mother of two ; and 66-year-old Jane Elizabeth Robinson .

The UK 's head of state , Queen Elizabeth II , issued condolences , saying she was `` deeply shocked '' by what happened .

`` In asking you to pass my deepest and most heartfelt sympathy to the families of all those who were killed or injured , and to the injured themselves , I am sure I share in the grief and horror of the whole country , '' the queen said .

Police also released a map tracing the route that suspect Derrick Bird , 52 , is believed to have traveled on his rampage through the region on Wednesday .

The route begins near the village of Lamplugh and winds through Cumbria , taking in the seaside towns of Whitehaven and Seascale before ending up farther inland near Boot , in the Lake District .

Police lifted the cordons at most of the 30 separate crime scenes , but Derrick Bird 's house in Rowrah , near Frizington , remained one of those roped off , they said .

Forensic experts were examining two weapons seized by police , a shotgun and a .22 rifle fitted with a telescopic sight . Police said Bird was a licensed firearms holder for 20 years and they were investigating whether the license covers the seized firearms .

Gun laws tightened after massacres

`` The focus of the 100-strong squad of detectives investigating the incident is firmly on finding out why someone would want to take so many lives in such a short space of time , '' Cumbria Police said in a statement . `` Officers and staff are conducting forensic evidential searches and tests across the area at each location . ''

`` What happened -LSB- on Wednesday -RSB- was unthinkable and is without doubt the most horrific incident I have seen in my 25 year long policing career , '' said Cumbria Chief Constable Craig Mackey . `` We now need to work together as a county to recover as we look to the future . ''

Police finished searching the known and possible routes Bird could have used -- an area covering 150 kilometers -LRB- 93 miles -RRB- -- and said as a result they were not expecting to find any more victims .

Of the wounded , eight remained in hospitals Thursday , with four in stable and four in `` comfortable '' condition , police said .

Local Detective Chief Superintendent Iain Goulding released a statement identifying Derrick Bird as a self-employed taxi driver who had lived in Rowrah since 1993 . Goulding noted that Bird drove a silver Citroen Picasso , which was used during Wednesday 's shooting spree .

Meanwhile , a taxi driver shot in the back during Wednesday 's killing spree has described how he watched Bird shoot dead another driver , Darren Rewcastle , at point blank range .

`` He turned up and shouted ` Darren ' before walking up to him and taking his face off . I saw it . He just shot him , '' Reed , a former soldier , told the Liverpool Echo .

Wounded taxi driver ` watched friend shot in face '

Peter Leder , who described himself as a friend of Bird 's , told CNN he spoke to Bird on Tuesday night and Bird told him , `` You wo n't see me again . ''

Leder said Bird drove his taxi in Whitehaven for more than 20 years and described him as `` an outgoing , well-known guy , who everyone liked . ''

Bird was close to his mother , who is ill in a local nursing home , Leder said .

He said his friend enjoyed scuba diving , went on several diving trips abroad and practiced regularly at the Whitehaven swimming baths . Leder said he knew Bird had guns but said he was not violent .

`` I ca n't shed any light on it , '' Leder said . '' ... He was a decent guy , and I 'm sorry for what 's happened . ''
