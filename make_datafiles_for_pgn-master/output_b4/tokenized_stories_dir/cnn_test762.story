Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kenneth Slayton wants to get a message to Jaycee Dugard , the California woman kidnapped as a child and held captive for 18 years .

Slayton would like to get together with Dugard and her two children on Father 's Day , but he said he is being blocked from communicating with the 29-year-old he believes is his daughter .

When Dugard went missing in 1991 , FBI agents investigating the 11-year-old 's disappearance knocked on Slayton 's door because the truck driver had been identified as her biological father .

Slayton said he was shocked by the FBI visit because until then he did n't know about Jaycee was his daughter .

The 64-year-old truck driver said he was shocked again last August when he heard a radio report his long-lost daughter had been found alive .

`` I almost wrecked my truck , '' Slayton said .

But Dugard 's return to her family did not include Slayton . He said he is desperately trying to change that .

`` Since she has been found , I have done everything I could to make contact with Jaycee , but to no avail , '' Slayton said at a news conference Friday .

Doing everything included hiring celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred .

`` Sunday is Father 's Day , '' Allred said . `` Our client has missed celebrating Father 's Day for 29 years . He is thrilled that his daughter has been found alive and that he has two grandchildren he never even knew he had . ''

Several letters from Slayton sent to Dugard through her lawyer were returned unopened , he said . They included photos of his other children who would like to meet their sister , he said .

Allred would not speculate on who decided not to open them .

`` They only thing she knows about me is something that maybe somebody said that maybe did n't like me too well , '' Slayton said . `` That 's wrong . ''

A spokeswoman for the Dugard family issued a statement recently which acknowledged Slayton as the father but questioned his motives for wanting into Dugard 's life after many years .

`` I was very upset by the verbal missiles that the spokesperson fired at me when she targeted me , '' Slayton said . `` I guess they 're trying to kill my spirit , reputation issuing totally false statements . I mean , these things are over the hill . ''

`` The statement that I had no interest in Jaycee is a completely false statement , '' he said . `` Ever since I learned certainly that I had a daughter I wanted to see her , protect her and love her . ''

He said he never would have abandoned a daughter if he had known she existed . `` I 'm not a runner . ''

`` I would have been there , '' Slayton said . `` I would have been a good loving father , and involved in supporting her and helping in any way that I could . ''

He filed a paternity suit last month . Legally establishing that he is her father would guarantee Slayton a courtroom seat when the couple charged with kidnapping Dugard are tried , Allred said .

Phillip Garrido , 58 , and his wife , Nancy , 54 , are charged with 29 felony counts in the kidnapping of Dugard , who was 11 when she was snatched in 1991 from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe , California .

`` I am also a victim of Phillip Garrido because he kept me separated from my daughter and because he inflicted terrible pain on her , '' he said .
