Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Aid intended for Gaza that was unloaded from a Libyan-backed ship in northern Egypt was sitting in storage Saturday , awaiting transfer , according to the governor of North Sinai .

The ship from the Gadhafi foundation , a charity headed by the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , docked in Al Arish and began unloading aid Thursday . However , it was taking time to sort out the medical supplies -- a top priority for delivery -- from other aid , Gen. Morad Mowafe told CNN Saturday .

Mowafe expected that the aid would arrive in Gaza by Sunday .

The ship reached Egypt after sailing from Greece on July 10 with 2,000 tons of aid . It was the latest ship attempting to breach an Israeli naval blockade of the Palestinian territory of Gaza whose captain was persuaded to dock elsewhere instead .

The aid includes food , medicine , and construction materials to be taken from the port to the Gaza border about 25 miles -LRB- 42 kilometers -RRB- away .

Israel said it must inspect all goods prior to their entering Gaza to ensure that weapons do not get into the hands of militants . Gaza is run by Hamas , the Palestinian Islamist movement .

The Gadhafi foundation refers to the ship as the Hope , although it appears to be registered as the MV Amalthea . It is Moldovan-flagged and run by ACA Shipping , based in Greece .

Israel came under fierce international criticism after Israeli navy commandos boarded a Gaza-bound Turkish aid ship in May and nine people died .

Israel said the activists on that ship attacked its troops when they boarded the boat .

The Israeli assault on the Turkish ship reverberated internationally and highlighted the Gaza blockade .

Israel has resisted demands for an international inquiry into the incident , but an Israeli military investigation into the boarding of the Mavi Marmara criticized some aspects of the operation .

CNN 's Housam Ahmed contributed to this report .
