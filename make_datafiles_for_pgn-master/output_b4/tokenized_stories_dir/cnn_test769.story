-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- County coroner 's officials in Los Angeles , California , hope to release results Thursday morning of their examination of skeletal remains found in a remote area of Malibu Canyon .

The family of a woman , missing nearly a year , await word on any clues the bones will yield .

Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said that an anthropologist and pathologist were examining the remains , and an odontologist -- or dental expert -- will also help make a final identification .

The remains , which included a human skull , were found Monday by park rangers searching the area for marijuana groves , said Los Angeles County Sheriff 's spokesman Steve Whitmore .

`` It 's incredibly treacherous terrain , '' Whitmore said of the remote site . `` There is no road , no trail even if you know exactly where you are going . ''

Whitmore said it appeared the remains had been in the area `` for quite awhile . ''

The family of missing Mitrice Richardson have been waiting to hear whether the remains are those of their loved one .

Richardson , who would be 25 now , is a former beauty pageant contestant who was last seen leaving a Los Angeles County sheriff 's station in Malibu during the early morning hours of September 17 , 2009 . She had been arrested the previous evening at an upscale restaurant for allegedly not paying for her meal , and patrons at the restaurant said she exhibited strange behavior .

Her family has said the college honors graduate suffered from mental health issues and should have been kept at the sheriff 's station until a relative arrived to pick her up .

The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that the remains are those of a woman and that `` women 's clothing was also found near the scene . '' The newspaper cited unidentified law enforcement sources .

Winter would not confirm Wednesday the gender of the remains . He said clothing was found `` near the body , '' but declined to elaborate on what type , saying many people had been using the area where marijuana was known to be harvested .

Latice Sutton , the mother of Richardson , held a news conference Tuesday night outside the coroner 's office , saying she had been told that the clothing found was a pair of Levis , and appealed to officials to let her view the clothing .

`` I do know that my daughter was wearing jeans that night , '' Sutton said .

Mom furious about leaks to media

Michael Richardson , Mitrice 's father , told HLN 's `` Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell '' on Wednesday that he is n't giving up the search for his daughter .

`` I 'm still remaining hopeful , positive , prayerful ... and until they can give me a definitive answer about it , Mitrice is still needing for us to search for her , '' he said .

The family of Richardson was joined at the canyon site Monday by another woman who believed the remains could belong to her husband , Timothy .

Pam Perryman said her husband went missing six years ago while hiking in the area .

`` I 've been praying that we would find him because it 's our anniversary this Saturday , '' Perryman told CNN iReporter Julie Ellerton . `` I just have a feeling ... in a way I hope it is him , in a way I hope it 's not . ''
