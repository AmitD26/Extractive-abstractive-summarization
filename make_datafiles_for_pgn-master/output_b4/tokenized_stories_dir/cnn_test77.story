-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- There 's not much you can do when that inevitable turkey coma sets in today , so instead of fighting those couch potato urges , indulge in some Thanksgiving TV .

Fortunately , there are plenty of TV marathons to be thankful for this year . Whether you 're craving something manly , in a nostalgic state of mind , or schadenfreude is the name of the game , there 's something to feast your eyes on .

Oldies , But Goodies

As you 're reminiscing about the good ol' days with family , it 's only fitting that you watch some cinematic masterpieces from yesteryear . First up is a jumbo-sized James Bond movie marathon . Celebrate the franchise 's 50th anniversary with a two-day Syfy blockbuster fest from 12 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. tomorrow . I 'm sure the release of the latest and highest-grossing 007 installment , `` Skyfall , '' has opened up the age-old debate about the best Bond flick .

The marathon includes Daniel Craig 's first two Bond films , `` Casino Royale '' and `` Quantum of Solace , '' and the very first film from the franchise , Sean Connery 's `` Dr. No . ''

If you 're more gangster than suave , AMC 's `` Godfather '' marathon is the way to go . With two consecutive airings of `` The Godfather '' and `` The Godfather Part II '' from 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. tomorrow , you 're sure to get your mafia fix -LRB- the third film is officially not worth watching -RRB- .
