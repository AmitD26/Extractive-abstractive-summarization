Gaza City -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Take a soccer-crazy crowd and a traditional Palestinian opening ceremony . Add a splash of corporate sponsorship , and sprinkle in some black-clad , gun-toting security .

What you 're left with is the World Cup of soccer -- Gaza style .

The 16-team , two-week tournament culminated Saturday with the field narrowed down to France and Jordan .

The idea for the contest was the brainchild of American aid worker Patrick McGrann and a Palestinian colleague .

`` There were a lot of us who were offended that Gaza is not allowed to participate with the rest of the world -- whether it 's diplomacy , whether it 's schooling , whether it 's education or whether it 's sports , '' McGrann said .

`` So we chose to try and come up with something special . And in this case , a Gaza World Cup . If the rest of the world gets a World Cup , we thought Gaza should get one too . ''

While the teams wore the colors of France and Jordan , almost all of the players were Palestinian . Foreign nationals working for the United Nations and other aid organizations rounded out the teams to give it its international flavor .

American player Corey Pattison played for the French team . He said they found a way to work past the language barrier .

`` When I get out there , it 's more like , ` Corey , go forward , go forward , go forward . Do n't kick the ball out of bounds , ' '' he said .

A crowd of several thousand men , along with a few women , watched the two teams battle in a game played down to the proverbial wire .

After scoring a goal a piece , the match went into overtime -- with the French besting the Jordanians on penalty shots .

The crowd , as expected , went wild . And the jubilation of the players could not be contained .

One jumped up on the rail separating the field from the spectators , took off his jersey and led the crowd in a raucous chant .

While organizers had hoped to keep politics out of the cup , the politicians could not stay away . Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh presided over the award ceremony .

But this was a day for Gazans to put aside politics and their many problems , at least for a while , and bask in the glory of hosting -- and winning -- the World Cup .
