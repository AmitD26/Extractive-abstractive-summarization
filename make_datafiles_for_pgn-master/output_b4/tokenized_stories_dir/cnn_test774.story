-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The death toll from massive floods in Pakistan rose to 1,497 on Friday as U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said the crisis is a `` slow-motion tsunami '' that is expected to grow .

The number of homeless as a result of flooding has doubled to 4 million .

Ban urged the international community to give more aid during a special fundraising meeting Thursday night .

`` Make no mistake , '' he said . `` This is a global disaster , a global challenge . It is one of the greatest tests of global solidarity in our times . ''

The U.N. secretary-general , who traveled to Pakistan last weekend to visit sites devastated by the disaster , said almost 20 million people need shelter , food and emergency care .

`` That is more than the entire population hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami , the Kashmir earthquake , Cyclone Nargis , and the earthquake in Haiti -- combined , '' he said .

The United Nations has already appealed for $ 460 million over the next three months , Ban said , and although donors delivered more than a half , the available resources are not sufficient to meet the needs on the ground .

The European Commission has pledged 40 million euros -LRB- $ 51 million -RRB- since July 31 for the flood victims . It said it will mobilize an additional 30 million euros -LRB- about $ 38 million -RRB- .

`` This disaster is like few the world has ever seen . It requires a response to match , '' Ban said . `` Pakistan needs a flood of support . ''

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who also attended the General Assembly meeting , announced an additional $ 60 million in U.S. aid . The funds bring to $ 150 million the amount pledged to Pakistan by the United States .

`` I want the people of Pakistan to know : The United States will be with you through this crisis , '' she said . `` We will be with you as the rivers rise and fall . We will be with you as you replant your fields and repair your roads . And we will be with you as you meet the long-term challenge to build a stronger nation and a better future for your families . ''

Clinton urged other nations to help the nation meet its funding goals .

Analysts have blamed `` donor fatigue '' for the delay in aid .

Pakistan has been on a seemingly constant round of donor needs -- to revive its feeble economy , to fight the Taliban and to recover from the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2009 refugee crisis .
