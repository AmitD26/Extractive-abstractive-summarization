-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's sometimes said that the ' 00s opened with a Pearl Harbor and ended with a Great Crash . Yet this dramatic decade still lacks even a name . The Forties had big bands and a bigger war , the Sixties protests and hippies , the Seventies `` malaise . '' But what do we call the decade just ending ?

The Double-Zeros ? The late Bill Safire suggested the Naughties , `` nought '' being an old-fashioned term for `` zero '' -LRB- as in dough-nought -RRB- .

Whatever you call them , the years from 2000 on have been united by one great theme : This is the decade when the bills came due for neglected problems .

1 -RRB- Terrorism

The most painful thought about the 9/11 attack was how easily it could have been prevented . If the state trooper who pulled over Ziad Jarrah for speeding had a way to detect a fraudulent driver 's license -- if the gate agent who checked Muhammad Atta in Portland , Maine , had acted on his suspicions -- if , if , if .

Through the 1990s , the United States was targeted by an escalating series of terrorist actions . Yet the country 's leaders continued to treat terrorism as second or third-tier problem .

President Clinton did not respond to the attack on the USS Cole in December 2000 . Some suspected he feared retaliation would disrupt his Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations . Candidate George W. Bush promised Muslim voters that he would end the use of CIA terrorism evidence in immigration hearings .

The bill for past laxity came due on September 11 , 2001 . And over the remainder of the decade , other bills would arrive : the bill for allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power in 1991 , the bill for not responding to Iranian-sponsored terrorist attacks in the 1990s .

After the attack on the U.S. Khobar Towers barracks in Saudi Arabia killed 19 , the Clinton administration threatened retaliation if Iran repeated the atrocity . That threat was followed by the ramping up of the Iranian nuclear program that confronts the world today .

2 -RRB- Health care

The private marketplace had developed a promising , cost-efficient means of delivering healthcare : the health maintenance organization . Thanks to the spread of HMOs , health care costs grew more slowly in the 1990s than any decade since World War II .

Because health care costs are paid out of employee wages , slowing those costs boosted worker pay . Thanks in large part to the slowdown of health cost inflation , worker incomes grew faster in the 1990s than in any decade since the 1960s .

But the HMOs had their faults and kinks . Instead of defending and improving the HMO system , demagogic state and federal politicians waged war on HMOs , imposing strict mandates on them that forced up their costs . And they persuaded employers to revert to more traditional and expensive fee-for-service medicine .

The main result : Costs exploded upward again in the 2000s . The average cost of a health policy for a family of four doubled between 2000 and 2006 , from about $ 6,000 to about $ 13,000 .

A secondary result : Wage growth stopped . The typical earner actually brought home less after inflation in 2006 than in 2000 .

3 -RRB- Immigration

In 1986 , Congress passed the Simpson-Mazzoli bill , granting amnesty to illegal aliens and promising stricter enforcement of immigration laws in the future . The law failed miserably . The amnesty only invited a huge surge of migrants hoping for a second amnesty . The promised enforcement never materialized .

Over the ensuing decade , the United States received the biggest influx of migration since before the First World War . These new migrants transformed the lives of middle-class Americans .

In the 1960s , McDonald 's was the typical night out for a middle-income family . In the 1990s , a family earning the same income could enjoy table service at an Olive Garden or Applebee 's .

House cleaning , gardening , nannying and valet parking all became more affordable to middle-class Americans .

There were losers from this social transformation : lower-skilled natives priced out of low-wage jobs . But they had little political clout , and their feelings were easily ignored .

But in the 2000s , it became apparent that the illegal migrant population had grown vastly bigger . Migrants were now displacing the native-born from more desirable work : construction , meatpacking , trucking .

More ominously , the children of the migrants were growing into something that looked very much like an underclass .

The rate of teen motherhood among second-generation Hispanic children is higher than among blacks . Barely half of second-generation Hispanic migrants complete high school on time . Rejecting the low-skilled jobs that employed their parents , but unprepared for more skilled work , they fall into gangs and alienation .

And this time , unlike 1986 , we are talking about a population numbering in the tens of millions .

These bills for past mistakes arrived in the 2000s . But we did not manage to pay them . Maybe it would be both more numerically and historically accurate to call the decade not the double zeroes but the triple zeroes .

The decade that 's ending does n't yet have a name

David Frum says the decade was marked by unsolved issues of earlier years

@highlight

Frum : Terrorism , health care inflation , immigration issues came home to roost

He says these problems have n't been solved in this decade either
