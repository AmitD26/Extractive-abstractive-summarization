-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Carlos Acosta is the ballet dancer who breaks all the rules . Perhaps the most famous dancer of his generation , his is a career that was n't meant to be -- a tough kid from the backstreets of Havana who was forced to study ballet and became a reluctant star .

Carlos Acosta : `` Ballet was my best friend . ''

His combination of talent , dedication and charisma have made him principal guest artist with the Paris Ballet , the Russian Ballet and the Royal Ballet in London . Acosta is that rarest of things -- a ballet dancer who has pirouetted into the public consciousness .

But success has its price . His career has taken him away from his beloved Cuba and Acosta 's story is one of displacement and a sense of longing for his family and homeland . `` My heart is in Havana , '' he told CNN . `` When I 'm there I can get close to the life that I do n't have anymore because of my career . ''

Acosta was born in Havana , Cuba , in 1973 . The youngest of 11 children , his early passions were football and breakdancing , but in a country with a proud ballet tradition , his lorry-driver father decided that the discipline of ballet school would keep young Carlos out of trouble , hoping that dance might one day provide his son with a way out of poverty .

Aged nine , Acosta was enrolled in the National Ballet School of Cuba , and he hated it . He found the repetitive exercises boring and longed to play football with his friends instead .

While Acosta was struggling to fit in , his father was jailed over a traffic accident and his mother suffered a stroke . Acosta played truant once too often . He was expelled and sent to a boarding school in Pinar del Rio , his first taste of life parted from his loved ones .

It was n't until he was 13 that Acosta saw his first real ballet . Watching the Cuban National Ballet perform he began to see the possibilities of the vocation that had been thrust upon him .

He turned out to be a natural at it and began to apply himself to his dance classes . At the age of 16 , he won a scholarship with the Turin Ballet , winning the Gold Medal at the Prix de Lausanne .

`` I found that ballet was my best friend . It was everything I had , the opportunity to become something else completely and to be fulfilled , '' he told CNN . `` It took me a while to understand that and once I did , there was no turning back . I was determined to be the best I could . ''

He went on to dance as principal with the English National Ballet from 1991 to 1992 , the National Ballet of Cuba from 1992 to 1994 , and was a principal with Houston Ballet between 1993 and 1998 .

In 1998 he made it into the ranks of London 's Royal Ballet , advancing to principal guest artist in 2003 , to become the Royal Ballet 's first black principal . His rise to fame , which had taken him from the streets of Havana to the biggest stages in the world , was mirrored in his semi-autobiographical show `` Tocororo , '' which Acosta created and choreographed .

After it received a rapturous reception in London , he took `` Tocororo '' to Cuba in 2003 , where he performed it in front of Fidel Castro . Acosta has described that triumphant homecoming as the highlight of his career .

Never one to shirk from a challenge , he traveled to Moscow to perform the lead in `` Spartacus '' with the Bolshoi Ballet , a notoriously demanding and exhausting role . He often speaks of the need for ballet to take risks , to evolve and to speak a contemporary language -- ideals that Acosta embodies .

Not just a virtuoso performer , it is Acosta 's ability to connect with his audience that has made him an international star . Conversely , Acosta says his audience is what inspires him .

`` When I find people that express how much my art makes them feel , this is priceless , '' he told CNN . `` You ca n't buy that with money , you can achieve that only with art -- you really touch people . Once you do that it lives on forever . ''

But he sees himself as more than just a dancer . In 2007 , his autobiography `` No Way Home '' was published to widespread acclaim . The book offered a glimpse of the sense of isolation he felt at living away from Havana .

He once told an interviewer , `` I had to leave Cuba to be the best I could be . I now have a very high status , but my family has never been able to share it with me . ''

Acosta is at his peak as a performer , but a ballet dancer 's career has a short span . He has said he does not want to be a choreographer once he retires , but he does have plans for the movies . There is talk of his autobiography being made into a film and Acosta has said he would like to play himself -- after all , who else could match his incredible leaps , fearless athleticism and effortless charm ?
