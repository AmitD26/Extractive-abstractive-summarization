Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Apparently President Barack Obama does n't need an iPad ; he 's got an aide for that : iReggie .

At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation -LRB- APEC -RRB- leaders ' retreat in Yokohama , Japan , on Saturday , a print pool reporter was within earshot of a brief exchange between the president and an iPad owner , Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva .

`` So you like your iPad ? '' Obama asked .

The Thai leader nodded and asked Obama if he had one .

`` These days mostly I have someone carrying my books . So that 's my iPad , '' Obama said , referring to personal aide Reggie Love .

Obama said as much in a New York Times interview last month . `` I have an iReggie , who has my books , my newspapers , my music all in one place , '' he told the newspaper .

Not everyone has an arsenal of human apps like the president 's : a personal aide , several advisers , cabinet secretaries , a press shop and military leaders at his beck and call .

Obama may not have a personal iPad , but he 's not too disconnected from Apple 's latest technological craze . According to the pool reporter , Jonathan Weisman , the president told Abhisit that he recently bought an iPad for first lady Michelle Obama .

At a rally in Seattle last month , the president was approached by someone with an iPad that said , `` Mr. President , sign my iPad . '' Obama penned his signature with the swipe of a finger instead of a pen .

Obama is the first president to carry a smartphone with Internet and e-mail access , but the public rarely sees him using his BlackBerry . He may be considered tech-savvy , but the Oval Office is n't .

The president 's Resolute Desk , the large wooden partner 's desk built from the timbers of the British exploration ship Resolute , has a telephone but conspicuously no computer . So what does the president do when he needs one ? On at least one occasion , the president borrowed his personal secretary 's computer .

The White House posted a photo of the president sitting at personal secretary Katie Johnson 's desk . He was due to deliver remarks that day and made last-minute edits on her computer .

Maybe there 's not an app for everything .
