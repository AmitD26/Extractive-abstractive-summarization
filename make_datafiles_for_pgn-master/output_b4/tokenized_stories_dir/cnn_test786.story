-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre will meet this week with an NFL official as part of the league 's investigation into allegations that he sent sexually explicit messages to women , an NFL spokesman said Monday .

`` It 's no secret , '' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said . `` Any time you review a matter like this , you 're going to talk to the person involved . What we 've said is , ` Yes , we will be interviewing him as part of the process . ' ''

Aiello said the meeting with Favre would not include Commissioner Roger Goodell , but the spokesman would not divulge with whom or where the meeting was to take place . `` We do n't generally provide these kind of details , '' Aiello said .

Asked Sunday what he expects to come out of the meeting , Favre said , `` I do n't expect anything . As I said last week , during the week , tonight , I 'm concerned about the next game . I 'll let that take its course . ''

Sunday 's news conference came after Favre led the Vikings to a 24-21 victory over the Dallas Cowboys , going 14 for 18 with 119 yards , one touchdown and one turnover .

The claims were first published by the sports website Deadspin.com , which has posted nude pictures , text and voice messages it alleges he sent to a model and former television host who worked for the New York Jets in 2008 .

The Jets have given National Football League officials all the information they have regarding the incident , a team spokesman said last week .

Jesse Derris , a spokesman for the Jets , told HLN 's `` Prime News '' that the team has no role in the allegations against Favre , who played one season in New York and now plays for the Minnesota Vikings .

Favre , who has been married for 14 years , has had no public comment on the allegations . He signed with the Minnesota Vikings in August 2009 after emerging from retirement for the second time in as many years .

Deadspin first reported in August that Favre sent text messages , left voice mails and sent pictures of himself naked from the waist down to Jenn Sterger , who worked as a sideline personality and host for the Jets at the time . It also published what it said were excerpts from the messages .

Afterward , Deadspin reported that a second woman had come forward to allege that she had received other lewd messages from the quarterback and that a third woman , whom the site did not identify , had received similar messages .

The site reported the two women were massage therapists hired by the Jets and identified them only by pseudonyms .

Derris said the therapists were hired for two days in the team 's 2008 training camp and would not confirm whether they had any direct contact with Favre .

CNN could not independently confirm whether the voice in the recordings belongs to Favre or whether he sent the notes . Sterger 's representatives have declined comment .

A.J. Daulerio , Deadspin 's editor-in-chief and author of the Favre stories , told CNN last week that no one from the NFL has contacted him about an investigation into Favre . He acknowledged that third-party sources were paid for the story about Sterger and that he could not say definitively that the messages or photos the site posted came from the 41-year-old quarterback .

Favre played most of his career with the Green Bay Packers , leading the team to a Super Bowl title in 1997 . He was traded to the Jets after the 2007 season .
