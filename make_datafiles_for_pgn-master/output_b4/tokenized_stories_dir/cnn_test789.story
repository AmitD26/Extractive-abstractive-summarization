-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An abandoned car sits in the Mexican desert outside Juarez , Mexico , the doors and trunk wide open . Under a blanket in the trunk is a body . Hands tied together . A bullet in the head .

This was freelance journalist Jeff Antebi 's introduction to the war between rival drug cartels in Juarez . The 40-year-old photographer , also known as the founder of the music company Waxploitation , traveled there to observe and document the violence that has gripped what many call the most deadly city in the Western Hemisphere .

`` When I arrived in Juarez , '' says Antebi , `` within an hour , over the police scanners , a body has been found . And maybe 30 minutes later , another body .

`` And then another body . And by the end of the day , it was 10 . The next day , 10 . The next day , 10 . ''

More than 2,000 people have been murdered in Juarez so far this year , according to police . Just this week , two students from the University of Texas at El Paso were shot and killed there .

The Mexican government estimates that as many as 28,000 people have been killed by the cartels since 2007 , when Mexican President Felipe Calderon declared war on the cartels . Army troops entered the fight , and the level of violence from the cartels escalated dramatically in response .

`` The cartels kill indiscriminately , '' says Antebi .

He arrived on the scene last December , just in time for the Christmas season . In the past , he had photographed many places where people live in poverty and despair , from the Gypsy camps of Europe to the slums of Haiti and Brazil . But in Juarez , he says , there is a unique sense of dread . `` The average ordinary resident of Juarez , their life is in danger every day . ''

`` You just never know if some distant cousin , perhaps , has done something , and someone is exercising revenge on them by killing you , '' he says .

As a precaution , Antebi traveled with a local reporter familiar with the lay of the land . And he avoided being out on the streets at night . `` The cartels , '' he says , `` own the night . ''

While visiting crime scenes throughout the city , Antebi discovered a chilling fact about police . `` Only in Juarez do the good guys wear masks . ''

Police officers routinely wear ski masks when out in public , or investigating crime scenes , to conceal their identities and protect the safety of their families . For that reason , Antebi says , he was careful to not photograph unmasked police officers . `` Those photos might be used to target law enforcement personnel when they are off duty . ''

There was another reason to be careful when photographing officers .

`` You might be taking a photo of a policeman who is secretly working for a cartel , '' Antebi says . `` That 's something that makes murder scenes so ominous . ''

Politicians are also at risk of becoming targets .

This summer , Antebi returned to Juarez to photograph the national elections .

Elections held amid conflict are of particular interest to Antebi . He has photographed elections in Afghanistan and Southern Thailand , among others . But Antebi says the violence of the Mexican election season was eye-opening .

`` Two weeks before the elections , several candidates in the state of Chihuahua were assassinated . ''

And other politicians , says Antebi , received gruesome threats . `` The prime candidate for mayor of Juarez , '' he says , `` had a severed head left on the front door of his house . ''

The result , according to Antebi , is that few politicians dare to openly challenge the cartels .

Journalists are in danger as well . Mexico 's National Commission on Human Rights says 65 journalists have been murdered since 2000 .

A recent front-page editorial in El Diario , the biggest daily paper in Juarez , has sparked national controversy . `` What do you want from us , '' the editorial asks the cartels . `` You are currently the de facto authorities in this city . ... Tell us what you expect from us as a newspaper . ''

The editorial was published after the assassination of one of the newspaper 's photographers .

Antebi says the government is trying to crack down on the cartels , and has arrested many key figures over the last two years . But he believes those efforts have only provoked even greater violence .

`` It 's a very sad city to be in , '' he says .
