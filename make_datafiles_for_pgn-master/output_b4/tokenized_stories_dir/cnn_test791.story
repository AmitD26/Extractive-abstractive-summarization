Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A compromise bill to provide free medical treatment and compensation to first responders of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack won final approval Wednesday from the House and Senate , sending it to President Barack Obama to be signed into law .

The bill passed on a voice vote in the Senate , and then on a 206-60 vote in the House on the final day of the lame-duck session of Congress .

Jubilant Democrats hailed the last-minute approval as a $ 4.2 billion triumph for firefighters , police officers and other emergency personnel who put themselves in harm 's way to help others in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attack .

Even though the vote was kept open for more than an hour , 168 House members did not participate . Missing were 89 Republicans , including incoming Speaker John Boehner , and 79 Democrats .

Still , there was a quorum -- a simple majority of 435 House members -- to vote on the bill .

Many House members also were absent Tuesday . Some likely went home for the holidays after the earlier funding votes , while others were members who are retiring or lost re-election bids .

The vote was the last by the House for the year , as it later adjourned until January 5 , when a new Congress will be sworn in and Boehner takes the speaker 's gavel .

Outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who presided over the chamber for the conclusion of Wednesday 's vote , said the discussion was `` about holy and sacred ground . ''

New York Sen. Chuck Schumer , who acknowledged that approval of the bill was in doubt until a few hours before the vote , called it a `` great day '' for the nation -- and especially for first responders sickened by exposure to toxic pollution from the collapse of the World Trade Center towers , because now they know their country will take care of them .

In New York , outgoing Democratic Gov. David Paterson said the bill `` will provide much-needed funds for medical treatment to the rescue workers and residents of New York City who suffered illnesses from breathing in toxic fumes , dust and smoke from ground zero . '' He said it also reopens the victims ' compensation fund for rescue workers who were hurt as a result of the attacks .

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the Senate 's approval of the bill `` affirms our nation 's commitment to protecting those who protect us all , '' and some of those first responders also welcomed the development but questioned why it took so long .

Kenny Specht , a former New York firefighter suffering from thyroid cancer , described his first exposure to Washington politics as a `` baptism by fire . ''

`` It was a lot of time and a lot of effort and it 's a little disappointing to see something like this only now receive the bipartisan support that it should have received from the beginning , '' Specht said .

Negotiations Wednesday morning involving Schumer and fellow Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York with Republican Sens. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Mike Enzi of Wyoming led to a deal that reduced the cost of the bill by $ 2 billion and made other changes sought by GOP opponents , according to statements by the participants .

`` The Christmas Miracle we 've been looking for has arrived , '' said a statement issued by Schumer and Gillibrand , adding : `` We are pleased to announce that we crafted an agreement that will allow this legislation to pass the Senate , and the House , this afternoon . We thank our Republican friends for coming together to fulfill America 's moral obligation to the heroes of 9/11 . ''

Coburn , a conservative who led the opposition to the bill , said the agreement produced a better piece of legislation .

`` Every American recognizes the heroism of the 9/11 first responders , but it is not compassionate to help one group while robbing future generations of opportunity , '' said Coburn , who had demanded that the cost of the bill be lowered and fully paid for . `` I 'm pleased this agreement strikes a fair balance and improves the bill the majority attempted to rush through at the last minute . ''

According to Coburn , the agreement reduces the overall cost of the bill by $ 2 billion to a total of $ 4.2 billion over a 10-year period . His statement said that $ 1.5 billion of the cost goes for health benefits and $ 2.7 billion will pay for compensation for health problems of emergency responders .

The agreement also caps attorneys ' fees at 10 percent of any total compensation award , and includes potential limits on compensation for individuals who already have received workers compensation for injuries due to the 9/11 response , the Coburn statement said .

Democrats previously agreed to pay for the bill with fees collected on various services involving foreign countries and foreign visitors .

On Tuesday , Schumer said it appeared the bill would come up for a Senate vote once lawmakers voted on New START , a nuclear arms control pact with Russia that is one of Obama 's top foreign policy priorities . Both votes occurred Wednesday afternoon .

The James Zadroga 9/11 Health Bill is named after a deceased New York Police Department detective who had worked in the toxic plume at ground zero .

The House earlier passed the previous version of the bill on a mostly partisan 268-160 vote .

According to the bill 's supporters , it is funded by a procurement fee on some foreign countries that trade with the United States , the continuation of a fee on some travelers to the United States and a fee on visas for some companies . The version being negotiated by the senators Wednesday drops some of those funding sources .

On Tuesday , a group of 9/11 first responders joined lawmakers in Washington to urge the Senate to pass the health care bill .

`` We continue to see our friends die on a day-to-day basis , '' said Glen Klein , a New York police officer who said he is sick with lung disease . `` We 're asking for the right to live . ''

In the years following the attacks , health experts have noted respiratory and mental health conditions , such as post-traumatic stress disorder , in those who engaged in ground zero rescue and cleanup efforts .
