-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman convicted of murder and adultery and sentenced to die by stoning said Saturday she would sue the two German journalists who interviewed her son , Iran 's government-backed Press TV reported .

The men , identified only as a reporter and photojournalist , were arrested in October after they interviewed the son and lawyer of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani , who was convicted of adultery in 2006 and sentenced to death by stoning .

Her case has drawn sharp criticism from the international community . No date has been set for her execution .

Ashtiani told reporters in the northwestern city of Tabriz that she planned to sue the German nationals , Press TV reported . The men , who work for the Bild am Sonntag newspaper , are charged with espionage and are accused of working illegally as journalists in Iran .

Germany-based anti-stoning activist Mina Ahadi said that government and prison officials were also at the press conference .

`` This regime has a history of pressuring innocent people into confessing on television . This is just another example of their propaganda , '' she said .

Speaking outside the prison , Ashtiani criticized her lawyers for politicizing her case and denied she had been pressured to give interviews , Press TV said .

Ashtiani 's son , Sajjad Qaderzadeh , was released from jail three weeks ago on humanitarian grounds , according to Press TV .

He had served more than a month in prison for granting the interview , Press TV reported .

Qaderzadeh appeared with his mother on Saturday and similarly said that he would sue the German nationals as well as his lawyers , who asked him to do the interview , Press TV said .

The son also added that he plans to take legal action against Issa Taheri , who Press TV said murdered Qaderzadeh 's father in collaboration with Ashtiani .

Germany 's Bild newspaper , a sister publication of Bild am Sonntag , published an editorial Sunday criticizing the reported lawsuit plans .

`` The woman who has been sentenced to death was allowed to leave her jail cell for a few hours to declare in front of western TV cameras that she would file a suit against our reporters , '' the editorial said .

It concludes , `` Does Iran really think that a strange farce like this will improve the credibility of its justice system abroad ? ''
