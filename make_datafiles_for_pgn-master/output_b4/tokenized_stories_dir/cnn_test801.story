LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- UK prosecutors may charge the parents of paralyzed rugby player Daniel James with helping their son end his life .

James , center , traveled from the UK to Switzerland to commit suicide . He was 23 .

James , 23 , from Sinton Green in western England was paralyzed from the chest down in March 2007 when a rugby scrum collapsed on top of him during match practice , dislocating his spine .

Worcestershire Coroner 's Service , which is conducing an inquest into the circumstances of his death , states on its Web site that James died on September 12 after he `` traveled to Switzerland with a view to ending his own life . He was admitted to a clinic where he died . '' The inquest was adjourned on September 19 for reports . What do you think about assisted suicide ?

UK police said they questioned two people in a criminal investigation of the case . Prosecutors said Thursday they plan to review the police investigation before deciding whether to prosecute anyone .

The case has renewed debate about assisted suicide in the UK , where those found guilty of helping someone kill themselves face up to 14 years in prison .

Switzerland , along with Belgium , Luxembourg and the Netherlands , are the only European countries where authorities will not prosecute those who assist with suicide .

Many in the UK have voiced support for Mark and Julie James , who flew to the Swiss clinic with their son . Watch the debate on assisted suicide ''

Mark Roebuck , uncle to Daniel , described the injury on a Web site for the Dan James Trust , which he set up to help his nephew 's recovery .

`` He dislocated his C6/C7 vertebrae , trapping his spinal cord and becoming a tetraplegic in a split second , '' Roebuck wrote . `` This means that Dan -LRB- had -RRB- lost the complete use of his body from the chest down . ''

James , regained some use of his fingers , Roebuck wrote , but that was the extent of his recovery .

Roebuck wrote this month that his nephew had died in an assisted suicide . `` His death was an extremely sad loss , '' his parents said in a statement , `` but was no doubt a welcome relief from the prison he felt his body had become . ''

In a statement last week James ' parents paid tribute to their son and said that he had attempted to kill himself several times already .

They added that their son , `` an intelligent young man of sound mind , '' had never come to terms with his condition and was `` not prepared to live what he felt was a second-class existence '' .

Matt Hampson , an English rugby player who was also paralyzed from the neck down with an almost identical spinal injury in 2005 , now runs a rugby Web site that supports a charity for children with spinal injuries .

Hampson said he met with James briefly last year to share his experience of living with paralysis . But James ' suicide , he says , was a personal choice that only James and his family can fully understand , adding : `` Who am I to judge what he did ? ''

`` You either get on with it or you die , '' added Hampson , who played for the England Under 21 team . `` I kind of see my role as getting on with my life to show people that , just because I 've had this catastrophic injury , that does n't mean I ca n't do things . I do n't think my life is worse . It 's a lot better in some ways . ''

Debbie Purdy , a 45-year-old who suffers from multiple sclerosis , says she wants the option of assisted suicide if her pain one day becomes intolerable . Purdy has a case before the High Court to clarify the law .

`` I just want clarity so I know whether or not my husband Omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if I decide to travel abroad and he accompanies me , '' Purdy writes on the Web site for Dignity in Dying , a British group that advocates for `` patient choice at the end of life . ''

Dignity in Dying says the law in England and Wales is unclear regarding assisted suicide . Although no one has been prosecuted for accompanying a family member abroad for the procedure , the group says , some relatives have faced police questioning .

`` I want to know what the law considers to be assisting a suicide , '' Purdy writes . `` Is Omar open to prosecution if he helps me into a taxi to the airport , or books my flights ? ''
