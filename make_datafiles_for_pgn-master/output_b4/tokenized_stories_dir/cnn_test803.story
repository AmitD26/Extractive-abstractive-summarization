Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama announced $ 8.3 billion in loan guarantees Tuesday for two nuclear reactors to be built in Burke County , Georgia .

A new nuclear power plant has not been built in the United States in three decades .

The new reactors are to be part of an expansion of an existing nuclear facility near Augusta , Georgia , operated by Atlanta-based Southern Co. .

The loan guarantees will help create 3,500 on-site construction jobs and 850 permanent operations jobs , administration officials claimed . The reactors will help provide power to over 550,000 homes and 1.4 million people , it said .

`` This is only the beginning , '' Obama said during a visit to an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers training facility in Lanham , Maryland . `` We 'll continue to provide financing for clean energy projects ... across America . ''

The president acknowledged that construction of new nuclear facilities will meet with some political resistance . Nuclear development has traditionally been opposed by more progressive elements of the Democratic Party . But nuclear power , he said , remains the country 's largest source of fuel that produces no carbon emissions .

`` To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change , we 'll need to increase our supply of nuclear power . It 's that simple , '' he said .

At the same time , the president argued , traditional Republican proponents of nuclear power should acknowledge that comprehensive energy legislation is needed to help provide incentives to make clean energy more profitable .

Any new nuclear facilities , he promised , will `` be held to the highest and strictest safety standards . ''

Leading congressional Republicans -- including both Georgia senators -- were quick to praise Obama 's decision .

`` This announcement represents a step in the right direction , '' said Sen. Saxby Chambliss , R-Georgia . `` The power generated by -LSB- the Burke County facility -RSB- is safe , reliable , emissions-free and environmentally responsible . ''

Nuclear power critics , on the other hand , slammed the administration 's decision to back the construction of new reactors .

`` The last thing Americans want is another government bailout for a failing industry , but that 's exactly what they 're getting from the Obama administration , '' energy analyst Ben Schreiber said in a press release issued this past weekend .

Schreiber works for the progressive group Friends of the Earth , which opposes nuclear power .

`` The Department of Energy is putting taxpayers on the hook for bailing out costly and dangerous nuclear reactor projects when the loans used to finance those projects default . This is great news for Wall Street but a bad deal for Main Street . ''

The risk of default is high , Schreiber argued , while nuclear power `` remains unsafe and dirty . ''

Energy Secretary Steven Chu , in turn , claimed that modern nuclear reactors are far safer than those built prior to the accident at Pennsylvania 's Three Mile Island in 1979 .

Chu also told reporters in a conference call that one of the reasons the Georgia facility was the first to receive a federal loan guarantee is the project 's low probability of default .

He added that the administration is now considering at least a half-dozen additional loan applications for nuclear facilities .

We are working `` as hard and as fast as we can '' to `` recapture the lead in nuclear technology , '' Chu said . America has been `` sitting on the sidelines ... for far too long . ''

Obama 's proposed fiscal year 2011 budget triples loan guarantees for nuclear power plants to over $ 54 billion , the White House noted .

CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux , Evan Glass , Deirdre Walsh and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .
