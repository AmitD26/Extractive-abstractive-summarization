-LRB- InStyle.com -RRB- -- Is there anything as romantic as a classic big screen kiss ? Even today -- when most Hollywood movies do n't exactly fade to black after the lovers lock lips -- the best kisses still have the power to send shivers down the spine . In honor of Valentine 's Day , InStyle chose the most memorable cinematic embraces : upside down , on a boat , and in the pouring rain .

`` Gone with the Wind ''

`` You need kissing badly , '' Clark Gable , as Rhett Butler , told Vivien Leigh 's Scarlett O'Hara in this 1939 epic . `` You should be kissed , and often . And by someone who knows how . '' Later on , while proposing to the twice-widowed Scarlett , he proves he 's the man for the job .

`` Lady and the Tramp ''

She was the original uptown girl ; he was a lovable drifter . But when these two crazy pups came together over a very long piece of spaghetti in this 1955 animated film , it was forever .

`` Breakfast at Tiffany 's ''

Truman Capote 's original 1958 novella was n't exactly a love story , so the author was less than thrilled with the 1961 big screen adaptation . -LRB- For one thing , he 'd wanted Marilyn Monroe to play Holly Golightly . -RRB- But audiences adored this stylish film , particularly for the final scene , in which Holly -LRB- Audrey Hepburn -RRB- and Paul -LRB- George Peppard -RRB- make a rainy New York City alley seem as romantic as any pink-streaked sunset .

`` When Harry Met Sally ''

This 1989 comedy made numerous witty contributions to the romantic lexicon -- and kickstarted a -LRB- still-raging -RRB- debate as to whether men and women could `` really '' be friends -- but it was the pair 's New Year 's Eve reconciliation that moved viewers to tears . As Billy Crystal -LRB- Harry -RRB- told Meg Ryan -LRB- Sally -RRB- : `` I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone , you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible . ''

`` Pretty Woman ''

`` I do n't kiss on the mouth , '' Vivian -LRB- Julia Roberts -RRB- warns Edward -LRB- Richard Gere -RRB- at the beginning of this 1990 movie . So when she does , it 's pivotal -- the audience understands that she 's come to regard Edward as much more than a client . But even that kiss ca n't beat the one at the happy ending , after Edward `` rescues '' Vivian on her fire escape and she promises to `` rescue him right back . ''

`` Titanic ''

Director James Cameron initially planned to cast `` an Audrey Hepburn type '' to play the female lead in this 1997 epic , and Leonardo DiCaprio nearly turned down his role .

`` Spiderman ''

The upside down kiss that Spiderman -LRB- Tobey Maguire -RRB- shared with Mary Jane -LRB- Kirsten Dunst -RRB- in this 2002 flick was breath-taking for Maguire , but not for the reasons you might think . `` The whole time I had rainwater running up my nose , '' he said . `` Then , when Kirsten rolled back the mask , she cut my air off completely . ''

`` Slumdog Millionaire ''

It was easy to see why Jamal -LRB- Dev Patel -RRB- was so hung up on his childhood friend Latika -LRB- Freida Pinto -RRB- . When they finally kiss on a Mumbai train platform , it 's a moment as exuberantly optimistic as the goofy dance scene that follows . Bonus points for still being a couple to this off-screen day .

Even the most diehard members of Team Jacob ca n't deny the romantic power of Bella and Edward 's first kiss .
