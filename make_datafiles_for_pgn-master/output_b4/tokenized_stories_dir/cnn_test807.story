Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Raymond Davis , the American accused of killing two Pakistani men , appeared Friday in a Pakistani court , where he was handed documents that detailed the case against him .

The court then adjourned until March 3 when Davis is expected to be formally charged .

The case has strained relations between the United States and Pakistan , a key ally in the war against al Qaeda and the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan , and the shooting deaths have outraged many Pakistanis .

Meanwhile , Pakistani authorities have detained a second U.S. citizen , identified as Aaron Mark DeHaven , in Peshawar , according to a statement Friday by the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad .

No additional details can be confirmed until a U.S. government representative meets with DeHaven , the statement said .

Davis has said that the January 27 shooting occurred after two men attacked him as he drove through a busy Lahore neighborhood , according to the U.S. Embassy .

U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat and later revealed he is a CIA contractor , intensifying the already highly charged situation .

During the court hearing Friday , Davis was handed over documents of evidence in the case , but he initially refused to accept them because they were in Urdu , a language he did not understand .

Clerks were told to translate the documents into English . Davis told the judge that he should be released from jail because he has diplomatic immunity , the same argument other U.S. officials have used since Davis ' arrest .

The judge said he was waiting on a response from the Pakistani government on that issue and that it should happen at the March hearing .
