-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The first ever regular season NBA game was played in Europe this weekend , as the New Jersey Nets took on the Toronto Raptors at London 's O2 Arena .

The British capital proved to be lucky for the Nets . The east coast team won both legs of the two-game tie -- they claimed the first 116-103 on Friday and the second 137-136 in triple overtime on Saturday .

Despite basketball not enjoying the same high-profile in Great Britain as it does across North America , fans packed the 18,600 capacity venue -- which played host to an exhibition between the L.A. Lakers and the Minnesota Timberwolves a year ago -- to watch the two highly competitive games .

In order to make sure anyone new to basketball understood what was going on , an announcer explained who the players , teams and coaches were and gave a commentary to explain the scoring to the crowd .

But aside from this , the game followed exactly the same format as any other NBA game would , with the points scored counting towards the Nets and the Raptors standings in the league this season .

There was also the same high energy half-time and time-out entertainment taking place on the court , with the two teams ' mascots present to entertain the crowds .

And just like any big sporting event held in the United States , the event was attended by a host of celebrities . Football stars Didier Drogba and David Luiz of Chelsea were spotted courtside , as were Jack Wilshere , Samir Nasri , Gael Clichy and Cesc Fabregas from English Premier League rivals Arsenal .

Part of the reason for the games being played in London was to promote basketball in Britain ahead of the 2012 Olympics -- to ensure the sport attracts the same large crowds as it did at the previous Games in Beijing .

However , as part of the NBA 's aim to expand across the globe , this might not be the last time we see games in the lucrative franchise decided on foreign soil .

NBA commissioner David Stern has hinted that more games could be held in London and elsewhere in Europe and Asia -- where demonstrations have also been held previously . He even said that there could be European based teams playing in the NBA in the future .

It certainly does not seem like the players would mind traveling to London again . Raptors and Italy star Andrea Bargnani said : `` The crowd was unbelievable . It 's great the Olympics are going to be here . ''

The Nets ' Brooke Lopez added : `` It was fantastic for the city of London to experience it and see two really fantastic NBA games . It gave them great exposure to the game of basketball and hopefully they want to see more . ''
