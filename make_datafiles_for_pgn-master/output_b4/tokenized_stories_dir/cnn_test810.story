-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There are few careers that can match the pedigree of Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho . Having just set a remarkable nine-year unbeaten home league record -- which spanned 150 matches and four clubs in four different countries -- the Portuguese manager is eyeing yet another remarkable record .

As he leads his Real side in the quarterfinal second leg against Tottenham Hotspur tonight , Mourinho is on the trail of becoming the first coach to win three European Cups with three different clubs . But as the 48-year-old aims to push his career to the next level , there may be the birth of a new star in his midst .

It was merely a coincidence that Porto clinched their 25th title as Los Merengues were shocked by Sporting Gijon at the Bernabeu -- Mourinho 's first home defeat in nearly a decade -- but what is not coincidental is the way Porto have dominated their domestic championship this season .

In a fashion not seen since the heady days of Mourinho between 2002 and 2004 -- when the self proclaimed `` Special One '' plundered two league titles , the UEFA Cup and the Champions League -- the youthful , dynamic and ambitious coach Andre Villas Boas has swept all before him .

Will Mourinho 's record ever be beaten ?

Villas Boas is Mourinho 's protege and student , but aged just 33 -- seven years younger than Mourinho was when he won his first title with Porto -- the question is whether the apprentice can match his former master 's astonishing achievements at the Estadio do Dragao .

Porto have simply outclassed their rivals this season , winning 23 and drawing the other two of their 25 matches to wrap up the title with five games remaining .

Along the way , they have scored 61 goals and conceding a miserly 11 , and are also through to the quarterfinals of the Europa League -- a competition Mourinho also won , under its former guise of the UEFA Cup , in his first full season .

`` I can find similarities between Villas Boas and Mourinho in the way they started their careers and the way in which they reached immediate success at Porto , '' Rui Orlando , a football commentator for Portuguese-based SportTV told CNN .

`` Furthermore , both of them were not known as players and started coaching very early on , working with some really well known coaches . ''

CNN Sport anchor Pedro Pinto , who has followed the careers of both men closely , is even more forthright in his comparisons of the pair .

`` There is no doubt in my mind that Villas Boas is the second coming of Jose . He is is a young , ambitious , disciplined football lunatic , who has soaked up as much knowledge as he can from working with the best coach in the world . ''

It is impossible not to draw comparisons between the two men . Mourinho learned his trade working as an interpreter for Bobby Robson at both Porto and Barcelona , picking up tips from the legendary English coach before eventually impressing with his own coaching acumen .

Villas Boas was also at Porto in the mid 1990s .

At the tender age of 17 , and with no football apprenticeship behind him , his mastery of English and attention to detail impressed Robson so much that the veteran coach hired the teenager to work as part of his scouting and statistics team -- sending him to Scotland to achieve his first coaching badges .

And when Mourinho returned to Porto , after cutting his managerial teeth at Uniao Leiria , he took Villas Boas under his wing , going on to employ the willing student at both Chelsea and Inter Milan in exactly the same manner as Robson had done with him .

Like Mourinho , Villas Boas started his coaching career at a small club .

Leaving his mentor behind in Italy , Villas Boas took over at bottom of the table Academica last season , performing a minor miracle to steer a club , without a win before his arrival , to mid-table respectability .

Porto , looking for a coach after sacking Jesualdo Ferreira following their failure to retain the league title and qualify for the Champions League , quickly came a-calling -- and Villas Boas has more than justified the decision to make him the youngest coach in the Portuguese top flight , with the club suffering just one defeat in all competitions .

`` He has had a very strong impact at the club , in the city and in the region , '' continued Orlando . `` He came in after a disappointing season and immediately asserted himself with a positive and confident attitude .

`` His philosophy is similar to Mourinho when he was at Porto . He likes to play attacking football based on ball possession and forcing opponents into submission and his planning is superb . He spends countless hours in his office sourcing information to give to his players . ''

And Pinto believes Villa Boas will go on to even greater success in the coming years . `` His strength is not only tactical , it is his ability to program players into doing exactly what he tells them to do .

`` His organizational and motivational techniques are so good that players really believe they can do what he tells them . ''

Even within the pantheon of great football coaches , there are few who have won titles before their 40th birthday ; even Mourinho fails to make the grade . But with Villa Boas claiming silverware at such a young age , maybe `` master '' Jose should beware of the burgeoning talent of his pupil .
