Sanaa , Yemen -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Five people were killed in clashes between rival forces in the Yemeni capital Sanaa as nationwide protests against the government continued Wednesday .

Of the dead in Sanaa , two were loyal to Gen. Ali Muhsen Al-Ahmar , who has defected to the opposition , a government security official said . The other three were regime soldiers .

Government forces were sending in armored vehicles as reinforcements to the demonstrations in Sanaa , the official said .

Thousands of Yemenis took to the streets in Aden , Taiz , Hodeida and Dhamar .

In addition to the dead in Sanaa , two people were killed in Aden , according to medical staff at the city 's Naqeeb Hospital .

Meanwhile , Yemen 's attorney general threatened to resign unless the government went after the killers of anti-government protesters last month .

Abdullah Al-Olufi said `` those who were responsible for killing almost 60 protesters and injuring hundreds of others should be identified and brought to justice soon . ''

`` If the security authorities do n't identify those responsible for the massacre including those who were masked , I will step down , '' Al-Olufi said as public and external pressure mounts on President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down .

Protests erupted in Yemen this week despite an attempt by Persian Gulf nations to decrease tensions .

The Gulf Cooperation Council has urged Saleh to transfer powers to his vice president , a move that falls short with the protesters who returned to the streets for marches . Opposition leaders vowed not to back down .

The Joint Meeting Parties bloc , Yemen 's largest opposition group , said the Gulf initiative `` does not clearly state that Saleh must step down and only focuses on Saleh 's transferring power . ''

`` We all know the VP is not strong and will never be able to tell Saleh no , even if all his powers are transferred , '' said senior bloc official Hasan Zaid .

Saleh , in power since 1978 , said he welcomes the council 's efforts to help resolve the political crisis in his country . He has said he intends to step down but only under a peaceful and constitutional transition process . He has already promised not to run in the next round of elections .

The United States , which has been allied with the Saleh government in its fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , has welcomed past Gulf council initiatives to resolve the crisis in Yemen .
