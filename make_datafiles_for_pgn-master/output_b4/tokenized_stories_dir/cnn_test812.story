Jakarta , Indonesia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations met in Indonesia on Saturday for a two-day summit expected to focus on efforts to achieve economic integration by 2015 .

The meeting started under the cloud of security issues such as the Thai-Cambodia border conflict .

Indonesia , which chairs the summit this year , has been trying to mediate talks between Thailand and Cambodia in their dispute over the ancient Preah Vihear temple .

Renewed fighting in the area has prompted displacement of thousands on both sides . Fighting along the turbulent border has raged since last month as the two sides accuse each other of trying to seize ancient temples .

Much of the border between the two countries remains in dispute .

Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urged member nations to promote peace .

`` We realize that to ensure peaceful and stable east Asia region , we must ensure stability and security in the region , '' he said in his opening speech .

`` History recalls that as one of the pioneers of regional integration in the world , ASEAN was established based on the strong desire to establish peace , building consensus , promoting stability through regional cooperation and integration . ''

Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa met separately with his Thai and Cambodian counterparts on Friday .

Last month , both nations agreed to the deployment of an Indonesian observer team to the disputed area , but have not agreed on conditions set by either country . There are no indications so far that the leaders of both nations will meet on the sidelines of the summit .

Other issues expected to be discussed is Myanmar 's bid to host the summit in 2016 , two years before its turn to assume the chairmanship .

Human Rights Watch urged ASEAN leaders to reject the proposal .

`` Rewarding Burma with ASEAN 's chairmanship after it staged sham elections and still holds 2,000 political prisoners would be an embarrassment for the region , '' said Elaine Pearson , deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch . `` ASEAN leaders need to decide if they will let Burma demote ASEAN to the laughingstock of intergovernmental forums . ''

Myanmar was formerly known as Burma .

The regional group rotates the chairmanship every year among its members : Brunei , Cambodia , Indonesia , Laos , Malaysia , Myanmar , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam . International pressure forced Myanmar to skip its turn in 2005 .

Yudhoyono also stressed the need for ASEAN leaders to address the challenges of food and energy security .

`` We must give serious attention and take concrete measures to address the soaring of food prices and world energy , which in turn will negatively affect the prosperity of our people , '' he said . `` History shows that the rise of food and energy prices usually caused the increase in the number of people living in poverty .
