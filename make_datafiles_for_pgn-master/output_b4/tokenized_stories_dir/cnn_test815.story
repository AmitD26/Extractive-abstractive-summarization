New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A New York billboard that focused exclusively on African-American abortion rates was taken down because of concerns for public safety , said Hal Kilshaw , spokesperson for Louisiana-based Lamar Advertising , on Thursday . The billboard was erected by group opposed to abortions .

The billboard was attached to a building that houses the restaurant Lupe 's Kitchen . Some of the wait staff , Kilshaw said , were being harassed by patrons who objected to the billboard . In addition , a scheduled protest Friday by people opposed to the billboard prompted public safety concerns , which led to the company 's decision .

Kilshaw said the controversy surrounding the billboard did not factor into the company 's decision to take it down .

`` We accepted the copy in accordance with our policy , '' Kilshaw said . `` We believe in people 's right to advertise , -LSB- we -RSB- thought it -LSB- the copy -RSB- was OK , -LSB- and -RSB- we stand behind that decision , '' Kilshaw said .

The sign , paid for by the organization Life Always , reads : `` The most dangerous place for an African-American is in the womb . ''

The billboard , about a half mile from a Planned Parenthood facility in Manhattan 's Soho neighborhood , featured an African-American girl .

`` They 're attacking women for choosing abortion while simultaneously destroying family planning , '' a spokeswoman Mary Alice Carr of NARAL Pro-Choice America said before the billboard was taken down . `` Their hypocrisy is as large and as obnoxious as this billboard . ''

But Stephen Broden , a pastor and Life Always board member , told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday that `` it 's hard to celebrate Black History Month '' with abortion `` hanging over our community . ''

`` Abortion is outpacing life in our community '' and he said the billboard 's message is meant to be a `` provocative '' way to illustrate the problem .

African-Americans have high abortion rates compared with other demographic groups , according to Rebecca Wind , a spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute , a New York-based research center for sexual and reproductive health .

The disparity is in part attributed to a `` lack of adequate services '' in many black communities , which `` has resulted in more unintended pregnancies , '' Wind said .

According to the Life Always website , the move is an attempt `` to raise public awareness of Life issues through advertising and raise truths about Life issues to educate and empower individuals . ''

The sign was part of a national campaign where more billboards will appear over the next couple of months across the country , Life Always spokeswoman Marissa Gabrysch said .

Calls to Life Always and NARAL Pro-Choice America were not returned Thursday evening after news of the billboard 's removal broke .

Bill Donahue , Catholic League president , released a statement Thursday in support of the billboard .

`` Life Always says it wants to raise public awareness of Planned Parenthood 's war on black people . Good for them , '' he said .

Critics say the message is misleading .

`` The issue is here they are doing a campaign , targeting one group of women and making them feel guilty and shameful about family choices that they are making , '' Carr said . `` You ca n't take a woman and lift her out of her experience . ''

But the Rev. Derek A. McCoy , another Life Always board member , told reporters something needs to be done about abortion in the black community and this is `` calling attention to a dramatic event . ''

`` This is a truth and tragedy , '' he said .

Broden said `` The child -LRB- in the billboard -RRB- was selected for her innocence . ''
