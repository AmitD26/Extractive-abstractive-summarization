-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Greetings , everyone ! It 's a great day for baseball .

We 've got a great battle for you today between two of the heaviest hitters in the baseball video game universe : `` MLB 11 The Show '' -LRB- Sony -RRB- and `` MLB2K11 '' -LRB- 2KSports -RRB- .

Both of these popular annual titles have retooled their lineups with some new additions this season . So in honor or baseball 's opening day Thursday , we match them up , feature by feature , in a nine-inning smackdown .

Here we go :

1st inning -- Pitching :

Both titles use buttons to select the type of pitch and the right analog stick for the delivery . `` MLB 11 The Show '' is a simple pull-back , push-forward motion with the analog stick for the velocity and direction of the pitch . The more you use a pitch , the better it becomes . A sliding bar indicates the best time to go from back to forward on the stick for optimum accuracy .

`` MLB2K11 '' uses the left stick for direction and right stick for a series of movements that correspond to the type of pitch you select . For example , a cut fastball might require a move to the left followed by a sweeping motion down . Your success is based on how well you time the power of the pitch and how accurate you are with your analog movements .

For ease of playability and not feeling like I have to contort every pitch , `` MLB11 The Show '' scores first here .

2nd inning -- Hitting :

Analog hitting is something both games do , but again , there is a difference in the execution . `` MLB2K11 '' uses the left stick to indicate the direction you want to try to hit the ball and the right stick to make contact . A simple swing is a push forward and a power swing is pull back , then push forward . Bunting is done with the square button .

Analog hitting on `` MLB 11 The Show '' is all done with the right stick . You can decide if you want a normal swing or power swing by using the circle or square button , respectively . Pull back on the stick to have the player stride and then push forward to swing . Bunting is just a push forward motion .

Both are easy enough to use , although I can not figure out if there is a timing to striding that helps hitting with `` MLB 11 The Show . '' However , check swings are a bit easier with the stride , so I 'm giving one run each to both games .

3rd inning -- Fielding :

Fielding in the games is identical . Move the left stick to get your player in position and use the correct buttons -LRB- or move the right stick if you are doing analog controls -RRB- to throw to the proper base .

While fly balls in each game use a circle shadow on the field to indicate where the ball is traveling , `` MLB2K11 '' changes things up a bit by utilizing a second circle inside the shadow to more precisely tell you where the ball is coming down . That second circle changes in size depending on the fielding rating of the player trying to make the catch . The better the fielder , the smaller the circle .

For that , `` MLB2K11 '' gets a run .

4th inning -- Players :

Each game is associated with the Major League Baseball Players Association , so almost all of the majors ' current players are in the game , and their likenesses are recreated in digital format . The rosters are updated online , but when I tried to get the latest Baltimore Orioles roster , `` MLB 11 The Show '' did n't include offseason acquisition Vladimir Guerrero in the lineup while `` MLB2K11 '' did . I did find Vlad in the free agent pool , however .

Both games try to recreate a realistic look and feeling with their digital players . `` MLB 11 The Show '' seemed to do a better job at portraying facial features and reactions without being repetitive . `` MLB2K11 '' had a couple instances where players would have sunglasses on while walking up to the batter 's box , then suddenly lose them when they stepped in . Also , `` MLB2K11 '' would sometimes repeat the same player motions over and over after every pitch .

Movement in the field felt more natural with `` MLB 11 The Show '' with fluid action and no noticeable hiccups . `` MLB2K11 '' had more than a few glitches when transitioning from fielding to throwing , but nothing that took away from actual game play .

`` MLB2K11 '' gets a run for the roster update out of the box , while `` MLB 11 The Show '' gets 2 for a better look for the players and smoother animation .

5th inning -- Stadiums :

Both games do a great job rendering all 30 major league parks with all the identifying quirks and traits that make each different . And both also have generic-looking minor league ballparks .

Since there is no real difference between the two games here , I awarded no runs this inning .

6th inning -- Living the dream :

Each game has a mode that allows you to create a player and take them from AA rookie to the Hall of Fame . `` MLB2K11 '' My Player mode provides a mentor that tells you what you need to work on in the minors to get your call-up to the bigs . Skill points can be earned during each at-bat , fielding chance or running opportunity . Increase your skills enough , and you earn a promotion to AAA or the big leagues .

`` MLB 11 The Show '' also lets you earn skill points and advance your way through your organization but offers more options when setting up your player . You can figure out what type of player you want to be -LRB- contact hitter , power swinger , speedster , etc. -RRB- . Players also receive evaluations and training to make them better and get them ready for the majors .

I played as a 2nd baseman and an outfielder in both . The infield experience was similar , but in the outfield , the camera angle on `` MLB2K11 '' sometimes made it difficult to tell where I needed to go to catch the ball . It got to be really frustrating at times .

So `` MLB 11 The Show '' scores a run this inning .

7th inning -- Real life :

Baseball is a game driven by statistics , and virtual baseball is no different .

`` MLB 11 The Show '' has developed a weather database that attempts to accurately reflect the real weather expected at each MLB stadium . That weather also affects what happens on the field and each player rating .

`` MLB2K11 '' tries to bring the real game into your virtual game by adjusting player skills as the season progresses . If a player in the real world gets on a hot streak , he will experience a hot streak in the game . Likewise , if he is not playing well , expect his performance to lag in the virtual world .

So thanks to those in-season adjustments , `` MLB2K11 '' gets the run here .

8th inning -- What 's new ?

`` MLB2K11 '' has some improved camera angles , a new revamped fielding system and upgraded player models -LRB- although they still could use some work -RRB- . The interface is better than last year , but still glitchy at times . It sometimes missed easy plays or threw to the wrong base .

`` MLB 11 The Show '' offers a new co-op mode that allows for a variety of options when you 're playing others online . The game also supports the Sony Move controller and offers a Challenge of the Week , where gamers can earn points toward prizes . And it offers 3-D functionality on the PlayStation 3 , if you want to see bats and balls flying at you .

Each game earns a run this inning because these new enhancements add value to both .

9th inning -- Bonus items :

`` MLB 11 The Show '' has a limited edition DualShock3 wireless controller that looks sort of like a baseball -- it 's white and has baseball seams where the left and right buttons are located . But it 's only worthy if you have a PlayStation 3 .

`` MLB2K11 '' is once again offering $ 1 million to anyone who can pitch -LRB- and record -RRB- a perfect game using specific criteria . Last year , an Alabama man won the prize using a spring training roster and game . This year , the contest does not actually start until opening day , so the feat may be harder to accomplish .

Let 's award one run for the awesome DualShock3 controller and one run for the potential of winning a million dollars .

And the winner is ... ?

Final score : `` MLB 11 The Show '' 6 , `` MLB2K11 '' 5 .

Both games reach for as much realism as they can . But overall , smoother animation and player renderings make `` MLB 11 The Show '' a better choice in achieving the feeling of immersion in the game . There seems to be more variation in movements and reactions with `` The Show , '' which appears cleaner that `` MLB2K11 . ''

That said , the in-season adjustments in `` MLB2K11 '' are an interesting real-life addition to your season .

Bottom line : Today 's contest was a close call , but either game would be a winner in your collection .

Both games were reviewed on the PlayStation 3 using the DualShock 3 controller . `` MLB2K11 '' is available on the Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , Wii , PlayStation 2 , PSP , Nintendo DS and PC . `` MLB 11 The Show '' is available on the PS3 , PS2 and PSP . Both are rated E for Everyone and available now .
