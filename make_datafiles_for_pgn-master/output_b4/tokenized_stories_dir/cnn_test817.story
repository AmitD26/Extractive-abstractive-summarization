Beirut , Lebanon -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hezbollah 's leader plans to speak Saturday about the indictment of four party members in the assassination six years ago of Rafik Hariri , Lebanon 's former prime minister .

The group 's press office said Hassan Nasrallah plans to make remarks about the U.N.-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon , which issued indictments and arrest warrants this week in the February 14 , 2005 killing of Rafik Hariri and 22 others .

Hezbollah is a Shiite political faction in Lebanon that provides social services to its constituents , but it has long been regarded as a terrorist organization by the United States and as an ally of Iran .

It has had longstanding animosity toward the tribunal , based on the expectation that some of its members would be indicted as conspirators in Hariri 's assassination , and Nasrallah has accused the group 's arch-enemy Israel of the assassination .

The tribunal submitted to Lebanese authorities a sealed indictment and arrest warrants for an unknown number of suspects .

A highly-placed source in the Lebanese Army told CNN the four include Mustafa Badreddine , Hasan Oneisa , Salim Ayyah and Asad Sabra -- all Hezbollah members .

Badreddine -- who is the brother-in-law of Imad Mughniyeh , a former Hezbollah commander who was assassinated in Syria in 2008 -- is reported to be a member of Hezbollah 's advisory council .

A U.N. source familiar with the tribunal said the people indicted include alleged perpetrators on the ground .

Two additional lists of indictments are expected later this summer and are expected to include the organizers and planners of the attack , the U.N. source said .

An indictment had been submitted in January and was then amended three times .

Daniel Fransen , a pre-trial judge with the tribunal , `` ruled that the indictment shall remain confidential to help Lebanese authorities in fulfilling their obligations to arrest the accused , '' the tribunal said . It wo n't comment on the identity anyone named in the indictment .

Authorities in Lebanon will have to report to the tribunal within 30 days on the measures they have taken to try to arrest the accused .

Many Lebanese believe the killing revolved around the controversies over Syria 's role in Lebanon , occupied at the time by Syrian troops , and the Damascus government 's strong political influence in Lebanon .

People believe Hariri wanted the Syrians to withdraw from Lebanon and lessen Syria 's influence , and many suspect that Syria and its ally Hezbollah went after Hariri because of his stance on this issue .

Those suspected connections of Hezbollah and the Syrian government to the killing have raised tensions in the country , stoking fears of sectarian conflict erupting in the ethnically and religiously diverse nation , which endured a civil war from 1975 to 1990 .

Syria had thousands of troops in Lebanon and great influence in the country until mass protests after Hariri 's assassination known as the Cedar Revolution forced their withdrawal . Syria has denied any involvement in the assassination .

Another was result of the anger toward the attack was the creation of the tribunal . The United Nations and the Lebanese Republic negotiated an agreement on the establishment of the body , based in the Netherlands .
