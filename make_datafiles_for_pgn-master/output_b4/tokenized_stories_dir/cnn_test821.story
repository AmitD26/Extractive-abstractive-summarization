THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Fridays are awesome ! Thank you for rounding out your week with CNN Student News . I 'm Carl Azuz , here to pilot you through 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines .

First Up : Libya Civil War

AZUZ : First up , United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says there are no signs of a cease-fire in Libya . That announcement came yesterday , one week after the U.N. Security Council voted to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . That 's part of the military operation that 's been firing missiles and running airstrikes . It 's been led by the U.S. Yesterday , there was talk of a deal that would make NATO , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the leader of the operation . But that was n't set in stone , and there was some doubt about it .

One interesting point about the conflict in Libya is how it could affect gas prices in the U.S. Libya produces about 2 percent of the world 's crude oil ; it 's not very much . But some stock traders are afraid that the trouble there could happen in other countries that produce more oil . That fear is one reason why oil prices are rising in the stock market . And that means gas prices are more likely to increase too , since crude oil accounts for about 65 percent of what we spend on gas .

Now , getting back to the military operation . Diana Magnay is on the ship that some of those airstrikes are launching from . She gives an idea of what life is like there .

DIANA MAGNAY , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Each night they fly , Harrier jets off the USS Kearsarge , bound for Libya . U.S. strike missions to take out Gadhafi 's air defense and attack capabilities as rebels clash with Gadhafi 's forces .

CAPTAIN MIKE WYRSCH , HARRIER FIGHTER PILOT : It was pretty neat the next day after the first attacks , to see that the rebel forces , their morale once they saw that they had people coming to help them out . But it 's breaking their supply chains as well as slowing down their advance onto Benghazi by taking out their tanks and artillery .

MAGNAY : Day times are about maintenance and repair , checking over these V-22 Ospreys , which had their first outing in Operation Odyssey Dawn early Tuesday morning . A daring rescue mission with a team of 30 Marines to find a U.S. fighter pilot who ejected over eastern Libya after his F-15 fighter jet suffered what the military called mechanical failure .

The pilot 's back in the medical facilities here on board . His other crew member , the weapons officer , also had to eject , but landed in a completely different location . So , he was rescued first by rebel forces and is now back on a U.S. Air Force base in northern Italy .

There are around 700 Marines on board , but this is n't a war which involves coalition ground forces . The Kearsarge 's six Harrier jets taking the active role in enforcing the U.N.-mandated no-fly zone

REAR ADMIRAL MARGARET KLEIN , COMMANDER , EXPEDITIONARY STRIKE GROUP FIVE : If there are vehicles on the ground that can shoot down our aircraft which are enforcing the no-fly zone , we consider that a legal mandate to be able attack that equipment .

MAGNAY : Precision targeting , 500-pound laser-guided bombs , and the sorties continue . No sign here that this part of the offensive is over yet . Diana Magnay , CNN , on the Kearsarge in the Mediterranean .

Violence in Syria

AZUZ : Syria is the latest country to deal with the political unrest that we 've seen around the Middle East and North Africa recently . Syria is located between Iraq and Turkey . And people there have been protesting over economic and human rights issues . Those demonstrations have gotten violent in the past few days , with protesters and security forces fighting on the streets of at least one city . Human rights workers say at least 34 people have been killed in the violence this week . And that includes a soldier who was reportedly shot because he refused to fire on the protesters . Thousands of people came out on Thursday for the funerals of that soldier and some of the other people who 've been killed .

Disaster in Japan

AZUZ : Toyota , the car company , might shut down some of its U.S. manufacturing temporarily because it does n't have enough parts . There 's been a delay in getting those parts from Japan because of Japan 's recent earthquake and tsunami . Inside Japan , workers are still trying to get things stabilized at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant . These pictures were taken inside the plant . Two of the workers were taken to the hospital yesterday after they accidentally stepped in contaminated water . Officials say the men could be all right if they 're quickly decontaminated . A U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is going through a similar process right now . Martin Savidge , you 're on deck .

MARTIN SAVIDGE , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Right now , every piece of hardware , every aircraft and every piece of machinery used to move that aircraft is on the front of the USS Ronald Reagan . And you can see a lot of the crew hands . You 're wondering maybe why are they all sitting around ? Well , we 'll show you . Look what 's going on back over here : water . Lots and lots of water just being sprayed all over the deck right now , in what is probably the biggest cleanup effort you 're ever likely to see at sea .

Shoutout

TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Ms. Mielke 's world cultures classes at Gorzycki Middle School in Austin , Texas ! What type of food is a peanut ? You know what to do ! Is it a : A -RRB- Grain , B -RRB- Legume , C -RRB- Fruit or D -RRB- Tuber ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Peanuts are legumes . And here 's another interesting fact : peanuts are not technically nuts ! That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout !

Allergy Outrage ?

AZUZ : Peanut allergies are pretty common . But in some cases , the allergic reactions can be life-threatening . And that 's why experts say it 's important to have a plan in place in order to avoid a potential problem . At one Florida school , the plan in place affects everyone , not just the student with the allergy . And as Jason Carroll explains , the plan is prompting protests .

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : They 're trying to take away all our rights .

JASON CARROLL , CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Protesters picketing outside a school in Edgewater , Florida . Their signs showing how a medical problem for one of the school 's students has turned into a controversy that has some parents calling for that student 's removal .

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We are not attacking the child or the parents .

CARROLL : At issue , rules the school put in place to protect the six-year-old girl who has a life-threatening peanut allergy . Lunches must be left outside the room . Students must wash their hands before entering the room and after lunch . At one point , students were also required to rinse out their mouths . Parents debating whether the rules infringe on the rights of students and take time away from education .

UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I guess it 's not fair for one kid to have a set of standards that the rest of the kids have to abide by .

UNIDENTIFIED MALE : It 's protecting the safety of the child . Everybody has the right to an education , so I do n't see what the problem is .

CARROLL : A district administrator says the rules must be enforced because the student 's allergy is considered a disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act . More districts could soon face a similar situation . The Centers for Disease Control says food allergies are on the rise . From 1997 to 2007 , reports of food allergies increased almost 20 percent among children under 18 years old .

DR. SCOTT SICHERER , PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS , MT. SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE : It 's always necessary to have precautions for a young child who has a food allergy . There might be specific procedures that need to be in place to just really ensure that that child does n't end up eating the food that they 're allergic to .

Before We Go

AZUZ : Finally today , I get sore just thinking about a marathon ; most runners are sore after running one . But Captain Ivan Castro does n't mind . He was injured while serving in Iraq and lost his eyesight . Now , every step is a reminder that he is still alive . After the attack , Captain Castro says it took three people to help him stand up . Last weekend , he finished a full marathon . And the only help he needed was his running partner , who helped him navigate the course with a string tied around their wrists .
