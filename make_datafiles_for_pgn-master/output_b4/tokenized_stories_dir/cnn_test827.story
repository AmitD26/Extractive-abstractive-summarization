-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- AC Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been ruled out of a return to his former club Barcelona when the group stage of the European Champions League kicks off on Tuesday .

The Sweden international , who spent just one season in Spain following his big-money move from Milan 's city rivals Internazionale in 2009 , suffered a thigh injury in training on Monday .

`` The tests carried out showed that the player has a strain in his thigh muscle and will not be leaving for Barcelona with the rest of the squad . He will rest for a few days and then start his treatment towards the end of the week , '' the Italian club 's website reported .

Ibrahimovic 's absence could mean a reprieve for Italy international Antonio Cassano , who was expected to make way for Brazil star Alexandre Pato despite scoring in the club 's Serie A opener on Friday . Ibrahimovic also netted in that game , a 2-2 draw with Lazio .

Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta said he was disappointed that his former teammate would not be lining up at the Camp Nou against the tournament 's defending champions .

`` It 's a pity that he ca n't play -- he 's a great player and you always want to play against good players . He really wanted to come and play , and it 's a shame he ca n't make it . However , I do n't think that takes anything away from the game , which should be fantastic , '' Iniesta told reporters at a pre-match press conference .

Iniesta will renew his rivalry with Milan 's Dutch midfielder Mark van Bommel , with whom he clashed during the 2010 World Cup final .

`` It 's true that during the final there was some rough play , but I prefer to think there was no malicious intent . He 's an opponent , but above all we are professional companions and I respect him in all respects , '' said Iniesta , who scored the only goal of the match in Johannesburg in extra-time .

Barca coach Pep Guardiola is expected to recall two-time world player of the year Lionel Messi , who was rested for Saturday 's shock 2-2 draw with Real Sociedad .

The Argentina forward will make his first competitive outing against the seven-time European champions , as he bids to be the competition 's top scorer for the fourth season in a row .

Barca will be without new signing Alexis Sanchez , with the Chile midfielder expected to be sidelined for two months after tearing a thigh muscle against Sociedad as the Catalan team dropped their first points of the La Liga season .

The match is the pick of Tuesday 's ties , with Viktoria Plzen of the Czech Republic hosting BATE Borisov of Belarus in the other Group H fixture .

In Group E , English club Chelsea host Germany 's Bayer Leverkusen , while Spanish side Valencia travel to Belgium to play Genk .

Chelsea 's build-up has been marred by a controversy over $ 80 million striker Fernando Torres , who supposedly criticized `` older '' teammates in an interview with Spain 's Primera Liga website which was translated to English on his personal Internet page .

`` We are going in-depth to regain the tape of that interview . We 'll see if things play exactly as they are in that interview , '' said the London team 's manager Andre Villas-Boas .

Torres was dropped for Saturday 's win at Sunderland , having earlier lost his place in the Spain squad for the Euro 2012 qualifier against Liechtenstein .

Group F sees another England-Germany clash as Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund host Arsenal , while French runners-up Marseille visit Greece 's Olympiakos .

In Group G , Portuguese champions Porto welcome Ukraine 's Shakhtar Donetsk , and Apoel of Cyprus host Russia 's Zenit St. Petersburg .
