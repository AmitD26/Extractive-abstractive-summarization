-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Not so long ago , the idea of a Casey Anthony movie seemed like a certainty . How could Hollywood resist the chance to adapt the sensational murder case ?

After all , producers did n't hesitate to turn the Amanda Knox , Natalee Holloway and Clark Rockefeller sagas into TV movies . And interest in those cases pales compared to Anthony , whose trial became the must-see television event of the summer .

But the public outrage over Anthony 's acquittal on murder charges is making some in the industry rethink the wisdom of adapting her story to the screen .

`` Anyone who pursued a movie based on these events , especially right now , will face some immediate backlash , '' said Matthew Belloni , news director for The Hollywood Reporter .

`` The nerve is so raw on this and so many people are so outraged by the verdict that anything that is seen as an attempt to exploit this , especially if the family is involved , will be seen as a negative by most of the people who followed the trial , '' Belloni told CNN .

The cable channel Lifetime would seem the logical home for an Anthony movie -- it aired the Knox , Holloway and Rockefeller films , and it 's in production on a movie about murder suspect Drew Peterson -LRB- with Rob Lowe in the lead -RRB- .

But when CNN asked the network if it was pursuing an Anthony project , Lifetime said it had `` nothing in development . '' When we asked if the network had obtained the rights to any of the central players in the case , we got the same response : `` We have nothing in development . ''

The mere hint of a connection to the Anthonys has sent Hollywood talent agencies diving for cover . When an erroneous report circulated last week that William Morris Endeavor had signed Anthony for representation , the agency was inundated with protest calls . It quickly sent out word denying the report .

And Paradigm , another big talent agency , signed Anthony 's lead attorney , Jose Baez , for representation , only to `` un-sign '' him several hours later after facing a drumbeat of criticism .

Actress Niecy Nash , who told CNN she watched `` every minute '' of the trial , is among those angered about the prospect of Anthony cashing in by selling the rights to her story .

`` If that girl -LSB- Anthony -RSB- makes one dime off of the death of her child , I 'm just telling you that I feel like America is going to be like , ` we are so done with you ! ' '' she told CNN .

`` I 'm upset because the opportunity to profit from a tragedy is laid out for this girl on a silver platter , '' Nash said .

Comedian and social commentator Alycia Cooper told CNN she could imagine a Casey Anthony movie under certain circumstances .

`` I do think there should be a movie made '' about the case , Cooper said . `` But I want the person that does the movie to be a neutral person , because that way , we 'll get more of a balanced movie , versus Casey Anthony doing the movie , because then it 'll slant her way , and it 's going to be filled with even more lies . ''

The possibility of a movie has inevitably spawned water cooler talk in Hollywood about who should play Anthony .

Cooper likes Alyssa Milano for the role . `` I think she 's got the chops , '' Cooper said . The Hollywood Reporter 's Marisa Guthrie picked `` Twilight '' star Kristen Stewart . Nash told us she would cast Katie Holmes or Anne Hathaway .

To play Casey Anthony 's father , the white-haired George Anthony , we heard suggestions of John O'Hurley of `` Seinfeld '' fame , Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Blake .

Speculation about casting the movie may be more than just idle chatter . Some people remain convinced there will be a Casey Anthony movie , including The Hollywood Reporter 's Matthew Belloni .

`` You 've got to believe that something this high-profile , something that everyone is talking about ... that eventually , this will become a movie , '' he told CNN .

The surprising verdict in the case only makes that more likely , Belloni said .

`` Then you have this outcome that many people ca n't reconcile with the facts , '' he said . `` That conflict presents good fodder for a film . ''
