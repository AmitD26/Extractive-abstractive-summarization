Cairo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of three American college students arrested in Cairo passed out from fear when Egyptian authorities accused them of taking part in violence , he told CNN Sunday .

`` There were cops and people with guns standing before us , '' Derrik Sweeney said , describing `` the scariest moment of my life . I did n't know if I was going to survive , and I actually fainted -- the only time I recall fainting in my life . ''

Sweeney , Gregory Porter and Luke Gates were back in the United States Sunday , a few days after an Egyptian court ordered their release .

Egyptian authorities had accused them of throwing Molotov cocktails in the clashes that have rattled Egypt in recent days .

`` That was entirely fabricated , '' Sweeney told CNN , adding that he and the others did not do anything `` to harm anyone or anything . ''

Porter was the first of the students to come home , returning to Pennsylvania on Saturday .

`` I just want to say that I 'm so thankful to be back in Philadelphia , '' Porter told reporters . `` I 'd like to thank my parents , my mom and my dad , for their support . ''

He also thanked his lawyers , embassy officials and the administration at the American University in Cairo for their roles in helping to secure his release .

Sweeney , 19 , of Jefferson City , Missouri , arrived at a St. Louis airport late Saturday night and was greeted by about two dozen relatives and friends .

All three students were attending American University in Cairo on a semester-long , study-abroad program . They have said they did not do anything wrong , according to their parents .

Sweeney is a student at Georgetown University ; Porter , 19 , is from Glenside , Pennsylvania , and attends Drexel University in Philadelphia ; and Gates , 21 , of Bloomington , Indiana , attends Indiana University .

Speaking to CNN on Sunday , Sweeney said he was `` hoping to see politics in action '' when he went close to the protests , but insisted , `` we were in the sidestreets '' and not in the thick of the demonstrations .

`` We were right near a large crowd , apparently near the interior minister , '' he said , when the police `` shot something into the crowd and we all sprinted away . As we were trying to regather ourselves , we found -- the three of us Americans -- found each other . And then someone came in plain clothes saying that they would take us to a safe place and help us out . The next thing we knew we were getting hit ... The first night we got hit in the face in the back of the neck a number of times . ''

While he does not know who the plain-clothed people were , `` I believe police , '' Sweeney said . `` They were certainly working with the police . They were able to walk around the police where the protestors were n't . ''

Looking back , he said , `` I have no regret that I went to the protests , '' but , `` I went too close to violent scenes . ''

`` Walking onto Mohamed Mahmoud street where there was violence was a bad idea , '' he said .

Adel Saeed , the general prosecutor 's spokesman , said Wednesday that a bag filled with empty bottles , a bottle of gasoline , a towel and a camera had been found with the three American students .

`` They denied the bag belonged to them and said it belonged to two of their friends , '' Saeed said .

Joy Sweeney , Derrik 's mother , said her family would celebrate Thanksgiving belatedly on Sunday .

Just three hours before the incident in Egypt , she said , she had talked to her son on the phone `` and he said , ` Do n't worry mom , we 're safe . It 's far away from where we are . ' ''

While she knew her son was in Egypt `` to experience the culture , '' she said , `` I did n't want him to be that close to the violence ... that was a little too close for comfort for me . ''

Drexel President John Fry released a statement Saturday expressing relief at Porter 's safe return and thanking all those involved .

Three Drexel students remain in Egypt and all of them want to stay as long as U.S. officials do not recommend they leave , Fry said .

Asked whether he wants to return to Egypt , Derrik Sweeney told CNN , `` I really enjoyed most of my time there and hopefully one day , '' but , he added , `` not very soon . ''
