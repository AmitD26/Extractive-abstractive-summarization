-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iraq scored in injury time Friday to beat 10-man China 1-0 and all but end their opponent 's hopes of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup finals .

The Asia Group A match in Doha was a mirror image of the side 's earlier clash in China a month ago , with Younis Mahmoud , who scored the only goal in Shenzhen , coming up trumps again in injury time .

China were handicapped by a red card for Zhang Linpeng and paid for missed chances .

Iraq , coached by former Brazil legend Zico , have moved into a strong position in the qualifying section , which is led by Jordan , who confirmed their place in the second stage by beating Singapore 2-0 .

Jose Camacho 's China would have to win their final two games and see Iraq lose by a heavy margin to Jordan and Singapore to claim an unlikely second in the group .

`` China played bravely , but we won the match and the result has almost guaranteed our place in the last ten , '' Zico told the official FIFA website .

`` The game went as we predicted . We knew China would attack , so we focused on defending in the first half before sealing victory late on . ''

Japan and Uzbekistan joined Jordan in clinching qualification Friday , continuing their domination of Group C.

Japan routed Tajikistan 4-0 and Uzbekistan beat North Korea 1-0 with Timur Kapadze scoring the only goal of the match for the hosts .

The big surprise of the day was the 1-0 defeat for Group D leaders Australia in Oman with Amad Ali scoring the winner in the 18th minute .

Australia will still be expected to progress after four earlier wins , with Frank Rijkaard 's Saudi Arabia moving into second in the group after a 3-0 win over Thailand .

In Group B , South Korea stayed top by beating the UAE 2-0 and Mahmoud El Ali grabbed the only goal of the game as Lebanon shocked hosts Kuwait 1-0 to move into second .

Iran held on to top spot in Group E but needed an injury-time equalizer from Mojtaba Jabari to scramble a 1-1 draw in Bahrain .

Iran lead Qatar , who recorded a 4-0 home win over Indonesia , on goal difference .

In the first round of African qualifying , the outstanding result Friday was 3-1 win for the Congo DR in Swaziland with Togo held 1-1 in Guinea Bissau . Totttenham 's Emmanuel Adebayor is set to return for Togo in the second leg next Tuesday .

A star-studded Argentina side were held to a disappointing 1-1 home draw by Bolivia in their third match of qualifying from South America .

Argentina , boasting the likes of Lionel Messi and Gonzalo Higuain , found the visitors hard to break down and even fell behind as Martins Moreno scored in the second half .

It needed an equalizer from Ezequiel Lavezzi to salvage a point , with Argentina booed from the field .
