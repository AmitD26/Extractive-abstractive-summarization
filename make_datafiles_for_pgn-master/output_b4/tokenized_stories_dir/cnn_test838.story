-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This week , `` American Idol '' Season 10 winner Scotty McCreery releases his debut album , `` Clear as Day . ''

As one would expect , the record 's 12 songs feature his deep crooning voice paired with lyrics about new love and small town aspirations . Fans of the teen should come away satisfied with this first effort , in that it 's pretty much what one might expect from a young musician with a gifted voice who one day found himself with a sizable record advance and access to coveted Nashville session players .

The 17-year-old McCreery is juggling his senior year of high school this fall along with promoting his album . So just how exactly does that work ? CNN spoke with McCreery from his home in Garner , North Carolina , about just that as well as young love , and what drink he will walk miles to enjoy .

CNN : You 're just starting your senior year in high school . What 's the class schedule like ?

Scotty McCreery : They did n't want me to have the first block because they did n't want me to be a distraction to kids getting to school . So I go in the second block and am there for the rest of the day . Next semester 's going to be the tough one . I have AP English and all that jazz .

CNN : How 's this work : You go on the `` American Idol '' tour , have amazing catering and then have to come back to cafeteria food ?

McCreery : -LRB- Laughs -RRB- Yeah , the catering was amazing on the tour ... I probably gained a few pounds I 'll have to run off . But they let us go off campus , the juniors and seniors ; we have a really big school and the cafeteria ca n't fit us all in there . We go out to Bojangles or Chick-fil-A . But we had Mexican food today , El Dorado 's .

CNN : Tell me about recording `` Clear as Day . ''

McCreery : Oh yeah , it was a lot of fun . It was kind of like the traveling studio , you know . We started off in Nashville and recorded a bunch of songs and once we got the tracks laid down , when I was on tour , whatever city I was in we 'd stop by a studio and they 'd bring the equipment from Nashville and we 'd lay down some vocals and then on to the next .

CNN : Looking back , does the record evoke certain themes ?

McCreery : Yeah , we were talking about this today , actually .

It 's got a cool thing about love . Not necessarily the boy-girl love or anything ; it talks about everyday love , it talks about family love with kids and parents , love with loss , love for my hometown on `` Water Tower Town . '' It 's not necessarily one theme of love , but it 's got a lot of influences . It 's a cool way that I like to think of it .

CNN : It 's very much rooted in what someone you 're age would be going through : Summer love , figuring out girls , football games .

McCreery : For me , an emotion is an emotion , whether you 're 70 or 17 . At 70 , you might have much more experience with it and know a little bit more about it , but if a 17 year old says they have a broken heart , in my eyes , they have one .

CNN : And those are some of the worst kinds .

McCreery : Oh , they 're horrible , absolutely horrible .

CNN : Some country records are riddled with clichÃ © s ; how do you avoid those ?

McCreery : The whole clichÃ © thing people think about country music , you know , `` drinking with the boys '' it is n't country music at all . Country music is real and talks about real-life situations and I think with this record we did that .

There 's a song called `` Back on the Ground '' and it can talk about a college student or someone like me , where you want to get of town and go live life but then when you 're at it for awhile , you ca n't wait to get back . I 've been at home for maybe 10 days since February and any time I can get a chance to get home , it 's a blessing .

CNN : Does going into this genre after `` American Idol '' give you a leg up versus other people coming out of that show that make a pop or an R&B record ?

McCreery : You know , I 'm not so sure exactly on that . But country fans are really loyal and they were really supportive of me . I did n't do the honky-tonk in the traditional way , but now , I 'm the newbie in country music . I was the `` American Idol '' and all that , but now I 'm making the transition and I 'm low down the ranks . Just like the senior in high school who becomes the freshman in college . I got to work hard and hopefully get my sea legs and stay around for a bit .

CNN : Obviously , your voice is the bread and butter . How do you take care of it these days ?

McCreery : On the road it was tough , singing every night and talking a lot . We had this thing called Throat Coat that we 'd drink a lot . Anytime I do n't have to be yellin ' or talking , I 'm trying to ease off on it . I 'm using it a lot and I do n't want to hurt it . It 's my instrument .

CNN : You mentioned the song `` Water Tower Town '' -- it might be one of the only songs that gives a shout out to sweet tea .

McCreery : I think that was the only one . I was the guy on ` Idol ' that walked six miles to -LSB- get some tea -RSB- . There was a time that I was going to go to McDonald 's because that was the only place in California you could find sweet tea . I took a right instead of a left , and I ended up walking six miles to get some sweet tea . I kept thinking as I was walking `` Man this is a long mile . ''
