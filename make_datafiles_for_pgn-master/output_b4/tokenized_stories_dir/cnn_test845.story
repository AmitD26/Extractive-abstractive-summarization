New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The occupiers of Wall Street have been portrayed by some as radicals , young kids without focus , ne'er - do-wells who 'd do anything but get a job . But one woman used her time in at Zuccotti Park differently , and as a result she has gone from Occupy Wall Street to occupying an actual office on Wall Street .

In the gathering of the so-called 99 % , Tracy Postert had no idea she would be the one who would be working for the 1 % .

`` There were some days it was a carnival , or lots of music , drumming , costumes , marching , protesting , '' said Postert , describing the weeks she spent demonstrating at the park in downtown Manhattan .

Frustrated with the economy , Postert says she jumped right into the Occupy Wall Street movement -- all in -- banging drums and washing paint - and dirt-covered sidewalks .

She sounds like the protester stereotype , but she is n't ; she has a doctorate in biochemistry .

In the past few years , the biochemist said , she had found herself at times unemployed or underemployed . Until a few weeks ago she decided to change her protest sign to a `` Job Wanted '' sign and hunkered down in Zuccotti Park with a handful of résumés .

`` Passers-by would say , ` Get a job , ' and I did n't have a really good response to that , '' Postert told CNN .

`` I wanted to say , ` Well , I 'm trying to get a job , ' but you know you ca n't really prove it . '' Postert said . `` So I said , why do n't I make a sign -LRB- and prove -RRB- that I am actively looking for a job ? ''

Within two days , she said , someone spotted her . They exchanged e-mails , and an offer followed .

That someone was a top executive at a Wall Street financial firm -- in other words , the enemy .

`` It might sound like it 's a fish-out-of-water story -- -LRB- round -RRB- peg in a square hole -- but it 's really not , '' said Wayne Kaufman , a market analyst at John Thomas Financial .

`` She was standing there . She had her sign , she had her résumé , and I just passed by her and I chatted with her just for a brief few seconds . And she was obviously an intelligent person , '' Kaufman said .

`` The résumé spoke for itself , it was very impressive , '' he said . `` So , I sent her an e-mail the next day and ... she responded almost immediately .

`` I asked her if she wanted to come in for an interview ; she said yes . I told her what I had in mind for her according to her skill set , and the rest is just history . ''

For now , Tracy is researching early stage biotech companies for John Thomas Financial . She says she plans to take a test that would allow her to become a broker , and thus a full-fledged member of the 1 % . So what are her former Occupy Wall Street compatriots saying ?

`` I have been accused of being a traitor to both sides . Some people are saying that the whole time I was at Occupy Wall Street I was really a Wall Street insider , '' says Postert .

She said she plans on keeping her sign . She pledged to protest again when she finds something she feels is worth protesting .
