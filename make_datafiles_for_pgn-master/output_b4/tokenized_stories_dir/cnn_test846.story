Tens of millions of Americans are on the move for the annual November trek to see family and friends , feast on turkey and pumpkin pie , and rediscover the joys of their hometown on Thanksgiving .

You probably know the drill : packed airports , crowded flights and lots of out-of-state license plates on the road .

All eyes are on the weather , which can turn a simple trip into a nightmare -- cue visions of Steve Martin and John Candy struggling to get to snowy Chicago in `` Planes , Trains and Automobiles . ''

Should you recline your seat ? The etiquette of crowded flying

Travelers faced stormy conditions in the Pacific Northwest , the threat of floods and severe storms in the South , lots of rain in the Northeast and the possibility of snow in parts of New England .

On Tuesday afternoon , weather-related flight delays were reported at airports including Philadelphia International , O'Hare , Newark International , LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International .

But the threat of bad weather is not keeping people home .

AAA projects that 42.5 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles during the Thanksgiving weekend , an increase of 4 % from last year .

Slightly fewer people are choosing to get to their destinations by plane .

About 23.2 million travelers will fly over a 12-day period surrounding Turkey Day , a 2 % drop from last year , according to a forecast by the Air Transport Association of America .

Unlike last year , when the `` National Opt-Out Day '' movement against airport body scanners threatened to snarl security lines across the country , air travelers are not facing the prospect of protest-induced delays . -LRB- The Opt-Out Day turned out to be a non-event . -RRB-

The TSA says it 's preparing its work force for a `` smooth holiday travel experience for travelers . ''

The busiest air travel days for the Thanksgiving holiday period are expected to be Sunday , November 27 , and Monday , November 28 , the Air Transport Association of America said .

If you 're flying into or out of Los Angeles International , Chicago 's O'Hare International or Orlando International , brace yourself for lots of company . Those will be the nation 's busiest airports this Thanksgiving , based on flight bookings , according to Orbitz.com .

-LRB- And in case you 're wondering , Mineta San Jose International in California and Kahului Airport in Maui , Hawaii , will be the least busy . -RRB-

No matter where you start your journey , flight attendants say , it 's a week when they see lots of extra-grumpy passengers worried about flight delays and cancellations .

`` There 's a little bit more at stake . Oftentimes , people are trying to get someplace to be with their family , so naturally they would be upset if they 're not going to make it , '' said Rene Foss , a veteran flight attendant for a major U.S. airline .

`` However , in general , it 's also kind of a festive time . Sometimes , contrary to what you might think , people are in a good mood because they are going for something kind of fun as opposed to just a business meeting or something related to work . ''

Flying with food or gifts ? Check out the TSA 's guide to what you can and can not bring through an airport security checkpoint . The agency reminds you not to wrap gifts you are taking on the plane because security officers may have to unwrap them if they need to take a closer look .

The TSA also offers tips on how to get through the security line faster , including packing coats and jackets in checked bags whenever possible and putting your shoes directly on the conveyor belt instead of a bin when they go through the X-ray machine .

Then , there are things you ca n't control : Snow , fog or rain may mean you wo n't fly on time or at all .

To avoid being stuck at the airport , sign up for airline alerts and check your flights frequently online before you leave home . If your flight is canceled , get in line for assistance and try your airline by phone or online at the same time to get an edge over other fliers who are trying to rebook .

Winter weather travel tips

If you 're driving through an area that 's expecting wintry weather , AAA recommends that you keep at least half a tank of gas in your car at all times and pack a cell phone , plus blankets , gloves , hats , food , water and any needed medication in case you 're stranded .

Stay safe out there , and happy travels .
