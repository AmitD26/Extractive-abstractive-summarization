-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Talk with two people who have been to Marrakech and you 'll get very different views on what a trip there is like .

One person will speak of the allure of wandering through a warren of market streets ; the other will complain of getting lost over and over again . One will tell you that people there are among the friendliest they 've met , if you can meet them halfway on the language . The other will say that the locals are only out to make money and not even directions are free . The food is exotic yet easy on the palate , or restaurants serve up bland clichÃ © s that still manage to turn you inside out .

And they would both be correct . Bottom line : Marrakech is not for the timid traveler .

My wife and I visited last November . We had heard it had much of what we look for in a travel destination : Centuries of history coupled with a very modern vibe . The city has a European feel , from the brand-name stores to the widespread use of French as a second or third language .

The crowded souks and calls to prayer from the mosque minarets are what you would find at the heart of a Middle Eastern country . It is the outline of the High Atlas Mountains that reminds you that this is North Africa .

The city 's origins stretch back to the 11th century . Back then Marrakech was a key trading route with sub-Saharan cities . And like other hubs -- Bruges as a European port , Samarkand on the Silk Road -- Marrakech had its golden epoch before falling from favor . The result is that parts of the city within the rose-colored walls and imposing gates surrounding the medina , or Old City , have a sense of being frozen in time .

The massive Jemaa el Fna is likely to be the focal point of your time in Marrakech , both as a destination and as a much-needed reference point . It is one of Africa 's largest squares , and as long as the city has existed it has been a place where storytellers , musicians , healers and just about everyone else has gathered .

During the day you ca n't walk through it without some snake charmer or henna tattoo artist offering to make your stay more memorable . At night , they push aside to make way for innumerable food stalls offering as genuine a selection of Moroccan cuisine as you 'll find at any restaurant . Grills sizzle beneath tiny merguez sausages and fish and skewers of vegetables . For the more adventurous , there is boiled goat head or bowls of snails .

More than once we were brought food that we did n't order , like the deep red harira soup and a basket of bread , maybe some fresh olives . We paid for it anyway , and frankly , it was worth it . It exposed us to foods we may not have tried otherwise . Just plan on paying a bit more than you might have expected . Later , you 'll walk it off as you wander amid the chaos , moving to incessant drum beats and chants , trying your best to take it all in .

Just north of the Jemaa el Fna you 'll find the myriad alleyways of the Marrakech souk , or traditional market quarter . No map will help you navigate these passages ; just accept that you are going to get lost and enjoy yourself along the way . While souvenir stalls are everywhere , you can still find shops selling items of remarkable craftsmanship that reflect local designs -- whether it is in the intricate patterns and colored glass of the hanging lamps , or leather goods from the tannery in another part of the city .

And trust me , the shop owners are always ready to make a deal . Make eye contact with a market trader , and before you know it you 're haggling over the price of something that you may or may not need , but will provide a terrific story when you get back home . Nothing here has a set price , and shopkeepers can be aggressive when they think you are interested in something . But no trip to Marrakech would be complete without trying your hand at negotiating .

At some point you realize that the hardest thing about visiting Marrakech is that you are usually moving at someone else 's pace . The streets of the souk are jammed with people who are either jostling to get past you or quite content standing in your way .

You and the other pedestrians will be on the lookout for young people on motorbikes heading in both directions . And everyone will try to maneuver around donkey-pulled carts . But anywhere you go -- and this is what makes a trip to Marrakech so special -- is an assault on the senses . It could be the vibrant colors of the shops selling mounds of rich spices or hand-tied rugs , the smell of food cooking , the press of the crowd , or the calls of the souk .

When all the bustle gets to be too much , there are plenty of sites that give you a chance to relax . South of the Jemaa el Fna stands the 19th century Bahia Palace and gardens , originally built for a high-ranking official and his concubines . You wo n't find a palace in the sense of Versailles or the Hofburg . Instead , you 'll meander through a series of rooms with little more than lavishly decorated floors , walls and ceilings , leading to courtyards with fruit trees and fountains . We walked through the palace on our own , though I suspect a proper tour could be organized . The Ben Youssef Medersa , a former boarding school where for hundreds of years young men studied the Quran , will amaze you with its intricate stucco and cedar carvings .

Or just sit in the shadow of the Koutoubia Mosque minaret , an important example of the region 's Islamic architecture . Or simply hop on one of the tour buses at the far end of Jemaa el Fna and check out Marrakech 's modern Gueliz district .

Staying in Marrakech is best experienced at a riad , a traditional Moroccan home built around a central courtyard . The whole idea was originally to create as private a dwelling as possible , so even finding the entrance to one can be a challenge -LRB- always ask your hosts if someone can meet you , if not at the airport , at least at the edge of the Old City to get you there -RRB- . The best have only a few rooms , each uniquely decorated and appointed . Your hosts will be more than ready to offer suggestions on where to eat , what to see , or just to offer a soothing cup of tea on the rooftop terrace .

Soothing tea aside , when you get back from Marrakech , do n't expect to feel relaxed . Exhausted is more like it . You will have navigated more alleyways , gotten lost more times and told more people `` no , thank you '' for one reason or another than you should on a vacation . But a few weeks later , when you are looking back over the pictures you took , none of that will matter much . All you 'll remember will be the sights and sounds that make Marrakech so special .

And you 'll be thinking about when you might go back .
