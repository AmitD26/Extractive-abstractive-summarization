-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Harry Redknapp is hoping to perform another Premier League rescue act after being confirmed as the new manager of bottom club Queens Park Rangers on Saturday .

The 65-year-old , who kept both Portsmouth and Tottenham in the English top flight , has replaced Mark Hughes .

The Welshman was fired on Friday after 11 months in charge , having failed to win a league match this season .

Redknapp , who was interested in becoming coach of the Ukrainian national team , was at Old Trafford on Saturday for Rangers ' game against Manchester United .

Winless QPR sack Hughes

Redknapp has been out of work since being sacked by Tottenham five months ago , having taken the London club to fourth in the Premier League but missing out on another Champions League campaign after Chelsea 's Munich triumph in May .

`` I 'm delighted to be back in the managerial hot-seat at QPR , '' said Redknapp , who won the English FA Cup with Portsmouth in 2008 after returning the club following a controversial move to neighboring Southampton , who were relegated in 2005 .

`` When I spoke to the shareholders and they told me about their plans I knew this was too good an opportunity to turn down .

`` There 's no doubt there 's a lot of ability in the squad , but for one reason or another things have n't gone as well as everyone expected since the start of the season .

`` I ca n't wait to get to work and get the results necessary to kickstart our season . ''

Redknapp was named Premier League manager of the year for 2009-10 after taking Spurs to Champions League qualification for the first time , and he guided the team to the quarterfinals in Europe the following season .

He had taken over with the club bottom of the Premier League in October 2008 with just two points from eight games , but guided Spurs to eighth place .

The former West Ham manager was favorite to take over as England boss when Fabio Capello quit in February this year , but -- although he was cleared in a high-profile tax court case -- missed out to Roy Hodgson and was then sacked after a poor finish to the season .

`` Harry was our number one target , the unanimous choice of the board and we 're delighted we 've been able to attract him to the club , '' QPR chairman Tony Fernandes said .

`` He has a proven track record in the Premier League and has all the characteristics we were looking for to get us out of the current situation we find ourselves in .

`` His man-management skills are second to none and we are confident he is the right man to lead us away from the bottom of the table . ''

Redknapp said on Friday he had been `` close '' to filling Ukraine 's vacant coaching role .

`` It was a job which excited me . We met the people and they were fantastic , '' he said .

`` It was exciting and something I 'd never done in my life and something I was really up for .

`` But when Mark left the job it changed everything . Yesterday , I was almost on my way to Ukraine . But when I got the phone call it changed everything around . ''
