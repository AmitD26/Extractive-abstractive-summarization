-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Taking a cue from Twitter , Facebook will be rolling out `` verified accounts '' for its most popular users -- presumably hoping to encourage the Lady Gagas of the world to get active on the site .

Starting Thursday , the site began testing a system that lets people with a large number of subscribers submit a government ID to prove they really are who they say they are .

`` This update makes it even easier for subscribers to find and keep up with journalists , celebrities and other public figures they want to connect to , '' a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail .

Once verified , a user will be able to `` more prominently display an alternate name -LRB- nickname , maiden name , byline , etc. -RRB- on their timelines in addition to their real name . ''

Unlike Twitter , Facebook has required users to register under their real names .

So , now presumably Stefani Germanotta can be Lady Gaga on Facebook , Declan McManus can be Elvis Costello , and Madonna Louise Ciccone can share photos of her Super Bowl performance using just her first name .

Twitter , which lets folks create an account using any handle they want , has long had `` verified '' accounts for public figures to distinguish the real people and their tweets from the impersonators . While at one point users could request one , the site now makes its own decisions about who gets the coveted check-mark .

The nickname issue has been a thorny one for social-networking sites like Facebook that stake their brand -LRB- and target their advertising -RRB- based on people using their real identities . Last month , Google 's upstart networking site , Google + , settled the issue with a compromise similar to Facebook 's -- allowing people to display a nickname or other pseudonym alongside their real name .

In the early going , Google + had taken flak from early adopters , some of whom were booted for signing up with names that were not real . Many of those people argued they were more widely known by nicknames on the Web .

Celebrities , sports stars , journalists and the like who have been verified by Facebook will now get more prominent display on the site 's `` People To Subscribe To '' list .

Facebook has been allowing subscriptions for about five months . They let users share information with anyone who chooses to subscribe to their feeds without having to actually become Facebook friends with them .
