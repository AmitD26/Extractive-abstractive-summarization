-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two Mexican nationals were charged Monday in the death of a U.S. Coast Guardsman , whose succumbed to a traumatic head injury after his boat was rammed off the Southern California coast .

The suspects -- Jose Meija-Leyva and Manuel Beltran-Higuera -- are charged with killing a U.S. government officer while that officer was on duty in the death of Chief Petty Officer Terrell Horne III , the U.S. attorney 's office for the central district of California said in a news release .

Neither man was asked to enter a plea when they appeared Monday afternoon in federal court , where Magistrate Judge Victor Kenton ordered them held without bond , U.S. attorney 's office spokesman Thom Mrozek said . A preliminary hearing is set for December 17 , and their arraignment is set for December 21 .

Calls placed Monday evening to the separate attorneys representing the two suspects were not immediately returned .

Early Sunday morning , the crew of a Coast Guard patrol aircraft spotted a panga boat near Santa Cruz Island , suspecting `` it was engaged in illegal activity , '' said Capt. James Jenkins . A panga is an engine-powered work boat often used off the coast of Mexico or Central America and is typically 25 feet to 45 feet long , Jenkins said .

The aircraft 's crew alerted the captain of the Cutter Halibut , an 87-foot patrol boat , which headed to the scene and noticed the panga `` operating with no lights . '' A small boat was dispatched from the Halibut , and it headed closer to the suspect vessel .

Then , the panga accelerated and slammed into the small boat , forcing Horne and another Coast Guard member overboard . Two Coast Guard colleagues on the same small boat recovered their shipmates , and all four boarded the Halibut as it headed to the nearest port .

Having suffered a traumatic head injury , Horne was pronounced dead by emergency medical personnel upon his arrival on shore at Port Hueneme . The other Coast Guardsman tossed overboard was treated at a hospital for `` relatively minor injuries '' and released later Sunday morning , Jenkins said .

The panga boat fled .

Around 5 a.m. Sunday , about four hours after the initial crash , the panga was located about 20 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border , according to the criminal complaint .

Coast Guard officers pulled up and ordered the boat 's occupants , at gunpoint , to exit the boat . They refused to comply , and the panga raced away . It then stalled , refused further orders , and sped away again , the complaint said .

In the third try , a Coast Guard officer pepper-sprayed both men on the panga . That boat 's driver was detained after a struggle with Coast Guard officers , while his passenger was `` detained without incident , '' the criminal complaint said .

The suspects had entered the United States `` illegally from Mexico , '' according to the document .

Meija-Leyva told investigators `` he was taking gasoline to some lost friends north of Los Angeles , '' and Beltran-Higuera said he 'd been offered $ 3,000 to transport gas to a waiting panga boat off the U.S. coast . As for what happened early Sunday , Beltran-Higuera said he heard people yelling `` Stop ! Put your hands up ! '' then `` a series of gunshots before the Coast Guard vessel collided with the panga , '' the criminal complaint stated .

The same day the two suspects were in court , colleagues of Horne remembered him as a devoted Coast Guardsman and beloved friend . The Redondo Beach , California , resident , 34 , was second-in-command on the Cutter Halibut .

`` Words can not express -LRB- the -RRB- admiration that I have for him , '' said the ship 's commander Lt. Stewart Siebert , as he fought back tears . `` He was my friend , he was my confidant , he was the glue that held my crew together . ''
