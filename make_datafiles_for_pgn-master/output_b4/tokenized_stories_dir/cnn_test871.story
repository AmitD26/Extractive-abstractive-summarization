-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Torkham border crossing in Pakistan was opened for NATO supply convoy traffic Sunday morning , authorities told CNN .

Trucks are free to pass once they have cleared customs , said Amjad Ali , a constable for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province .

Pakistan closed the main land route for NATO supplies crossing from Pakistan to Afghanistan after U.S. helicopter strikes across the border killed two Pakistani soldiers .

A report from a NATO and Pakistan assessment team concluded that soldiers fired warning shots to let them know of their presence , but the helicopter crews assumed they were insurgents and fired the shots .

While the main route has been closed , at least seven attacks on convoys carrying supplies for NATO forces in Afghanistan have taken place in Pakistan . The convoys are generally operated by contracted Pakistani firms , using Pakistani trucks and drivers .

Since October 1 , at least six people have been killed in attacks on supply vehicles .

The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the most recent attack , which took place Saturday in Pakistan 's western Baluchistan province .

Assailants attacked 28 oil tankers with a machine gun and rockets , said Meeran Bukhsh , a police official in the Bolan district , said . Police said the tankers caught fire , and two people were injured .

The attack was carried out by the Pakistani Taliban 's special squad on U.S. assets in Pakistan -- particularly fuel trucks for NATO , Shakir Khan , the militants ' spokesman said Saturday .

The special squad was purportedly founded in response to increased U.S. drone strikes .

`` We are very proud of the performance of this squad as they have been able to successfully target NATO convoys all over Pakistan , '' Khan said .

A second supply route through Chaman in western Pakistan was open during the Torkham closure , but the Pakistani Taliban has threatened violence on any route used for NATO purposes .
