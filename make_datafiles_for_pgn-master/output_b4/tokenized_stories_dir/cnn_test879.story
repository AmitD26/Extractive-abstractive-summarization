Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Months after announcing the reintroduction of the low-cost Datsun brand -- to be assembled in Indonesia -- Nissan Motor Company on Tuesday moved its global headquarters for its luxury Infiniti line to Hong Kong to be closer to the red-hot Chinese luxury market .

The common denominator between both moves : Building production and customer base outside the Japanese market , as export-driven companies have been hammered by the high value of the yen .

Nissan produces about 20 % of its cars in Japan , but CEO Carlos Ghosn would like to see that reduced .

`` We 're going to continue to do that -LRB- offshore production -RRB- , obviously , because how can you compete with the yen at 80 yen to the dollar when the historic level has been 110 -LRB- yen to the dollar -RRB- ? '' Ghosn told CNN 's Andrew Stevens . `` We can not compete against Korean makes or other competitors . ''

The yen hit record high of 75.93 yen to the U.S. dollar in October and remains stubbornly strong , hovering around the 79.45 yen to the dollar this week .

`` I 'm still not happy because of the strength of the yen . The strength of the yen is a penalty for Japan , '' Ghosn said . `` I do n't think it 's so much a penalty for companies , because large companies have the possibility to off-shore production . ''

Despite the ongoing travails in Europe , Ghosn predicts 2012 will be a record year for the automotive industry . `` Last year the industry produced and sold about 76 million cars -- we are on a trend this year to sell 79 million , '' he said .

`` I think in 2012 we 're going to have a recession in Europe , that 's obvious , '' he added .

`` Yes , Europe is going to be a problem ... but Japan 's going to be better than last year , '' Ghosn said , as the world 's third largest economy recovers from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami , and the subsequent energy problems , as the nation 's nuclear plants went off line following the Fukushima nuclear disaster .

`` The U.S. is in recovery more -LRB- and will sell -RRB- 1 million additional cars compared to last year , '' Ghosn said . `` China , even though the growth has slowed down , there is still growth -- 5 % to 6 % growth of 17 million or 18 million cars sold there is still an additional million cars worth of growth .

`` Brazil is growing well , India is growing well , Russia is growing well , the Middle East is coming back , '' he added .

The move of Infiniti 's headquarters to China is designed to help Nissan capture the luxury car market , a segment which has seen `` 20 % to 25 % growth on a yearly basis , '' Ghosn said .

Nissan announced earlier this year the return of the Datsun brand after 30 years . The company plans to introduce the low-cost car in several emerging markets in 2014 .

The Datsun brand first emerged in Japan in 1923 but was phased out in the 1980s as the company focused on mid-market buyers and its upscale Infiniti brand , launched in 1989 .

The company also plans to invest $ 400 million in Indonesia production , adding 3,300 jobs and producing 250,000 vehicles by 2014 .
