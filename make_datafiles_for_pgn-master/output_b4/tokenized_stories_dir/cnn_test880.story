-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- How do you solve a problem like Mario Balotelli ? After an eventful fortnight that saw the Manchester City striker gatecrash a press conference , row with teammates and crash his Bentley , it 's perhaps no wonder that his club manager Robert Mancini has been driven to despair .

When reporters this week quizzed Mancini over an alleged locker room bust-up between Balotelli and teammate Kolo Toure , the Italian sympathized with his frustrated squad .

`` I can understand it . I told him -LRB- Mario -RRB- , if you played with me 10 years ago I would give you every day maybe one punch in your head , '' Mancini said ahead of Sunday 's trip to Arsenal -- a match that could have a big bearing on the English title race .

`` I think in every big game he played very well . I think his problem is his concentration , but I work with him every day .

`` I speak with him -- not every day because if not I need a psychologist -- but every two days I speak with him . ''

It was one of Mancini 's most frank discussions about the troubled player who earlier this season set off fireworks in his bathroom with a group of friends , causing severe damage .

The controversy continued with Balotelli gatecrashing new Inter Milan boss Andrea Stramaccioni 's first press conference late last month . The ex-Inter player unexpectedly entered the press room as Stramaccioni was being formally unveiled as Claudio Ranieri 's replacement .

Just days later he again aggravated the football world , being reportedly involved in a dressing-room row with Yaya Toure during second-placed City 's 3-3 draw with Sunderland . In the same game , in which he scored twice but was criticized for his performance , Balotelli also argued with teammate Aleksandar Kolarov over who should take a free-kick .

`` Yaya Toure -- that is totally false , '' Mancini said . `` What happened with Kolarov on the pitch , that is a situation that can happen in difficult moments .

`` It is not good but I can understand this situation can happen . After the game it was finished . I am not worried -- it is important that after the game everything was okay . ''

Then there was Thursday 's car crash in Manchester city center . Balotelli , driving his Bentley at the time , escaped unhurt , while a passenger from one of the other vehicles involved was taken to hospital as a precaution , according to police .

With Balotelli 's erratic antics continuing to grab headlines , Mancini may be pressed to find an answer soon -- especially if he is to quell locker room bust-ups and his squad 's growing suspicions there is one rule for Mario and another for the rest .

But despite the aggravation , Mancini refuses to completely condemn the 21-year-old Italian .

`` Because when you have a player like Mario you should always not talk bad things against him because he is your teammate . If you say something about him , it 's better to talk face-to-face , to say what you think , '' he said .

`` Mario is young . He can do some mistakes . He has paid for his mistake . I can understand -LRB- why players are annoyed . -RRB- I understand this . But there are different ways to help guys like Mario . ''
