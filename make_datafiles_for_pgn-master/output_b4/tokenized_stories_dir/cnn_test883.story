ANTHONY , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Texas may be best known for `` Big Oil . '' But the oil that could some day make a dent in the country 's use of fossil fuels is small . Microscopic , in fact : algae . Literally and figuratively , this is green fuel .

Plant physiologist Glen Kertz believes algae can some day be
competitive as a source for biofuel .

`` Algae is the ultimate in renewable energy , '' Glen Kertz , president and CEO of Valcent Products , told CNN while conducting a tour of his algae greenhouse on the outskirts of El Paso .

Kertz , a plant physiologist and entrepreneur , holds about 20 patents . And he is psyched about the potential algae holds , both as an energy source and as a way to deal with global warming .

`` We are a giant solar collecting system . We get the bulk of our energy from the sunshine , '' said Kertz .

Algae are among the fastest growing plants in the world , and about 50 percent of their weight is oil . That lipid oil can be used to make biodiesel for cars , trucks , and airplanes . Watch how pond scum can be turned into fuel ''

Most people know algae as `` pond scum . '' And until recently , most energy research and development projects used ponds to grow it .

But instead of ponds , Valcent uses a closed , vertical system , growing the algae in long rows of moving plastic bags . The patented system is called Vertigro , a joint venture with Canadian alternative energy company Global Green Solutions . The companies have invested about $ 5 million in the Texas facility .

`` A pond has a limited amount of surface area for solar absorption , '' said Kertz .

`` By going vertical , you can get a lot more surface area to expose cells to the sunlight . It keeps the algae hanging in the sunlight just long enough to pick up the solar energy they need to produce , to go through photosynthesis , '' he said .

Kertz said he can produce about 100,000 gallons of algae oil a year per acre , compared to about 30 gallons per acre from corn ; 50 gallons from soybeans .

Using algae as an alternative fuel is not a new idea . The U.S. Department of Energy studied it for about 18 years , from 1978 to 1996 . But according to Al Darzins of the DOE 's National Renewable Energy Lab , in 1996 the feds decided that algae oil could never compete economically with fossil fuels .

The price of a barrel of oil in 1996 ? About 20 bucks !

Government scientists experimented with algae in open ponds in California , Hawaii , and in Roswell , New Mexico .

But that involved a lot of land area , with inherent problems of evaporation and contamination from other plant species and various flying and swimming critters . Darzins said NREL switched from algae research to focus on cellulosic ethanol . That 's ethanol made from plants like switchgrass and plant stover -- the leaves and stalks left after a harvest -- but not edible crops such as corn and soybeans .

Valcent research scientist Aga Pinowska said there are about 65,000 known algae species , with perhaps hundreds of thousands more still to be identified .

A big part of the research at the west Texas facility involves determining what type of algae produces what type of fuel . One species may be best suited for jet fuel , while the oil content of another may be more efficient for truck diesel .

In the Vertigro lab , Pinowska studies the care and feeding of algae for just such specifics . She said even small changes in the nutrients that certain algae get can help create a more efficient oil content .

And she said a knowledge of algae 's virtues goes way back .

`` Even the Aztecs knew it was beneficial ; they used it as a high protein food , '' said Pinowska .

The other common commercial use of algae today is as a health food drink , usually sold as `` Spirulina . ''

I 'm too sexy for my pond

And who knew that single celled plants could be such `` hotties '' when it comes to sex ? Kertz said it 's a real `` algae orgy '' under the microscope .

Some algae reproduce sexually , some asexually , while many combine both modes . In some green algae the type of reproduction may be altered if there are changes in environmental conditions , such as lack of moisture or nutrients .

Intriguing details like that keep Kertz and other scientists searching for more and different algae . While dusty west Texas may not be the best hunting grounds , he said he is always on the lookout for samples in puddles , streams or ponds .

Locating algae processing plants intelligently can add to their efficiency . Locating algae facilities next to carbon producing power plants , or manufacturing plants , for instance , the plants could sequester the C02 they create and use those emissions to help grow the algae , which need the C02 for photosynthesis .

And after more than a decade hiatus , the U.S. government is back in the algae game . The 2007 Energy Security and Independence Act includes language promoting the use of algae for biofuels . From the Pentagon to Minnesota to New Zealand , both governments and private companies are exploring the use of algae to produce fuel .

But Al Darzins of the National Renewable Energy Lab said the world is still probably 5 to 10 years away from any substantial use of biofuels .

`` There 's not any one system that anyone has chosen yet . Whatever it is has to be dirt , dirt cheap , '' said Darzins . E-mail to a friend
