New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A member of Pedro Hernandez 's family walked into a Camden , New Jersey , police station in the 1980s and reported that Hernandez told relatives and others that he had killed a boy in New York and threw the body near a Dumpster -- but there 's no indication anything came out of that report , the family member told CNN .

`` You feel like they did n't believe you . I felt empty and a little bit mad , '' the relative said . `` I was expecting something else . ''

Now , 33 years after Etan Patz disappeared , Pedro Hernandez stands accused of choking to death the 6-year-old youngster after luring him to the basement of a corner grocery store in New York City , and of throwing away his body inside a trash bag .

The family member , who CNN has agreed to not identify , said there was no receipt of paperwork to document the information provided -- nor was the relative ever contacted again about the report .

`` Police asked whether I was mad '' at Hernandez or had an ulterior motive , the source added .

Hernandez allegedly confided the information to a New Jersey church prayer group that included some members of his family and his then-spiritual adviser , the source told CNN .

Tomas Rivera , a leader of the prayer group , declined comment Monday on Hernandez or the prayer group , citing authorities who told him not to talk to the media .

Pastor : Wife of suspect in Etan Patz case ` absolutely shell-shocked '

At 19 , shortly after Patz 's disappearance on May 25 , 1979 , Hernandez left his job as a stock clerk and returned to his mother 's home in North Camden , New Jersey . The attempt to tell police that Hernandez might have killed a child happened a few years after that .

CNN has not been able to reach Camden police for comment .

`` When he moved home , he was really nervous and shaking all the time , '' the family source said of Hernandez . `` He constantly had diarrhea , and he spent a lot of time just looking out the window , '' the source added , saying the behavior was out of character for Hernandez .

Hernandez also allegedly told his first wife that he had killed a boy , according to the source . CNN has not been able to reach her . The two divorced , and Hernandez has remarried .

Neighbors say suspect in Patz killing lived a quiet life with his family

Before Hernandez was picked up for questioning last week , the family source was visited by police and asked about any previous confessions from Hernandez about killing someone .

Surprised to be contacted after so many years had gone by without hearing anything , the family member asked , `` What took you so long ? ''

The family member did n't get an answer and does n't know what prompted police to visit .

The relative had no explanation for why no other relative spoke up years ago . `` Maybe they did n't want to get involved , '' the source said . `` I was n't going to stay quiet . I have a conscience . ''

The family source said he was surprised on Friday , when Hernandez ' defense attorney announced in court that his client has a long psychiatric history , is on medication for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , and suffers from hallucinations .

Attorney Harvey Fishbein said Hernandez -- who was on suicide watch at Bellevue Hospital on Sunday -- has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation .

New York police say they tracked down Hernandez after a tipster they wo n't identify contacted police last month . The person came forward after seeing publicity surrounding the FBI 's search of an unrelated basement in Manhattan 's SoHo neighborhood , a half block from Etan Patz ' home .

New York police have not responded to a request for comment about the latest development .

But in a press conference Thursday , New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said no family members or spiritual advisers ever contacted police . It 's not clear whether Kelly was referring to the New York Police Department or any police department .

Meanwhile , police have asked New York 's Sanitation Department for trash pickup and dumping records dating back to 1979 , said Vito Turso , a spokesman for the department .

`` We said we would search for those handwritten logs , '' he said . However , he said , businesses in the area could have hired private companies to haul away their trash , and `` we would have no records of their pickup schedules . ''

The Patz case was the first of several high-profile cases that catapulted concern about missing children to the forefront of national consciousness .

The relative of Hernandez is concerned about what Etan Patz 's parents must be going through .

`` At this moment , they must be hoping this is the right guy , and they do n't go through this again , '' the source said . `` It 's going to be like a nightmare for them , if it turns out it 's not Hernandez . ''

`` They must want to know the truth and get this over with , '' the relative added . `` At least they will know . ''
