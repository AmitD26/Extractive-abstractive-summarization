`` Apologies to Kamui and to my team . The team deserves better from me . Best wishes , Lewis . ''

Hamilton 's retirement from the Spa race left him fifth in the drivers ' standings , 113 points behind the Red Bull of championship leader Sebastian Vettel .

Vettel , who claimed the world title in 2010 , took the checkered flag in Belgium ahead of teammate Mark Webber , with Hamilton 's McLaren colleague Jenson Button recovering from 13th on the grid to take third position .

Button , a world champion in 2009 , was pleased with his performance and the condition of his car .

`` Our car is the best it 's been all year , and I feel better than I ever have in Formula 1 , '' the 31-year-old told McLaren 's official web site . `` We just need to stop the little mistakes from happening so that we can win even more races . ''
