-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of the man authorities say was dismembered by a Canadian porn actor called for the suspect 's quick extradition Tuesday and expressed hope that their `` devastating situation '' could become something positive .

Jun Lin , a 33-year-old student at Montreal 's Concordia University , was killed in late May in one of the city 's grisliest crimes in years . The suspect in his killing , Luka Rocco Magnotta , is being held in Germany while Canadian prosecutors seek his return .

`` Jun Lin was our beloved son . As the only son in the family , he was our pride and hope , '' his family said in a written statement issued Tuesday . His killing `` is not only a devastating attack to our family , but also has had a tremendous impact on the whole society . Love and trust must be rebuilt . ''

The family traveled from a village in China last week to reclaim their son 's remains -- parts of which had been mailed to the headquarters of Canada 's Conservative and Liberal parties and to two schools in Vancouver , on the Pacific coast . Other parts , including his head , are still missing .

The family thanked the people of Montreal , who stepped up to support their travel ; and Concordia , which has set up an award in their son 's name to assist Chinese students -- a move the family said `` perfectly reflects Jun Lin 's compassionate spirit . ''

`` We are very grateful and moved by the kindness and sympathy for us , '' they said . `` It is our wish to take this opportunity to turn a devastating situation into something positive that brings the goodness and peace back to society .

`` We are calling for the extradition of the murder suspect back to Canada as soon as possible in order to bring justice and peace to our family , the Chinese community and the whole society , '' they said . `` To commemorate Jun Lin , please let us remember his kindness , diligence and love for life . ''

Police say they believe Magnotta killed and dismembered Lin and posted a 10-minute video of the slaying online . Montreal police Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and included evidence of cannibalism .

Investigators have said the suspect and victim knew each other , though they have not defined the nature of their relationship .

The mailings and the discovery of other body parts behind Magnotta 's apartment triggered an international manhunt . German authorities nabbed him June 4 in Berlin , where they said he had been spotted browsing online articles about himself at an Internet cafe .
