Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Electoral College tie .

It 's the white whale of American elections : elusive , mythical and never realized .
But could it finally happen this year ?

The likelihood that President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will each net 269 electoral votes in November , instead of the 270 needed to win , is actually not so farfetched -- and for close observers of the Electoral College system , a tie would set off a wave of constitutional and political mayhem that would make the 2000 Florida recount seem like a tidy affair .

Election results in key states would immediately be subject to legal challenges . Electors , normally an anonymous batch of party insiders elected to ratify each state 's winner with their electoral votes , would be lobbied to change their votes by friends , neighbors and political leaders .

Ultimately , the House of Representatives could elect the next president , even if that candidate lost the popular vote .

`` What it would reveal is that we have , in some sense , a profoundly undemocratic mechanism for dealing with a tie , '' said Alex Keyssar , a professor of history and social policy at Harvard University , and a critic of the Electoral College . `` I think there would be an enormous outcry over that . ''

A quick reading of the electoral map shows that the prospect is startlingly real .

This year 's list of battleground states is now familiar to anyone following the race . The campaigns and their allies are spending money in states where the polls are tight : Ohio , Florida , Virginia , Nevada , Colorado , New Hampshire and Iowa .

By the numbers : Why Ohio matters

Democrats say North Carolina is in the mix . Republicans insist the same is true for Pennsylvania , Wisconsin and Michigan , where Romney has family roots .

Strategists inside both campaigns agree , for now , that the 2008 battlegrounds of Missouri and Indiana are all but certain to go red , while New Mexico is likely to stay blue .

So using those parameters , here 's one plausible scenario in which no candidate wins an Electoral College majority in November :

Romney tears up Obama 's 2008 map and wins New Hampshire , Iowa , Ohio , Florida , North Carolina and Nevada .

Obama , meanwhile , keeps Colorado , Virginia , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the Democratic column .

That combination of states adds up to 269 votes for each candidate -- and that 's just one of several realistic scenarios yielding the same outcome .

A handful of paths involve Wisconsin and Pennsylvania , two blue-leaning states that Democrats insist are off the table for Republicans -LRB- even though the Obama campaign has spent heavily in Pennsylvania on television ads attacking Romney -RRB- .

Also in the mix is Nebraska . The state awards its five electoral votes by congressional district , and the Omaha-anchored 2nd District sent a single vote to Obama in 2008 .

The Obama campaign has been organizing in the Omaha metro area for months , and the Republican National Committee is opening a field office there in the coming weeks .

Both campaigns know that just a single electoral vote could play a decisive role in what 's expected to be a historically close race , and that makes what happens in the event of an Electoral College tie all the more intriguing .

Both political parties begin coordinated ad efforts with the campaigns

The rules governing the process -- outlined 208 years ago in the 12th Amendment -- seem straightforward . The House tallies up the electoral votes in a special session of the next Congress in January , and if no candidate reaches a majority , then each state 's delegation in the House casts a vote for president .

The last time a `` contigent election , '' as it 's known , occurred was 1824 .

After the unresolved presidential election of 1824 , when none of the four candidates achieved an Electoral College majority , the House met the following January to decide the outcome .

After a good bit of politicking from all the candidates , the House awarded the presidency to John Quincy Adams , even though Andrew Jackson had won the most electoral votes .

This is the model that will be used if Obama and Romney find their fates in the hands of Congress in January .

According to a report on contingent elections by the Congressional Research Service , the procedures undertaken for that 1825 vote -- the House met in closed session without reporters , for instance , and voted anonymously by paper ballot -- would be `` precedential , but not binding '' for similar elections in the future .

But a modern-day version of that pageant play is guaranteed to be messier and far more dramatic , election scholars say .

If Romney and Obama both finish on November 6 with 269 electoral votes apiece , the true results will not be known until December 17 .

That 's when the electors -- Democratic and Republican loyalists nominated by state party officials and placed on the ballot alongside the presidential candidates -- meet in their respective state capitals and the District of Columbia to formally cast their electoral votes .

That has become a mostly irrelevant exercise in recent presidential elections . But in the event of a razor-thin finish , or a 269-vote tie , every elector will suddenly wield great power .

A handful of states have `` faithless elector '' laws on the books designed to punish electors who switch their votes , and some two dozen states require electors to pledge to vote for the state 's winner .

`` If there appears to be a tie , then faithless electors become a big problem , and we could have a real mess on our hands , '' said Robert W. Bennett , a constitutional law professor at Northwestern University who has written extensively about the Electoral College .

Many recent electors have mulled switching their votes and little can be done to stop them , said Robert Alexander , an Electoral College expert at Ohio Northern University .

What are the most important issues to you ?

In the course of writing a book on presidential electors , Alexander interviewed more than half of the electors who participated in the 2000 , 2004 and 2008 elections . Of the 2004 group , 10 % said they considered voting for someone other than to whom they were pledged . In 2008 , 11 % said the same .

Many told Alexander they were lobbied or pressured by someone to change their allegiance -- sometimes in person , sometimes by anonymous e-mails and phone calls -- in the period between Election Day and mid-December , when the Electoral College votes .

`` If it 's really close , you would expect to see massive lobbying campaigns , '' Alexander said . `` Most do follow the herd , but not all , and that becomes the question in a close election . What happens at the margins ? ''

Despite being party loyalists , he said , electors are regular people with their own biases and political inclinations . In rare cases , they make them known .

In 2000 , Washington D.C. elector Barbara Lett-Simmons abstained from casting her electoral vote as a protest against the District 's lack of voting representation in Congress . In 2004 , an anonymous Minnesota elector voted for John Edwards instead of John Kerry .

Throughout this past spring and summer , Ron Paul 's devoted supporters worked furiously to elect their own as electors at state party conventions .

`` They are trying to be the revolution to the Electoral College , '' Alexander said .

If the electors behave in December and affirm an Election Night split decision , the action would move on to the House of Representatives .

A joint session of the newly elected Congress would be convened to open and count electoral votes . A House leadership aide told CNN this would happen on Monday , January 7 .

If no candidate reaches a majority of 270 votes , a contingent election immediately ensues .

In the House , each state 's delegation casts a single vote for president .

This scenario all but guarantees a victory for Romney . Republicans hold a majority in 33 state delegations to 16 delegations for the Democrats .

Barring a miraculous Democratic wave up and down the ballot this November , the axis of power is unlikely to shift enough to hand Obama 's party control of a majority of state delegations .

And there 's another hiccup : The vice president is elected separately by the U.S. Senate , which may still be controlled by Democrats next year .

Each senator has a single vote , and the next vice president would be chosen by a simple majority vote .

A Romney-Biden administration ? No one 's betting on it . But it could happen .
