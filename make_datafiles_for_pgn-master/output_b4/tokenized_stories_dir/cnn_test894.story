Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A wheelchair-bound Israeli veteran died Wednesday , days after setting himself on fire in a protest over his economic situation , a spokeswoman for Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv said .

Akiva Mafa'i , who was badly injured two decades ago during his service in the Israel Defense Forces , had set himself alight Sunday .

The 45-year-old poured gasoline over his body and ignited it at a bus station in the town of Yehud . Passersby extinguished the flames with bottles of water and a fire extinguisher but he was left with 70 % burns .

The veteran had spent four months in a coma at the Beer Sheva Medical Center after he was injured at age 23 , according to local media reports . He was to be married a month after he was hurt but the marriage was canceled .

Mafa'i is the second person to die in a self-immolation in Israel in less than a week .

Moshe Silman , a bed-ridden member of a movement to lower the cost of living in Israel , set himself alight during a demonstration in Tel Aviv on July 14 . He died two weeks later .

According to local media reports , he left a note accusing the conservative Netanyahu government of `` taking from the poor and giving to the rich . '' Israeli media have reported other suicide attempts apparently motivated by economic hardship .

The social protest movement has been gaining ground since large demonstrations were held in cities last summer , led by members of Israel 's middle class , over soaring costs of living .

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the self-immolations as tragic . Such incidents are unusual in Israel .

A self-immolation in Tunisia in December 2010 by Mohamed Bouazizi , a young street vendor , was the spark that ignited the protests and revolutionary fervor of the Arab Spring .

The desperate measure is a more common form of protest in some Asian nations , in particular for Tibetans who want autonomy from China .

Some 44 Tibetans , many of them monks , have self-immolated since 2009 , according to the Central Tibetan Administration , which functions as the government of Tibetans outside the Chinese territory .

Opinion : Why the Dalai Lama can not condemn Tibetan self-immolations

Chinese official interference with Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and nunneries contributed to at least a dozen self-immolations in 2011 , according to the U.S. State Department 's International Religious Freedom report .

In Europe , where self-immolation is also a rare form of protest , a 55-year-old Greek businessman set himself alight last September , overwhelmed by despair and anger over the debt crisis engulfing himself and his country .

Apostolos Polyzonis , who survived after being rescued by police and spending days in intensive care , told CNN in April : `` At that moment , I saw my life as worthless . I really did n't care if I was going to live or die . ''
