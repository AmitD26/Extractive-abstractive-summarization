Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran is in an `` open war '' with Israel , President Shimon Peres said Monday , as he pointed the finger at Iran and Hezbollah for last week 's bombing in Bulgaria that killed five Israelis .

In an exclusive interview with CNN , Peres said Israel would act to prevent further attacks .

Peres said Israel had `` enough '' hard intelligence to link the Bulgaria attack to Iran and its proxy Hezbollah and believes more attacks are being planned as part of what he called an `` open war against Israel . ''

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Iran and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah movement were responsible for a number of attacks and attempted attacks against Israeli targets in Thailand , Georgia , India , Greece , Cyprus and other countries .

Asked whether the Bulgaria bombing and the other attempted attacks were revenge for the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists , which Iran blames on Israel , Peres said that Israel has never claimed responsibility for the killings . But he noted that Israel has a right to prevent killing of its citizens .

`` We do n't have an initiative of terror , '' Peres said . `` We do n't do it . But self-defense is the right and the must of every people . ''

He said Israel 's policy was one of `` prevention , '' rather than `` retaliation . ''

`` If you have enough information about a certain person which is a ticking clock that can explode a bomb that can endanger civilian life , clearly you have to prevent him from doing so , '' Peres said , citing reports that the United States has killed as many as 3,000 people in drone strikes aimed at terrorist enclaves .

With neighboring Syria in a spiral of violence , Peres said Israel will be forced to seize Syria 's chemical weapons if there is a risk President Bashar al-Assad would use them against Israel or that the arsenal could fall into terrorist hands .

Over the weekend , Defense Minister Ehud Barak said he ordered the military to prepare contingency plans to attack Syria 's chemical weapons arsenals , should the need arise .

`` The use of chemical weapons is internationally forbidden ... and what do you do when somebody violates the law ? You fight against it , '' Peres said . `` You stop them . We shall not remain indifferent and tell them , ` Do what you want . ' ''

When asked how far Israel would go to secure Syria 's chemical arsenal , Peres simply said : `` Until it will stop being a danger . ''

With Israel facing a potential influx of refugees , Peres said although no Syrians have tried to enter the country , Israel would not help any refugees who want to cross the border and would use force against any armed individuals .

`` If they will come by force , we shall stop them by force , '' Peres said . `` If they shall come in without force , we shall stop them the way any country defended her border with civilian means . ''

Peres spoke a day after Israel marked the 40th anniversary of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich , Germany , where 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were killed .

While he would n't go into details , Peres said Israel was taking precautions to ensure Israeli athletes would not be targeted at the London Olympic Games , which start later this week . He argued , however , that if Israeli intelligence services been at Munich , they would probably have been able to prevent the attack .
