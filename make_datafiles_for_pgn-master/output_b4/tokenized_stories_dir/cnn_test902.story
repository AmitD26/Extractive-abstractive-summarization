New Brunswick , New Jersey -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man with whom Tyler Clementi had a sexual encounter is soon expected to take the stand in the trial of a former Rutgers University student accused of spying on Clementi .

Wednesday marked the fourth day of Dharun Ravi 's trial . Prosecutors say he and another student placed a camera in Clementi 's dorm room without his knowledge to allegedly spy on his encounter with the man .

Prosecutors have withheld the man 's name , listing him only as `` M.B. , '' to protect his identity . He is expected to testify Thursday .

Just days after the webcam incident in 2010 , Clementi committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge , which connects New Jersey and Manhattan .

Ravi , 20 , now faces a 15-count indictment in Clementi 's death that includes hate crime charges , charges of invasion of privacy , bias intimidation , tampering with physical evidence , witness tampering and hindering apprehension or prosecution .

If convicted , he faces up to 10 years in prison .

Last year , he turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time .

The deal offered by Middlesex County prosecutors would have required the former student to undergo 600 hours of community service , counseling and to dispose of any information that could identify the man who appeared in the web video with Clementi .

Prosecutors also offered to help Ravi avoid deportation , though they said they could not guarantee it . Ravi is a citizen of India who had been studying on a visa at the New Jersey university .

On Tuesday , the second student charged in the case took the stand again , saying she felt `` sad '' and `` overwhelmed '' in the wake of the incident .

Molly Wei , 19 , reached a plea deal that requires her to testify against Ravi .

`` Police officers told me that they believe Tyler is missing and that he possibly committed suicide and I was feeling very -- I was sad , overwhelmed . I felt very bad if anything had happened , '' Wei told jurors during her second day of testimony .

Prosecutor : `` These acts were purposeful ''

Should Wei complete a three-year program on cyberbullying , as well as 300 hours of community service without any additional legal troubles , charges against her for allegedly watching the video will be dropped , according to prosecutors .

She also testified about when she learned of messages Ravi allegedly sent about the stream .

`` I was very surprised because my friends brought it up , and I had no idea how they knew , but they said that Dharun had told them . ... They told me about these Twitter , tweets , that they received on Tuesday about him trying to have a viewing party , '' said Wei .

Less than a month after Clementi 's suicide , President Barack Obama released a videotaped message condemning bullying .

In November , Clementi 's family consented to the use of his name on federal anti-harassment legislation called the `` Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act . ''

The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid `` to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student , '' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg , D-New Jersey .
