-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Florida prosecutors dropped charges against a husband and wife accused of training for a race war as part of a white supremacist group , their attorney said Monday .

Prosecutors have n't responded yet to CNN 's calls .

Ten other American Front members , including alleged leader Marcus Faella , are set for trial next month , while two co-defendants have entered guilty pleas .

Jennifer and Mark McGowan were charged with violating a Florida law against participating in paramilitary training by taking part in target practice and hand-to-hand combat training with others in the American Front .

`` They were a group of citizens having barbecues , and nothing illegal was occurring out there , '' attorney Sam Edwards said . `` The state made allegations they were firing guns and saying racial epithets against blacks while shooting into jugs , but there is no corroborative evidence . But even so , it is a protected First Amendment right . ''

According to police , Faella was planning to stage provocative disruptions at Orlando City Hall and at a Melbourne , Florida , anarchist gathering that included members of skinhead groups .

Faella , according to police documents , wanted to stir up media attention to help gain new recruits for American Front , which hate-tracking groups say has been faltering since the death of its leader , David Lynch , in California .

The 25-year-old group enjoyed a resurgence in 2007 under Lynch , described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a charismatic leader who helped form it in 1987 . But Lynch was shot to death in his home in March 2011 , leaving the group with no clear leader , according to the Anti-Defamation League .

Most of the group 's 50 or so members appear to live in Florida , according to the ADL .

`` Faella views himself and the other members of the AF as the protectors of the white race , '' investigators wrote in an affidavit , referring to the group by its initials . `` Faella has stated his intent during the race war is to kill Jews , immigrants and other minorities . ''

According to police , Faella 's group watched videos training members in fighting and the use of AK-47s and other weapons at a St. Cloud , Florida , compound , which the affidavit said is ringed with barbed wire and protected by pit bulls and firing positions facing the driveway .

The property was meant to become a refuge for white supremacists after the fall of the U.S. government during a race war , investigators wrote . The group was allegedly making body armor and sniper suits and stocking up on supplies in preparation .

The charges came on the heels of a two-year investigation based on the reports of a confidential informant who had to flee the fortified compound after Faella nearly discovered secret recordings the informant had made of training exercises , according to the arrest affidavit .

Defendant Kent McLellan , 22 , pleaded guilty on October 16 to paramilitary training and was sentenced to four years ' probation , prosecutors said .

Christopher Brooks , 27 , pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and will serve three years in prison . In exchange for his plea in August , prosecutors dropped two other felony counts -- participating in paramilitary training and conspiracy to shoot into an occupied dwelling -- according to Bernie Presha , a spokesman for the state attorney 's office for Osceola and Orange counties .
