-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama is immensely popular overseas and his re-election will be welcomed by many . But how will his second-term agenda differ from the first ? And what will it mean for a global economy where growth in emerging markets is hesitant , and a massive sovereign debt crisis continues to brew in Europe ?

One thing is certain . In the immediate aftermath of a grueling and divisive campaign , and confronted with a national emergency -- the fall off the `` fiscal cliff '' -- Obama 's immediate priorities will be domestic , not international .

Drawing on the authority conveyed by electoral victory , he will seek to establish a constructive dialogue with Republicans who continue to control the House of Representatives and who can filibuster his agenda in the Senate , just as before .

Above all , he will seek to avoid large tax increases and expenditure cuts worth about 4 % of GDP that will be triggered automatically on January 1 next year , should he fail to reach agreement on a long - term plan of fiscal consolidation worth some $ 3.5 trillion to $ 4 trillion over 10 years .

If the U.S. falls off this fiscal cliff into recession , the outlook for the world economy , already gloomy , will darken further .

The task of keeping the eurozone afloat , amid scared investors and depression-level unemployment in Spain and Greece , will become even harder .

The risk of a renewed global banking crisis triggered by sovereign defaults in Europe would escalate sharply . Nor could the U.S. or Europe deploy the policy arsenal they possessed in 2008 to right the ship -- their fiscal and monetary bullets have been spent .

Confronted with this dire alternative , Obama will have to compromise by accepting a program of long-term cuts in social programs while Republicans accept phased tax increases -- both departing from their diametrically opposed electoral platforms .

As a minimum , this compromise will include a claw back of the payroll tax reduction , and of extended unemployment benefits as well as some expenditure cuts , adding up to 1 % to 2 % of U.S. GDP in 2013 .

The likely effect will be that the recovery will remain sluggish , and the world 's growth locomotives will again have to be found , if anywhere , in China and other emerging markets .

Quest : Which way will economy go ?

The uncertainty surrounding the U.S. fiscal outlook is likely to persist for several months and if , as is possible , the only feasible compromise turns out to be temporary , new fiscal cliffs may loom in the future , extending the uncertainty over years to come .

This outcome is possible because the election outcome has not fundamentally altered the balance of forces .

An obvious implication is that the U.S. will remain fiscally bound as far as the eye can see . Europeans will have to rely on their own resource to deal with their dangerous crisis , with the U.S. urging action and support through IMF involvement , but without providing money for rescue programs either directly or indirectly through the IMF .

Resources for international aid will remain scarce and may be cut along with other programs . With the Europeans and the Japanese also retrenching , international organizations will increasingly look to China and other emerging markets for additional funds and new initiatives , buttressing the influence of the rising powers in their deliberations .

Perhaps fortified by weather events such as Hurricane Sandy , Obama 's second term may bring renewed efforts to encourage control of carbon emissions through environmental regulation , which could yield some modest results .

However , given the profound skepticism about climate change in many quarters , the array of special interests in favor of fossil fuels , and the simple fact that the median American family has seen its living standards decline over many years , the appetite for increased gasoline or other carbon taxes will be low .

The new administration can be expected to pursue the development of shale natural gas -LRB- a clean alternative to coal -RRB- and reduced reliance on imported energy with alacrity . The positive effect on reduced gas prices in Europe and other regions of these new American technologies is already being felt .

Increased use of natural gas in lieu of other fuels , and the continued `` dematerialization '' of the American economy , will in any event help mitigate the nation 's emissions for a long time to come .

One arena where the new term may bring more daring initiatives is trade . This is ground where the administration and the Republicans in Congress may be able to join forces , perhaps as part of a broader bargain that would include tax reforms in support of business , and assistance for workers displaced by trade -- both of which Obama has also advocated .

Trade measures will likely include implementation of recently ratified trade agreements , determined pursuit of the Trans-Pacific Partnership , and may include a renewed effort to close on a low-ambition and partial Doha deal .

Markets may breathe an immediate sigh of relief that the election did not end in a dead heat or require extensive recounts , or pitted Obama against a Republican senate . Stocks in healthcare and in alternative energy may be boosted more durably by his re-election . But until the deadlock over how , and how quickly , to effect fiscal consolidation is broken for good , and U.S. politics finds a way to address the nation 's structural challenges -- including exploding healthcare costs and its chronically low savings rate -- there is little reason to expect a trend shift in equity prices .

For the time being , the U.S. government continues to borrow at the most advantageous rates , in part for lack of better alternatives .

Everyone knows this can not last -- how long it will is anyone 's guess .
