San Juan , Puerto Rico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A fire at a fuel storage facility that burned for three days and forced hundreds of Puerto Rico residents from their homes has been extinguished , fire officials said Sunday evening .

But some of the tanks continued to smolder and crews stood ready to fight another outbreak .

Hundreds of firefighters battled the blaze , which began with an explosion at the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. facility in Puerto Rico 's Bayamon municipality , near San Juan , early Friday . The initial explosion shook the ground with the force of a 2.8-magnitude earthquake , authorities said , and flames shot into the air while plumes of thick , black smoke hovered over the region .

As the fire died , reporters and officials were able to witness firsthand the extent of the damage . Seventeen tanks were destroyed by flames and the initial explosion .

Agents from the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives were investigating to determine whether the explosion was an act of sabotage .

The FBI is investigating graffiti found on two San Juan tunnels that referred to a fire , Special Agent Harry Rodriguez said Friday . A spray-painted message on the tunnels , less than three miles apart , said : `` Boom , fire , RIP , Gulf , Soul , ACNF . '' Caribbean Petroleum owns the Gulf Oil brand , but Rodriguez said he did not know what ACNF referred to .

Agents were at the storage facility and treating it as a crime scene , which is a routine designation .

Puerto Rico 's governor , Luis Fortuno , said the main priority of his government is to counter any long-term effects of air and water pollution caused by the fire . Representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency had been checking air quality near the fuel depot .

`` We 're not finding levels that would be of concern , '' EPA spokeswoman Bonnie Bellow said .

She said the fire had been so intense that it was `` burning off chemicals that are part of the fuel . ''

About 600 displaced people were in shelters on Sunday night , but many were being sent home . Dr. Lorenzo Gonzalez , Puerto Rico 's health secretary , said everyone at shelters and all the emergency personnel were vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus as a precaution , given their close proximity to each other .

He said tests have been conducted on the air and water , and the results showed no reason for concern .

President Obama declared an emergency in Puerto Rico , which frees up federal aid . Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States .

Fortuno said the blaze has cost the island at least $ 6.4 million .

The governor sought to allay fears over gasoline supplies . Caribbean Petroleum owns 200 gas stations on the island and several inland distribution facilities , and supplies much of the island 's fuel .

Puerto Rico will receive 3.6 million gallons of regular gasoline , more than 1 million gallons of premium gasoline and more than 1 million gallons of diesel fuel to help make up for what may have been lost , Fortuno said .

The company has had violations of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act , the main law in the United States that deals with the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes , according to EPA spokeswoman Bellow . Caribbean Petroleum is under a corrective-action plan , she said .

CNN 's Rafael Romo in San Juan and Arthur Brice in Atlanta , Georgia , contributed to this report .
