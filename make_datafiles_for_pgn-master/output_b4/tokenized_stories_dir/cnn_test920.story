-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On Wednesday , all over the Web , `` Slurpee '' was the big trend . The date was July 11 . Seven . Eleven .

Or , put another way : 7-Eleven . Home of the Slurpee .

Just add some bad character development , and you 've got the basic premise of a Nick Cage movie .

Of course , it 's no coincidence that this particular word was trending on this particular day . July 11 was the official 85th birthday of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain , and to celebrate they were giving out free 7.11-ounce Slurpees . This apparently caused the Twitterverse to have a collective aneurysm .

The general consensus : `` Drink all the Slurpees !!! ''

In fact , 7-Eleven was prepared to give away up to 10 million of these things across the United States and Canada .

So , I attempted a little math , which ultimately ended in tears and a mild rash , and determined that 10 million Slurpees equals 71.1 million ounces . Then I did some additional math , which resulted in more tears and a uniquely different rash , and found that 71.1 million ounces equals 555,468.75 gallons .

Then I got a completely unrelated rash and finally embraced the reality that I may need to see somebody .

The point is , you could almost fill an Olympic-size swimming pool with all the Slurpees they were planning to give away . Granted , Michael Phelps would then promptly drink the pool to reach his daily caloric intake . But you could .

And it would be cold . According to 7-Eleven , their famous `` semi-frozen carbonated beverage '' should be served at a `` frosty '' 28 degrees . Which makes this next fun fact rather amazing : The No. 1 market in the world for Slurpees is Winnipeg , Manitoba .

You know , where the average low temperature in January is minus 10 degrees . It makes absolutely no sense . Perhaps they just like saying , `` Hey , let 's get a Slurp-eh ? ''

Or maybe Neil Young goes back after each tour and lathers himself in 60,000 ounces of Mountain Berry Blast . Which would be both fascinating and disgusting .

Whatever the reason , this was unbelievable information I just could n't process . My phone conversation with the nice 7-Eleven PR lady went something like this :

Me : `` Winnipeg ? Seriously ? Winnipeg ? ''

Her : `` Yep . ''

Me : `` Hmm . Winnipeg . So I 've got this rash ... ''

She also told me that , surprisingly , in the United States , the No. 1 market is Detroit . But the No. 1 store for Slurpees is in Kennewick , Washington . I 'm not sure what else to do with this information .

I guess ... visit Kennewick . Have a Slurpee . Or do n't .

Of course , when it comes to straight-up soda , 7-Eleven also has the Big Gulp . These are great for when you absolutely , positively want to pee for 17 uninterrupted minutes .

And if you 're really thirsty there 's the Double Gulp . This is enough to completely drown a small community . So , watch yourself , Kennewick .

Without question , it 's a lot of soda . Seemingly more than any one person needs . But the science does n't lie ; 50 ounces of caffeine is pretty much requisite for all mid-to long-range road trips . That , and beef jerky . It 's actually sort of amazing what personal health rules we 'll bend in the process of getting from Point A to Point B when it requires slightly more effort than your standard commute .

`` Honey , looks like we 're still 20 miles from Asheville . So you fill up the tank -- I 'll grab 36 Nutter Butters . ''

And that 's why we have convenience stores . Because they 're awesome .

However , what 's not awesome is the fact that we do n't have 7-Eleven in Georgia . And now I really want a Slurpee .

So , I guess I 'm off to Kennewick . You know ... before the flood .
