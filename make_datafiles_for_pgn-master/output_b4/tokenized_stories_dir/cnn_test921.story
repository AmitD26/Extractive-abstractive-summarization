-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nickey Van Exel , the 20-year-old son of former NBA player and current Atlanta Hawks coaching staff member Nick Van Exel , has been charged with capital murder in the shooting of a close friend , his attorney said .

Van Exel was released on $ 25,000 bond , said Executive Chief Deputy Jesse Flores of the Dallas County Sheriff 's Department .

Van Exel is charged in the shooting of Bradley Bassey Eyo , 23 , in the Dallas suburb of Garland . Eyo 's body was dumped near Lake Ray Hubbard , authorities said , and had an apparent gunshot wound to the upper body .

Police found the remains on Sunday and arrested Van Exel on Wednesday , authorities said .

In an interview with CNN affiliate WFAA , Eyo 's father said police told him that Van Exel said the shooting was an accident .

`` They were playing with a shotgun , and when it went off on Bradley , he did n't know what to do , took his body and dumped it on the street , '' the father told WFAA .

Authorities told reporters that they reviewed the case closely before making it a capital offense .

`` If a person is making the assertion this was an accident -- you place the body in a vehicle and moved it to a second location -- that in itself , coupled with the fact that property is missing , makes this a capital murder , '' said Deputy Chief Craig Miller .

A cell phone and shoes were the missing property , said Dallas police spokesman Kevin Janse .

Paul Johnson , Van Exel 's attorney , told CNN the shooting was the result of `` horseplay . ''

`` The young men were involved in a bunch of horseplay . They did n't believe it was loaded and , unfortunately , it was , '' Johnson said . `` Unfortunately , there was a tragic result to the horseplay . ''

The two men had been friends for years and were neighbors who lived across the street from each other , Johnson said . Van Exel does not live with his father , Johnson said .

`` Everybody considered them to be like brothers , '' the attorney said of the two young men .

When asked why Van Exel allegedly moved the body , Johnson said Van Exel went `` into a state of shock and panic . ''

`` When it occurred , there was no question his friend was deceased , '' Johnson said .

Van Exel tried to call his family , but he `` could n't get a hold of anybody , '' Johnson said . `` You are talking about a 20-year-old boy . ''

Van Exel and Johnson went to police and cooperated , Johnson said . Van Exel consented to have his home and vehicle searched , Johnson said .

Johnson described the families of the two young men as close . `` There has been communication between the families since the incident , '' Johnson said .

The elder Van Exel became player development instructor for the Atlanta Hawks in September after serving as an assistant coach at Texas Southern University , according to the Hawks ' website . Van Exel , 39 , played 13 seasons in the NBA with the Los Angeles Lakers , Denver Nuggets , Dallas Mavericks , Golden State Warriors , Portland Trailblazers and San Antonio Spurs , the website said .
