JAKARTA , Indonesia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Indonesia , the world 's most populous Muslim nation , has temporarily banned YouTube to block access to a video that many Muslims consider anti-Islamic .

Protesters demonstrate against an anti-Islamic film in front of the Dutch embassy in Jakarta .

Indonesia 's Communications and Information Minister sent a letter to all Internet providers ordering them to block the video-sharing Web site until further notice , a ministry spokesman said Tuesday .

The minister has asked YouTube to remove the 15-minute movie `` Fitna , '' but has not received a reply from the company , the spokesman said .

`` Fitna , '' which is the work of Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders , features disturbing images of terrorist acts juxtaposed over verses from the Quran to paint Islam as a threat to Western society .

It has been posted on several Web sites , including Google Video and YouTube .

Last week , about 50 Indonesia students broke into a Dutch consulate compound to protest the movie . They tore off the gate of the embassy in the city of Medan and ripped down a flag , said a Dutch Embassy spokeswoman .

Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkanende has said his government is worried that Geert Wilders ' film could provoke a violent backlash .

The film has also prompted protests in other parts of the Muslim world .

Soon after its release last month , hundreds of angry Muslims rallied in Pakistan , where the government temporarily blocked access to YouTube because of a trailer for Wilders ' film . The protesters burned the Dutch flag and called on Pakistan to cut ties with the Netherlands .

The Dutch government and others , including the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference , have rejected the film .

The OIC has 57 member states across four continents and claims on its Web site to be the second largest inter-governmental organization , after the United Nations . In its statement , it urged the international community to condemn the showing of the film and asked the Dutch government to prosecute the author of the documentary under Dutch law .

But Wilders has stood by his project .

`` My intention was not to offend in any way , but to show the truth -- at least the truth as I see it , '' Wilders told CNN . `` And if the truth hurts and could be offensive , well , this of course is not my problem . '' Watch interview with Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilder . ''

Wilders is a member of the Dutch parliament from the conservative Party for Freedom and an outspoken critic of Islam . He said he has `` big problems '' with Islam 's Prophet Mohammed , the Quran and `` everything that is stated inside this terrible book . ''

The title , `` Fitna , '' translates in Arabic to `` strife '' or `` conflict '' of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group .

The film opens with passages from the Quran , interspersed with graphic images of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks against the United States .

The video also includes disturbing images of other terror attacks -- bloodied victims ; beheadings of hostages ; executions of women in hijab , the traditional Muslim attire ; and footage , with subtitles , of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians .
