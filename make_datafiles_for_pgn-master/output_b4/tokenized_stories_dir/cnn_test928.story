United Nations -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.N. Security Council discussed Friday a resolution introduced by Morocco that calls on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down and transfer power to his vice president .

The resolution also supports `` full implementation '' of the Arab League report on Syria that called on Syria to form a unity government within two months but stopped short of supporting military intervention . The Arab League report was released about a month after it sent observers into Syria .

Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby and Qatar 's Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani , are expected to brief the council Tuesday about the observer mission 's findings . When asked whether that briefing would lead to a vote next week , France 's U.N. Envoy Gerard Araud responded with just one word : `` Inshallah , '' or `` God willing '' in Arabic .

British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said a vote could be held as soon as Wednesday on the text . `` It was quite clear that there was very strong support in the Security Council this afternoon for the text that was introduced by Morocco . ''

The next step is a meeting of experts from the missions of the 15 countries on the Security Council , on Monday afternoon .

The Security Council has been unable to agree on any resolution on Syria . In October , Russia and China issued a rare double-veto of a resolution that lacked sanctions but would have condemned the violence in Syria . This latest draft also lacks sanctions , but is tougher than the October version , which said nothing about transfer of power .

The draft resolution , obtained by CNN , calls on al-Assad to hand over authority to his deputy and calls for the formation of a national unity government .

The draft gives Syria 15 days to comply or risk the adoption of further measures .

Advocates of a resolution -- especially Britain , France , and Germany -- hope that a stark briefing from the Arab League will be enough to persuade Russia not to use its veto power .

After Friday 's meeting , Russian U.N. Envoy Vitaly Churkin said , `` I just can not see the draft which we saw today as a basis of a possible outcome . But we will continue to engage with the sponsors of this resolution . ''

He said there were some red lines that he would not allow the Security Council to cross .

`` The red lines include any indication of sanctions , '' he said . `` The red lines included any sort of imposition of arms embargo , because we know how in real life , arms embargo means that you supply weapons to illegal groups but you can not supply weapons to the government . We can not accept that . Unfortunately the draft which we saw today did not ignore our red lines but also added some new elements which we find unacceptable as a matter of principle . ''

He went on to say that those added things included the idea of imposing a political outcome .

This week , the Russian ambassador to the United States accused the United States and Europe of trying to turn a Security Council resolution on Syria into an `` anti-al-Assad '' resolution , a step that , he argued , could `` be a recipe for disaster . ''

Araud was sanguine : `` Frankly , I do n't think it will be too difficult to reach an agreement , '' he told reporters .

And German Ambassador Peter Wittig said world body must take action . `` Let 's seize this window of opportunity that we have . ''

But Syrian Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari was dismissive of his colleagues . `` Some of these ambassadors who have been entrusted by the so-called international community to maintain peace and security in the world through their important role in the Security Council have chosen to undermine peace and security in the world -- following their narrow strategic and geopolitical interests , '' he said .

`` They deal with us as if we are a former colony -- that we should subjugate ourselves to their will . They are wrong and they will be disappointed . ''

He continued , `` Syria will not be Libya ; Syria will not be Iraq ; Syria will not be Somalia ; Syria will not be a failing state . ''
