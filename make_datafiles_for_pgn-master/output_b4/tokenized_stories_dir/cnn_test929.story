-LRB- CNNGo -RRB- -- What ? A best-markets-of-the-world lineup without Marrakesh , Istanbul 's Grand Bazaar and Cairo 's Khan el-Khalili in the mix ? But you already know about those , and anyway we just mentioned them .

If you 're still searching for that elusive knockoff , that priceless $ 20 trinket , that vintage earthenware goblet -- above all , that authentic bazaar experience -- you can bet your top and bottom dollar you 'll score big at one of the following , one-of-a-kind markets around the world .

1 . FLEA

Rose Bowl Flea Market : Los Angeles

Every second Sunday of the month , 2,500 vendors and 20,000 hagglers gather outside Pasadena 's storied Rose Bowl to barter over Eames chairs , Richard Pryor memorabilia , antique dental tools , art deco glassware and that autographed Aerosmith bootleg you 've been hunting for .

Never mind Hollywood or Venice Beach , here 's the definitive L.A. Experience . A tradition since 1969 .

Best buys : Locals flock here for anti-IKEA home furnishing deals they can stuff into a friend 's borrowed pickup . Travelers come for vintage clothing and accessories , cheap 502 Levi 's owned by former B-list celebrities and the best people-watching in Southern California .

Know B4 u go : Regular admission , starting at 9 a.m. , costs $ 8 , but you can pay more to get in earlier , starting from 5 a.m.

Rose Bowl Flea Market : 1001 Rose Bowl Drive , Pasadena , +1 323 560 7469 ; www.rgcshows.com

2 . FLOATING

Tha Kha Floating Market : Ratchaburi , Thailand

Every beige-pants-wearing Southeast Asian traveler and their posse of touts flock to the far better known Damnoen Saduak Floating Market .

A more authentic option : hiding out with your Canon at this far less touristed aqua-bazaar just ten kilometers away -- where the same colorful chaos of flat boats captained by tough-as-nails Thai women awaits , with rather fewer Rough Guide-reading riffraff .

Best buys : Go ahead and score that ripe mangosteen or choice bunch of Malacca grapes . The prime takeaway experience is a hired boat ride along the canals -- and an overnight in one of several homestays in the area .

Know B4 u go : Consult the heavens before you arrive . The market is only open six days a month -LRB- 6 a.m.-noon -RRB- in accordance with the Thai lunar calendar .

10 kilometers from Damnoen Saduak market , your best bet is to hire a taxi . Open 6 a.m.-noon weekends only .

3 . FISH

Tsukiji Central Fish Market : Tokyo

`` Lost in Translation '' is an I-Can-Read book compared to the incomprehensible scene inside Japan 's biggest seafood market -- a 1,200-stall , hangar-style building on Tokyo Bay packed to the gills with frenzied fishmongers and wholesalers bartering over 2,000-plus tons of marine meat every day .

Can a single ocean actually support this place ?

Best buys : If you 're a local buyer , choose from more than 450 kinds of seafood . Visitors can feast their eyes on these proceedings -LRB- after 9 a.m. when tourists are permitted inside the `` inner '' market -RRB- and then sample the goods in the `` outer '' market 's lineup of top sushi bars .

Know B4 u go : The early-morning tuna auction is legendary , and currently restricted to 140 first-come-first-served spectators per day -- who line up at the market 's main info center by 5 a.m.

Above Tsukiji Shijo Station on the Oedo Subway Line , or a five-minute walk from Tsukiji Station on the Hibiya Subway Line . The closest rail station is Shimbashi , about 15 minutes ' walk from the market . www.tsukiji-market.or.jp

4 . FRENZIED

Chandni Chowk : Delhi

It 's saying something when a shopping district is routinely called `` incomparable '' even by Indian standards .

The swarm of spice sellers , masala merchants , paneer pushers , Vishnu figurine hawkers and every other imaginable purveyor and shopkeeper buried in the rickshaw and oxcart traffic of Old Delhi 's timeless commercial artery , Chandni Chowk , erases all doubt that roads like New York 's Canal Streetor L.A. 's Santee Alley are relatively young and tame .

Best buys : Pick your specialized alley for clothes , fabrics , jewelry , leather goods or electronics and let the haggling begin . The real headliner here is Delhi street food -- beginning -LRB- and ending -RRB- with a deep-fried jalebi at the institutional Old and Famous Jalebi Wala on Dariba Kalan Road .

Know B4 u go : Duck into the adjacent Red Fort -LRB- a palatial-style stronghold and UNESCO World Heritage Site -RRB- or the Jama Masjid -LRB- India 's largest mosque -RRB- to decompress and view two of the subcontinent 's most outstanding architectural achievements .

Any rickshaw wallah in the city will take you to Chandni Chowk in north New Delhi for less than $ 5 .

5 . FLOWER

Aalsmeer Flower Auction : Aalsmeer , The Netherlands

The most only-in-Holland-experience that does n't involve a `` coffeeshop '' takes place 16 miles southwest of Amsterdam in the small lakeside town of Aalsmeer -- home of the world 's largest flower auction .

About 20 million flowers and more than 13,000 varieties are bartered off in a visitor-friendly warehouse that 's reckoned -- at 990,000 square meters -- to be the third largest in the world .

Best buys : If you 're shopping for a cheap spring bouquet , stick with Amsterdam 's Bloemenmarkt . Aalsmeer 's more of a spectator sport where visitors can watch pros bid on football field-size quantities of tulips , gardenias , roses , lilies and gerber daisies before ending up in the site 's souvenir shop for floriculture tchotchkes .

Know B4 u go : Get here early . Technically the auction runs until 11 a.m. , but the flower bidding wars hit their stride at around 7 a.m.

Take bus 172 from outside Centraal Station , near the Victoria Hotel , which stops right outside the auction warehouse . www.floraholland.com/en/AboutFloraHolland

6 . FESTIVE

San Pedro Telmo Antiques Fair : Buenos Aires

Officially , this Sunday proceeding -- about 270 stalls and 10,000 pedestrians -- held in the main plaza of historic San Telmo is billed as an antiques fair . Fair enough .

But it 's a Buenos Aires-styled antiques fair -- replete with carnivalesque street performers , musicians and impromptu tango performances .

Best buys : Old gaucho bolos and bridles , classic tango art and recordings and other Argentine gems you wo n't find elsewhere are for sale in Plaza Dorrego and along the Crafts Walk on Calle Defensa .

Know B4 u go : After the vendors start packing up at around 4 p.m. , stick around for the outdoor Milonga , the city 's best free , Sunday evening open-air tango dance party .

Dorrego Square , Defensa and Humberto , 1 Buenos Aires ; every Sunday from 10 a.m.-5 p.m.

7 . FREAKISH

Sonora Witchcraft Market : Mexico City

These three had been dying to come to this market for years . You can only browse through so many buckets of chilies , cactus paddles and piñata stalls at Mercado de la Merced , Mexico City 's top farmers ' market , before it 's time for a jolt of the occult at the neighboring Mercado de Sonora -- a maze of ritualistic , remedy-filled booths that 's collectively been called `` the Walmart of the witch world . ''

Best buys : It all depends on what you 're trying to attract or repel by spiritual means . The range of healing herbs , love potions , Santería charms , voodoo dolls , tarot-reading luminaries , unorthodox dandruff cures and dried critters is staggering .

Know B4 u go : Mercado Sonora is held in sacred regard by a loyal local following . While browsing for snake blood , be respectful with your comments and camera .

Avenida Fray Servando Teresa , Venustiano Carranza , Mexico City .
