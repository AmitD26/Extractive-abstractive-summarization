-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The fairy tale of a cancer survivor from Austin , Texas , who beat the odds to win the Tour de France a record seven times , has morphed into a parable about telling a lie .

Lance Armstrong has been revealing in his two-part exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey Thursday and Friday night , but critics say he is leaving out important details .

There has been a lot to learn from Armstrong and from those watching him as he starts to tell the truth .

Getting caught is just the beginning .

This is the reason for his confession . After retiring from the Tour in 2005 , he made a comeback in 2009 .

`` We would n't be sitting here if I did n't come back , '' Armstrong told Winfrey .

Cycling colleague Floyd Landis went public in 2010 with his own doping and leveled allegations at Armstrong as well . This eventually led to investigations against Armstrong .

Alternative steps for redemption

The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency , which tests Olympic athletes for performance enhancing drugs , praised his televised interview as a `` small step in the right direction . ''

But it still would like a full confession of all of his doping activities , under oath at the USADA . The agency had started an investigation against Armstrong , who sued to try to stop it .

He told Winfrey he wishes he 'd cooperated freely back then , but now that he has a second invitation to do so , he is approaching it with a caveat .

Armstrong said he would participate if the agency forms a broad `` truth and reconciliation commission , '' involving doping across the sport of cycling .

Blaming yourself is not the same as telling it all .

`` I deserve this , '' were his comments on his fall from grace to public disgrace . In the interview he disparaged his own character for hours , calling himself `` deeply flawed , '' `` ruthless '' and `` arrogant . ''

`` I was a bully , '' he told Winfrey of how he treated others who might expose his doping and lies .

` I want to compete again '

Armstrong admitted to personal guilt but was careful not to implicate others .

Things escalated to the level they did `` because of my actions and because of my words , and because of my attitude and my defiance , '' he said .

But he also blamed the culture of cycling during the time he doped , saying the practice was widespread and just as much `` part of the job '' as water bottles and tire pumps .

There were also allegations he still denies , like coercing teammates to dope as well .

People will believe a lie .

Armstrong cheated for years , and no one in the sport of cycling stopped him . He lied under oath about his use of performance enhancing drugs . `` Hundreds of millions , '' as Armstrong has put it , believed him , adored him , and many wore yellow bracelets , because he inspired them .

The fairy tale image was `` one big lie that I repeated a lot of times , '' Armstrong said . It became impossible to live up to and it fell apart .

He publicly derided those trying to expose him , ruining some of their lives . `` We sued so many people , '' Armstrong told Winfrey -- people who were telling the truth and lost to him in court in spite of it .

It was about controlling the narrative of his heroic story . `` If I did n't like what somebody said ... I tried to control that and said that 's a lie ; they 're liars , '' Armstrong said .

`` Now the story is so bad and so toxic , and a lot of it is true , '' he said .

Be nice to people on your way up .

You may meet them on your way down . Lance has . And now the tables have turned .

Why we cheat

`` This was a guy who used to be my friend , who decimated me , '' said Betsy Andreu , the wife of one of Armstrong 's former teammates , who went public with doping allegations against Armstrong .

Andreu , author Daniel Coyle , journalist David Walsh , whom Armstrong attacked for writing about his doping for over a decade , former teammates and others he has discredited and sued have now gained plausibility .

They are already critiquing his confession and casting doubt on its completeness . Andreu and Coyle have called Armstrong out over his denial of allegations that he coerced teammates to use performance enhancing drugs .

It 's hard to regain trust .

Armstrong 's lies and bullying rattled his fans , former friends and teammates , even his own children .

`` I will spend the rest of my life ... trying to earn back trust and apologize to people , '' Armstrong told Winfrey .

Sunday Times journalist Walsh believes the cyclist 's bullying was worse than his lies and left behind deeper scars .

Cancer survivors ' mixed feelings

`` He never showed any compassion during his years or any sense that it troubled him to destroy other people , '' Walsh said .

Armstrong said he had been ruthless because he `` expected to get whatever he wanted and to control every outcome . ''

`` There will be people who hear this and never forgive me , '' he said . `` I understand that . ''

The emotional damage to his children seemed to touch him the most .

Appearing to hold back tears , Armstrong said he confessed to the three oldest children over the recent holiday break . `` The older kids need to not be living with this issue in their lives , '' the athlete said . `` It is n't fair . ''

Speaking specifically about his 13-year-old son , whom he had heard defending him , Armstrong said he told the youth : `` Do n't defend me anymore . ''

Hindsight is 20/20 .

The former Tour de France icon said he did not think there was anything wrong with what he was doing at the time he did it -- something he today finds `` scary . '' That he did n't feel guilty was in retrospect `` even scarier . ''

That he did not think it was cheating is the `` scariest '' part . `` I viewed it as a level playing field , '' he said , where most everybody doped .

Livestrong likely to survive

Armstrong also does not believe he could have won cycling 's most prestigious race seven times in a row without performance enhancing drugs . And his success was not synonymous with contentment .

`` That was n't the happiest time of my life , '' Armstrong said of his championship years . He told Winfrey he felt happier giving her his confession .

But his doping and bullying years also were n't the worst in his life , he said . The time of his cancer diagnosis was worse .

The bigger they are , the harder they fall .

Armstrong would like to compete again but has no interest in returning to the Tour de France . He 'd like to be able to run in the Chicago Marathon when he 's 50 , but the punishment he 's been slapped with wo n't allow it .

`` I ca n't run the Austin 10K , '' he said . `` Anything that is sanctioned '' by an official governing body is ruled out .

`` This may not be the most popular answer , but I think I deserve it -LRB- being allowed to compete -RRB- , maybe not right now , '' Armstrong said . A six-month suspension is customary for doping he said , but he received a `` death penalty . ''

Now that he has been caught and has confessed , lawsuits he won could be reviewed , and his victims could come after him , tearing away at his fortune .

But the nadir , Armstrong says , was his departure from his cancer awareness charity Livestrong , which distributed the iconic plastic yellow bracelets .

It happened in two phone calls .

They first asked him to resign as chairman of the board .

The second call was less to the point . `` We need you to consider stepping down for yourself , '' Armstrong said he was told .

He got out of the way and hopes the charity , which was built on his debunked fairy tale legacy , can carry on without him .

`` It hurt like hell , '' Armstrong said . `` That was the lowest . ''

Armstrong 's golden halo in the sport 's annals has decayed to a black mark . No other cyclist was awarded the victories he was disqualified from .

In place of a record seven wins by Lance Armstrong , the chronicles of the Tour de France bear seven record vacancies .

No one won .

Cycling , facing an uphill climb , hopes next hero just around bend
