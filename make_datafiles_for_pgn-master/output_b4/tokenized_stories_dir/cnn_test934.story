Brooks was Cachay 's boyfriend , according to CNN affiliate WABC .

Cachay 's body sustained bruising on the neck and bite marks , and was found clothed in the hotel room bathtub , the spokesman said .

The city medical examiner said Friday the initial autopsy was inconclusive . The office will provide more details surrounding Cachay 's death `` pending toxicology and tissue testing , which would take a few weeks , '' said spokeswoman Grace Burgess .

`` Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke , '' said publicist Kate Godici . `` She will be deeply and painfully missed , yet celebrated , honored and never forgotten . ''

The elder Brooks was indicted on multiple counts of sexual assault earlier this year , according to New York Supreme court documents .
