-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Quentin Tarantino has made a spaghetti western and cross-pollinated it with a blaxploitation picture , but it 's fully formed , unapologetic and easily one of the best popcorn flicks of the year . I 'll go further : It 's my favorite American movie of the past 12 months .

Before we get to the why , a quick outline of what 's in store : `` Inglourious Basterds '' standout Christoph Waltz plays a bounty hunter masquerading as a dentist -LRB- the wagon he drives has a giant molar wobbling on the roof -RRB- . Although he 's German by birth , he speaks such florid English most of the Americans he encounters have trouble keeping up . His name is Schultz , but he goes by the more distinguished -LRB- and resonant -RRB- Dr. King .

Dr. King is tracking a gang of outlaw brothers , and he enlists the aid of a slave who knows them by sight . This would be Django -LRB- Jamie Foxx -RRB- , who starts the movie as a piece of property but becomes Dr. King 's business partner and ally . Django eventually takes the upper hand , as the pair trespasses onto the notorious Candyland , the plantation where Django 's wife , Broomhilda -LRB- Kerry Washington -RRB- , serves Southern aristocrat and sadist Calvin Candie -LRB- Leonardo DiCaprio -RRB- .

It 's a typical , even quintessential Tarantino gambit : to take two defunct , disreputable genres , dust them off and mash them together . It 's what he does : sniff out the nitro and introduce the glycerin . Lately , in `` Inglourious Basterds '' and again here , he 's added historical flashpoints to the mix for a little extra flare -- and upset those commentators who believe that appropriating history -LRB- Nazism , slavery -RRB- for the purposes of entertainment automatically trivializes it .

Not true . While Tarantino 's morally challenging , emotionally wrenching films carve a different path from the sanctimonious costume dramas made to flatter middlebrow tastes -- and perhaps -- seduce awards voters , they are no less intellectually provocative for it .

The comparison with `` Lincoln '' is irresistible -- the two films take place within five years of each other . One is grounded in assiduous historical research and offers a shrewd analysis of idealism and political pragmatism , while the other is pure fantasy . But it 's the fantasy that truly rattles the chains of slavery , confronting not just the racist assumptions but also the economic power structure that underpinned it -- the paradoxes , hypocrisies and insidious evils that permitted the system to flourish for so long .

Unlike `` Lincoln , '' `` Django Unchained '' affords room at the heart of its narrative for compelling and assertive African-American characters , both heroic -LRB- Foxx in the title role -RRB- and otherwise -LRB- Samuel L Jackson , memorably repellent as a house servant who has become his master 's right hand and confidant -RRB- .

` Django ' cast debates : How does movie violence influence violence in real life ?

At a time when so many of our movies aspire to be colorblind -LRB- but `` urban '' film remains largely ghettoized -RRB- , `` Django Unchained '' dares to confront racism as a potent force and a moving target , discovering horror and also grotesque comedy in the niceties of Southern etiquette : the way a white landowner can maintain a black mistress , for instance , or tolerate the grumbling of a loyal servant , just so long as everyone knows he will have his dogs tear a runaway limb from limb . That may be the film 's true subject , when you get right down to brass tacks : the vacuity of good manners , and the limits of tolerance .

Rambling but in a jaunty , generous , let 's - shoot-the-works fashion , `` Django Unchained '' draws on dozens of westerns -- some of them American , others from Italy and Germany -- and includes a very funny travesty of the Ku Klux Klan that might have been an outtake from `` Blazing Saddles . '' It doffs its hat in the direction of German mythology , and the soundtrack samples James Brown , 2Pac , Rick Ross , Ennio Morricone and John Legend in the process . It 's a big , brazen movie , brilliantly acted across the board , one of the best things Tarantino has done .
