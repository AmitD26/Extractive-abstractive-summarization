-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ford 's Europe boss says the car giant is sticking with the UK despite the slumping currency and friction with European partners .

Stephen Odell -- chief executive officer of the U.S. automaker 's European division -- told CNN the debate over a UK referendum on EU membership is not an `` inhibitor '' to Ford 's investment strategy in the short term .

U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron is pledging to offer the British electorate a vote by 2017 on whether Europe 's second largest economy remains in the 27-nation political union .

In January , Cameron said the British people should have a choice about whether to remain in the EU on the basis of a renegotiated settlement -- or to leave .

The referendum should not be held until it 's clear how changes made after the crisis in the eurozone work out , he said .

Speaking from the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland , Odell told CNN : `` I hope sense prevails as we start to move potentially towards a referendum . ''

He added : `` From a business perspective to elect and decide to vote to move away from 50 % of your business partnership does n't strike me as a very good view . ''

Odell also said the weak pound would not deter Ford 's operation in the UK . Sterling is under pressure as investors anticipate new stimulus measures from the Bank of England .

`` The U.K. -LSB- car -RSB- industry last year was quite buoyant because the pound was strong against the euro but I do n't think that 's a principle driver of our decision , '' said Odell .

This week Ford is launching its new Tourneo Courier at the Geneva Motor Show , with the people carrier set to hit UK showrooms next spring . Odell says Ford is already beginning to see encouraging signs in sales in the European car industry .

`` There are some signs on supplier purchasing , on our own order banks that there are some green shoots ... . we could start to see some sort of recovery slow in the second half -LSB- of 2013 -RSB- . ''
