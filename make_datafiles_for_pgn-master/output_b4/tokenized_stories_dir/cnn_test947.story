-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Allison Janney was always on the move as a child . The `` West Wing '' actress played sports and enjoyed figure skating , so staying active was easy . But over the years , exercise took a back seat to Janney 's evolving career .

`` I think when ` West Wing ' ended , I just went into a slump , '' she recently said .

We all did , Ms. Janney .

Thankfully the popular government drama is back , available for streaming on Netflix due to a new deal with Warner Bros. that sent fans to the couch in rerun ecstasy . And Janney has returned to her active lifestyle , dropping 20 pounds by focusing on her diet and daily hikes with her dogs .

Janney 's had more than one high-profile role since `` The West Wing '' ended : She played the dog-obsessed mom in `` Juno , '' a Southern socialite in `` The Help '' and Matthew Perry 's crazy boss on `` Mr. Sunshine . '' But Janney said White House press secretary C.J. Cregg will always be one of her favorite characters .

`` I feel proud , '' she said . `` I feel like I can die happy ; I did something good . Not that I 'm planning on dying anytime soon . ''

That 's good , especially considering Janney 's newest role is spokeswoman for the American Heart Association 's Go Red for Women campaign .

The campaign aims to spread awareness about the No. 1 killer of women : heart disease .

Heart disease kills one woman every minute , according to the American Heart Association , and the gap between women 's and men 's survival rates continues to widen .

Janney comes from a long line of `` cream and butter '' lovers , she said . Her family 's history of heart disease -- including a grandfather who died of a heart attack -- led her to volunteer for the campaign .

`` I feel if there was one cause that I actually had experience with , and a reason to step up for , it would be this , '' she said . `` I hope I can make a difference in someone 's life . ''

CNN spoke with Janney about Go Red for Women , how she stays healthy and where she hopes her career heads next . The following is an edited version of that interview .

CNN : I love the dress that you 're wearing in the new PSA ; that bright red color looks great on you .

Allison Janney : I love it , too ! Red has always been a great color on me , which is why I decided to do the campaign . -LRB- laughs -RRB-

CNN : What does that color symbolize for women ?

Janney : It 's blood . It 's love . It 's your heart . It 's vibrant . It 's alive . Red is just the most standout , powerful color I think there is .

This famous costume designer I worked with ... said the woman who gets to wear the red dress is the one who 's the most powerful . It 's the perfect color to go with this campaign , because it 's all about keeping women strong and healthy and vital .

Survivor of heart failure dedicates birthday to educating others

CNN : Let 's talk about the real reason you 're working with the American Heart Association .

Janney : I had a bit of a scary experience with my mother who , like most women I think , ignored the symptoms .

She was driving , going to see the grandkids . She was in a motel and probably had what was a very small heart attack -- but a warning . She just thought she was having this unbelievable pressure and discomfort in her neck and shoulders .

She drove 10 hours to Dayton , Ohio , and drove right to the doctor because she knew something was wrong . He just could n't believe she drove all that way . She went right into the hospital and had emergency quadruple bypass surgery .

I almost lost her . For that reason alone , I 'm glad to be part of this campaign .

CNN : You mentioned that many women feel like they have to tough it out and just ignore the symptoms . Why do you think that is ?

Janney : I think , as women , we tend to always put our own needs in the back seat to take care of our family or loved ones . My mother did just that .

Women feel they need to take care of everybody , -LRB- but -RRB- they ca n't take care of anybody if they do n't take care of themselves .

CNN : How did that experience , and learning more about heart disease , change the way you looked at exercise and nutrition ?

Janney : I 've lost 15 -LRB- to -RRB- 20 pounds since the summer . I 've been doing Pilates three days a week , and I have three dogs , which gets me out walking every single morning . It 's been nice to slim down and bump up the exercise .

CNN : Do you have any favorite foods that you 've had a hard time giving up ?

Janney : I do n't believe you have to give everything up completely . I am my mother 's daughter . I like cream sauces . I like macaroni and cheese , all that comfort food .

I love chocolate , but now I go for 88 % and 90 % dark , dark chocolate to treat myself .

I go for Greek yogurt instead of heavy cream in a recipe . It 's kind of a game to see how I can take a recipe and make it healthy and still make it taste good . It 's a challenge I 'm enjoying .

CNN : So you like to cook ?

Janney : I do . I 'm not the best cook , but I do like to get inspired -- you know , get the cooking magazines or watch cooking shows .

Basically , I like to have people over to my house , because I usually hate going out to restaurants . So I 'm trying to give them more reasons to want to come over to my house . Like , `` Oh , my God , Allison 's a good cook . ''

CNN : What else is a staple in your diet ? What do you have for breakfast ?

Janney : I 've been doing juicing ... kind of an almond milk mixture . And then if I 'm still hungry , I make steel cut oats or have oatmeal with some banana in it or a little agave to sweeten it . And that keeps me going .

I eat a lot of salads . Whatever I eat is mostly 70 % water . I eat tons of salads and greens and peppers and scallions and avocados , my favorite food on the planet . I 've been eating a lot of soups and one-pot meals , with quinoa , with chicken breast and tomatoes and thyme .

I really try to stick to that , and I find I feel better ; I have more energy . I 'm 50-something , and I feel better than I felt 20 years ago . So it works .

CNN : What do you do for stress relief ?

Janney : I 'm trying to learn to meditate . I have n't been able to achieve it successfully yet because I get impatient .

I do these breathing exercises where if I start to feel stressed I breathe in for -- I start at a high number like eight -- and breathe in for eight counts and breathe out for eight counts , until I feel like I can go down to seven and then to six ... and it really does calm me down .

Getting a dog I would highly recommend for anyone . Animals are great for stress . The morning comes , and you have to take those dogs out . And I feel better because I do n't feel guilty .

CNN : What would you like to tell women about heart disease ?

Janney : We only get to be here once ; why not feel the best you can feel ? Start making choices that are going to make a difference in your life and the people 's lives around you .

You just have to consciously be aware that we 're not going to be here forever . This is not a dress rehearsal . This is it . This is all we have . And if you look down and you can pinch more than an inch , it 's time to start taking it seriously .

CNN : You 've been called one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood . What have n't you done that you 'd still like to do ?

Janney : Really ? Wow . I just signed up for doing a series for CBS called `` Mom . '' Anna Faris plays my daughter . It 's a multicam series , the first time I 'll be doing that sort of format where I 'm performing in front of a live audience for television . I 'm really excited about that .

There are lots of types of roles that I 'd like to do that I have n't done yet . I 've always said I 'd like to play action hero ; a really physically demanding film role would be fun .

I want to be challenged , work with great people and find better roles . Like the role that I found in C.J. ; I like the women that I play who are inspiring to other women . That makes me feel good about what I do , that it has a lasting impact on the world .

I want to do more Broadway . I want to continue doing film . I want to have this show -LRB- `` Mom '' -RRB- with Chuck Lorre be a great success .

I just want to keep working , because that 's where I 'm happy , and I think that 's what I 'm supposed to do in this lifetime : keep working and keep experiencing and keep healthy and stay alive as long as I can .
