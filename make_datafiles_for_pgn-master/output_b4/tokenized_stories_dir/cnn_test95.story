-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Here 's a quick , slightly doctored -LRB- to protect the innocent -RRB- anecdote from the many-splendored , multi-faceted realm of real life :

One sunny day in the borough of Brooklyn , a couple of friends are sitting in a coffee shop , talking about a book that had one had recently read -- a dreadful piece of drek -LRB- in her opinion -RRB- detailing the true story of how the author had spent two years emulating the lifestyle of the lowly cockroach in order to prepare himself for the upcoming Mayan apocalypse .

The disgruntled friend has just grandly exclaimed to her laughing pal something akin to , `` It 's good that he 's studying up to be the last dude on Earth , because that 's the only way he 'll ever get a date , '' when the young man across from the duo stands up , spills his coffee all over the table in a state of extreme agitation and cries , `` I 'm sorry you hated my book so much ! And for your information , tons of girls are into entomology ! ''

In the RL realm , such an instance could be seen as completely serendipitous , and the girl is n't really to be faulted for her less-than-favorable view of the book in question . But transpose this scenario into what is essentially the digital coffee shop of the Web -- Twitter -- and you have another situation altogether .

More and more , Twitter is becoming a kind of online comment box , a place for fans and customers to weigh in with their myriad opinions . Which is good , in many instances . Brands get constructive feedback ! Musicians and fans make friends and collaborate ! An open dialogue is forged !

In other cases , however , we have scenarios like those above -- scenarios where words a fan thinks are falling on deaf ears result in an explosion and scads of useless fighting .

Read on for four ways you can drop a comment in the Twitter box without making enemies .

-LRB- NB : If your aim is to instigate , that 's all well and good . Trolls will be trolls . Still , do so at your own risk , because there 's a fine line between a taunt and a threat .

Be constructive

Your favorite band , Emo Screamo , has just posted their upcoming tour dates , and your hometown of Pinprick , USA , is unfortunately not on the docket this go-around . Rage and disappointment flood your eyes and a torrent of salty tears cascade onto your keyboard , effectively shorting out the `` F '' key . Blasting Emo Screamo 's number-one hit , `` Time of Death : Your Kiss , '' you take to Twitter , sending off the following waterlogged words into the abyss , `` uck you , emo screamo ! uck youuuuuuu ! ''

Emo Screamo 's lead singer , Johnny Longbangs , happens to see your tweet and takes it to his black , black heart , shooting back at you in rage , `` uck you , too , you illiterate toolbag . '' At first , the joy at seeing the you-addressed tweet in your timeline blinds you to his rageful words , and then the slow realization that your favorite singer likely hates you fills you to the eartips with anguish .

`` I 'm sorry , man , '' you type back rapidly , `` I just really wanted to you to play in Pinprick , ya know ? I was just disappointed . '' But it 's too late , friend , Longbangs has retreated into his dark cave of sadness , and has vowed to never set foot -LRB- or `` oot '' -RRB- in Pinprick as long as Emo Screamo is a band -LRB- which will be about six more months , tops -RRB- .

Yeah , that was all a little dramatic , but the main takeaway is : Be specific about your gripe , do n't just rage . If you 're sad that your favorite band is skipping your burg , tweet a special invite to play your church and crash on your couch ; if a journalist gets a fact wrong , tweet a correction , do n't call him/her an expletive , expletiving , expletive -- because you never know when the object of your ire will actually take note of your blistering display of inner turmoil .

Be careful how you at-reply

Tweeting directly at a person , brand , etc. is equivalent to running up to him/her/it on the street and yelling , `` HEY , HEY , HEY , listen to me . I have something to say to YOU and only YOU ! ''

When it comes to people , before you hit '' @ '' try to imagine yourself saying your piece to said person 's face . Are you looking for a direct reaction from said person ? Would you speak your tweet to his/her face ? If not , maybe just tweet something a little more general -LRB- taking # 1 into consideration -RRB- .

When tweeting at brands , think about your end game : Are you trying to get faster service from Time Warner ? Sure , send a -LRB- see number one , constructive -RRB- tweet to the company . Expressing a blanket distaste for Candy Corn Oreos ? Maybe do n't personify the snacks by sending a tweet reading , '' @Oreo , your new candy-corned flavored spawn was obviously crafted in the bowels of hell . '' Unless , you know , you want to be openly mocked on Dumb Tweets At Brands . Special exception for the dude who elicted this tweet from Dominos .

Will your job take a hit ?

This should be obvious , but if you work in a certain industry , you should probably be careful what you say about that industry in a public sphere such as Twitter . Still , people are getting fired for doing just that , it seems , so we 'll just leave this here .

Does the medium fit the message ?

Tons of musicians got all up in arms the other week when singer Amanda Palmer put out a call on her blog asking for volunteers to play horns and strings -- for free -- during select gigs on her current tour -LRB- after raising more than a million dollars on Kickstarter for her new album -RRB- .

Obviously there was a plethora of meeping on the microblogging site , but musician Amy Vaillancourt-Sals scored the undivided attention of Palmer herself -- in the form of a lengthy open letter -- after she posted a thoughtful epistle to her idol on her website .

Yeah , Palmer and Vaillancourt-Sals may still agree to disagree , but at least the latter managed to open up a dialogue with her considered and articulate letter -- a dialogue that would have lost a lot of its cohesion and luster if confined by character limits .
