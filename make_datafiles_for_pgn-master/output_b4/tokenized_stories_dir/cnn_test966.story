-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The riskiest , trickiest , friskiest movie you can see right now happens to be a documentary . Do n't let that put you off .

This is the story of an ambitious European entrepreneur who buys himself diplomatic immunity for less than $ 200,000 . That would be Danish agent provocateur Mads Brugger , who greases several palms in a bid to get himself appointed the Liberian ambassador to the Central African Republic .

And why would anyone want to do that ? Well , if you think Liberia could use some governmental oversight , wait until you see what goes on in the Central African Republic . While most of the populace is mired in poverty , let 's not forget that this former French colony is also home to some of the world 's richest diamond fields -LRB- which is where diplomatic status proves an invaluable investment -RRB- .

We 're used to seeing intrepid reporters digging out a story , but bribing officials to smuggle out blood diamonds ? That 's not something Robert Redford would have done , surely ?

Brugger is short and bald , very white , and with a ginger goatee . In his previous film , `` The Red Chapel , '' he sneaked a peek into North Korea under the guise of filming a theatrical troupe on a cultural exchange .

Here he dresses the part of a colonial martinet : tight jackets , jodhpurs , riding boots , and even affects a cigarette holder . He makes `` humorous '' remarks about Hitler in an effort to ingratiate himself with his new friends -- a ploy that works quite well , actually -- and liberally distributes what he calls `` little envelopes of happiness '' to smooth the way for his business proposal , a plan to build a match factory staffed by the country 's pygmy tribe .

This is his cover story , a fig leaf for his smuggling plans , and an illustration of the kind of development that might genuinely help the indigenous peoples . But it 's also a cruel hoax on the pygmies he meets , collateral damage in his bid to expose their corrupt political masters and the international diplomatic classes who feed off them .

Brugger is playing with dynamite here .

The closest comparison may be Sacha Baron Cohen 's knife-edge satirical rubes . The film is often very funny even if you feel lousy about laughing -- except that Baron Cohen has n't put his own neck on the line like this .

Central Africa can be a dangerous place at the best of times . For a long while Brugger is marooned there -LRB- his documentation has not come through , and in fairness to Liberia 's authorities , it never does -RRB- , and if he needs any reminder of what could go wrong , it all comes crashing home when one of his interviewees is assassinated . The movie 's last 20 minutes play like a real-life John le Carr√© spy thriller : The wheels start to come off the deceit and we have to wonder if he 'll be able to extricate himself without serious injury .

`` The Ambassador '' is a damning movie on almost every level .

You might have serious reservations about his methods , but you ca n't fault the man 's nerve . It 's extraordinary just how many illicit conversations with important men Brugger manages to get on camera . Already the Liberian president has called for an inquiry , though there seems little likelihood of similar soul-searching in the Central African Republic . In any case , Brugger has given his testimony and issued his indictments , too .
