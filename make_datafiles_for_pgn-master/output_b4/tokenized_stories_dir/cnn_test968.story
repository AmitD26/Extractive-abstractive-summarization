-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The task of replacing seven-time MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi at Ducati has been handed to his fellow Italian Andrea Dovizioso .

Legendary rider Rossi will return to former team Yamaha Factory Racing on a two-year deal at the start of the 2013 season , a move which will see him reunited with fellow title winner and rival Jorge Lorenzo .

Dovizioso , currently riding for the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 satellite outfit , is fourth in the standings after 11 rounds of the 2012 season , 46 points ahead of Rossi .

The 26-year-old will spend his sixth season in the elite division of motorbike racing at the Italian team , alongside American 2006 champion Nicky Hayden .

`` It is with great pleasure that I welcome Andrea , as we marshal our best efforts in confronting the MotoGP World Championship , '' Ducati president Gabriele Del Torchio said of the 26-year-old on MotoGP 's official website .

`` Along with Nicky Hayden , with whom we have renewed a working agreement , we are confident that we will be able to proceed with our development program , to compete , and to obtain the results and rewards that will repay our efforts and the faith that our partners , sponsors and fans have never failed to demonstrate . ''

Dovizioso finished the 2011 championship in third position and will hope for better results at Ducati than Rossi achieved -- the 33-year-old has recorded just two podium finishes in 28 races .

Ducati will be without Hayden for this weekend 's Czech Grand Prix after he picked up a hand injury during a qualifying crash at the last race in Indianapolis , meaning Rossi will be the team 's sole rider at Brno .

Reigning world champion Casey Stoner , third in the 2012 riders ' standings , will not race this weekend after a crash in the U.S. left the Australian with a fractured bone in his right ankle and torn ligaments .

Despite picking up the injuries in qualifying ahead of the race , Stoner was still able to compete in the grand prix and register a fourth-place finish .

Stoner will now fly from the Czech Republic to his homeland after doctors recommended he undergo surgery .

`` It was always feeling like it was going to be this decision anyway , '' explained Stoner , who will retire at the end of the season . `` I was recommended by everyone not to race on Sunday in Indianapolis , so I did n't expect the situation to be better here .

`` It 's definitely disappointing ; it 's not what we wanted , especially in my last season ... In the later part of the season you never know what could have happened , but we 'll keep pushing .

`` I do n't regret it -LSB- racing at Indianapolis -RSB- . I 've never really followed people 's orders with things like that in the past . But now , if another accident was to happen it would be huge damage . It 's just frustrating to thing what we could have done without this injury . ''
