-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Her mother was assassinated , her father died in prison after being jailed by the military . Today , Hafsat Abiola is one of the most prominent civil rights activists in Nigeria , fueled by a desire to ensure her parents ' deaths were not in vain .

The daughter of Nigerian politician and philanthropist Moshood Kashimawo Olawale -LRB- MKO -RRB- Abiola , Hafsat was at her second year studying at Harvard , United States , when her father was sent to prison by Nigeria 's junta after claiming the country 's 1993 presidential election .

Although MKO Abiola garnered almost 60 % of the vote , the West African country 's military rulers annulled the results and eventually charged the former businessman with treason . His imprisonment prompted a wave of demonstrations , led partly by Hafsat 's mother and Abiola 's second wife , Kudirat .

In 1996 , Kudirat Abiola was shot in the head when the car she was traveling in was attacked on a Lagos expressway . Hafsat was still in the United States with her siblings when news came of her mother 's assassination .

`` All five of us were in the U.S. when we heard , and we stood in a circle , and we held hands , '' remembers Hafsat . `` We just stood there , and then I said to my siblings that we wo n't let her down , and really since that time we 've been trying to make sure that we do not let her down . ''

Two years later , in July 1998 , MKO Abiola died while still in custody . Everything Hafsat has done ever since is done through the prism of her loss and her desire to continue the legacy left by her parents .

After Kudirat 's assassination , Hafsat founded an NGO in her mother 's memory , the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy -LRB- KIND -RRB- , a group working to strengthen Nigeria 's civil society .

Along with promoting female leadership by offering training and support to women who want to run for office and be active in public life , KIND is also tackling issues such as violence against women .

`` We wanted to also work with protecting women from domestic violence , raising awareness about the issue of domestic violence , '' says Hafsat . `` Also , we 're drawing tacit public acceptance of it . If the public challenges people who abuse their wives , their daughters , their sisters , their girlfriends , it will stop , it will be not so easy to continue . ''

Last year , Hafsat was appointed as a special adviser to the governor of Ogun State , Ibikunle Amonson . Hafsat runs a conditional cash transfer project for the state , where poor pregnant women are encouraged to use available healthcare facilities for safer pregnancies in a bid to reduce maternal mortality rates .

According to the World Health Organization , maternal mortality in Nigeria is 630 per 100,000 , more than 20 times as high as in Europe or the United States .

`` We need to drive the women into our primary health centers , '' says Hafsat , explaining that many pregnant women choose to not visit a doctor due to high costs .

`` But for us the cost of their loss of life is too high for us and society to bear , so we have to incentivize them to overlook the cost , '' she says .

`` So what we 're doing is that we pay them to go to the doctor six times before delivery , which is a lot of times but we want to have enough time to be checking if there 's any complications arising that we have to prepare for .

`` We pay them to deliver in the hospital , so each time they go to give birth we give them a small amount of money . It 's not a lot , but it will cover transportation and a little bit extra . ''

Hafsat says that through her efforts and those of others in the country , the work of her parents can reach a new generation of Nigerians .

`` I think that if they were to do it all over again , they would do it exactly the same way , '' says Hafsat of her parents . `` Or if not , they would even make more sacrifices because I think we only live once , and we must do what we can . ''
