-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Maybe a phone 's not big enough for you and your spouse to cuddle up with on the sofa . Or single folks need to travel light when they 're on the prowl .

Whatever the reasons , a new survey suggests that married couples are more likely to own a tablet , while smartphones are more popular with unhitched folks .

The Search Agency , a digital marketing company , recently released its 2012 Online User Behavior and Engagement Study -LRB- PDF -RRB- , created with the help of market research firm Harris Interactive .

In it , 49 % of single respondents said they own a smartphone , compared with only 43 % of married people . Meanwhile , 45 % of people who have said `` I do '' reported owning a tablet , compared with 36 % of singles .

Search Agency Vice President Mike Solomon said that differences in the ages of single and married respondents may have played a bigger role than specific habits .

`` For many of the findings , percentages zigzagged between age groups , rather than plotting a consistent bell curve -- indicating how factors such as generational differences , disposable income , and the influence of children on their parents impact results , '' Solomon said in a written statement .

`` Married people are often older , have more disposable income and can more easily justify superfluous pieces of technology , such as tablets . At the same time , baby boomers are often more tech-literate than their slightly younger counterparts -- likely because their millennial children are pushing them to use new tools and devices . ''

The survey of 2,006 U.S. adults was conducted online between August 14 and 16 .

It provides some other interesting glimpses into what could be called the mobile revolution that has taken over the computing world .

For example , 59 % of smartphone owners said they had launched a Web search on their mobile phones when they were sitting within arm 's reach of a desktop or laptop -- a number that jumps to 74 % for younger users , age 18-34 .

And 66 % of tablet owners said they 've quickly jumped onto their iPad , Kindle Fire , Nexus 7 or other gadget to get more information about products they see on TV .
