-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Just about every year , brilliant movies are utterly ignored by the Oscars . `` The Searchers , '' `` Groundhog Day , '' `` Breathless , '' `` King Kong , '' `` Casino Royale , '' `` Touch of Evil , '' `` Caddyshack , '' `` Mean Streets , '' `` The Big Lebowski '' -- the Academy has a long history of overlooking comedies , action movies , horror flicks , hard-boiled genre pics , artsy foreign films , and documentaries that are n't about World War II . This year , we 'll be taking a closer look at films that were too small , too weird , or perhaps simply too awesome for the Academy Awards . These are the Non-Nominees .

The Film : Affectionately known as `` Channing Tatum 's stripper movie , '' the Steven Soderbergh film is about man at a crossroads : Does `` Magic Mike '' keep grinding his moneymaker to bank those singles he 's saving to start his own custom-furniture business , or , does mentoring a fresh face -LRB- Alex Pettyfer -RRB- for his shady boss -LRB- Matthew McConaughey -RRB- make him see that he 's losing more than he 's gained and hang up his G-string for good ?

Why it Was n't Nominated : EW 's Owen Gleiberman gave the movie an A - , so we could pretend this had an actual chance to follow in The Full Monty 's footsteps and garner a nod as one of the year 's Top 10 -LRB- or nine -RRB- best pictures . But even with Soderbergh 's name attached , no one wanted to take this film seriously . -LRB- Especially the people who paid to see it multiple times even though they thought there was n't enough stripping and that Cody Horn , as Tatum 's love interest , was way too wooden . -RRB-

The real snub here is that McConaughey , who 's picked up supporting actor honors from the New York Film Critics and National Society of Film Critics among others this awards season , did n't score his first Oscar nomination for playing narcissistic club owner Dallas . The critics remember their summer raves for McConaughey 's commitment , but the buzz had faded by the time Academy members got to voting : Only one acting nomination this year came from a film with a U.S. release date before September , and that 's Beasts of the Southern Wild 's lead actress Quvenzhane Wallis . Another uphill battle : All supporting actor nominees this year have not only been nominated before , they 've all won before .

But perhaps the biggest mountain for McConaughey to climb was the idea that him playing a shirtless beefcake with a chill vibe and his eye on the prize -LRB- moving the revue from Tampa to Miami -RRB- was n't a stretch . -LRB- We did n't penalize Alan Arkin for playing Argo 's acerbic movie producer , did we ? -RRB-

` Following ' ratings grow in week 2

Why History Will Remember It Better Than `` Amour '' : This is the film that secured Channing Tatum the title of People 's Sexiest Man Alive -LRB- and will forever make of us think of him when we hear Ginuwine 's `` Pony '' -RRB- , but it was already legendary before that . There are multiple lessons here :

1 . -RRB- How Tatum turned what could have been an embarrassing leak -- a video of him stripping in his younger days -- into a film that 's grossed more than $ 113 million domestically and sparked talk of a sequel and a stage musical . He did n't try to bury his past -LRB- as perhaps some of his reps wanted him to -RRB- ; He knew there was a story in the comically dark , seedy world of male stripping , and he used his experience to inform it . That kind of honesty and sense of humor wins you fans .

2 . -RRB- Media tours can be fun , which we learned watching Tatum 's remarkably game costar Joe Manganiello body-roll his way around town . That 's also something we wo n't soon forget .

3 . -RRB- Speaking again to McConaughey 's snub specifically , just because a role seems a perfect fit does n't mean you should n't get credit for making it your own . As we found out when we went behind the scenes of the stripping numbers , in the original script Dallas did n't even have a stripping scene . McConaughey wanted one , and knew exactly how it should play out : He 'd begin by serenading the women from the stage with a slow song . Music supervisor Frankie Pine suggested she and McConaughey pen the tune with Martin Blasick , McConaughey 's guitar coach .

They wrote `` Ladies of Tampa '' in about three hours at McConaughey 's hotel . `` The song is silly as hell , but Matthew swears it 's gon na get nominated for an Academy Award . He keeps telling me I have to pick out my dress . And you know what , I am gon na submit it , '' Pine told EW before the film 's June 29 release . After the song , McConaughey wanted to blow fire , smash his guitar , and strip to KISS ' `` Calling Dr. Love . ''

McConaughey worked with costume designer Christopher Peterson on designing his thong . `` Matthew did n't want to wear , nor did I want him to wear , just a spandex thong . There was a rock 'n' roll Western feel to his clothing , and he kept talking about this specific coloring that a certain horse has . It just started occurring to me that maybe we were talking about a horse mane and fringe .

He liked that idea , '' Peterson told EW last summer . Fringe placement was another discussion . `` I started placing it at different places on the thong , and Matthew said , ` Right down the center , ' '' Peterson recalled . `` Initially , the fringe was a little out of control . It was like a horse 's mane . We trimmed it back and trimmed it back . When those pants came off and the silver and black patent fringe started catching the light , the reaction was IN-SANE . ''

As for the actual moves for the number , McConaughey had ideas for those , too . `` He was so in it to be gross and raunchy , '' choreographer Alison Faulk told EW . He came up with signature moves , like the `` Lick It and Slick It '' -LRB- he licks his fingers and slides them down his pants -RRB- . `` He was the one who had the most names for things , because we would call them out , '' Faulk said . `` I 've never laughed as hard as I laughed watching him perform , only because it was so f -- ing amazing . The women did not know what to do with themselves . The last thing he does in his routine is lie on the ground , and the girls were insane trying to tip him , shoving money in his G-string , and his G-string ripped off . He held it on with his hand . Nothing will beat that to me . ''

As Peterson said , when recalling that McConaughey 's G-string also had a fringe tail , `` Matthew was out to outdo all the other boys . I do n't know that he succeeded necessarily , but he certainly committed something incredibly memorable to film for all time . ''
