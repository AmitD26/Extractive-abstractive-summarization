New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former college professor in upstate New York says he was fired and discriminated against because he is straight .

Dr. Csaba Marosan taught natural Sciences at Trocaire College in Buffalo . He told CNN that he was asked not to return this year because of his formal complaint against the college in 2009 .

Marosan alleges that college officials gave preferential treatment to gay faculty members in a small clique dubbed , `` the Merry Men . ''

The college denied the allegations and attributes his dismissal to lack of qualifications . The former professor said he has taught at the college for eight years .

`` Trocaire is confident that it will be vindicated when the full facts of this case are presented in the hearing process , '' said John A. Vecchio , vice president for institutional advancement .

A report from the New York State Division of Human Rights shows that a dean of education allegedly made comments about Marosan 's nationality , accent , culture and manner of greeting colleagues .

The initial report was amended in April to include the differential treatment Marosan allegedly received since the investigation started , including his eventual dismissal . The amended report also includes a charge of discrimination based on sexual orientation , which Marosan said he initially left out .

`` I am not a homophobe , and I did not want to bring up sexual orientation going into it , '' he said .

Vecchio criticized the rights ' group probe .

`` The decision of the New York Division of Human Rights is based on a poor and incomplete investigation , '' he said .

In addition , the report indicates that among a number of sexual harassment complaints made against Marosan , at least one student admitted to having been coached . All other cases were fully dismissed .
