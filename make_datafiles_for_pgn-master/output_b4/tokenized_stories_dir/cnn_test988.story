-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For award-winning Nigerian film director Obi Emelonye , the London premiere of `` Last flight to Abuja '' in early June was supposed to be a celebratory event , a marquee moment introducing his suspense-filled airplane disaster thriller to the rest of the world with pomp and grandeur .

But then June 3rd happened .

On that fateful Sunday , the Dana Air Flight 992 from the Nigerian capital of Abuja crashed into a densely populated neighborhood in Lagos , killing all 153 people aboard as well as at least 10 people on the ground .

The tragic news left Emelonye , whose high-octane action movie is based on a series of fatal air crashes that stunned Nigeria in 2006 , in a state of shock .

`` The coincidences and the timing of it was scary , '' he says . `` This was five days to the London premiere that we 've been building up to -- my first reaction was to cancel the premiere . ''

But after consulting his team , Nigerian officials and some of the families of the bereaved , Emelonye was convinced to go ahead with the original plan , using the movie to spotlight aviation safety in Nigeria .

`` They said ` no , this might end up being one of the longest lasting legacies to the lives of these people that were lost so needlessly in those crashes , ' '' he remembers . `` This film was supposed to flag some of those issues that have now taken their lives , so it 's in their interest that this story goes out there -- if for nothing , to put the issue of aviation safety squarely in the public agenda so that we do n't forget . ''

Five days later , in an emotional event attended by hundreds of people , Emelonye made sure the premiere was dedicated to the Dana Air crash victims -- attendees observed one minute of silence while the film 's end credits were replaced by the names of those who lost their lives on that ill-fated flight .

Emelonye says that `` Last Flight to Abuja , '' written in 2007 and shot in November last year , has now become a campaign film , raising attention for safer flying in Nigeria and the rest of the continent .

`` The film has taken on added significance way beyond my planning , '' he explains . `` It has become an advocacy ... for aviation safety , not just in Nigeria but for the whole of Africa , and it 's a responsibility I take very seriously . ''

As a result , Emelonye says that some of the profits of the film will be donated to a fund dedicated to helping the families of the air crash victims .

`` We 're trying to give back financially because we feel whatever profits from this film should go to , in some way , to continue the campaign for safer skies , '' he says . `` In the absence of social security , there are people in dire hardship from that accident and we 'll contribute something and kind of compel our partners to contribute also . ''

At just 30 years old , Emelonye is one of the rising stars of Nigeria 's booming movie-making industry , known as Nollywood . Passionate and self-taught , he left behind a career in law to follow his dream of becoming a filmmaker . He achieved critical and commercial acclaim last year with `` The Mirror Boy , '' a fantasy/adventure film released all across the African continent and the UK .

And now he is aiming for further success with `` Last Flight to Abuja , '' a big-budget production starring many of Nollywood 's biggest names .

The 81-minute long film has already become a box office hit in Nigeria and is shown in screens across West Africa and in London .

Emelonye says he hopes the movie , along with promoting civil aviation safety in Nigeria , will open up his country 's burgeoning film industry to a wider audience , dismissing the low-quality tag that 's often attached to Nollywood productions .

`` We have a film that has pushed the boundaries with Nollywood and introduced a new genre in Nollywood filmmaking , '' he says .

Emelonye says Nollywood films are growing in popularity because they offer audiences a narrative they can connect to .

`` There 's something I call the quintessential African voice , which has kind of given Nollywood , in spite of its qualitative problems , international attention -- it 's watched across Africa , it 's watched across the world , even though they 're shot on very low quality cameras , very simplistic stories , they have a common connection with people that is great .
