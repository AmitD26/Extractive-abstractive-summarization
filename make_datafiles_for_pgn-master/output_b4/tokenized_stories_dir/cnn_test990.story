-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Championship leader Dani Pedrosa claimed his first pole position this season after stunning MotoGP titleholder Jorge Lorenzo with a scorching late lap at Mugello .

The Honda rider will head the starting grid for Sunday 's Italian Grand Prix , having relegated his fellow Spaniard Lorenzo to second for Yamaha .

Andrea Dovizioso secured the final place on the front row for home team Ducati , despite angering Pedrosa with his tactics in Saturday 's qualifying and receiving a shake of the fist during the session .

`` He was trying to follow me , '' Pedrosa told the MotoGP website after clocking one minute 47.157 seconds to clinch the 25 pole of his career . `` I understand his position . It was not only him , he was just one of them , but everything is alright .

`` It was a hard session at the end . I could not really find a space to do a lap time -- many riders were behind me . I was not high up in the order before my last lap , but was able to do a great lap . ''

Lorenzo , who trails Pedrosa by 17 points in third overall , had been seeking his third pole in five attempts this year .

However , motorcycling 's two-time world champion missed out by 0.069 seconds despite beating Pedrosa 's record lap time from last year .

`` I was surprised by my lap time , that was really impressive and I did n't expect it , '' said the Mallorcan , who won last year 's race from Pedrosa . `` I also did n't expect the lap time from Dani on the second try . I expected to be on pole , but that happens sometimes ...

`` We have to try to make a good start to lead the race at the beginning because we have strong pace on the first two laps . It is going to be really difficult , as Dani and his team have improved the bike so much and he has improved his riding style . ''

Dovizioso , who injured his neck after crashing on Friday , sympathized with Pedrosa but said he had done nothing wrong to his former teammate .

`` He complained because too many riders delayed him , but I can understand him because he was fast and wanted a clear track to try and do the best , '' the 27-year-old Italian said .

`` But when you have n't disrupted his fast lap , he ca n't say anything . ''

Britain 's Cal Crutchlow heads the second row in fourth for Monster Yamaha Tech 3 , ahead of Germany 's Stefan Bradl on a Honda LCR .

Pedrosa 's new Honda Repsol teammate Marc Marquez will start back in sixth after three crashes in the past two days meant he did not qualify in the top-10 and had to go through the eliminator for the first time in his rookie season .

The 20-year-old is the only rider to have finished on the podium in all four races , and trails Pedrosa by six points in the standings .

`` Sixth place today was the best that we could have hoped for and I am very happy with this result , '' he says , having missed out on the front row while equaling his grid position of the season-opening Qatar Grand Prix .

`` At the end of qualifying I was able to put in a hot lap , but the race tomorrow is going to be difficult and tough . I wo n't be 100 % physically because I 'm bruised and sore ; my shoulder is bothering me the most and we will see how it responds tomorrow . ''

Marquez will start one place ahead of seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi , who had been third for Yamaha until he was bumped down the times late on .

`` Unfortunately I have to start on the third row but I 'm quite happy because my pace is quite good , so I think with a good start I can do a good race , '' said the Italian , who won seven times at Mugello between 2002-2008 .

American Nicky Hayden was eighth fastest on the second Ducati , with Spain 's Alvaro Bautista rounding out the third row .
