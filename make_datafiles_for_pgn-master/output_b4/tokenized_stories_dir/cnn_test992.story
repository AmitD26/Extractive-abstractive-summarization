-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A German opera house forced to ditch its Holocaust-themed staging of a Wagner opera after it horrified the opening night audience said Friday that the decision to perform it only as a concert had gone down well with the public .

The concert version of the production , featuring only the orchestra and singers , was performed at the Oper Am Rhein in Duesseldorf for the first time Thursday night .

Scenes involving a Nazi-era firing squad and gas chamber during the Saturday premiere had left members of the audience reeling -- with some so badly affected that they needed medical help .

Oper Am Rhein said Thursday that it had been aware from the outset that director Burkhard Kosminski 's modern production of Richard Wagner 's `` Tannhauser '' was `` absolutely likely to arouse controversy . ''

But , it said , the effects had gone beyond controversy , with `` some scenes , especially the firing-squad sequence , which was staged with drastically realistic force '' apparently proving an `` intolerable burden for numerous members of the audience , '' both mentally and physically .

As a result `` they were subsequently obliged to undergo medical treatment , '' it said .

After due consideration , the opera house said , `` we have come to the conclusion that we can not permit ourselves to undertake further responsibility for such an extreme effect caused by our artistic endeavors . ''

German newspaper Der Speigel said in its English-language version that the production depicted `` the character Tannhauser as a Nazi war criminal and it even included a gas chamber on stage . ''

In what was a particularly shocking scene , it said , `` nude actors are lowered to the floor on a cross made of glass cubes that are slowly filled with fog to represent the gas chambers . ''

A spokesman for Oper Am Rhein , Daniel Senzek , told CNN Friday that many people had appreciated the decision to stage the production as a concert only .

The opera house has offered refunds for any ticket holders who want their money back .

Some people have requested refunds for their tickets , Senzek said , but was unable to give exact numbers . Other people bought tickets especially to see the concert version of the performance Thursday , he added .

Oper Am Rhein said it had tried to negotiate with Kosminski over his staging after the disastrous premiere but he refused to modify his concept `` for artistic reasons . ''

It added : `` Needless to say , we are obliged to respect the director 's insistence on the protection of his artistic liberty . ''

The production was supposed to explore Wagner 's anti-Semitism and the influence the composer would have on Nazi ideology , Der Spiegel said .

Tannhauser , which had its world premiere in 1845 , is usually seen as a romantic work combining mythology and history .
