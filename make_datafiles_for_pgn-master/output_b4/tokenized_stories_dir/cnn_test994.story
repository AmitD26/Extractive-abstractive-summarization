Williamson , West Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As she grieves , Rosie Crum is being called upon to lead .

Rather than having dinner with her husband , Walter E. `` Eugene '' Crum , she spent Thursday night mourning his violent death and taking over the job he held as sheriff of Mingo County , West Virginia .

The county 's three commissioners voted unanimously to appoint Rosie Crum as sheriff during an emotional meeting Thursday afternoon .

That night , she was sworn in as sheriff at the county courthouse , meaning that she 'll serve at least through the remainder of her late husband 's term , with an election set for 2014 . Rosie Crum did not speak at the ceremony , though she did hug 22 deputies who came to the ceremony , county commissioner John Mark Hubbard said .

'' -LRB- She -RRB- is the best person to fulfill '' her husband 's commitment as sheriff , including taking steps to curb drug abuse in the county , county Commissioner Greg `` Hootie '' Smith said .

David Baisden , another county commissioner , explained that part of the rationale for appointing Rosie Crum -- who has known her husband since she was 14 and , though she is active in local politics , has no law enforcement experience -- is to make sure she is taken care of financially for the next 21 or so months .

She will have a role , but Williamson Police Chief Dave Rockel will `` manage the law enforcement end '' of the sheriff 's department , he explained .

Authorities still are trying to make sense how they got into this position , how a man so admired in his community could be so brazenly gunned down while eating his lunch .

It took two shots to kill Eugene Crum around noon Wednesday , as he sat in a parking lot near the Mingo County courthouse .

A man had walked up to the sheriff 's driver 's - side door from behind , fired at Crum 's head , then returned to his own vehicle and drove away , Rockel told reporters Thursday . The .40-caliber shell casings recovered at the scene indicate the shots came from a semi-automatic handgun , he added .

Those were some of the details offered Thursday by authorities . What they did n't explain , however , was why .

The suspect -- Tennis Melvin Maynard , 37 -- was in critical but stable condition Thursday at Cabell Huntington Hospital , said Rockel . He had been shot in the chest an exchange of gunfire with a sheriff 's deputy , following a chase .

He `` said some things to us '' on his way to the hospital , West Virginia State Police First Sgt. Michael Baylous told CNN on Wednesday .

`` We 're still trying to make sense of it , '' Baylous said of Maynard 's comments . `` It could be interpreted in different ways . ''

Rockel did not elaborate Thursday , when asked by CNN , on whatever Maynard might have said , saying only that `` we do n't want to focus on any particular motive . ''

`` We are unsure at this point , '' Rockel said , why the sheriff was killed . `` We are looking at all possibilities . ''

Source : Suspect got treated for mental health issues

Who is Tennis Melvin Maynard ?

A search of Mingo County court records show no criminal arrests or civil cases involving Maynard . His only citation involves failure to wear a seat belt , according to the records .

On Thursday , a source with knowledge of the suspect 's past told CNN that Maynard had spent time at a state hospital for mental health issues within the past couple of years .

Weeping and shaking , his mother , Olgie Maynard , confirmed as much , saying her son was institutionalized for about a week three to four years ago .

`` He went crazy , '' Olgie Maynard told CNN , explaining her son had n't been the same since he was involved in a workplace explosion five or six years ago in Alabama . `` He was out in the yard yelling . We called the police , and they took him away . ''

Since then , she said Tennis had gotten more psychiatric help at another mental health center . At home in Ragland , where he lives with his parents , he mostly stayed in his bedroom and watched television .

`` He talks a lot to himself , '' Olgie Maynard said . '' ... He was never violent . ''

She added that Tennis Maynard `` has guns , but I do n't know one from another . ''

On Thursday afternoon , he was recovering in a hospital bed . According to the state police spokesman , Maynard is expected to survive .

He 's already facing at least two serious charges : first-degree murder for Crum 's death and attempted murder for firing on a sheriff 's deputy .

`` Those charges are pending on him getting out of the hospital , '' Rockel said .

Sheriff 's slaying ` a big blow to the community '

The man he allegedly killed , 59-year-old Eugene Crum , had been a county magistrate and a special investigator for the prosecutor 's office before becoming sheriff in January .

In 93 days on the job , Crum gained a reputation for taking a tough stance on drug dealers . His legacy will live on , Mingo County officials say .

`` The flame that Sheriff Crum sparked can not be extinguished , '' Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney C. Michael Sparks said in a statement read at Thursday 's press conference in Williamson .

His slaying has shaken the rural county , which normally sees only one or two slayings per year , said Lt. Randy Hatfield of the Mingo County Sheriff 's Office .

`` It 's devastating , '' Hatfield said . `` It 's a big blow to the community . ''

Asked whether officials thought there was any connection between Crum 's slaying and the recent killing of a Colorado prison official or the slayings of two Texas prosecutors , Hatfield said , `` I hope not , '' but declined to elaborate .

For now , the focus is on remembering Crum and his family .

In addition to Thursday night 's candlelight vigil , a memorial service for Crum will be held late Saturday afternoon and his funeral will take place Sunday , both services at Mingo Central High School .

Crum will be remembered as a devoted public servant and a family man , having left behind his wife as well as several children and grandchildren .

`` It 's quite obvious that the last 26 hours have been a difficult time , '' said Hubbard , president of the Mingo County commission . `` We continue to solicit your prayers . ''
