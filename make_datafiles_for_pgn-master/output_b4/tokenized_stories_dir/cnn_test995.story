-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Five people , including the daughter of the Qatari culture minister , were ordered detained as authorities investigate a fire that killed 19 people at a Doha , Qatar , shopping mall , the state-run Qatar News Agency reported .

Thirteen of those who died in the Monday blaze were children in a nursery at the upscale Villaggio shopping mall .

Those detained at the order of the attorney general include the owner of the mall ; the owner of the nursery ; the mall 's director and deputy director ; and the mall 's assistant director , the news agency reported Tuesday .

The nursery 's owner is the daughter of Minister of Culture Iman Al Qawwari .

The mall 's security director and the official in charge of issuing licenses were among those summoned by the attorney general , QNA reported .

The government has set up a committee to investigate `` the causes and circumstances '' of the blaze , QNA said Monday night . It is also investigating complaints that sprinklers and alarms were n't working at the mall when the blaze broke out .

Mall fire : `` Accident waiting to happen ? ''

Christine Wigton , an American living in Doha , told CNN she heard `` a buzzer , not very loud '' as she walked into the mall , but heard no loud alarms as smoke built up inside . Elementary school-age children were eating at some of the restaurants and no one was trying to escape , she said .

`` There were no sprinklers , and there was nothing that would tell somebody that something was wrong , '' she said .

Built in 2006 , the mall advertises itself as `` the newest and the largest entertainment center in Doha . '' The Venice-themed complex features gondola rides down an indoor canal , an artificial sky , a 13-screen movie theater , a theme park , skating rink and a bowling alley .

Qatar 's Interior Minister Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Bin Khalifa Al Thani , said earlier the civil defense office reviews safety standards for commercial buildings before they grant a license .

`` The investigation will clarify all the circumstances of the incident and find out the shortcomings and question those who are responsible in order to tackle the matter in the future , '' he said in remarks carried by QNA .

Several of the dead were from Qatar 's expatriate community .

The mall 's website on Wednesday showed a picture of a black ribbon .

`` We offer our deepest condolences to all the families of the victims and martyrs on duty who lost their lives in the fire , '' the site says . `` May the departed souls rest in peace and may almighty Allah give fortitude to the bereaved families to bear this irreparable loss . ''
