-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Brazil has intensified its efforts to forge closer relations with Africa recently , as the sixth largest economy in the world tries to compete with other emerging giants like China and India to take a more central role in the resource-rich continent .

Last month , Brazil 's top investment bank BTG Pactual unveiled plans to raise $ 1 billion to create the world 's biggest investment fund for Africa , focusing on areas such as infrastructure , energy and agriculture .

The independent bank 's fund , which comes amid a government drive to establish a strategic partnership with Africa , is one of the latest moves signaling Brazil 's increasing interest to extend its economic footprint on the continent -- trade between Brazil and Africa jumped from around $ 4 billion in 2000 to about $ 20 billion in 2010 .

`` It does represent a turning point where a lot of these investors and these entities for investments are recognizing that Africa is indeed the last frontier for growth , '' says Lyal White , director of the Centre for Dynamic Markets at the Gordon Institute for Business Science in South Africa .

Eyeing potential

An unprecedented decade of economic growth in Africa , coupled with a series of policy and institutional reforms , has attracted emerging global powers into the continent , seeking to gain a stronger foothold in the continent in their bid to reach more markets and forge new political alliances .

But while much has been said and written about China 's and India 's strides in Africa , Brazil 's African foray has garnered less attention .

`` Brazil has kind of been operating under the radar , it is not seen necessarily as one of those kind of players -LSB- China and India -RSB- , '' says Markus Weimer , research fellow in the Africa Program at Chatham House . `` The stories of Brazil with Africa have also been less contentious -- you 've heard stories from Zambia about miners being mistreated by their Chinese bosses but you do n't hear from Mozambique or Angola when it comes to Brazilian companies . ''

Using Portuguese-speaking countries like Angola and Mozambique as an entry point to the continent , Brazil 's state and private companies have made big inroads in various parts the continent , operating mostly in strategic sectors such as infrastructure , mining and energy -- last year , mining giant Vale announced plans to spend more than Â £ 12 billion on investments in Africa over the next five years .

But while Brazil , like China , seems to be deeply engaged with the African resource sector , some analysts say its strategy and interests are quite distinct from its resource-hungry BRICS partner .

`` Being a resource-rich country and a future major oil exporter itself , Brazil is not pursuing a strategy to secure resources , '' says Christina Stolte , research at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies .

`` Rather , the South American economy is seeing Africa as a means of diversifying its export markets -- for food , seeds , agricultural machinery -- and internationalizing the production of its big companies -- Petrobras in the oil and biofuels business , Vale in the mining business . ''

Strong ties

Although separated by the Atlantic Ocean , Brazil and Africa have long historical and cultural ties , dating back to the days of slave trade in the 16th century , where scores of Africans where shipped to the former Portuguese colony to be exploited as slaves on the sugar cane plantations .

Today , Brazil is quick to use this cultural affinity with Africa as an advantage in its competition with the other powers acting on the continent , analysts say .

`` The fact that the majority of Brazil 's population is of Afro-Brazilian origin -- making Brazil the world 's largest black population after Nigeria -- is frequently quoted by the , almost exclusively white , governing elite of Brazil in order to stress Brazil 's cultural similarities with the African countries , '' says Stolte .

Such remarks could often be heard during the 2003-2010 presidency of Lula da Silva , who made Africa a strategic priority for Brazil as part of the country 's efforts to expand its global influence .

During his eight-year tenure , Lula made 12 trips to Africa , visiting 21 countries , more than any of his predecessors . At the same time , Brazil increased the number of its embassies in Africa from 17 in 2002 to 37 , boasting today more embassies in the continent than the United Kingdom .

Brazil 's deepening engagement with Africa has also continued under the leadership of Dilma Rousseff , who became president of Brazil in January 2011 -- in her first year in office , Rousseff visited Angola , Mozambique , and South Africa .

Business model

Analysts say Brazil has adopted a three-pronged approach to its engagement with Africa , with an `` almost seamless interaction '' between the government , the private sector and development institutions .

`` This all kind of comes together as one coherent strategy toward Africa from Brazil , '' says White .

Brazilian companies seeking to do business in the continent tend to hire and train local workforce and offer social projects to foster home-grown development -- in Angola , Brazilian construction company Odebrecht has become the largest private employer in the country .

Knowledge transfer

In recent decades , Brazil has gone from being a net importer of food to one of the world 's biggest exporters of agricultural and food products . More recently , Brazil 's per capita income rose an average of 1.8 % faster than its GDP in 2003-09 , according to a World Bank report .

As a result , Brazil 's domestic development experience and success in narrowing social inequality have attracted attention from several African countries who are keen to replicate some of its programs .

Analysts say Brazil is keen to leverage its advanced technological know-how in helping African countries in areas that are key to the continent 's development , including tropical agriculture and disease fighting .

`` Brazil therefore sees itself as partner for African countries that is able to offer successful strategies to fight the continent 's most pending problems such as hunger and AIDS , '' says Stolte .
