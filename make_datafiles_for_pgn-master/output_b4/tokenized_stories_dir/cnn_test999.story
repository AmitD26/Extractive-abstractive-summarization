Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dozens of Chinese workers angry over a pay dispute have held their U.S. boss hostage for five days , the American businessman said .

Chip Starnes , co-founder and president of Specialty Medical Supplies China , has been trapped in the company 's suburban Beijing factory since Friday . He told CNN it 's all because of a misunderstanding about layoffs and severance packages .

`` I tried to leave a day and a half ago , and there was like 60 or 70 of them here inside every entrance , and every exit was barricaded , '' Starnes said Tuesday from behind the gates of the factory . `` I ca n't go anywhere . ''

Starnes was calm but looked haggard , wearing the same blue jeans and a blue shirt that he said he has been wearing since last week .

The incident started when the company laid off about 30 workers in its injection molding division . He said he transferred workers to another division , but some workers did not want to move . So the company gave them severance packages .

Starnes said the problem came when workers who already moved to another division also wanted severance packages .

But workers who spoke to CNN from behind the factory gates gave an entirely different account . Some said they 're owed two months ' worth of back pay and feared everyone at the plant would be laid off , as they claimed no new materials had entered the factory .

Starnes disputed that .

`` There are no outstanding balances . There is no reason to be doing this other than bad information , '' he said . `` The wrong information got out . Things snowballed . I am in the process of trying to fix that , but the demands and the amount of money that it is taking to do that puts the company in a bad situation , so there has got to be some compromise . ''

About four police officers at the scene would not comment on the situation .

U.S. embassy officials in Beijing met with Starnes on Monday and confirmed he is safe and is close to reaching an agreement , spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said . He said the executive has access to attorneys .

Starnes said the employees have n't caused any physical harm but have disrupted his sleep by banging on doors and windows .

He has a cot and is receiving three meals a day , said Les Capella , the U.S president of Specialty Medical Supplies .

Capella said the company has offered protesting employees a lesser severance package if they want to leave . But he said the 80 to 100 employees at odds are demanding about $ 500,000 -- which would bankrupt the company .

CNN 's John Zarrella contributed to this report .
