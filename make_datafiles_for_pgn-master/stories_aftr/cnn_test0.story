Seoul (CNN) -- South Korea's actions toward Pyongyang after the death of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il were intended to show that Seoul does not have animosity toward the North, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea said in a meeting with political leaders Thursday.

Lee told members of the governing and opposition parties that he believed North Korea had probably not expected South Korea to take such measures toward the North.

North Korea delivered the message -- addressed to the chairwoman of Hyundai Group, Hyun Jeong-eun -- through the company's office in the North's Kaesong Industrial Park some 45 kilometers (27 miles) north of Seoul, said Roh Jee-hwan, a Hyundai spokesman.

"The swift stabilization of North Korea's leadership is in the interest of all neighboring countries," Lee said Thursday.

Many observers see the recent moves as efforts by Lee to improve the soured relationship with Pyongyang after tensions flared last year because of the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel and the shelling of an island near Seoul.

Lee's efforts with the North are much less advanced than those of the two previous governments, under which the leaders of the two Koreas held summit talks in Pyongyang, Kwon said, but noted that Lee has made the first step toward improving what had become a tense, cold relationship between the two capitals.

Public opinion in the South is divided on whether it is appropriate to pay respects to Kim.

Critics have called for a more proactive approach by Lee, suggesting that sending condolences to the North Korean people was too indirect.

Some South Koreans argue that now is the time for Seoul to seize an opportunity to make a breakthrough in North and South relations, while others say the idea of paying respects to the dictator is out of the question.

"We don't pay respects in the South to someone who has committed atrocities, why are we even discussing this issue?" an internet user posted on an online message board under the username hwachon11_1.

"I know there's a lot of debate about the issue, but I think we need to see the North as a nation that we want to reunify with" a person using the name brit4men posted on the same message board. "I think it's only appropriate we send a delegation."
