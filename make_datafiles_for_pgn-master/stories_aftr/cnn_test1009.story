So imagine my surprise when, at a recent debate, Texas Gov. Rick Perry turned to Mitt Romney and, with a certain amount of disdain, sniffed, "Mitt has had six years to be working on a plan. I have been in this for about eight weeks." In other words, I'll get back to you.

This time the process is oddly perverse. A large chunk of the Republican party base is looking for a candidate to fill their own belief system: fiscal and social conservative, tough on immigration, tax-cutter, and on and on. They could go with Romney -- and probably will, in the end -- but they're skeptical about his bona fides. They didn't like him last time around, and they're afraid to like him this time.

So they're auditioning. The tea party activists have become the GOP's theatrical directors. Michele Bachmann played well in Philly, but never made it to Broadway. Perry looked right for the part, but blew his lines. And Herman Cain, well, he's very entertaining.

They're looking for the sort of artistic perfection which, as we have all learned, is not necessarily a presidential trait. They like Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan, but he's too unreliable on the abortion issue. They may like Perry's new optional flat tax, but cringe at his more liberal views on immigration that allow the children of illegal immigrants to get in-state tuition in Texas. And what about Bachmann claiming, without any proof, that the HPV vaccine can cause mental retardation? Not exactly a presidential move.

When Perry entered the race as the fave du jour, it wasn't because of his specific ideas, or his specific record, or his specific abilities: It was because the GOP base had a slot to fill, and they thought he was the guy to fill it. He was conservative, after all. Then he appeared on stage, and somehow appeared smaller than the role demanded.

There's a strange whiff here of back-of-the-envelope campaigns. Cain has a tax plan that catapulted him to the lead, then Perry tries out another catchy plan to regain the lead. "It's a gimmick in response to a gimmick," says Vin Weber, a Romney adviser.

So could it be that Romney's problem is that he isn't gimmicky enough for these tryouts? He's got a serious, boring, 59-point (how un-gimmicky is that?) plan for the economy that does not include a silver bullet to fix all. He does not believe there is one.
