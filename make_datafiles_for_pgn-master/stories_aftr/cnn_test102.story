(CNN) -- The tears of joy from a year ago turned to tears of sorrow as Zambia became the first defending champion to be knocked out in the first round of the Africa Cup of Nations in 21 years.

Herve Renard's side was held to a goalless draw by group winners Burkina Faso in Nelspruit, South Africa Tuesday.

"Everybody is sad but my players did their maximum, and I'm very proud of them. It's not the end of the world.

"I loved my team tonight, I can't play with eight defenders. If there is someone who is responsible (for our elimination) then it's me, not my players."

Burkina Faso take giant stride towards knockout stage

Two penalties from Chelsea's Victor Moses set up an intriguing looking quarterfinal between Nigeria and tournament favorite Ivory Coast.

"We believed we could go further in this. It's a night of history for Burkina Faso," coach Paul Putt told reporters.

It got worse for Ethiopia 11 minutes later when goalkeeper Sasay Bancha was sent off for bringing down Moses inside the penalty area.

Moses added a second from 12-yards to spark wild celebrations and seal Nigeria's place in the last eight.

"This is a victory for Nigerians where ever they are in the world," Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi told reporters.
