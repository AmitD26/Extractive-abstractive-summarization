(CNN) -- It was a fable made famous by football -- now Japan's rising tennis star Kei Nishikori is doing his best to dismiss the long-held sporting notion that size does matter.

In 2012 he became the first Japanese man to reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in 80 years and the first Japanese player to win his home nation's most prestigious tournament in its 40-year history.

His 7-6 3-6 6-0 win over the 6'4" Milos Raonic earlier in October was also the first time Nishikori had won a trophy since Delray Beach in 2008.

With the help of veteran Nick Bollettieri -- the coach Nishikori calls the greatest in the history of the game -- and Dante Bottini, the Japanese star currently sits proudly as the 15th best player in the world.

Technique wins out

The "size matters" myth has been ground to dust in other sports in recent years.

It was a theory that held steadfast in soccer until countries like world champions Spain, and Germany, moved away from height and physical strength as a cornerstone of their philosophy, turning to a new generation of more diminutive, technically gifted players.

The most dominant European club side of recent years has been Spanish giants Barcelona, whose players make up the nucleus of an all-conquering Spain team. Among their ranks is Argentina striker Lionel Messi, considered by many to be one of the finest footballers in history, who stands just 5'6" tall.

"Kei is a shot maker," Bollettieri told CNN. "And when he's on, he can beat anybody in the world. Now remember, Kei is not a big guy. So he has to be very careful to take advantage of the opportunities when he gets them.

"If you're small, it's more difficult, no matter what anybody says. If you look at today, probably the height of the guys is 6'2", 6'3", the ladies up at 5'9", 5'10", Sharapova 6'3", Venus 6'2".

"So you take that as fact and you don't throw in the white towel and say 'I can't do it'. What Kei has, he has mobility, he creates and he has unbelievable hands and feet that you can't purchase.

"So he has to keep adding, keep working on any defensive balls, come to the net a little bit more, and this is what Dante is working on. If he stays status quo, he'll win a lot of matches.

Role model

"Basically, in Japan, they're not giants," added Bollettieri. "You look at some of the good players, they're very strong, good ground strokes," he said.

"It gives hope, and you get more people out there playing the game. The more people that play the game increases your chances of having good players, great players, and hopefully some day a champion."

And with time on his side, the hope is that Nishikori could finally end Japan's long wait for a major champion.

'Project 45'

Nishikori's first ATP Tour title at Delray Beach came at the tender age of 18 when he was still outside the top 240 players in the world. It was Japan's first tournament success since Shuzuo Matsuoka won the Seoul Open in 1992.

It also served as justification for his family's decision to send him to Bollettieri's academy as a 13-year-old, even though he spoke not a word of English.

His Delray Beach triumph gave rise to what became known as 'Project 45' in Japan.

Positively Orwellian in title, it was actually Nishikori's mission to overhaul Matsuoka's career best ranking of 46 -- the highest any Japanese player has ever reached.

Nishikori broke through that particular barrier at last year's Shanghai Masters and now has his sights set on the top 10. Should he do that, Nishikori might have to increase his wardrobe of disguises, to avoid being mobbed on home soil.
