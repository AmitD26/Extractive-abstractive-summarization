Nadal was as relentless as ever on his favorite surface and needed only one hour 32 minutes to complete victory.

"This has been an important week for me. To win here again is a great joy after everything I've been through," Nadal told the crowd after his victory.

"It was a fantastic match for me."

Since returning to the ATP Tour following a seven-month injury layoff, he has reached the final in all six of the tournaments he has entered and won four of them, the first man to reach that mark this season.

World No.1 Novak Djokovic denied Nadal a ninth straight title in Monte Carlo but sat out the Barcelona event.

The pair are set to lock horns again at the Madrid Masters which starts next weekend as the build-up continues to next month's French Open where Nadal will be defending his crown.

The Czech beat Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-3 6-2 in the Bucharest final and dedicated his victory to his father, who sadly passed away 10 days ago.
