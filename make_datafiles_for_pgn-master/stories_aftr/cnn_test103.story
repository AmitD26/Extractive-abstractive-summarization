Same-sex partners who sign a military "Declaration of Domestic Partnership" form will be eligible for several benefits, including military identification cards as dependents.

This would allow them unescorted status on bases, access to commissaries, and the right to visit their partners in military hospitals.

They will also be able to receive many survivor benefits, including life insurance payments.

The changes are expected to go into affect no later than October 1, 2013.

The move had been expected for weeks and is widely seen as part of Panetta's effort to finish as much as he can in extending benefits to gays and lesbians before leaving the Pentagon.

"One of the legal limitations to providing all benefits at this time is the Defense of Marriage Act, which is still the law of the land. There are certain benefits that can only be provided to spouses as defined by that law, which is now being reviewed by the United States Supreme Court," Panetta said in a statement.

Out -- but not in

The Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage as that between a man and a woman. Federal courts have ruled it unconstitutional and the Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal.

Pentagon officials briefing reporters on the change also said the agency did not extend housing benefits to same sex-couples.
