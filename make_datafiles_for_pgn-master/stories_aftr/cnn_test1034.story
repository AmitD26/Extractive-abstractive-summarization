Officials have lowered the death toll, from 106, since Tuesday. "We found some body parts, which we have decided not to count as a whole for now," said Musa Ecweru, the minister for disaster preparedness.

"It's impossible to take bulldozers and any heavy equipment to the site. The earth is very delicate and heavy machinery may cause more landslides," Ntabadde said. The terrain also is inaccessible by road, Ecweru said.

The area is so steep that evacuees are walking about 6 miles (10 kilometers) to nearby camps. The Red Cross, United Nations and World Food Program are helping provide food, water and other essentials, such as blankets, to the displaced, officials said.

The chances of finding survivors were fading as heavy rain pounded the area, leaving rescuers focusing on recovery efforts, the Red Cross spokeswoman said.

"We have not found anyone alive today," Ntabadde said. "We don't expect to find any more people alive." Most of the bodies were recovered from a hospital engulfed by the landslide after residents sought shelter, officials said.

"The villages of Nametsi, Namakansa and Kubewo in Nametsi parish have been wiped out," Ntabadde said.

The neighboring village of Bamuyaka in Bubita Sub County also has been affected. Flooding also has destroyed roads and washed away bridges in at least seven districts. The landslide occurred near Mount Elgon, on the Kenya-Uganda border.
