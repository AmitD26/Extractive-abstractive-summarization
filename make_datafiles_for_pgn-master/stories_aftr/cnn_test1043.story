(EW.com) -- Things haven't been going great for Paula Deen the last few days: She's been dropped from the Food Network, QVC is "reviewing the relationship," and her biggest defenders so far have been her sons â€” and their examples left a lot to be desired.

Rice first posed the question to her readers by saying: "What's happening with Paula Dean? Is it fair? I never heard of her until today, and wow, this looks like a crucifixion. Opinions, thoughts welcome....aren't we becoming something of a lynch mob culture?"

No evidence, of course, except Deen's own sworn deposition about the offense level of jokes. "I can't, myself, determine what offends another person," Deen said before going on to explain how she wanted to hire "all black waiters for her brother's 2007 wedding."

Rice continued her defense in the court of public opinion, via Facebook: "It's so easy to persecute an older, overweight, unwise, crude, ignorant woman who may very well be a good person at heart who has achieved a great deal in her life. So easy to vilify her and hate her and try to destroy her life. Woe to anyone today who is not slender, young, clever and politically correct."
