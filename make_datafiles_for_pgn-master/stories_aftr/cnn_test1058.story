(CNN) -- When I started the Fit Nation program, I was a big guy. Seven months later, I'm still a big guy.

I've learned that being healthy is ultimately about being honest with myself. It's about being honest about what I can accomplish and what I can expect to accomplish in the short- and long-term. I think I would be doing myself and my health a disservice if I accepted the premise that I could be fat and fit, or at least as fit as I want to and can be.

While I'm healthier now that I was at the beginning of the year, I still have improvements to make and fitness to gain. I hope to continue making gains for the rest of my life.

Good health: The best birthday present

We all joined this program for different reasons, but the one thing that united us is that we wanted to take steps toward better health through a more active lifestyle, for ourselves and for the people we love.

The one thing that Fit Nation has taught me is that I now know where I want to go, and I feel like I'm better prepared mentally and physically to get there.

Setting goals is really pretty simple, when you think about it. A goal is something for which you're willing to work. And you get what you want by planning and putting that plan into action. I have more goals to set and more success to achieve.

Training for a tri: What I wish I'd known

The only true measure of my accomplishments is to compare myself to how far I've come and to see how much farther I have to go. Most importantly, I've come to understand that fitness is a journey and not a destination.
