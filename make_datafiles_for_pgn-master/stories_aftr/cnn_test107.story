Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people have fled fighting between Thailand and Cambodia over the past week, 30 people have been injured, and five Thai soldiers have been killed, the Thai Ministry of Public Health said Tuesday.

About 27,000 people are living in 33 temporary shelters in Thailand, the ministry said.

Clashes between the two sides began last Friday, with each country accusing the other of trying to seize two ancient temples.

There were no new casualties from the incident, which he said resulted from a misunderstanding stemming from a routine Air Force exercise.

Both sides claim the disputed temples are in their country. Thailand calls them Ta Kwai and Ta Muen, while Cambodia calls them Ta Krabey and Ta Moan. Much of the border between the two countries remains in dispute.

The U.S. government is speaking directly to Thai and Cambodian officials, and also supports efforts by Indonesia, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to work with both countries on a resolution, Clinton's statement said.

Cambodia said Monday that Thai warplanes had entered its airspace and that the Thai military had shelled populated Cambodian territory. Cambodia's government has said three of its troops have been killed in the fighting.

On Sunday, Sansern accused Cambodian troops of opening fire first and said Thai troops responded to protect their country's sovereignty.

CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.
