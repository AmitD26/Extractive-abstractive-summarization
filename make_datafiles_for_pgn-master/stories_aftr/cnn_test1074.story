"NFL. Just so you know."

About 3:25 a.m. -- two minutes after the message went out -- gunshots shattered the quiet night in a southeastern Massachusetts industrial park, according to witnesses.

Not five minutes passed before a surveillance camera at his North Attleborough home captured video of Hernandez carrying what appears to be a gun, prosecutors said. Lloyd lay dead about a mile away.

Let go by the Patriots, Hernandez will step into a courtroom for the sixth time since his June 26 arrest.

He's expected to formally plead not guilty to first-degree murder in the death of Lloyd, a 27-year-old semipro football player.

"He's bearing up under the pressure," defense attorney Michael Fee said when Hernandez was indicted last month. "He understands what's in front of him, and he's committed to clearing his name."

Investigation continues in another case

Friday's arraignment comes as authorities continue to investigate Hernandez in connection with an unsolved 2012 double homicide case in Boston.

Boston police have said the men were inside a BMW sprayed with gunfire after they left the nightclub.

After Lloyd's murder, Bristol, Connecticut police discovered the vehicle by accident while searching the garage of Hernandez's uncle, a law enforcement source told CNN.

Boston police had been looking for the vehicle for almost a year, law enforcement sources added.

Hernandez has not been charged in the unsolved double shooting.

His attorneys have previously declined to comment to CNN when asked about the ongoing Boston investigation.

A Bristol County, Massachusetts, grand jury last month indicted Hernandez on a first-degree murder and five weapons charges.

Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated the shooting of his friend Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee.

Fee said he was pleased with the indictment because it gave his client "a path to trial," and that a jury will find Hernandez "innocent."

Police have not located the gun believed to have been used in the Lloyd killing.

But prosecutors say Hernandez returned a rental car with a bullet casing that allegedly matched bullets found at the scene.

"I know there is a reason I'm going thru this and I will figure it out through my relationship with the Lord," Hernandez wrote.
