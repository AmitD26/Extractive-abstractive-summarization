LONDON, England (CNN) -- The daughter of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been axed by a BBC television show after she made an offensive "off-air" remark, the corporation has confirmed.

According to reports in the British media, Carol Thatcher referred to a tennis player as a "golliwog" back stage during the filming of The One Show last Thursday.

The remark was made about a male tennis player taking part in the Australian Open tournament in Melbourne.

The term is an offensive word for black people used in several countries.

She was immediately challenged about her gaffe but dismissed it as a "joke."

The Golliwog first appeared as a character in an 1895 book, "The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls," described by author Florence Kate Upton as "a horrid sight, the blackest gnome."

Based on a black minstrel doll Upton played with as a child, the character inspired early 20th-Century dolls by several manufacturers and was used as the trademark of James Robertson & Sons, a British jam and preserve maker, in the early 1900s.

The term "wog" became a widely used racial slur for dark-skinned people that grew in popularity among some Britons during World War II.

As late as the 1960s, soldiers in Great Britain's Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders military regiment wore a brooch of one of the Robertson characters for each Arab they killed, according to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan.

The term "golliwog" is used as racial slur in Germany, England, Ireland, Greece and Australia, according to the museum's Web site.
