(CNN) -- A Florida university has stopped all band performances amid an investigation into the death of a student over the weekend that authorities say is linked to hazing.

Robert Champion, a 26-year-old drum major with Florida A&M University's marching band, became ill and died Saturday night after a game, the Orange County, Florida, Sheriff's Office said.

"Any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third degree felony," he said. "Anyone who participates in such events can be criminally charged."

Ammons vowed to convene a task force "to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the Marching 100."

"The purpose of this review is not to establish culpability of individual band members in this particular case, but rather to determine whether there are patterns of behavior by the band -- or members of it -- that should be addressed at the institutional level.," he said.

Asked whether it is accurate that at least 30 band members were let go this semester because of possible involvement in hazing, he said, "That is true."

CNN's calls to the university for further information were not immediately returned.

In his statement, Ammons warned students: "There will be no retaliation against anyone who cooperates with the investigation, but there will be serious consequences for anyone who tries to impede it."

After a game Saturday, the band returned to its hotel, where "the victim reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe," the sheriff's office said in a release. "Friends of the victim called 911 and administered CPR. The victim was transported to Doctor Phillips Hospital, where he was pronounced deceased."

A music major from Atlanta, Champion was one of six drum majors for the 375-member Marching 100 band, the school said.

A memorial service was scheduled for Tuesday evening.

FAMU takes pride in the Marching 100. The band has been credited for "not less than 30 innovative techniques which have become standard operating procedures for many high school and collegiate marching band programs throughout the nation," according to its official website. The band dates back to 1892.

The Marching 100's motto lays out "qualities to live by," including "highest quality of character" and "dedication to service."
