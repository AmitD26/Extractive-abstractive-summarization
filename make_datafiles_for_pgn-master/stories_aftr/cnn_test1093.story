Kentucky is the first race of the U.S. Triple Crown series -- followed by the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.

History repeats?

If Krigger's prediction is right, he'll be the first black jockey to win the premier race since Jimmy Winkfield took the trophy back-to-back in 1901 and 1902.

Much like the NBA today, black athletes dominated horse racing for the next three decades, winning 15 of the first 28 Derbies.

"They were the premier horsemen in the world," says Joe Drape, author of "Black Maestro," which tells the story of champion jockey Winkfield.

"It was the first professional sport for black athletes in America. They were at the forefront of horse racing and it was a place where they could earn a good living."

But the rise of Jim Crow laws in the late 1880s -- segregating blacks and whites -- spelled an end to the golden era of jockeys like Winkfield.

"If someone is going to be the first African American in 111 years to do it, then why not me?" he said.

Childhood dreams

The same thought ran through Krigger's mind as a youngster watching the Derby on TV, from his home on the island of St Croix.

At 10-years-old he was given his first mare, challenging other children to races on the beach and down dirt roads.

Horse-mad Krigger would even balance his saddle on the arm of the sofa and pretend to ride it.

At 17, he headed to the U.S. to follow that dream, competing across the country with some success, though failing to crack into the top-ranked competitions.

His time would come a decade later. In 2011 Krigger finally found his stride, winning 124 races and notching up $2.8 million in prize money.

The racing world took notice -- Krigger got a call from famous Los Angeles agent Tom Knust with an offer to compete at some of the top southern California circuits.

He needn't have asked twice. Krigger packed up his family of four children and long-term girlfriend, and moved them from Seattle to a hotel, and then a trailer, before settling into a rented house.

He came under the tutelage of reigning Kentucky Derby winning trainer, Doug O'Neil, with a chance to ride the horse of his dreams -- Goldencents.

It's little wonder Krigger is feeling confident about this Saturday's derby -- the pair has won four of their six races together.

Expectation and dedication

Since winning the Santa Anita Derby last month -- the first black jockey in the 78-year history of the race to do so -- hype has been building around the possibility Krigger could make a repeat performance at Kentucky.

"I don't think my win is a win for African American jockeys -- every one of us has to earn the respect of our trainers," Krigger said.

"The next black jockey isn't going to ride in the Kentucky Derby because of me -- it's going to be down to them."
