That's right -- $0.

It's almost unbelievable when you know the statistics -- that one in six U.S. children are obese, that nearly one-third are overweight, and that these rates are even higher for Hispanic children (of whom Miami has a high population).

But Greenberg doesn't despair. "I've been in my position since 1995 -- I've never had a budget," she says. "It's always been up to me to find my own money."

Miami-Dade County Public Schools is one of nine regional finalists in the Active Schools Acceleration Project's first annual Innovation Competition. ASAP is an initiative started by ChildObesity180.org, an organization dedicated to reversing the trend in childhood obesity.

"We know there's so much good work going to get our kids up and moving every single day all across this country," first lady Michelle Obama says in the competition's introduction video. "So we want to find the most effective ways that people are increasing physical activity for kids, and then help those ideas grow to scale so that they can help even more children."

More than 30 judges evaluated the hundreds of applications.

Nine regional finalists were announced Tuesday; each will receive $25,000 to invest in physical activity programs. Two national winners will be announced in Washington on June 13. They will be given $100,000 and ChildObesity180 will work to expand their programs across the country.

In Miami, only one semester of physical education is required for high school students, and middle school students can have a parent waive the regular class. That means a child could go from fifth grade to 12th grade without ever working up a sweat.

Greenberg's solution was Fit-Tech Wellness Labs. With grant money, she converted classrooms in her local high schools into minigyms. These labs contain traverse climbing walls, gaming stationary bikes and virtual group fitness instructors.

"That's this generation's world," she says. "I knew that to engage students in becoming more physically active I had to incorporate that technology."

"In primary school we teach kids how to read and we teach kids how to write. We also have to teach kids how to move," he says. "If we expose children to these environments that are rich in opportunities to be physically active, they're going to be more physically active as adults."

Faigenbaum rated highly the programs that incorporated movement into minibreaks throughout the school day. "Many people look at this from the neck down, and they look at all the physical benefits. But when we're talking about kids in school, we also have to look at the neck up. Kids who are engaged in physical activity are better learners."

"We had a much greater buy-in (from teachers) because it fits with what they already have to do," says Andrea Brekke, the Healthy Schools, Healthy Families program manager.

Often, childhood obesity is attributed to a "toxic environment," filled with endless hours of computer use and video game playing.

"Technology (ideas) ... change the social environment by incorporating the notion of getting physical activity throughout the day," says Dorn. "They change the environment by changing the culture and the way of thinking."
