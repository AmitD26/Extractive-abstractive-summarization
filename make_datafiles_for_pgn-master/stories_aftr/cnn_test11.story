(CNN) -- Pollsters in Peru said Sunday that left-leaning Ollanta Humala looks poised to win the presidency, defeating rival Keiko Fujimori in a polarizing runoff election that pits the county's left and right against each other.

Pollster CPI showed Humala with 52.5% of the vote and Fujimori with 47.5%. Ipsos Apoyo said Humala would win 52.6% of the ballots cast, while Fujimori would trail with 47.4%.

A watchdog election group later released a quick count of ballots, showing Humala would win with 51.5% of the vote, vs. Fujimori's 48.5%.

Official results are not expected until later Sunday.

Still, supporters of Humala celebrated in downtown Lima, cheering the early results, waving flags and hoisting banners. One read: "Ollanta, Presidente."

Peruvians went to the polls Sunday to pick their next president in a runoff election between two candidates with little in common.

"There are recordings and witnesses that prove that this gentleman is a good soldier of Chavez," she said to cheering crowds. "I am not going to allow other countries to interfere in the sovereignty of our country. I'm going to defend it!"

In a recent interview with CNN en Espanol, he denied his goal is a Chavez-style social revolution in Peru.

Like her opponent, Fujimori was forced to answer uncomfortable questions about her past during this year's election. She is the daughter of former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who is currently in prison on a 25-year sentence for human rights crimes.

Many Peruvians credit the elder Fujimori with defeating insurgencies that ravaged the South American nation for years and for enacting economic reforms that stabilized the Peruvian economy. However, he is also criticized for corruption, having an authoritarian streak and the widespread rights abuses that were committed under his watch.

She has since backed away from those remarks.

In that round, Humala garnered more than 30% of the vote, while Fujimori ended slightly above 23%. Under Peruvian law, only the top two contenders advance to a second round.

Peruvians are required by law to vote and some 20 million people were thought to have cast their ballots in Sunday's election.

The new president will face many of the same challenges Garcia did: Persistent poverty, protests around the rights to natural resources and violence from remnants of a leftist insurgency that helped to make Peru the world's largest producer of coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine.

On the eve of the election, five soldiers were killed in an attack in the country's southern province of Cusco, state news said. They were reportedly on their way to provide local police with additional security for the election when they were ambushed.
