Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Throughout the 1990s, SÃ£o Paulo's House of Detention contained about 8,000 of Latin America's most violent criminals. Better known as Carandiru, it was once the largest prison on the continent. On October 2, 1992, a massive fight broke out in the Brazilian complex among the prisoners. It ultimately resulted in 111 inmate deaths.

After the jail's destruction, Mazotto de Lima transferred to a minimum-security prison in Serra Azul. He brought more than his experience to the new job.

He also took along some of the only surviving evidence of the massacre: More than 2,000 photos, 300 personal effects and 10 hours of grisly video footage.

It was all taken shortly after the violence subsided, and he wants to be sure that history doesn't forget what he witnessed. So we asked him to help us understand.
