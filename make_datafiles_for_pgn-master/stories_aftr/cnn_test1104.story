(CNN) -- Seen the ball drop in New York's Times Square?

Byron Bay, Australia

Good times apparently await those who have prepared in advance.

Goa, India

Goan celebrations kick off on December 27 with the three-day Sunburn music festival -- headliners include Pete Tong, Markus Schultz and Afrojak, among other DJs.

Parties on New Year's Eve range from masquerade balls to beach raves.

If you don't mind crowds, Anjuna Beach has dance performances, Goan folk music and plenty of feni (a local liquor), while the sunset party at Querim Beach's nightclub Kitty Su takes things outdoors with some of the country's top music acts on the sand.

At the Hill Top event, near Vagator Beach, a globetrotting roster of trance musicians will entertain revelers well into New Year's Day.

Prague, Czech Republic

The official show explodes over the Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square at midnight; the best vantage points are from the Charles Bridge, Petřín Hill and near Prague Castle.

Vltava River cruises are free from crowds and provide Czech beer and live jazz.

January 1 is particularly poignant to Prague locals as it marks the day the Czech Republic was created after the breakup of Czechoslovakia in 1993.

A special fireworks display will be held at Letná Park on the day, kicking off at 6 p.m. to ensure that families with young children can attend.

Harbin, China

New Year's Eve festivities don't get much cooler than those held in the northern Chinese city of Harbin.

Not far from the Russian border, the city gets temperatures well below freezing in winter, perfect for the annual Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival.

Celebrating 30 years, the festival sees larger-than-life ice sculptures crafted around town, lit either by lasers or with traditional lanterns.

Niagara Falls, Canada

Billed as Canada's largest free New Year's Eve extravaganza, the December 31 concert at Queen Victoria Park in Niagara Falls is expected to draw more than 40,000 people.

The party includes food stalls, entertainers and two fireworks displays, at 8.45 p.m. and midnight.

December 31 sees crowds converge on 10 bonfires lit around Iceland's capital before revelers make their way to Hallgrimskirkja church, a dramatic 73-meter-high building designed to resemble the country's lava flows.

Fireworks are sold throughout the city, which means that explosions can be heard from the moment the sky darkens.

The festival of lights can often continue on New Year's Day when tourists head off in search of the aurora borealis.

Cruise ship, Various

If you can't decide on one destination, a cruise offers a roster of ports.

All cruise lines ring in the New Year with pomp and ceremony, but a few go the extra mile.

Crystal Cruises hosts a balloon drop in the atrium of its two ships, followed by a ship-wide countdown at midnight, with champagne. On New Year's Day, celebrations continue with a boozy brunch.

On December 31, Crystal Symphony will be docked in Sydney Harbour, under the bridge, so you're guaranteed a dazzling introduction to 2014.

Norwegian Cruise Line ships will have fireworks and a captain's countdown from the bridge. "The Pride of America" is scheduled to arrive next to Hawaii's volcanoes on the first day of 2014.

Oceania Cruises

The Canadian winter sports resort town is hosting a Youth Dance and NYE kids' countdown in Millennium Place, with fire spinners, dancers, circus entertainers, live music and a giant bubble wrap stomp and balloon drop at 9 p.m.

At the Fire and Ice Show, Whistler's best skiers and riders jump through blazing rings of fire as guests dance into the New Year.

A dazzling display of lights and sounds will ring in the new year.

Walt Disney World, Florida

Epcot will have shows at 6:30 p.m. and 11:40 p.m., plus DJs throughout the evening at the Future World Fountain Stage. Hollywood Studios will showcase fireworks and special effects at midnight with the theme "Mulch, Sweat and Shears" -- a series of four concerts.

Chiang Mai, Thailand

Locals and visitors gather on Thapae Road (closed to traffic from dusk) around the Thapae Gate, where food stalls line the street and musicians and dancers entertain.

Even before the sun disappears, paper lanterns are released into the sky.

Things are more subdued, but equally illuminating, at the city's Buddhist temples.

At Ping River, visitors can also watch floating lanterns being released onto the waterway.
