Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- The judge in the libel case of Amanda Knox's parents resigned Monday because he was involved in the trial of Knox and her ex-boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito in the killing of a British student.

Knox won a legal victory last week when key DNA evidence from her murder trial was called into question.

"There is no conclusive scientific evidence regarding the nature of the blood," the report states. "It cannot be excluded that the result obtained from sampling the find B (knife blade) could be the result of contamination" occurring at any stage of the testing process.

Mellas on Monday hailed the DNA findings as "great news," saying Amanda Knox was "thrilled."

The forensic report gave Knox "a little bit more hope that this is all going to turn out the way it should. I mean, as an innocent person it's really hard for her," her mother said.

Knox's lawyer Luciano Ghirga said the conclusions of the report "are clear to everyone -- there is a probability of contamination" of the evidence.

In a 2009 interview in the Sunday Times of London, the couple said their daughter "had not been given an interpreter, had not received food and water, and had been physically and verbally abused" by police after her arrest for the murder of the exchange student, according to Italy's ANSA news agency.

Kercher, 21, was found dead in November 2007, semi-naked with her throat slashed. Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of the murder.

Sollecito is serving a 25-year sentence. A third person, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, was tried separately and is serving a 16-year prison sentence.

CNN's Drew Griffin, Ashley Hayes, Todd Schwarzschild and journalist Barbie Nadeau contributed to this report.
