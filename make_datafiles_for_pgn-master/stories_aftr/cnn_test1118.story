This is now quoted widely in nuclear industry circles as a textbook case of "radiophobia." We are hard-wired, it seems, to react with fear to what we don't understand. It's what we all learn as children: remember the story of Chicken Little? The sky is falling.

"When we talk about radiophobia, people hear that word 'radiation' and immediately imagine the worst -- we're all going to die and turn into the Toxic Avenger and start mutating," he says.

The images from the Fukushima nuclear emergency have not helped ease fears. Pictures of a ruined power plant, smoke billowing into the sky after explosions and fires and talk of a potential meltdown have sparked panic. Too many people watching television images, fire-trucks and choppers dumping water on the reactors, smacked of last-ditch desperation.

The Japanese government has struggled with communication. Critics say it is often too little, too late. There's a worrying lack of detail.

Officials in Japan may have consistently told people that radiation levels pose no risk to health, but few here are willing to bet their life on that.

"The company is hiding information. They are lying about it; they're not disclosing the risk," he says.

So what are the available facts as they stand right now? Take a comparison with Chernobyl.

According to the World Nuclear Association, you need exposure to 1,000 millisieverts per hour before suffering radiation sickness.

Even for the heroic workers still in the plant, prolonged exposure, says Polanski, could make them sick, but it will not kill them.

"No, not at all. Four hundred millisieverts sounds scary, but it's not," he says.

A caveat: this emergency is in uncharted territory, it could always take a turn for the worse. After a week of trying everything and resorting to dropping water from helicopters, several reactors are still overheating.

In fact, Japan's nuclear safety agency has now raised the crisis to level 5 on the nuclear event scale. That's the same rating as the partial meltdown of the nuclear plant at Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979.
