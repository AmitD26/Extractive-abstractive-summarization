Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's death instantly changed the lives of his family and friends. The weeks immediately after the pop icon died were chaotic, and many questions are still unanswered for those closest to Jackson.

The home is filled with memories of their father, including many photos of a young Michael Jackson. The theater room of the large house was converted into a classroom where they've been home-schooled for the past year.

The grassy yard of the Encino estate is often filled with Michael's kids playing ball with four cousins -- the sons of Jackson brothers Jermaine and Randy -- who have lived there the past year with their mother.

They share a computer with internet access, which resulted in fans getting a rare and candid look at Blanket's dancing, acting and light saber skills when several videos were uploaded to YouTube in April.

Paris made the world cry at the end of a memorial for her father when she said, "Ever since I was born, daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine."

Paris and her older brother took the stage at the 2010 Grammy Awards to accept their father's lifetime achievement award.

"To all his songs, his message was simple, love," Prince Michael said. "We will continue to spread his message and help the world."

Michael's mother

Katherine Jackson's main focus since her son's death has been caring for his three children. A Los Angeles judge immediately gave her temporary custody, which became permanent after Debbie Rowe, the mother of the two oldest children, agreed not to challenge her.

Katherine Jackson and her husband have attended every hearing in the criminal case against Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in their son's death.

She has only recently begun speaking publicly about her son's death, giving a handful of media interviews. Katherine Jackson also posted a YouTube video this month announcing her support for a tribute to Michael Jackson to be held June 26 in Beverly Hills, California.

Michael's father

"Never. Never have. And I -- and I raised him just like you would raise your kids, you know? But harm Michael, for what? I have no reason. That's my son. I loved him and I still love him," Jackson told CNN's "Larry King Live" in August.

Jackson, not mentioned in his son's 2002 will, has an ongoing legal challenge against the men named as executors in the document. The probate judge has ruled against him, but it is under appeal.

Michael's siblings

Michael Jackson's five brothers and three sisters have, at times, come together as a family since his death. But, as with many large families, they each follow their own paths.

Brothers Jackie, Jermaine, Tito and Marlon appeared together on an A&E Network reality show last fall that followed their attempt to record and perform again as a musical group. The series ended after six episodes with no new songs and no public performances. Brother Randy chose not to take part in the show.

Jermaine Jackson has been the most visible publicly, traveling around the world to promote his own projects and Michael Jackson's legacy. He recently performed a tribute concert to his brother in Gambia.

Sister Janet has stayed busy with her acting and music career, which included roles in two Tyler Perry movies in the past year.

Michael's ex-wife

Debbie Rowe is a former nurse who married Michael Jackson in 1996, gave birth to his two oldest children and then agreed to a divorce settlement in 1999. Prince Michael and Paris remained with their father.

Michael's doctors

Murray lost his only patient when Jackson died a year ago. It was several months before Murray resumed his medical practices in Houston, Texas, and Las Vegas, Nevada.

Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death in February. The judge refused to suspend his California medical license, although Murray cannot personally administer anesthesia on patients. The maximum sentence if convicted is four years in prison.

Dr. Arnold Klein, Jackson's dermatologist and longtime friend, was never criminally implicated in Jackson's death, although drug agents did subpoena medical records from his office.

Klein hinted in an interview that he may have been a sperm donor for Jackson's children. His lawyer unsuccessfully appeared at a probate hearing last summer to seek a role for Klein in the children's lives.

Michael's money

When Jackson died, he was nearly $500 million in debt, according to a source familiar with his estate who is not authorized to speak about financial matters. In the year since, the debt has been reduced to about $300 million, the source said. The remaining debt is "very manageable" considering the income flowing into the estate, the source said.

The estate also has a steady flow of cash from the rights to 250 Beatles songs that Jackson shares with Sony.
