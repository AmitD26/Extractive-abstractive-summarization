KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Babies lie side by side in warming beds or sprawled on blankets atop crude wooden tables.

Many families at Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, seem resigned to the situation.

Children with wounds and broken bones are carried in by their parents to wait on stiff plastic chairs.

Outside, coughing youngsters squat on the pavement with their anxious families, waiting for care.

And everywhere, parents clutch plastic bags containing bring-your-own medicines and supplies.

For though they are all awaiting treatment at Afghanistan's only specialist pediatric hospital, the hospital cannot even afford bandages for its patients.

The United Nations says that more than $15 billion in aid has been sent to Afghanistan since the U.S.-led coalition overthrew the Taliban in late 2001. But still, the hospital cannot afford to help the hundreds of children who stream in every day, desperate for care and cures.

Doctors say they have to double up premature babies in incubators. And some of those incubators are compromised. On a recent day, a plastic surgical mask taped onto one machine was the only shield from infection.  Watch scenes from inside the hospital Â»

The U.S. Agency for International Development says infant mortality has dropped by 22 percent since the overthrow of the Taliban but acknowledges that the health status for Afghans is among the worst in the world.

One in every five Afghan children will die before their 5th birthday, often of a preventable disease, according to the Save the Children aid agency.

At the end of 2001, there were hopes that the hospital would be upgraded, but it is still waiting. It needs some acute care of its own, or it will continue to struggle to help the children who arrive at its door pleading for care.
