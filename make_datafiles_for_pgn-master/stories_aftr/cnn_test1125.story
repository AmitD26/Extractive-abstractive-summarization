(CNN) -- A Harvard University student was named Tuesday in a criminal complaint alleging he was responsible for bomb threats that led school officials to delay some final exams, including his, that had been scheduled for Monday.

Eldo Kim, 20, of Cambridge, allegedly e-mailed bomb threats at about 8:30 a.m. Monday to offices associated with Harvard, including the Harvard University Police Department and the Harvard Crimson, the student-run daily newspaper, according to the five-page complaint.

The subject line in each of the messages read "bombs placed around campus" and cited "shrapnel bombs" in four buildings on the school's main campus in Cambridge.

Shortly before 3 p.m., long after Kim's exam had been canceled for the day, officials concluded that the threats were a hoax and reopened the buildings.

The e-mail messages had been sent through a service called Guerrilla Mail, which creates temporary and anonymous e-mail messages, according to the complaint. And the person had used a product called TOR, which assigns an anonymous Internet Protocol address that can be used to hide the identity of the sender, it added.

The Crimson identified Kim as a sophomore.

An FBI agent and an officer with the Harvard University Police Department interviewed Kim Monday night at his campus residence, where he "stated that he authored the bomb threat e-mails" and said he had acted alone, the complaint says.

"According to Kim, he was motivated by a desire to avoid a final exam scheduled to be held on (Monday)," the complaint said. He is to appear Wednesday in U.S. District Court before District of Massachusetts Chief Judge Judith G. Dein.

If convicted, the student could face a maximum of five years in prison, three years of suspended release, and a $250,000 fine.
