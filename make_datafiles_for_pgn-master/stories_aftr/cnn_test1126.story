(CNN) -- A free Lamborghini in Miami, Florida.

Brazos, a new luxury condo development in Austin, Texas, will auction off its rooms at deep discounts in May.

And bargain hunters were jazzed to pay, on average, $600,000 for a unit at the auction.

"Developers will bend over backwards to sell these units," said Brad Hunter, chief economist at Metrostudy. "There is no limit on the number of ways they will work with someone to sell at this point."

Condominium sales continue to sag amid soft demand from buyers. Metrostudy reported that sales prices nationwide have dropped from a massive and unsustainable pace that reached a crescendo in 2006.

The situation has only worsened with the  economic downturn, Hunter said. Buyers are tightening their wallets and demanding lower prices. Recovery isn't expected for several more years in some markets, the firm says.

Even more troublesome, thousands of new units are entering saturated condo markets such as Miami, Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona. Much of the financing from the projects came before the condo market collapse, experts say.

Meanwhile, the value of existing condominiums is falling. The National Association of Realtors found that the prices for existing condos has dropped nearly 16 percent since 2006. The small number of recent sales probably were brought on by the deep discounts, said Walter Molony, spokesman for the group.

"The condo market is starting to improve, but you still have a long way to go," Molony said.

Other prospective buyers are having trouble obtaining loans to make down payments in a tight credit market, housing experts say. This month, Fannie Mae implemented additional fees on condominium loans regardless of applicants' credit scores. Some private mortgage lenders are also refusing to give loans to buyers for condos that are empty or have delinquent owners.

In some condo markets, marketing teases are still popular. While they may not make the sale, they spark interest, sellers say.

High-end shoppers will find luxury properties like the South of Fifth development in South Beach, Florida, which offered a free Lamborghini worth $260,000 when buyers purchased one of the multimillion-dollar properties, said Sildy Cervera, who managed the sales.

In recent months, auctioning has become a popular way for developers to liquidate their properties.

Next month in Austin, Texas, Kennedy Wilson, a California company that handles auctions nationally, will auction units at the Brazos, a sophisticated development with prices previously at $200,000 to $1.6 million. Instead, the starting bid prices will range from $80,000 to $600,000.

Kennedy Wilson President Rhett Winchell said he has received four times as many inquiries for auctions in the last year, compared with the previous year. "We can sell out 30 to 50 properties at one single event," he said.

Last month in Atlanta, sellers auctioned off The Horizon at Wildwood, where sleek contemporary condos originally priced at $375,000 went for $200,000. In Atlanta, only 645 units units sold, leaving more than 6,000 units unsold in 2008, according to Haddow & Company, a real estate consulting firm.

"I got a fine deal," said Drake, who is currently painting the walls before he and his wife move in next month. "I am really pleased."
