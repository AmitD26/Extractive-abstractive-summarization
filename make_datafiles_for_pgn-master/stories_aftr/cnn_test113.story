New York City (CNN) -- A suspect in a weekend hit-and-run crash that killed a Brooklyn couple and their unborn child pleaded not guilty to criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident, his lawyer said.

"The overreaction everyone has taken in this case frightens him and he's ready to deal with it," Brettschneider said. "It was an accident. It's a tragedy, but an accident."

Raizy Glauber was pregnant, and the couple's boy was delivered by cesarean, but died the next day, police said.

Acevedo ran away from the scene, police said, and it wasn't immediately clear how investigators identified him as the suspect.

He was arrested after a friend helped facilitate his surrender in the crowded parking lot of a convenience store in Bethlehem, New York, according to Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne.

During Thursday morning's hearing, he said he is unemployed and living with his mother in Brooklyn, Judge Kelly Banach said.

His next court appearance is scheduled for Wednesday.
