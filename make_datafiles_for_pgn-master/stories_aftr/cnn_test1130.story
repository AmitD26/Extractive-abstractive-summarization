(CNN) -- With the passing of Steve Jobs earlier this month, the tech industry lost one of its most revered icons. So where will the industry turn for inspiration now that Jobs is gone?

But there's one tech leader who just might fit the bill: Amazon's Jeff Bezos.

Steve Jobs took Apple on a detour from personal computers into music with the iPod, and then into cell phones with the iPhone. It worked, and made Apple into the biggest and richest tech company in the world.

In 2007, Amazon introduced its electronic reader, the Kindle. The product limped along for a couple of years, then started to take off in 2010 with the third generation.

He doesn't like dissent

Bezos often tells employees that they're lucky to work at Amazon and leaves sticky notes reminding them who's in charge if they disagree with him, according to Yegge.

He has otherworldly smarts

In a follow-up post, Yegge explained how Bezos was so smart that you could only impress him in presentations if you deleted every third paragraph to keep his brain occupied -- and even then, he'd figure out something you missed. "People like Jeff are better regarded as hyper-intelligent aliens with a tangential interest in human affairs."

He always wanted to change the world

He is obsessed with secrecy

Some companies are like leaky sieves -- Hewlett-Packard can't keep an internal secret to save its life, and Google and Facebook products leak all the time. The tech press publishes all sorts of rumors about Apple, but most of them turn out to be wrong because the company places a high premium on secrecy. But Amazon is even more secretive than Apple.

He was born in hard circumstances

Jobs was born to a young mother out of wedlock and given up for adoption. Bezos was born to a teenage mother whose marriage to his biological father lasted little more than a year. (Bezos has his adopted father's last name and considers him his real father, just as Jobs considered his adoptive parents his real parents.)

To be sure, there are some major differences between the two men.

Most important, Amazon hasn't yet created many products that inspire the kind of love that the iPod, iPhone and iPad do. There aren't any Amazon fans -- or at least they're nowhere near as obsessed as Apple's.

But give Bezos another five years and a few more new product areas, and that might change, too.
