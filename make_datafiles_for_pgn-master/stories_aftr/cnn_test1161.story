(CNN) -- His appointment at Bayern Munich was regarded as a something of coup, but less than a year after his arrival in Bavaria the first cracks have appeared in the relationship between Pep Guardiola and the German club.

Widely regarded as the best coach in the world, Guardiola joined Bayern last year armed with a footballing philosophy that had brought him world domination during his time at Barcelona.

The Spaniard quickly guided Bayern to victories in the club World Cup and the UEFA Super Cup, before securing the German Bundesliga title in record-breaking speed.

"If we don't win, it does not help me when Bayern Munich's chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and sporting director Matthias Sammer, are backing me," Guardiola told reporters Friday.

"If we lose I'm a risk for the club. It's a big club and you always have to win. If this doesn't happen, the club may decide something else."

"Bayern are not right," Beckenbauer, who both played for and managed Bayern, told Spanish newspaper Marca.

"This is something that we have known for weeks. The disappointment is huge."

But Guardiola is adamant he will not alter his approach, insisting it is down to Bayern to decide if they want him to continue as manager.

Bayern's 4-0 home defeat by Real raised questions that Guardiola's team is too tactically predictable.

"Next season, we will play 100% with my ideas. I can't coach this club or its players without believing in my ideas."

Guardiola says he is already planning for life in Munich next season, when he will be hoping to repeat his success on the domestic front, while going those extra steps further in Europe.

Hopfner, who is 61, has spent over 30 years in a series of senior positions at Bayern.
