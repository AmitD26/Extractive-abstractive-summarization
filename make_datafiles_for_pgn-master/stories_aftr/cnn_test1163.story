Madrid (CNN) -- Preliminary charges of financial corruption have been filed against Spain's Princess Cristina for a second time by a judge investigating her husband for alleged diversion of public funds.

But Castro continued his investigation and has now decided to bring preliminary charges again. Prosecutors are once more opposing them.

A court spokeswoman confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that the conflict between Castro and the prosecution would automatically see the issue returned to the provincial court.

A panel of four judges will then decide whether to uphold the preliminary charges.

The princess's husband, Inaki Urdangarin, is accused of diverting, for private use, public funds earmarked for his nonprofit foundation.

He has faced preliminary charges for more than a year. The preliminary charges could eventually be dropped, but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion.

Urdangarin was granted the title of Duke of Palma when he married Princess Cristina, King Juan Carlos' youngest daughter, in 1997.

The fraud scandal has created unprecedented problems for Spain's popular royal family and kept the country riveted.

The government approved the law in September.
