Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Petrol bombs, smoke canisters and hurled bricks have injured dozens of police during weeks of violence in Northern Ireland, officials said Sunday.

Tensions have been high since City Council members there voted a month ago to stop flying the Union Jack flag year-round, restricting it instead to certain days.

The meeting came a day after the Police Service of Northern Ireland said its officers deployed water cannons and fired plastic bullets Saturday night at a crowd of more than 100 demonstrators who were hurling fireworks and bricks at them.

The disorder follows a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police officers hurt.

The recent violence follows more than a decade during which Northern Ireland has made steady progress toward lasting peace and stability.

"You may be assured there will be sufficient resources in the event of more disorder for however long is necessary," Chief Constable Matt Baggott said in a statement. "The police service will continue to do everything possible to maintain law and order and we will deal firmly with outbreaks of violence."
