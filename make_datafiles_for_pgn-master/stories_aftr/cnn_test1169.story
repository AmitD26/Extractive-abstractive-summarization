"My first trip to Washington after Katrina, Senator Cochran said, 'You tell me what the state needs and I'll try to get it,'" Barbour told CNN. "He never deviated from that and ultimately he succeeded."

Their efforts helped ensure that the victims of broad devastation, such as the type seen after Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy in 2012, could get aid for housing and rebuilding.

"In our time of greatest need, he was the giant in the delegation for Mississippi," Barbour said.

Now, one of the longest serving lawmakers in Congress is facing a very different type of storm.

The veteran lawmaker and his challenger both failed to eclipse the 50% threshold in the June 3 primary to avoid a runoff and will face off again on Tuesday.

Mississippi GOP primary heads for runoff

The stakes are especially high in Mississippi as the tea party reels from Republican primary setbacks in Kentucky and other states this spring.

In Mississippi, the race leading up to the runoff turned ugly.

This month, police arrested political blogger Clayton Kelly after authorities said he broke into a nursing home where Cochran's wife, Rose, has lived for roughly 14 years and snapped pictures of the elderly woman which ended up in a political attack ad on YouTube, according to The Clarion-Ledger.

Though the Cook Political Report and the Rothenberg Political Report both have the senate seat as remaining solidly in the Republican column, Stuart Rothenberg in April wrote: "Cochran, 76, is in trouble â€” in deep trouble â€” primarily because of changes in the Republican Party. But it's also true that the senator, and his campaign, didn't start his re-election effort where they needed to be."

In 2010, Citizens Against Government Waste, a non profit government spending watchdog group, dubbed Cochran the "king of earmarks" after he netted roughly $490 million for projects he favored.

"He has worked hard in the state to make sure Mississippi got its fair share," Barbour said.

Still, the challenge from McDaniel has Cochran on the defense, Bruce said.

"I think McDaniel's campaign is a little bit of tea party, a little bit of personal attacks, and a little bit of ambition on McDaniel's part," Bruce said. "The mystery going forward is the magnitude of any impact from the photos of the senator's ailing wife."

The race's tenor seems a departure for someone who, friends like Barbour said, prides himself on being "a true gentleman."

"He is a true gentleman. He is gracious, never says anything bad about anybody," Barbour said. "He is a quiet, but very able colleague. He's always been held in very high regard by people in both parties."

Though he was a high school football star in Hinds County, Mississippi, he decided to join the cheerleading squad at the University of Mississippi â€” an experience he credits with his first taste of politics.

Key races to watch in 2014

"You had to go around to the different residence houses and fraternity and sorority houses and campaign, answer questions and make a little speech about why you thought you'd be a good cheerleader," Cochran told Roll Call in 2011.

Fellow Mississippi Republican and former Sen. Trent Lott was also an Ole Miss cheerleader a few years after Cochran.

Cochran was elected to the House in 1972, serving three terms before moving on to the Senate.
