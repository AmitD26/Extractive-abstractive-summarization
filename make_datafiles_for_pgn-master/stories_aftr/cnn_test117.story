Prescott was taken into custody early Friday morning and a search of his home revealed about 25 weapons, including hand guns and assault rifles, along with 40 large steel boxes of assorted ammunition, officials said.

Maryland man who called himself 'joker' taken into custody

"Maryland does not have a statute on the books that makes it expressly illegal for a person to communicate generalized threats over the telephone," said Alsobrooks. She said Maryland should have a stronger law about such threats and that she would lobby for one.

Prescott worked as a subcontractor for Pitney Bowes and was in the process of being fired.

On July 23, he was on the phone with a supervisor and allegedly said several times, "I am a joker. I'm going to load my guns and blow everybody up," according to local police.

Police officials said they took the threats seriously and were sensitive to the use of the word 'joker' in the aftermath of the July 20 mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie complex showing the latest Batman movie, "The Dark Knight Rises." The Joker was the villain in a previous film in the series and also appears in the comic book series that inspired the films. Suspect James Holmes was arrested in the Aurora shootings and charged with murdering 12 people and wounding dozens more.

Later that day, a judge issued an order for Prescott to be hospitalized for evaluation.
