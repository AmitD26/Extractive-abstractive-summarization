On a night where the champion was dethroned in brutal fashion, Real flexed its muscles and showed it is ready to end the long wait for a 10th European triumph.

Not since 2002 has Real, Europe's most successful club, managed to acquire the continent's top club prize.

No team has ever retained the Champions League title and Bayern Munich, so highly fancied once again this year, rarely looked like repeating its glorious triumph of last season.

Sergio Ramos scored twice in four minutes before Cristiano Ronaldo rounded off a fine counter attack to claim his 15th goal of this season's competition -- a new Champions League record.

Ronaldo added a fourth late on with a free-kick to cap a remarkable performance to make it 51 goals in 50 Champions League career appearances.

"It's a fantastic result for us," winger Gareth Bale told ITV.

"We've been working hard, got our tactics right, played well and deserved the win.

"We are happy to be in the final but still have one game to go. Everybody put in 100% -- no matter who it was, they put in a performance.

This was a painful and merciless destruction of a Bayern side which had looked unbeatable earlier in the season.

While Real played with the belief and purpose of champions, Bayern appeared cumbersome, disjointed and a shadow of the side which had waltzed to last season's title.

Bayern coach Pep Guardiola had spent the past few days instilling belief and confidence into his players.

Labored and predictable in possession and embarrassingly open in midfield, Bayern allowed Real to use the likes of Ronaldo and Bale at every opportunity.

Yet, for all the attacking talent at its disposal, it was through an old-fashioned set-piece routine which Real forged ahead.

Shocked and stunned by conceding, the home team was then hit with a real knockout blow four minutes later.

Two years ago, the Spain international missed from the penalty spot as Real was defeated on spot kicks by Bayern in the last four.

This time, it was he who was dancing with delight as Bayern heads began to drop.

And with 11 minutes of the first half remaining, it produced a breathtaking move to claim a third.

Needing five goals to qualify for the final, Bayern's case looked hopeless and so it proved.

Bayern enjoyed plenty of possession after the interval but Iker Casillas in the Real goal was rarely tested.

In the end, it was left to Ronaldo to have the final word.

With just over a minute of normal time remaining, the Portuguese star unleashed a low free-kick which flew past Neuer to add further gloss.

"La Decima" is within touching distance -- only Atletico or a certain Mr Mourinho can stop Real now.
