(CNN) -- OK, so it looks like something from a horror movie.

But the design of the mask, with its narrow mouth opening, was not perfect. For 13 hours Saturday night and early Sunday, it caused her to swallow "tremendous volumes" of seawater, which in turn led to bouts of vomiting. Nyad grew dehydrated, weakened and discouraged.

The jellyfish dispersed by Sunday afternoon, however, and Nyad did not wear the mask again during the crossing.

After Cuba-Florida feat, Nyad to swim 48 hours in New York

Venom from box jellyfish contains paralyzing toxins that attack the skin, heart and nervous system and is considered to be among the most deadly in the world. Twenty to 40 people die from stings from box jellyfish annually in the Philippines alone, according to the National Science Foundation.

During last year's swim, Nyad wore protective gear over her face, hands and body. But the jellyfish still stung her repeatedly in the mouth, aborting her attempt about halfway between Cuba and Key West.

"Literally the only square inch exposed of my entire body was the lips. We just couldn't design a way to protect the mouth and still breathe while swimming," she said last month in a blog post on her website. "Yet these animals ... are brilliant at finding animals to sting and they indeed found my lips. On both occasions, I suffered the paralysis, the otherworldly sensation of being burned alive."

But the jokesters of Twitter had some fun with her mask.

"Not only did Diana Nyad finish her swim, but that new mask of hers can double as a Halloween costume. One-stop shopping. Smart lady," wrote a Boston-based blogger on Twitter.

And there was this, from a Kansas-based comedian: "Somewhere under the sea the King of the Jellyfish yells at his men "WE HAVE FAILED. DIANA NYAD'S SILICONE MASK HAS SHAMED US ALL."
