London (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth's jubilee tour strikes an historic note today, when the British monarch visits Northern Ireland on a trip it is hoped will mark a symbolic end to the decades-long conflict there.

She's been to the province almost every year over the last decade. But this visit is especially significant as it follows her tour of the Republic of Ireland last year.

It was the first visit by a British head of state since Ireland's independence, and at the time, British Prime Minister David Cameron described it as a game-changer.

Despite the passing of 15 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, resentment among Ireland's Catholics - both North and South - has lingered over the wrongs committed during British rule.

At a state dinner the same day, there were gasps as she spoke in Gaelic. The Irish president was seen mouthing the word 'wow' and commentators declared the speech historic.

The queen managed subtly to set the tone of a visiting head of state as opposed to a ruling one. The image was powerful and cathartic for those still bitter towards Britain.

In Northern Ireland, the queen has the chance to make history again -- but this time it is personal.

The queen's cousin, Louis Mountbatten, was assassinated by the Provisional IRA (Irish Republican Army) in 1979, using a bomb planted in his fishing boat. Three others died in the same explosion.

Sinn Fein has decided that Republican icon and Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, should shake hands with the queen in front of the cameras. McGuinness is a former IRA commander.

With a simple gesture, a victim and a former man of violence will put their personal feelings aside in the name of duty, and in the name of peace.
