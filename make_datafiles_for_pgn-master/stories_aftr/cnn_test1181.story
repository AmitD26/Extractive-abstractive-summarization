Rodgers suddenly felt his arm "burning," he said, and realized he had been shot in the elbow.

Police have started to piece together what happened.

When it was all over, five people had been shot, but the only fatality was Coon, who police said killed himself in a classroom.

Investigators have reason to believe some victims were specifically targeted by Coon, who had been suspended from school Monday.  Watch what happened at the school -- and the warning signs Â»

Rodgers was treated and released from the hospital, but others were more seriously injured.

Edward Eckart, commissioner of EMS Cleveland, said the 42-year-old underwent surgery at MetroHealth Medical Center and was in stable condition at 8 p.m. Wednesday.

Fifty-seven-year-old Kachadourian was in stable condition, he said.

In addition, a 15-year-old male with a gunshot wound to his side and a 15-year-old female with a knee injury were transported to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, where they were in stable condition Wednesday night, Eckart said.

Coon had a previous arrest last year for a domestic violence incident, and police had been to his home before for incidents that involved weapons, according to McGrath.

Students said they took cover in closets after the school principal announced a "Code Blue" on the intercom.

Students described the gunman as being "odd."

Rodgers spoke to reporters after leaving the hospital Wednesday evening.

Friday was already going to be a professional day for faculty and will now be devoted to figuring out how to go about resuming classes on Monday.

Cleveland Municipal School District CEO Eugene Sanders said the community and everyone with ties to SuccessTech needs "to take a breather and relax a moment and put this in perspective."

SuccessTech is a nontraditional high school, according to local school officials.

The academy describes itself on its Web site as a "small, nontraditional high school that provides a learning environment in which all student believe in their ability to succeed."

It adds that the curriculum is "problem-based" and "infused" with technology.

The school was founded in part with a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

No metal detectors were at the school on Wednesday, although the school board has portable detectors that are randomly moved from school to school, McGrath said. An armed security guard was at the front desk, he added. E-mail to a friend
