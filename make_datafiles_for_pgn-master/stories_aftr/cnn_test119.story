(CNN) -- Fat Tuesday is rolling up fast, so we asked for your recommendations for New Orleans' very best dishes.

"Excess is the new moderation," one iReporter proclaimed. Debatable, but not a bad mantra for a trip to diner's paradise. If you're not hungry now, you will be.

Oysters every which way

Tucked into a baguette, charbroiled, fried, smothered in butter and cheese, sprinkled with bacon or just slurped right out of the shell, oysters turn up in many a New Orleans memory.

The charbroiled variety from Drago's made a big impression on Heather Ackerly, a South Louisiana transplant. "The rich butter and garlic mixed with the fresh saltwater taste of the oyster is heaven. And before you know it -- the oysters are gone. But that wonderful butter and herb sauce remains, waiting for you to soak it up with the French bread."

Eatocracy: What NOT to do during Mardi Gras

"The wonderful thing about New Orleans cuisine is it really doesn't matter if you have $100 to spend or $10, you can always get something truly special," she said.

Local Ed Killeen goes just blocks from his home in Old Metairie to Zeke's for the "most stupendously crisp and fresh oyster po' boys!"

A proper po' boy requires lightly toasted French bread, real butter, crisp lettuce and pickles, thin-sliced tomato and "most of all, freshly fried oysters," Killeen wrote in his iReport.

Mardi Gras beyond bare breasts

"Yes, other restaurants now make fatter ones on artisan breads with more exotic cold cuts and fancier ingredients in the olive salad, but Central Market's muffuletta has a classic dignity that simply cannot be bettered," she said.

"By the time you're ready to walk around, cocktail hour should be creeping up on the Quarter. A cold Abita and a few oysters sounds lovely. Give in," Wolfe advised.

Kristen Hendrix had an unforgettable taste of her husband's crab cake pasta at Oceana Grill. "It was so rich and creamy, just the right amount of seafood flavor to it," she said.

"We have tried to replicate it at home with no success so far," said Hendrix, who lives in Charleston, Illinois.

The alligator sausage cheesecake appetizer at Jacques-Imo's received two iReporter endorsements. Richard Senger of The Woodlands, Texas, called it "inexplicable."

Mariel Metzenthin of Overland Park, Kansas, went for it with this description: "The look on everyone's face at the table was the same, 'Damn!' -- eyes wide, mouths full and forks going in for seconds. The texture was smoother than a quiche, yet not as rich as the traditional cheesecake and the alligator sausage gave the right amount of bite."

For true home cooking, Marissa Turner recommends Val's Marina in Maurepas, Louisiana, about an hour's drive from the New Orleans airport. "I make the drive to Val's Marina because it feels like having dinner at my momma's house. And that's saying something," said Turner, who lives in Prairieville, Louisiana.

New Orleans: The food that got them through

What's not to love about fried things doused in powdered sugar? The famous Café du Monde, established in 1862, popped up several times among iReport contributors. Beignets, French-style square doughnuts, are the main attraction, but coffee mixed with chicory is a natural complement.

More sweet treats

For a more unusual, sucré salé treat, head to Green Goddess. "The standout, not-to-be-missed creation I'm crazy about is the bacon sundae," said Lynn Chen of Los Angeles. She tucked into this concoction -- pecan praline ice cream drizzled with bacon caramel sauce, topped with Applewood bacon and whipped cream -- instead of cake on her 35th birthday.

Breaking away from the local standards

"Get it loaded or 'dressed,' as they say in NOLA," said Curole, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire.

Melinda Green Harvey of Lubbock, Texas, offered another rave for a well-loved sandwich: the Cuban. She found a very tasty version at Cochon Butcher, a hybrid sandwich shop, butcher and wine bar.

"I get it. People go to New Orleans for gumbo, or red beans, or beignets. But when you get tired of that and just want something simple and delicious, head to Cochon Butcher."
