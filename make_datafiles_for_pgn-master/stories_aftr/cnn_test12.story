(CNN)  -- Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button secured a McLaren one-two in a dramatic  Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday as they took advantage of a collision between Red Bull pair Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel.

Polesitter Webber was leading when his German teammate tried to overtake him on lap 41 of 58 and succeeded only in crashing into him and going off.

Webber completed the podium and the third place helps him maintain the lead in the title race, five points clear of Button, with Hamilton moving up to third place, four points further adrift.

The Mercedes pair of seven-time champion Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg finished a distant fourth and fifth with Robert Kubica sixth for Renault.

The Ferraris of Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso were seventh and eighth, hardly an auspicious performance to mark the 800th grand prix for the famous red cars.

German Adrian Sutil was ninth for Force India and Japanese Kamui Kobayashi completed the points scoring for Sauber in 10th.

To complete a disappointing afternoon for Red Bull, they lost the lead to McLaren by a single point in the constructors' title race.

"There was a long way to go and I was not guaranteed to win, but it was an interesting few meters on the track between us."

"It is bad for the team and we have lost a lot of points. I always ask them to give each other room, but we have handed the points on a plate to McLaren now.

It was the McLaren team's second one-two of the season, with Button leading Hamilton home at a rain-hit Chinese Grand Prix on April 18.

Hamilton was delighted to have secured his 12th career win and his first since Singapore last year.
