That music was jazz.

Today, Jaspects, an Atlanta-based group of young musicians who were born in the hip-hop era, fuse rap and jazz melodies to introduce younger audiences to jazz and the broader ideas regarding African-American society.

For Jaspects, whose music has appeared in the movie "Hustle & Flow" and recently was featured in the CNN documentary series "Black in America," the lessons of jazz go beyond its artistic merits to questions about the ownership and control of black music in general.

Veteran saxophonist Jimmy Heath, who has performed with nearly all the jazz greats of the last 50 years, says that the music called jazz today began as a voice of the repressed.

"The history of jazz comes with the history of African-American people. Because whenever they were permitted, they always sang and played their music when they were in their own quarters, and eventually I think, when instruments were available, they started to play music on those instruments," Heath says.

In his exhaustive work on the African-American experience, "Africana," Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. writes that while black musicians were the principal innovators during this era, white musicians often reaped the fame and benefits and that "the black musicians who found greatest favor with whites were those with a happy-go-lucky air and a ready grin."

With the exception of groups such as Jaspects, jazz today is considered by Brown and some others to be a "museum piece" that aged instead of evolving. Brown says hip-hop is following a similar route, and he says a major reason is a lack of ownership of the music.

"Hopefully, there will come a time where a lot of African-Americans who do have money and do have the resources ... take over some of these corporations ... and not just have the No. 1 hit record on the charts, because that in itself will allow the community to give back to itself," Brown says.

At the same time, there has been a rise of prominent black music executives such as Sean "P. Diddy" Combs, Jay-Z, Russell Simmons and Jermaine Dupri. Jay-Z and P. Diddy, who earned $34 million and $32 million, respectively, in 2007, were named hip-hop's cash kings by Forbes magazine.

Dupri, owner of record label So So Def Records and producer of hits for recording artists TLC, Usher and Mariah Carey, disagrees that corporate ownership is affecting black music for the worse.

"If you are driven by money, then the backers that are giving you the money tell you what to do."

Dupri says that there are not enough African Americans who are in control of the music business, and that education has a lot to do with it.

Brown says he's hopeful that the rise of black leadership in music will have a positive impact on the community.

Jaspects and groups like them are hoping to change things a little. Using hip-hop, the music of rebellion and youth in 2008, they are introducing jazz to a new generation -- to tell its story, preserve its artistry and learn its lessons.
