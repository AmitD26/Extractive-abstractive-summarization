"You elected me to strengthen the results that we had achieved in security, and we have delivered," Santos said in a televised speech Wednesday night.

The peace process has been ongoing for one year, with progress coming slowly. This approach is controversial in Colombia, which in the past has been burned by failed negotiation attempts.

Zuluaga's proposal is backed by former President Alvaro Uribe, a former ally of Santos who now favors someone with a hardline stance against the guerrillas.

Santos says he wants to be re-elected to finish the peace process he started.

"We still have big challenges, but I'm convinced that the way to confront them is not only through blood and fire," he said.

Santos' current approval rating of about 30% means his incumbency will not guarantee him a second four-year term.

Santos placed all his political capital on the negotiations with the FARC, so it's natural that he is seeking re-election, another analyst, Vicente Torrijos, said.

Seeking a second term was his only option given that the peace process is still underway, he said.

"So he is going to present himself to Colombians and the world as the peacemaker and of course this is his best calling card to aspire to this re-election," he said.

Journalist Fernando Ramos reported from Bogota. CNN's Mariano Castillo reported and wrote the story in Atlanta.
