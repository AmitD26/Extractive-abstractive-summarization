The Federal Trade Commission has charged four companies with deceptive advertising related to their weight loss products. "Operation Failed Resolution," as the FTC calls it, is an effort by the federal agency to crack down on companies' misleading claims about products that allegedly help consumers slim down.

Only three weight-loss drugs are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for long-term use by certain adults: Belviq, Qsymia and Orlistat (sold over-the-counter as Alli).

"Simply sprinkle Sensa on, eat all the foods you love and watch the pounds come off," one commercial promised. "It's that easy."

A one-month supply of Sensa is $59.00 (plus shipping and handling). Profit from the sales of Sensa in the United States between 2008 and 2012 totaled nearly $364 million, according to court documents.

The FTC complaint named Sensa Products LLC, Sensa Inc., Sensa CEO Adam Goldberg and Sensa creator Dr. Alan Hirsch. All were charged with making unsubstantiated claims.

"SENSAÂ® made a business decision to settle with the FTC so it could focus on the core of its business: its customers," the company said in response on its website. "The settlement includes no admission of wrongful conduct by the company... The company has agreed to make changes to its advertising claims but otherwise will continue business as usual."

In a statement, LeanSpa said that it "regrets that it was forced by heavy-handed government tactics and financial circumstances, including an unwarranted freeze of the personal assets of LeanSpa principal Boris Mizhen and his wife (who wasn't even involved in the business and has been accused of no wrongdoing), to enter into this settlement. LeanSpa never should have been named in this lawsuit and has been ruined by it.

"LeanSpa was an excellent company with first rank scientific advisors and an excellent, clinically tested weight loss product. It did not mislead consumers in its product claims or billing practices, and was itself a victim of deceptive and fraudulent conduct by its marketing partners. The settlement is a pragmatic compromise which admits no wrongdoing by LeanSpa and Mr. Mizhen and spares them expensive, protracted litigation. Could they have had their day in court, they are confident they and their actions would have been wholly vindicated."

The company's website, LeanSpa.com, appeared to be down Wednesday.

L'Occitane sells beauty products and fragrances that are "inspired by the Mediterranean lifestyle," according to the company's website.

Seven ounces of the products sold for $48 and $44, respectively.

HCG Diet Direct sells a liquid form of the hormone chorionic gonadotropin, which is produced by the human placenta and has long been said to promote weight loss. HGC products are sold online and in stores as pellets, sprays or oral drops, and are supposed to be taken with a very-low calorie diet of less than 800 calories per day.

In November 2011, HCG Diet Direct and six other companies received warning letters from the FTC and the FDA.

"These HCG products marketed over-the-counter are unproven to help with weight loss and are potentially dangerous even if taken as directed," said Ilisa Bernstein, acting director of the Office of Compliance in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, at the time. "A very low-calorie diet should only be used under proper medical supervision."

The companies and defendants named in the legal charges are barred from making any other weight-loss claims about dietary supplements, food or drugs unless they have reliable scientific evidence, according to the FTC.

Americans spend billions of dollars every year on supplements. The industry reported an estimated $25 billion in sales in 2009.
