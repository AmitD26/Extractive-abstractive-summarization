A torn page in a cheap, tatty frame has sold at auction for an eye-watering $68,000 (A$74,000), plus commission.

Sydney auctioneer Mark Owens confesses he still knows very little about lot 11, which appears to be a page of the Quran.

"I've never even spoken directly to the person who put it in apart from a couple of e-mails," he said.

"He said it came from an estate in Melbourne. I don't think he knew a great deal about it. How old it is, I still don't know."

Owens had a clue it might arouse some interest. A few months ago, he sold another page of the Quran -- which he says was in worse condition -- for $27,000 (A$29,000). It had been previously bought for less than $10 at a local auction.

His auction house, Bargain Hunt Auctions, sells everything from fridges to paintings, many from deceased estates, and mostly for less than $100.

On this sale alone, the company made about $22,000 (A$24,000) in commission, before tax.
