But Zonderland knew that to beat the best in the world he had to persist with his plan. and on the afternoon of Tuesday August 7, he produced one of the most memorable moments of a Games defined by its iconic sporting achievements.

"I was really focused and not thinking about the past or the future but just of the moment," he told CNN's Human to Hero series.

"The routine was going so fast but by the end of it I was getting more relaxed, and then I did the dismount -- and when I landed the dismount it was the best feeling I ever had."

From the moment the 26-year-old spun off the bar to come down flush on the mat without a hint of a wobble or further movement, he knew the gold was his.

"It was a perfect landing so it was a really great feeling and the crowd was going wild," he recalled.

"The first is the cassina, you have a double somersault and then straight, and you make one turn," he explains.

"The second is the kovacs, a double-somersault and then tucked, with your legs, and the third one is the kolman, and it's a double-somersault tucked with one turn."

Zonderland had become renowned as the only gymnast to regularly perform two of the difficult moves in succession, but to perform three had many shaking their head.

Crazy risk

"I think I surprised a lot of people to really do it."

"Of course it's a hard combination. I have a little bit less time for other things but it's great I can do sport at this level and get a great education," said Zonderland, who aims to be an orthopedic doctor.

"It's getting harder and harder to compete at this level but I think I can manage to continue until the next Olympics when I'm 30."

Having started gymnastics training when he was four in the town of Heerenveen, Zonderland will have been in his sport for over a quarter of a century come the next Games, gradually building up the intensity of his efforts.

All-round ability

Zonderland has won European silver on the parallel bars, and it was thanks to his ability over six events that he was even able to appear at the 2012 Olympics.

Finishing outside of the top three in the high bar at the 2011 world championships in Tokyo after a disappointing display, he was forced to qualify via the all-round competition at the London test events.

"I wasn't ready for that anymore but it was the only possibility," he said.

"I qualified (beating fellow Dutchman Jeffrey Wammes) so I was very happy with that, and after that I could train on the parallel bars and high bars again."

His confidence increased as Zonderland appeared to perfect the routine in almost every training session.

But performing it under the pressure of competition is another matter, and Zonderland's spectacular flop at the European championships in Montpellier set nerves on edge.

"I knew from the training where I made it almost all the time that it was possible but the big challenge is in your head," Zonderland said.

"On the day of the competition I had a lot of nerves and it was quite hard to get it under control."

But he need not have worried, stunning the crowd and his rivals with his performance. But now he is at the summit of his sport, Zonderland knows he cannot relax.

"You realize there are a lot of talented gymnasts who can do the same as you do, so I think about my competitors who are really working hard," he said.

"I heard about one gymnast in the Netherlands who is also able to do it (the triple move) but for the rest I don't think anybody can do it."

Fortunately, his girlfriend Linda, who competed at a high level in speed skating as a junior, understands the nature of top-class sports competition.

Zonderland appears remarkably unaffected by his celebrity status in his home country as the first man to win a gymnastics Olympic gold.

Lasting fame

In his own country, gymnastics has received a massive boost as youngsters look to emulate him.

"It's called the 'Epke effect,' " his agent of five years Johan Boesjes told CNN.
