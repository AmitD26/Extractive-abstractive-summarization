Long Run got up with two strides remaining to pip 16-1 shot Captain Chris, who had been given every chance by jockey Richard Johnson.

7-1 French shot Grand Crus finished a distant third on the grueling heavy ground.

The Nicky Henderson-trained winner was beaten by the now retired Kauto Star in last year's edition of the festive classic.

Kauto Star was paraded before the large crowds at the racecourse in south-west London ahead of the feature race of the day.

His half-brother, Kauto Stone, looked to keep the King George title in the family, but finished out of the placings, clearly struggling in the slow going under jockey Ruby Walsh.

"He was so brave, we wanted to take the sting out of everything else and I asked so much, but he was so brave," jockey Waley-Cohen told Channel 4 .

Long Run joined greats such as Kauto Star and gray hero Desert Orchid in regaining the King George title after relinquishing it the year before.
