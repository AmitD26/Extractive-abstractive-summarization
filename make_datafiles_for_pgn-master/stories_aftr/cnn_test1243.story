"Obstetric fistula" is a mouthful. But to these women, it's much more than just a physical injury. They see themselves as the walking dead, says Dr. Justin Paluku Lussy, head of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at HEAL Africa Hospital in Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

A woman with a fistula, who is perpetually leaking urine and sometimes feces, is often rejected by her husband and shunned by her village because of her foul smell and inability to bear more children.

"People think fistula patients are witches and just have bad luck," he says.

Although an estimated 2 million women in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa live with untreated obstetric fistula, according to the Fistula Foundation, it's unlikely for these women to meet or hear of anyone else suffering from the same injuries, because of the lack of modern forms of communication and also the women's reluctance to discuss the condition, Heller says.

One of the youngest in Heller's study, a 15-year-old girl who was married off to her uncle at age 8, spent eight months selling bags of candied peanuts in order to raise enough money to pay for a taxi so she could get to a fistula center.

But pregnancy complications and childbirth are among the leading causes of death and disability for African women, Wall says.

"Habsu," one 32-year-old woman in Heller's study, contracted a fistula in her ninth pregnancy and has had three previous surgeries, all of which have failed. During the latest pregnancy, she was in labor for several days at home in a rural village before receiving medical care. Like many African women, she was malnourished and her pelvic bones were too small for a natural birth.

Another West African woman in Heller's study, "Amina," also has a severe fistula but only leaks when she sits down. After the seated interview with Heller, Amina apologized, saying she would leak urine once she stood up.

"It was as if a gallon of water was thrown to the ground," Heller says. "She was so ashamed."

Many Africans -- both educated and uneducated -- believe there is no cure for fistulas, Paluku Lussy says. When he was in medical school at the University of Goma, he says, "they used to tell us not to even try to fix them."

But, he says, that's not the case. Fistulas can be repaired with delicate surgery, which has a fairly good success rate. However, surgeons must be well-trained in the principles of the operation, and good follow-up care is essential so the surgery won't fail. Patients with more severe fistulas may need multiple surgeries.

Too many mothers still dying

Although he is a full-time professor, Wall last year opened the Danja Fistula Center in Niger, a 42-bed hospital specializing in fistula repair surgeries with an operating room, outpatient clinic and hostel facilities for about 100 women.

But it's very difficult to get trained staff to run a fistula hospital, because of the lack of available education in Africa, he says. Fistula centers rely on donations and cannot afford to hire American gynecologic surgeons.

That's true for Washington resident Olivia Bowen. She had never heard of obstetric fistula until she read a book featuring a detailed story of an African woman with the condition. Bowen was shocked at how affordable fistula repair surgery is, by Western standards.

"I'm not a runner. I do yoga. So it's something that just came naturally to me," Bowen says.

So far, participants have raised about $2,250, or enough to fund five surgeries.
