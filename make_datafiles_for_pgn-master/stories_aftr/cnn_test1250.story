(CNN) -- Marissa Mayer, who was Google's first female engineer and its 20th employee when she joined that company in 1999, has been named CEO of Yahoo.

She's the fifth CEO in as many years at that struggling company. Monday's announcement has caused ripples in the world of technology as people expressed surprise that Mayer would leave Google and that Yahoo has landed such a charismatic leader.

If we missed something fun, let us know in the comments.

1. She's responsible for the clean look of Google.com. The minimalist home page, with plenty of white space and a single search bar in the center, is said to be the brainchild of Mayer, who has overseen the launch and development of many of Google's iconic products.

"Google has the functionality of a really complicated Swiss Army knife, but the home page is our way of approaching it closed. It's simple, it's elegant, you can slip it in your pocket, but it's got the great doodad when you need it," she told Fast Company in 2005. "A lot of our competitors are like a Swiss Army knife open -- and that can be intimidating and occasionally harmful."

4. She's obsessed with fashion. According to the Los Angeles Times, Mayer once paid $60,000 at a charity auction to have lunch with fashion designer Oscar de la Renta. "Objects that make Mayer happy include her Oscar de la Renta cashmere cardigan with three-quarter sleeves and pointelle detailing and enamel buttons," Vogue wrote in 2009.

5. She has a fly penthouse. It's atop the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco, and it's worth a cool $5 million, according to The New York Times.

6. She's good in an interview. In 1999, during her interview for a job at the company, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin reportedly asked her: "How would you write a spell-check program when you have a vocabulary so big it won't fit in a computer?" She became a product manager at the young start-up after turning down a teaching job at Carnegie Mellon University.

7. She dated Larry Page. The Google co-founder and Mayer, who was a product manager at the time, dated in the early 2000s, according to the book "Googled" by Ken Auletta. A Gawker blogger wrote about how Silicon Valley considered this subject taboo.

8. She can make working as a grocery clerk sound glamorous. She told the Los Angeles Times about her high school job working the cash register: "I learned a lot about work ethic from people who had been there for 20 years. They could do 40 items a minute over an eight-hour shift. I was pretty routinely in the 38-to-41 range. I was pretty happy about that. I have a good memory for numbers.

"At the grocery store, you have to remember to charge $4.99 a pound for grapes and 99 cents a pound for cantaloupe by typing in a number code. The more numbers you could memorize, the better off you are. If you had to stop to look up a price in a book, it totally killed your average."
