(CNN) -- Looking to get to Hawaii without blowing your son's college fund? Want to experience the islands but not sure when to go?

Here's how to avoid costly and exhausting mistakes during your Hawaiian vacation.

Tourists crowd Hawaii's stunning beaches in summer and winter. During school holidays, flight and hotel rates are off the charts -- between Christmas and New Years, condos and vacation rentals can run three times as much as rates in early December.

DO visit Hawaii in the off-season.

Hands down the best values on visiting Hawaii can be found in May and October. With prices reasonably low and the weather at its peak -- not too hot, not too rainy -- take advantage of the perks of off-season travel to jet off to the islands. Current spring and fall flight deals from the West Coast are half of July rates. Additionally, hotels and condos generally slash their prices off-season, rewarding visitors with oceanfront accommodations that typically sell out in peak months.

Travel Snapshots: Hawaii

DON'T blow your whole budget on a luxury resort.

While staying in a luxurious Hawaiian resort where birds flutter through the open-air lobby and fresh papaya is served at the swim-up bar is nice, it is likely to cost between $400-$600 a night in high season. Instead, fork over the cash for a lomilomi massage and gourmet seafood dinner, and make your own poolside Mai Tai at a rental condo.

DO consider staying in a condo.

DON'T try to see everything.

DON'T fall for the luau.

And lastly, DO NOT forget to relax on the beach.
