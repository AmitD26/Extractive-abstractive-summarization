Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Three members of NATO's International Security Assistance Force were killed in an attack in Kabul on Tuesday, the coalition said.

Two were U.S. military personnel, and the third was Polish, a U.S. defense official said.

ISAF and Afghan officials are investigating the blast, the coalition said. It did not identify the names or nationalities of those killed.

At least 13 Afghan civilians were also wounded in the attack, Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said. He said 17 civilian vehicles were damaged in the blast.

The explosion in Kabul came a day after a man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform turned his weapon against ISAF members in western Afghanistan on Monday, the coalition said.
