(CNN) -- Israel's military said Tuesday it shot down a Syrian warplane over the Golan Heights amid what it described as growing tensions in the border area.

Military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said the aircraft shot down was a Russian-made Sukhoi-24 and that both the pilot and co-pilot ejected into Syria.

The plane penetrated roughly a kilometer (more than half a mile) into Israeli airspace, he said.

Syrian state TV also reported that Israeli forces had shot down a Syrian warplane.

Defense Minister: We will act strongly

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based activist group, said the Syrian fighter jet was targeting the countryside around the Syrian town of Quneitra, where the only border crossing between Israel and Syria is located.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said the Syrian fighter jet "came close to Israeli territory on the Golan Heights in a threatening manner, and even crossed the border line."

"We have made it clear, and we are making it clear now as well: We will not allow any factor be it a country or a terror organization, to threaten our security and violate our sovereignty. We will act strongly against all attempts even if it is a mistake or intentional."

An IDF statement posted online said the Israel-Syria border had been "highly unstable" in recent months.

The incidents occurred after Syrian rebel fighters took control of the border crossing in Quneitra in late August.
