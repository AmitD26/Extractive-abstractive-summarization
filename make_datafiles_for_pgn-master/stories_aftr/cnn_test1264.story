'I'm done," suspect Justin Bourque yelled as he gave up, a nearby resident who watched the 24-year-old's arrest through a window told CNN partner CBC.

He was unarmed, although police found weapons nearby, said Marlene Snowman, a superintendent for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

RCMP Assistant Commissioner Roger Brown identified the slain officers as Constables David Ross, 32, Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, and Douglas James Larche, 40.

Shortly after Bourque's arrest, barricades tumbled as residents on lockdown since the shooting slowly gathered on the streets.

"It's hard to imagine that we can go back and turn the page without having a sense of the great loss we've suffered," Mayor George Leblanc of Moncton told CTV.

"Moncton is such a beautiful, warm community ... I know this community has a tremendous spirit, and we will get through this."

Arrested in a backyard

Michelle Thibodeau told CBC that the suspect was captured near her home in Moncton.

While there, they yelled for the suspect to surrender. He was hiding behind a row of trees, Thibodeau said.

"They were screaming for about five minutes and they had their guns loaded. And eventually Justin came out with his hands up and he yelled, 'I'm done.' And they collected him and brought him to my front yard, where he lay sprawled out. "

Her parents, brother, his girlfriend and a dog all watched the scene unfold from a window.

At the time of his arrest, the suspect was wearing the same camouflage uniform shown in the pictures, according to Thibodeau.
