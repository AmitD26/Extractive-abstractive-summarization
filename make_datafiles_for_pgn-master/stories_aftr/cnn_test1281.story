(CNN) -- Arsenal extended their lead at the top of the English Premier League, but only by a point as Everton earned a 1-1 draw at the Emirates on Sunday.

But Everton's attacking persistence paid off four minutes later when substitute Gerard Deulofeu flashed a shot past Wojciech Szczesny.

"We have to say Everton were a very good side today, especially at the start of the game, the first half-an-hour ..." Arsene Wenger said afterwards.

"The performance from our point of view, I couldn't be happier," Martinez said.

Earlier, Fulham ended a run of six consecutive league defeats with a 2-0 win over Aston Villa at Craven Cottage.

Villa remain in 10th place with 19 points, three points behind David Moyes' Manchester United who suffered a second consecutive home defeat to Newcastle United on Saturday.
