(CNN) -- California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Sunday a bill that prohibits most teenagers from getting bronzed in tanning beds, making the Golden State the first to do so.

While most states regulate how minors can use tanning facilities, California's recently enacted restrictions go further than any other state, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some counties also address the issue, with the same organization noting that Howard County, Maryland, was the first jurisdiction to ban indoor tanning for all under age 18.

Such steps come after the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, in 2009 classified "UV-emitting tanning devices as 'carcinogenic to humans.'"

Lieu explained that excessive tanning at an early age can be especially perilous because tanning and its negative effects are "cumulative." But he said that one concern is how tanning salons market such services.

"They often say come in (and get) the package deal, where you can tan a lot over a (relatively) short period of time and do intense damage," said the Democrat from Torrance.

Still, he said that at least in some circles -- including the MTV reality show "Jersey Shore," where "gym, tanning and laundry" is a way of life -- he believes the message about the danger of tanning beds may be getting through.

"I know that Snooki on the 'Jersey Shore' has changed to spray tanning," Lieu said. "Spray tanning has no known harmful effects, and you can get tans from lotions or cream. There are safe ways to get that brown look."
