The stipulation -- an agreement between two parties in a case that something is a given fact -- could save time in a trial that is expected to last several months.

While acknowledging Jackson died on June 25, 2009, AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam is still reluctant to stipulate what killed him and that Murray was the cause.

Putnam: "Absolutely."

Panish: "Are you willing to stipulate that the cause of his death was Dr. Murray?"

Putnam refused to stipulate that Jackson was dead at a pretrial hearing last week, later explaining to CNN that he did not want to concede any elements that are needed to prove the case against AEG.

Prosecutors said Jackson's death was caused by a fatal combination of the surgical anesthetic propofol and sedatives Murray gave him in a desperate effort to treat his insomnia.

Detective: Money woes may have led doctor to "break the rules"

Los Angeles Police Detective Orlando Martinez delivered testimony this week that Jackson lawyers believe boosted their argument that Murray's negligent treatment that killed Jackson was spurred by his deep financial trouble -- something they contend AEG executives should have known.

Martinez, who led the department's probe of Jackson's death, testified that he suspected Murray's "severely distressed" financial situation -- including having his home in foreclosure, delinquent taxes, student-loan liens and unpaid child support -- could have led him to give Jackson unsafe treatments.

After interviewing Murray two days after Jackson's death, Martinez's "thinking at the moment was the crime was negligence," he testified.

Murray, who initially asked AEG for $5 million to work for a year as Jackson's personal physician, eventually agreed to take $150,000 a month.

What he learned about Murray's financial troubles led him "to opine that he may have, for this easy money -- the $150,000 a month -- may break the rules, bend the rules, to do whatever he needed to do to get paid."

Dr. Christopher Rogers, the deputy medical examiner who conducted the autopsy on Jackson, will be called to testify after that questioning of Martinez concludes Thursday. No court is scheduled for Friday.
