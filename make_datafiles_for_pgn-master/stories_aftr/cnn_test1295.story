(CNN) -- Local favorite Andy Murray was a man under pressure but it seldom showed as he kept his ATP World Tour Finals bid alive on Tuesday.

The Scot knew that anything other than victory against Canadian Milos Raonic would have eliminated him from the prestigious season-ending event in London.

After losing his opening match to Japan's Kei Nishikori on Sunday, Murray raised his game as he won 6-3 7-5 while Raonic, who suffered his second straight defeat, hit 33 unforced errors.

The Scot now needs to beat an in-form Roger Federer in both players' final Group B game on Thursday to be sure of reaching the semifinals.

"It's always a pleasure to play against Roger," Murray added.

"He's one of the greatest players that's ever played the game so to get the opportunity to play him in an atmosphere like this is excellent."

With two wins out of two in Group B, following a straight sets win over Raonic on Sunday, Federer is on course to continue his dependable displays at the tournament.

Should he reach the last four, he will match the record of Ivan Lendl -- who reached the semis on 12 occasions.

A masterly display against Nishikori, the first Asian man to qualify for the World Tour singles, also took Federer to within seven wins of 1,000 career victories.

"It would obviously be cool to get there -- I think it's a great number," said the 17-time grand slam champion, to cheers and the sound of cowbells from a vocal Swiss contingent.

Nishikori, who lacked the poise he showed when beating Murray on Sunday, showered praise on the evergreen Federer afterwards.

"I never feel that he's 33," said the 24-year-old, who finished runner-up at this year's U.S. Open. "He still looks young and plays amazing tennis."
