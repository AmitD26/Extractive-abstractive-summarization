The showdown comes just two weeks before Election Day and marks a final point in what's become the most expensive 2014 midterm race in the country, more than any House or Senate campaign.

While Crist entered the race last November with a sizable polling advantage over Scott, the race has tightened up and the two men now find themselves neck-and-neck toward the finish line. A CNN/ORC International poll last week indicated the race was tied at 44%.

The contest also takes place in the largest presidential swing state, meaning both parties are paying close attention to who will be in the governor's office come 2016.

And last week the race became the setting for perhaps the most unusual moment in recent political debate history, when the candidates spent the first seven minutes in a stand-off over Crist's use of a personal fan on stage, a blow-up that's since become known as "fangate."

"It's the perfect storm. You can't script a better race than this," said Robert Watson, professor of American Studies at Lynn University in Boca Raton. "Two unpopular candidates. The most expensive race. The backdrop of the 2016 presidential race — and now fangate."

Despite the political circus, Watson added, the two men have stark differences on policy, and Tuesday night gives them a final opportunity to hash out their disagreements. Here are seven things to watch for in the debate:

He maintains he didn't know the debate had started, but by not coming out on stage for seven minutes, Democrats quickly seized on the episode to paint Scott as petty and uninterested in debating the issues.

Fans of Charlie Crist can now buy their own fan

CNN has stated that no fans will be allowed, so it will be interesting to see how Crist handles the lack of circulation Tuesday night and how Scott addresses the mini-drama that put a national spotlight on the race.

2. Will Scott try to add some personality? Florida has a history of popular governors — from Jeb Bush to Lawton Chiles to Bob Graham. But the back-slapping retail politicking of Scott's predecessors hasn't come easy for the current governor, a former health care CEO.

3. Look for the zinger. One easy way Scott could display some humor would be to go after Crist over fangate.

"It's their last chance to really make that final impression, both of them would love to come away with a zinger that really resonates," Walsh said. "I think they're going to stay pretty close to their talking points, but I think they may want to take a risk at trying to produce a gotcha moment or real memorable moment."

Unlike a lot of Democrats, however, Crist hasn't entirely sought to distance himself from the President, which gives Scott more room to sharpen his attack.

Scott will also attempt to pin Crist as untrustworthy because of the former governor's party switch. While Crist agrees that same-sex marriage should be legal now, for example, Scott argues it's hard to know how Crist truly feels about the issue, given that he opposed it in 2008 when he helped get the state's same-sex marriage ban on the ballot.

Expect Scott to pounce on this flip-flopping angle as much as possible.

By this point, however, Crist is well versed in how to respond to Scott's attack on the economy. "People in Florida know I didn't cause the global economic meltdown any more than Rick Scott caused the national economic recovery," he said last week in the debate.

For his part, Crist will focus on the $1.3 billion in education cuts during Scott's first year as governor. While the cuts were caused by the expiration of stimulus funds and while some of them were restored, education is nonetheless a big issue in Florida and Crist will attempt to hammer home the statistic as much as possible.

6. Libertarian appeal. According to CNN's poll last week, Libertarian candidate Adrian Wyllie pulled a significant share of the vote at 9%, enough to make a huge difference in a tied race.

Opinion: The truth about the midterms

Lance deHaven-Smith, a public policy professor at Florida State University, said Scott could try to attract Wyllie supporters by arguing for less government, but he'll "have to overcome his association with big business." Crist, meanwhile, might find more favor with libertarians on social issues.

"I will be watching for comments bemoaning big government, big business, and big labor," said deHaven-Smith. "But of course this is not an easy sell for either candidate, because Scott is supported by big business and Crist by big labor."

7. Blue Dog Democrats. DeHaven-Smith added that neither candidate has done much to reach out to the rural, white Southern voters in the panhandle and central part of the state. While most are registered as Democrats, Scott appears to think they will vote Republican as they tend to do in statewide races, deHaven-Smith said.

"But Blue Dogs might be up for grabs if Crist stressed his Florida roots. He is a native Floridian. Scott had lived in Florida for only four years before running for governor," he said. "Without the Blue Dogs, Crist needs a very large turnout to win."

So how would Crist try to make such an appeal Tuesday night? DeHaven-Smith said to watch for how the Democrat talks about environmental issues. Blue Dogs live in rural areas and like to fish and hunt, so they want to protect the environment for recreation and sporting purposes.

The biggest elephant in the room is Crist's use of a fan last week that led to Scott protesting the debate.

The final debate could come down to whether a candidate makes a zinger that sticks with voters.
