And now the Australian skipper of that venture, James Spithill, who spearheaded his crew to overcome an 8-1 deficit to win the next eight races and take home the 162-year-old trophy, has effectively won sailing's Oscars.

The 35-year-old, named ISAF World Sailor of the Year at a glittering awards ceremony in Palma, Mallorca on Tuesday, told CNN: "I'm accepting this on behalf of the team. It's a fantastic group of nominees of more individual performances and this could not be further from that.

"It was a team effort and it's just a real highlight to be here and accept it on behalf of the team."

Spithill's team had looked dead and buried when they trailed by seven in the first-to-nine contest against Emirates Team New Zealand before pulling off a remarkable overhaul.

Grael and Kunze have been the star attraction in the 49erFX class this season with a myriad of victories and the end-of-season No.1 spot in the world rankings in a year capped by their recent World Championships win.

Launched in 1984, the awards are recognized as the pinnacle for individual competitors in the sport globally.
