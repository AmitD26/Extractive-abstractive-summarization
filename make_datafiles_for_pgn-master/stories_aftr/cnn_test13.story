Williams, bidding for her fourth U.S. Open crown, had gone into the match as a hot favorite despite a troubled year blighted by injury and serious illness.

"I had one of my best days and I'm very fortunate that I had it on this stage in New York," Stosur said after the match.

"Ever since I started playing, it was a dream of mine to be here one day, and now my dream has come true."

"Thanks to everyone back home for supporting me. All my friends, family and everyone else, thanks so much for supporting me. I look forward to coming back home."

Although she was only seeded 28th, Williams came into the tournament bang in form after winning two warm-up events -- including victory over Stosur in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto.

But Stosur, whose only previous Grand Slam final appearance came last year when she lost the French Open to Francesca Schiavone, did not read the script, dominating the opening set against the 13-time Grand Slam champion, who had reached this stage without dropping a set in the tournament.

Then came the talking point of the match. Williams had already saved one break point in the first game of the second set.

However, on the second break point, the American shouted "come on" as she unleashed a fierce forehand before Stosur had reached the ball.

Umpire Eva Asdaraki immediately penalized Williams for "intentional hindrance," and the point and the game went to Stosur.

Williams reacted angrily to the decision and was then given a code violation for verbal abuse.

"Don't even look at me -- If I see you in the corridor don't even walk past me," shouted the 29-year-old. "A code violation for expressing my opinion?, we're in America -- you're unattractive inside"

Stosur then broke serve to take a 4-3 lead and broke Williams again to clinch a famous victory -- becoming the first Australian women's winner at Flushing Meadows since Margaret Court in 1973.
