(CNN) -- A speeding vehicle struck and killed three girls Friday night, including twins, who were trick-or-treating in Southern California, authorities said.

The girls, all 13, were in costume and carrying bags of candy in a residential area in Santa Ana.

They were hit about 6:45 p.m., the Orange County Fire Authority said, according to CNN affiliate KTLA.

All the girls were declared dead at the scene, CNN affiliate KABC reported. Authorities have not identified them pending notification of next of kin.

Witnesses said the driver was speeding, and police are searching for two male suspects who fled on foot, the affiliate said. The vehicle, a Honda CRV, was found nearby.

KTLA said investigations indicated the vehicle was going at least 50 mph -- twice the listed speed limit of 25 mph.

The girls were thrown more than 100 feet, authorities said.

One of deadliest nights of the year

Two years ago, 48% of all crash fatalities during Halloween involved a drunken driver, compared with 31% on an average day in the same year, according to the agency's most recent data.

In Lake Wales, Florida, in central Florida's Polk County, a 2-year-old boy was killed along U.S. Highway 27 by a bus transporting a work crew home, CNN affiliate WFLA reported.

According to a Polk County Sheriff's Office report, the boy was out with two adults and two children when one of the adults dropped his cell phone. The adult left the children in the median of the highway and told them to stay there while he went back to retrieve his phone. The other adult waited on the highway's shoulder.

The 2-year-old climbed out of his stroller and walked back to the highway, where he was struck by the bus. According to WFLA, the bus driver was unable to see the child and couldn't stop the vehicle in time.

The highway's northbound lanes were shut down for four hours.

Five people were struck in Phoenix while out trick-or-treating as a group, according to CNN affiliate KPHO.

The trick-or-treaters -- three adults and two children -- were crossing a local street when a car hit them. One adult suffered minor injuries. The others -- a 23-year-old woman in a wheelchair, a 25-year-old man, a 10-year-old girl and a 2-year-old boy -- all were in critical condition.
