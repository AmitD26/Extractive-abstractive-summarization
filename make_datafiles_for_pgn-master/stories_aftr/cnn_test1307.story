(CNN) -- If Paul Revere had owned a pair of sneakers, he undoubtedly would have laced up and gone on a midnight run instead of a midnight ride through the streets of Boston.

Boston is sneaker city, especially this year, on the heels of the Boston Marathon bombing anniversary. Everybody is a runner -- in reality or in spirit.

Turn a corner in this handsome, historic town, and you'll stumble upon at least one -- usually a pack -- of neon-garbed runners navigating their way through Boston's cobblestone streets and parks.

On your mark, get set, go

The Charles River/Esplanade: This popular running route loops around the Charles River, taking in Cambridge and Boston. You'll have opportunities to cross several footbridges and other spans, including the BU Bridge, the Longfellow Bridge and the Mass Ave Bridge, depending on how far you want to run.

On the Cambridge side of the river, you can dash by the Museum of Science, cross over the Longfellow Bridge and run along the Esplanade, passing the Hatch Shell where the Boston Pops perform on July 4. For a 4-mile loop, cross the Mass Ave Bridge to Cambridge, run along the Charles, cross over Longfellow Bridge, back along the Esplanade in Boston. Or, go for it, and run the entire 17-mile path all the way out to neighboring Watertown.

Emerald Necklace: Frederick Law Olmsted of Central Park fame designed this gem, a lanky chain of nine green parks that stretches for more than seven miles covering 1,200 miles of parkland, including the flowery Arnold Arboretum.

The Emerald Necklace begins at Boston Common in the heart of downtown, and dangles to Franklin Park (home to a zoo). Along the way, expect plenty of shade from tree-lined paths, some hilly, mostly paved. Run the whole stretch or just sections; the "T", Boston's subway, has stops along the way.

Chestnut Hill Reservoir: Another beauty designed by Olmsted, this 1.6-mile trail hugs the reservoir in Cleveland Circle, on the outskirts of Boston, and is a nature nut's nirvana -- serene water vistas, wildlife and inspiring sunrises and sunsets.

A leg up on after-run refreshments

Home run: One of Boston's many Irish pubs, McGreevy's is especially popular for sports fans and music lovers (it's home base for Celtic punk band, Dropkick Murphys.) Expect a fun-loving scene, with floor-to-ceiling windows that open onto Boylston Street in nice weather.

If you love baseball as much as running, this bar has a huge Red Sox following -- after all, it claims to be 1,200 steps from Fenway Park and channels Red Sox history with memorabilia. (mcgreevysboston.com)

Run and a pint: Another Irish pub, not far from MIT in Cambridge, Asgard is a popular runner's cool-down bar, especially after a nearby Charles River run. Sit at one of the wooden communal tables or pull up a seat on the outside patio. (classicirish.com)

Jog your memory: You've exercised your body, now grab a beer and flex your mind at Mass Ave Tavern. Casual and friendly, with an entire wall of board games (Scrabble, anyone?), this downtown location is a popular spot for runner group meet-ups.

Harpoon serves about 20 beers, including a Harpoon IPA and, just in time for summer, the UFO Big Squeeze, a grapefruit Shandy. The brewery also sponsors the annual Harpoon 5-Miler running race. (harpoonbrewery.com)
