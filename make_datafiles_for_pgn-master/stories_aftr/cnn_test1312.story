(CNN) -- In the movies, it's a familiar storyline: superheroes joining forces to tackle a world crisis.

But CNN Heroes can do it, too. Marie Da Silva, Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow and Evans Wadongo are working together to help AIDS orphans in the African nation of Malawi.

In 2002, Da Silva started the Jacaranda School in Malawi, where half a million children have been orphaned by AIDS. For her efforts, she was honored as a top 10 CNN Hero in 2008.

CNN recently spoke with Da Silva about the team-up and how it's helping the children.

But there was something else that was happening at our school at that same time. For all the years that I had the school, I was buying the porridge for the children, costing me something like $500 a month. Then, for a time, we were given porridge by (another organization) ... but we had had a drought in Malawi, so I was panicking.

CNN: How has Magnus' support enabled you to do more for your students?

Da Silva: The high school students who stayed in school through the afternoon ... they were weak, most sleeping in class. (Mary's Meals) agreed to provide an additional meal of porridge for (them) at noon. This has resulted in a lot more attendance at the school and students studying with energy.

One of our college graduates is now working for Mary's Meals as a field monitor. We are so proud. ... This is what we want: to see them graduate and get quality jobs.

CNN: How did you come to work with Evans Wadongo?

Da Silva: I first heard about Evans through CNN Heroes. I met him through a friend of mine, Lane Hill, who thought Evans should come to teach our kids to build the (solar lanterns).

Then Robert Burke, a math teacher at the Shanghai American School in China -- one of our biggest supporters -- was looking for another project for his students to become involved in. ... Since seeing my story on TV, they've visited us and donated money to build our first toilets with running water, a clinic and a physics and science lab. ... So, (he) raised money to bring this project to life.

Today, I'm happy to tell you that we have over 200 lamps made by the kids themselves with the help of Evans and his team, and we distributed the lamps to the kids who are taking their examinations.

For the family, (this) cuts the costs. And for the children, it's helping them to study. And during this examination time ... I'm sure we're going to see better results, so we're very thankful to Evans.

Da Silva: Evans brought a lot more than just those lamps to our students. ... He's a young African guy, and they're young African students, so ... he's motivated our kids to be inventors. They've come up with their own little models that work just like Evans' lamps. ... He really gave them confidence that they, too, can make something that can help people and change people's lives.

CNN: Are you surprised that two of your fellow honorees have been able to help you?
