Another federal lawmaker, Abdullahi Ahmed Hussein, also known as "Onka," was seriously injured in the shooting and taken to a hospital for treatment, authorities said.

The attackers were wearing Somali army uniforms, Isse said. They drove away after the shooting, police Capt. Abdalla Jama said.

Al-Shabaab's aim is to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries, as well. The group carried out the mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya, in September that left at 67 people dead.

Hayd's death comes more than three months after the assassinations of two other lawmakers, and almost six weeks since a bloody attack on the parliament headquarters.

On April 21 in Mogadishu, a hidden bomb exploded in a car containing Parliament member Isack Mohamed Ali, popularly known as Isack Rino, killing him, officials said.

Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for both killings.

On May 24, al-Shabaab militants attacked Parliament headquarters with guns and explosives in a siege that lasted more than three hours. At least 10 people were killed and 11 others injured, witnesses and officials said. Security forces killed some of the attackers, and other militants died by blowing themselves up, police said.
