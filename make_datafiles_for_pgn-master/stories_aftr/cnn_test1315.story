Canadian police believe Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, who was born as Eric Clinton Newman and also uses the alias Vladimir Romanov, has fled the country, prompting Interpol, the global police agency, to add his name to its most wanted list.

"We believe he filmed himself," said Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere. "It's gross."

Magnotta knew the victim, whom Lafreniere said he could not identify. He said the headless body was too mutilated to make any immediate identification.

Lafreniere said police found evidence suggesting he had fled Canada. He once wrote online about how to disappear after committing a crime.

Police were first alerted to the grisly act when a severed foot in a package arrived by mail at Conservative Party headquarters in Ottawa. Police Sgt. Steve Hodgsontold reporters that staffers had begun to open the package before calling police.

"The odor coming from the package was just horrible, and I'm sure many of us will never forget it," Conservative Party spokesman Fred Delorey told Canada's CBC news.

A severed hand turned up the same day at a postal distribution center, where it was intercepted. It was addressed to the Liberal Party.

On Wednesday, a third body part -- a torso -- turned up behind a Montreal apartment building, where the suspect was a tenant. It had been stuffed into a suitcase. The foot and hand belong to the same victim, Lafreniere said, and police believe the torso does as well.

"We are still missing pieces of this puzzle in terms of body parts," he said.

"I had my eye on it, because it looked like a nice suitcase," resident Richard Payette told CBC. But something about it struck him has odd.

"I've been a police officer for more than 20 years now, and I met officers that were doing an investigation for more than 30 years, and they said they never saw a scene like that," Lafreniere said.

Dried blood stained the table, the bed, the bathtub and the refrigerator of apartment 208.

Police say they have found a video online of Magnotta committing the murder in Montreal.

Magnotta also was notorious among animal rights activists who pegged him as a serial kitten killer who used the carcasses in sexual acts.

"We are patiently waiting for more information on the case and have faith in the Montreal Police," the website said Thursday.

Lafreniere said police were aware of the animal allegations.

"Once and for all I will set the record straight," he wrote. "Many hoax websites are created using my image and name, posing as me to seem more believable in respect to the type of audience these website (sic) have, I feel I don't need to list them specifically but people need not be told, not to believe what they read and to take it as fact."

The website has writing in Arabic and Russian and images of Magnotta, half naked and with lips pouted.

Several Canadian newspapers also reported that Magnotta had dated notorious Canadian killer Karla Homolka. Lafreniere said he could not confirm any links and that she was not part of the investigation.

"We need to bring him to justice," Lafreniere said.

CNN's David Ariosto, Jake Carpenter, Paula Newton and Matt Smith contributed to this report.
