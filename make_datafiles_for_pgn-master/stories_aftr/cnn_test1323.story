(CNN) -- "Roll Tide!"

"Go Ducks! "

"FSU is on the warpath!"

Those are some of the things you'll hear and see during college football's biggest games this season.

Alabama, Oregon, Florida State and Ohio State are the four universities voted into the inaugural College Football Playoff, the selection committee announced Sunday.

No. 1 Alabama will play No. 4 Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl, and No. 2 Oregon will play No. 3 Florida State in the Rose Bowl. Both games will take place on January 1, and the winners will face off in the National Championship Game on January 12.

But there was plenty of controversy over which team should get the fourth and final spot. Ohio State got the nod after stomping the Wisconsin Badgers 59-0 in the Big Ten championship game.

Here's what you won't hear: any cheers from fans of Baylor or Texas Christian universities.

But starting in the 1990s, various incarnations of what came to be known as the Bowl Championship Series attempted to pit the top two teams in the country in a winner-takes-all finale. The overall rankings were compiled using a combination of human- and computer-generated rankings. While the game featured the No. 1 BCS-ranked team versus the No. 2 team every year since 1998, often debate raged regarding whether those were actually the two best teams.

Many sports pundits have called for an eight-team playoff. It's safe to assume Baylor and TCU fans would agree, though it's too late for this season.
