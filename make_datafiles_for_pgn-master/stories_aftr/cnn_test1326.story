(CNN) -- Serbia hosted the Third Meeting of Heads of Government of China and Central and Eastern Europe this week, marking the first visit of a Chinese Premiere to Belgrade in 28 years.

The Balkan nation has positioned itself as an attractive destination for Chinese investment over the last decade, with a number of big projects in the pipeline. One of them is the China-funded Zemun-Borca bridge over the Danube river which was ceremonially opened by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Serbian prime minister Aleksandar Vucic Thursday.

Serbia is increasingly looking to invest in big infrastructure projects in Southeast Europe in order to ease the passage of its goods from the Greek port of Piraeus, which is under a 35-year concession by Chinese shipping giant Cosco, to western Europe.

CNN's Paula Newton sat down with Vucic in Belgrade ahead of the summit to discuss the government's efforts against corruption, Serbia's strategy for EU membership and the Kosovo issue. An edited version of the interview follows.

CNN: Strategically, why is it so important at this point in time to be having this summit and to invite so many different countries?

CNN: What is China getting out of it? Some wonder if they will have undue influence in this country, because of the strong economic ties?

AV: They get our money. It's capitalism; they invest something, they earn money and that's it -- it's a market economy.

CNN: You're all in competition, I would say, in these European countries for that Chinese investment .Do you think there's enough around to go for everyone, or do you feel that it is a competitive environment right now?

AV: We do our best. Of course there is competition, that's something very normal between countries and Serbia is not afraid of competition. From Serbia you have a very open market of one billion people, which means that we have free trade agreements with the European Union, and on the other hand we have free trade agreements with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, as well as Turkey.

CNN: One of those important reforms is your anti-corruption pledge. What is the situation now?
