(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho's Chelsea had the last laugh on London rival West Ham to keep up its relentless pace at the top of the English Premier League with a 2-0 Boxing Day home win.

The pre-match build up had centered on Mourinho's remarks after the corresponding fixture last season -- when peeved by the West Ham defensive tactics in a 0-0 draw -- he said manager Sam Allardyce and the team had been playing "football from the 19th century" -- amid other sharp criticism.

In truth, once the match got underway there was little the visitors could do to stem the tide of almost constant Chelsea attacks, with very little in reply.

It was the former England international's second goal in two games and his team might have been further ahead but for Adrian producing a fine save from Nemanja Matic and top scorer Costa shooting over.

Hazard was nearly on the score sheet early in the second half, but it was the Belgian international who turned provider as he played Costa through to finish clinically for this 13th of the season just after the hour mark.

Southampton won 3-1 at Crystal Palace to leapfrog West Ham into fourth spot, the defeat the last match in charge for home boss Neil Warnock.

Tottenham Hotspur took closer order to the Champions League spots with a 2-1 win at bottom club Leicester.

In the Boxing Day late game, Alexis Sanchez saw his penalty saved by Rob Green then put Arsenal ahead in a 2-1 win over QPR at the Emirates.

The Gunners had Olivier Giroud sent off for a headbutt on Nedum Onuoha, but added a second through Tomas Rosicky. A Charlie Austin penalty reduced the deficit but the 10-man home side hung on as Arsenal went sixth.
