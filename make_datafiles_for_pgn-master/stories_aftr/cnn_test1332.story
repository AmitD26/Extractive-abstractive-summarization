CNN's John King looks back at Sunday's talk shows and what will make news in the coming week.

For Pelosi, last week included a concession that she had been briefed about the use of waterboarding back in 2003 and an accusation the CIA had deliberately misled her and Congress about Bush era interrogation practices.

With Speaker Pelosi declining offers from "State of the Union" and others to answer questions on Sunday, her Republican critics stepped into the vacuum -- with gusto.

Pelosi's critics fire away

For all the criticism of the Democratic speaker, there was clearly little desire on the part of some Republicans to seek an investigation that might damage Pelosi but would definitely put the spotlight on Bush administration officials and the interrogations of terror suspects.

"I am less interested in investigating whether her memory is correct or she lied about it than I am in the policies that flow from the debate that we're having. I am not one who thinks we ought to have truth commissions and all of the rest of it and keep looking backward. I agree with the president. We've got enough on our plate, we need to look forward." -- Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, on ABC's "This Week"

Conservatives are putting pressure on leading Republicans to prepare for a confirmation fight, and while the math overwhelmingly favors the Democrats, the Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said it was too soon to rule out a filibuster, a tactic he condemned during Bush administration court debates.

"I think it is way premature ... to be predicting what kind of procedural moves will be taken when we haven't even seen the nomination yet." -- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on "Fox News Sunday"

Cheney: Help or hindrance?

Former Vice President Dick Cheney was not out on the Sunday talk shows, but there was a lot of debate over whether he's helping or hurting the Republican Party with his harsh criticisms of the Obama administration.

The criticisms have been coming hard and fast ever since his first TV interview on "State of the Union" on March 15. Read more about criticisms, reaction

One of his staunch defenders was his daughter:

The concept of Republicans "influencing the White House" relates to two recent dramatic reversals of policy: refusing to release additional photos of interrogations and considering trying Guantanamo detainees in military commissions instead of civilian criminal courts. The debate on what to do with the detainees continued Sunday:

Economy: Hopeful signs?

"I think what happened is the free-fall in the economy seems to have stopped. I guess the analogy [is] there are some glimmers of sun shining through the trees, but we're not out of the woods yet. We do have more work ahead." -- Peter Orszag, director of the Office of Management and Budget, on "State of the Union"

President at Notre Dame

Another big Sunday story was Obama's commencement speech at Notre Dame University -- speaking directly to those who protested his presence at the Catholic institution.

"When we open our hearts and our minds to those who may not think like we do or believe what we do -- that's when we discover at least the possibility of common ground. ... That's when we begin to say, 'Maybe we won't agree on abortion, but we can still agree that this is a heart-wrenching decision for any woman to make, with both moral and spiritual dimensions." -- Obama at Notre Dame University.

On "State of the Union," two political contributors, conservative radio talk show host Bill Bennett and Democratic strategist James Carville, had very different views of this event:

Bennett: Yes, he should be welcome on the campus. Yes, he should be able to come and express his views. Should he receive an honor for his views? No, he should not. When you go against fundamental moral principles, fundamentally teachings of the church, then you should not be honored. Should there be a debate on campus on this as there can be, sure.

Bennett: Missing the point.

Bennett: Free inquiry at the university is entirely appropriate. But the point of honoring someone who is the most pro-abortion president for his life and his work is inappropriate. I have one of those honorary degrees from Notre Dame, by the way. It ain't worth much.

On a lighter note

Boehner took the joke about his deep tan in stride:
