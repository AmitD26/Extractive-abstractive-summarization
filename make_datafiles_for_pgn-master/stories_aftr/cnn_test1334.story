Watch your step as you climb these stairs, whether spiraling up mountains, narrow passageways or sky-scraping attractions.

Stairways can leave just as much of an impact on your memory as the places they lead you. Some are so eye-catching they look like they belong in an M.C. Escher painting, while other stairs are downright intimidating, especially when they stand between you and a site you flew halfway across the world to experience.

In Peru, for instance, travelers need to tackle about 600 feet of slippery granite rocks carved into the mountainside to reach the Moon Temple at Machu Picchu. And at Yosemite National Park, you can't take a selfie at the top of Half Dome without climbing a cable ladder up the rock face for more than 400 feet.

All it takes is a misstep for any old staircase to become treacherous (just ask Jennifer Lawrence), yet some standout for being especially scary.

Other stairs are intimidating for more psychological reasons, such as the creaking noises made by the world's longest wooden stairway in Norway or the eerie atmosphere at "The Stairway to Hell," part of an abandoned industrial complex in Japan.

Angkor Wat Temple Stairs, Cambodia

In this super-humid hotbox of Buddhist history, there's no shame in bowing down on your hands and knees or pulling yourself up with the provided ropes to scale the nearly 70 percent inclined stairs of Angkor Wat's uppermost temples.

Guides claim the steps were made to be so steep to remind people that heaven was hard to reach—though you might make the same argument about Earth as you try not to tumble on the way down.

At first it's lovely to notice that the staircase adjacent to these waterfalls was designed to blend in with the tropical landscape. But consider the name—in English, the Devil's Cauldron—and the evil tricks the steep steps can play.

Half Dome, Cable Route, California

What's between you and the most iconic peak in Yosemite Valley? A seven-mile (one-way) all-incline hike through the wilderness that culminates with climbing up the rock face along a cable ladder for more than 400 vertical feet.

At Machu Picchu, 600 feet or so of steep, slippery, cloud-covered granite rocks the Inca carved more than 500 years ago into the side of Huayna Picchu (the peak in everyone's photos) lead to the rarely visited Moon Temple—and a spectacular view of the ruins.

Statue of Liberty, New York City

If you want to gaze out from Lady Liberty's crown, check your claustrophobia at her feet. The platform's only access is via a cramped, 146-step double-helix spiral staircase with just six feet of head clearance—and it's teeming with tourists. Real troopers, however, will make the entire tight 377-step hike up all the way from the lobby, the equivalent of climbing a 20-story building.

These physical challenges all come after you've managed another feat: snagging one of the hard to get passes that allow entry into the crown. They have to be booked at least three months in advance, are name and date specific and are limited to four per order.

Florli Stairs, Norway

Norway's Flørli Power Station is the starting point for the best hikes around the town of Lysefjord—and its stairs will make you gasp for two reasons. First, there are 4,444 steps that ascend a staggering 2,427 feet from the bottom. Second, it is the longest staircase in the world made entirely out of wood, meaning you should be paying close attention to each mysterious creak and crack you hear.

Mount Huashan Heavenly Stairs, China

There's no official count of steps on this cardiac stress test carved into a sacred Taoist mountain. Perhaps because anyone attempting to conquer this vertiginous washboard wall has lost count, distracted by the dizzying drop and its threat of death.

Travel + Leisure: World's scariest bridges

Janssen Observatory, Mont Blanc, France

Batu Caves, Malaysia

Sagrada Familia, Barcelona

Gaudí envisioned a forest canopy when designing the rooftop of this Roman Catholic church, but climbing the spiral staircase to its towers feels more like crawling up a Slinky. Not only does it coil high along the tightly enclosed walls, but there's also no banister to prevent you from barreling over the middling edge while you're walking up and down with hordes of other people.

Can stairs be so seriously scary that they've been banned? Answer: Yes. The 3,922 rickety steps that lead a half mile up Oahu's Koolau Mountain Range pose such a risk, it's actually illegal to climb them. There's even a guard placed at the bottom to stop you from going up.

No visit to Milan is complete without having marveled at the view of Italy's northern city from the roof of this famed cathedral stacked with about 2,000 statues. But in order to check it off your bucket list, you're required to wiggle up and down a steep, slender staircase in a shaft way clogged with tourists.

Tip: Head to La Rinascente, a department store across the street with a rooftop café that serves up perfect views of the cathedral and skyline—no stairs necessary.
