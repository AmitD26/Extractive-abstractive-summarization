Arriving in a city with an area five times the size of New York City and 23 million people can be overwhelming.

Fortunately Shanghai -- the most developed city on mainland China -- is equipped to impress even the most jaded of international business travelers.

From getting in quick to getting out with the hottest souvenirs -- and having eaten plenty of fantastic food in between -- this mini-guide offers tips for time starved executive travelers looking for the best of Shanghai.

Just getting out of the airport in Shanghai is a thrill if you climb aboard world's fastest commercial train, the Shanghai Maglev.

This airport shuttle connects Shanghai Pudong International Airport with Longyang Lu Station in the suburbs of Pudong.

Moving like a silver bullet, Maglev trains cover 30 kilometers in about seven minutes. Metro Line 2 also runs between Longyang Lu and the airport -- the journey takes about an hour.

Maglev trains run once every 15 to 20 minutes and cost RMB50 ($8) for a single trip and RMB80 ($13) for a round-trip, good for seven days.

Rooms with views

The 174-room hotel occupies the 79th to 93rd floors of the 492-meter-tall Shanghai World Financial Center -- the tallest functioning building in Shanghai.

If you'd rather enjoy views of both sides of the curved Huangpu River, you'll want to check into the Hyatt on the Bund on the north end, or Indigo Hotel on the south end.

The latter also provides views of Shanghai Old Town.

When it comes to dinner, Maison de L'hui on Julu Lu is the place to impress the pickiest of clients.

Elsewhere, tree-lined Jinxian Lu is a relaxing little street known for its authentic home kitchens, such as Lan Xin and Hai Jin Zi.

In these no-frills restaurants, chatty Shanghainese women greet you in a cramped dining room as their husbands cook up some of Shanghai's best braised pork belly, stir-fried shrimps and tofu soup.

Qibao Water Town on the outskirts of Shanghai has a brilliant food street that offers unforgettable xiaolongbao, pig trotters and Shanghai-style glutinous dumplings.

Originally an ethnic dress of Manchu people, the qipao was immortalized by the flirty Shanghai calendar girls of the 1930s, and then by year 2000 film "In the Mood for Love" starring Maggie Cheung.

The best qipao tailors in Shanghai gather in two locations: Changle Lu (between Shaanxi Nan Lu and Ruijin Yi Lu) and Maoming Nan Lu (between Huaihai Zhong Lu and Fuxing Zong Lu).

Among them, Han Yi on Changle Lu is said to have supplied qipao for Maggie Cheung for her role in "In the Mood for Love."

In a rush? Shanghai Tang, which has several outlets in Shanghai, sells stylish off-the-rack pieces, including Mandarin collar jackets and shirts for men.

Best photo ops

Zhongshan Park in the west side of the city is a great place to document Shanghai's morning exercise culture -- serious-looking retirees practicing fan dancing, Mulan boxing and gentle martial arts.

Afterward, for an Instagram shot that'll make all your followers hungry, De Xin Guan on Guangdong Lu is great for lunch. This popular local restaurant is known for noodles and incredible xiaolongbao (pleated pork dumplings).

When the sun sets, Shanghai is at its most glamorous.

In Puxi, we recommend the rooftop terrace of Bar Rouge in Bund 18.

In Pudong, the rooftop bar at The Ritz-Carlton offers an unforgettable view towards the vast Puxi area.

The former French Concession is the most pleasant and walkable area of Shanghai.

An ideal starting point for a 30-minute walking tour is the statue of Russian author Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin, located at the meeting point of Taojiang Lu, Yueyang Lu and Fenyang Lu.

The streets between People's Square and the Bund make up another intriguing area -- the oldest part of Shanghai developed by the British colonists.

You can use Fuzhou Lu as an axis and explore the surrounding small streets, slowly making your way eastbound toward the Bund.

The neighborhood also contains one of the few Muslim quarters in Shanghai, located between Guangxi Bei Lu and Zhejiang Zhong Lu.

Easy-to-pack souvenirs

Many objects are souvenir candidates, such as colorful chopsticks, purses and cushion covers made with brocade, or bottle openers shaped like Peking Opera masks.

Remember to bargain -- half the asking price is a good strategy.

Tianzifang on Taikang Lu is another good source of souvenirs.

Apart from the many boutiques filled with wacky T-shirts, communist-style postman bags and mugs, this amazing alleyway shopping complex has adorable tea shops selling carefully packed Chinese loose-leaf tea, handcrafted jewelry and artistic postcards.
