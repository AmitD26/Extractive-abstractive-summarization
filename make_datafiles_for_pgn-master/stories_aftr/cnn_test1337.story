Like that previous Lifetime attempt, viewers on Twitter loved to hate "Aaliyah: The Princess of R&B."

Original star Zendaya Coleman backed out of the movie earlier this year, saying it all seemed "a little rushed."

Aaliyah had a very successful recording career, singing many hits before her tragic death at age 22 in a 2001 plane crash.

Before the biopic aired, producers defended it. The Washington Post reported that executive producers Howard Braunstein and Debra Martin Chase, as well as Christopher Farley, the author of "Aaliyah: More Than a Woman," on which the movie was based, said it was their goal to present a tasteful tribute to the late singer.

"Biopics are hard," Chase said. "People have an opinion and social media allows them to voice that opinion. But at the end of the day, our goal was to make the best movie possible."
