Being a highly productive, contributing member of society demands effort and commitment.  It requires sacrifice and a passion for teamwork.

But I really do enjoy my regularly scheduled naps.  So much so, in fact, that my close friends know not to call between 2 and 4 p.m. on the weekends.  The "baby" is sleeping.

And that's why I was rather excited this week to discover all the social media buzz over the amazing new Ostrich Pillow.  Essentially, it's a soft, padded tube in which you can bury your entire head to take a nap, so long as you don't mind burying your entire head in a soft, padded tube.  Of course, there's really no way you should already know whether this is something you like.

"What?  You haven't tried?"

Regardless, I did some serious soul searching -- I pictured myself wearing it in public situations like at an airport or a bris -- and decided that, yes, I'm totally down for living in this tube.  It's so stupendous!

"It's a nap!"

The Ostrich Pillow was conceptualized by the European design duo kawamura-ganjavian, who wanted to find a creative way to provide people with the health and productivity benefits commonly associated with power napping.  Power napping is a lot like normal napping, only when you're done with a power nap, you're expected to actually do stuff.

Perhaps this says a lot about people's attitudes toward napping and the importance of taking a little siesta during the busy workday.  The official sales pitch for the Ostrich Pillow even claims that a 20-minute power nap can increase productivity by 37%.

Amazing!  I can only dream of all the things I would get done at the office if I actually worked at 37% productivity.  And to think, all I need is a quick nap as soon as I get to my desk.

"Let's start the morning meeting.  Where's Bellini?"

By and large, the Ostrich Pillow seems like a great idea.  It's dark.  It's cozy.  It has a place for your hands.  But the big question is whether people will actually wear it in public.  And we really can't say yes or no based on what I would do, since a better assessment would come from somebody who actually has the ability to feel shame.

Nevertheless, I'm still hoping to get my hands on one of these to give it a proper test drive.  But, until then, if you need me, I'll be sleeping under my desk.

"Let's start the morning meeting.  Where's Bellini?"

"Who cares."
