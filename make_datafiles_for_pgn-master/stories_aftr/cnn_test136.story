(CNN) -- Pour yourself a cold martini, make sure it's extra dry, put some classic jazz on the stereo, a mournful saxophone is a must, and settle in with one of the best-reviewed novels of the year, "Rules of Civility."

The story unfolds largely in flashback, set on New Year's Eve in Manhattan 1937. The Jazz Age is over, the Depression in its final days, World War II just over the horizon. At its outset, there is a budding love triangle between Katey Kontent, that's "kon-tent, like the state of being"; her boardinghouse roommate, Eve; and a handsome banker, Theodore "Tinker" Grey, but an unexpected accident sends the story in a more serious direction.

Katey is the narrator and the wry heart of this novel. She's a young woman of "poise and purpose." Brooklyn-born, the daughter of immigrant laborers, she works in a Wall Street secretarial pool though aspires to much more.

The novel takes its title from young George Washington's "Rules of Civility & Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation"; you'll find all 110 of them in the novel's appendix. These rules are described as "a do-it-yourself charm school. A sort of How to Win Friends and Influence People 150 years ahead of its time."

Towles gives a knowing nod to some classic American authors, no less than F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Edith Wharton among them, but this book is much more than an homage.

CNN recently spoke to Towles about his bestselling novel. The following is an edited transcript:

CNN: You're a 46-year-old investment professional. What led you to write your first novel?

One reason for the long hiatus is that I have been an investment professional since my mid-20s. My personal challenge as an artist has been having a day job which is intellectually satisfying and fun -- and thus can easily supplant the desire to make art.

But the benefit of having that career has been that I could write without an overwhelming sense of urgency to be published. I could just keep refining my craft until I was convinced I had something worth sharing.

CNN: What made you choose New York City in 1938 as the setting for your novel?

The subway photos weren't shown publicly until the 1960s, and, as I flipped through the pages, I had the fanciful notion of someone at the exhibit's opening recognizing the same person in two of the portraits. When I set out to write a novel in 2006, I returned to this old idea -- which necessarily took me back to New York in the late '30s.

Beyond that, I've always had a great interest in the period between 1900 and 1940, because it was a period of such incredible creative combustion. In retrospect, the pace of change in the arts and industry in the 19th century seems pretty glacial. Painting, music, the novel, architecture were all evolving, but at a pretty observable pace.

Then in the span of a few decades, you have James Joyce, Nijinsky, cubism, surrealism, jazz, Henry Ford, Sigmund Freud, the rise of socialism, movies, airplanes, skyscrapers and the general upending of received forms in almost every area of human endeavor. New York was certainly one of the global centers in which these changes were taking shape, making it an inviting setting.

My grandmother, who was simultaneously a woman of manners and verve, fended off marriage proposals until she was 30 because she was having too much fun to settle down. Like the book's narrator, Katey, she pushed a rival in furs into the drink before ultimately accepting my grandfather's proposal.

CNN: While there's a very retro appeal to the book, it still has a very modern feel. Do you think your story could have taken place in today's New York?

Towles: I certainly hope so. I think the book's themes of self-invention, aspiration, love and loss are as pertinent in today's New York as they were a century ago.

At the same time, the aristocratic families of the 1920s began to abandon the outward pomp of cotillions and tails. Wonder Bread, Budweiser and Chock Full o' Nuts found their place in pantries high and low (with consistency and low price being attained at the expense of differentiation and flavor). This convergence has had weird byproducts: The vast of majority of Americans, spanning a wide array of economics (from the statistically rich to the statistically poor), now identify themselves as "middle class."

And where in the first half of the century the struggling youth would have aspired to the narrow circles of aristocracy, in recent decades the affluent youth have aspired to the fashion and cadences of the streets. But having made these rough generalizations about transformation, I'd say that many aspects of 1930s social behavior prevail.

CNN: "Rules of Civility" has received some high praise and been compared to classics like "The Great Gatsby," "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and "The House of Mirth," among others. What do you think about these comparisons?

Perhaps I didn't struggle too much with comparison because I am such a lover of collage. Whether it's the works of the early Dadaists or the boxes of Joseph Cornell or sampling in contemporary music, I enjoy experiencing the successful integration of one work of art into another.
