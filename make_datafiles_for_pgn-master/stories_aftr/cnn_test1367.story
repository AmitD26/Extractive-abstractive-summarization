(CNN) -- One goal in eight matches for new club Liverpool, and dumped by the Italian national team.

Perhaps the man known as "Super" Mario Balotelli isn't feeling quite so super at present.

And until the striker, painted as a maverick and a trouble maker in the press, proves he can '"carry" a club, his enormous potential may go unfulfilled, according to Milan director Umberto Gandini.

"Until he will do that he won't be able to fulfill his promises."

Balotelli has struggled to adapt to life back in the English Premier League, scoring just one goal in eight matches for Liverpool since his $25 million move in August.

Even his new manager Brendan Rodgers admitted signing the former Inter forward was a "calculated risk" given his checkered past, saying the player himself knows this is probably his last chance.

Not helping him is the shadow of the man he replaced on Merseyside -- Luis Suarez, now at Spanish club Barcelona.

And while there are similarities in the way the pair have courted controversy in the past, Balotelli is yet to offered any hint of the potency that punctuated Suarez's stay at the club.

But that is at odds with Gandini's assessment -- that Balotelli is far more professional than he is portrayed -- though he does acknowledge the player is energized by conflict.

"He is much, much better than he is portrayed and his lifestyle was much better than portrayed in England," Gandini added. "He is a fantastic kid, he is humble, and recognizes a lot of values that football has given to him, and life in general.
