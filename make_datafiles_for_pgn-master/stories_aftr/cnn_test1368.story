The 43 Mexican students who disappeared in southern Mexico in September were abducted by police on order of a local mayor, and are believed to have been turned over to a gang that killed them and burned their bodies before throwing some remains in a river, the nation's attorney general said Friday.

This is the conclusion that investigators have reached, Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said, though he cautioned that it cannot be known with certainty until DNA tests confirm the identities.

This will be a challenge, he said, as the badly burned fragments make it difficult to extract DNA.

Parents of the college students reacted immediately, some saying the evidence is inconclusive and insisting that their children are alive.

Another parent, Isrrael Galindo, said the government is getting ahead of itself in an attempt to get protests over the disappearance of the students to stop and the public to stop demanding answers.

"The government is trying to resolve things its way so that to rid itself of this great problem it is facing," Galindo, who lives in California but whose wife and children are in Mexico, told CNN en Español.

The parents have been highly critical of President Enrique Peña Nieto for his administration's handling of the investigation.

A cell phone video from a closed-door meeting with the President, released on YouTube, shows family members accusing Peña Nieto of being out of touch with who the students are. One family member on the recording suggests the President should resign if he can't deliver answers.

Describing the federal investigation as one of the most complex in recent times, Murillo outlined what he said befell the students from a rural teacher's college in Ayotzinapa, Guerrero state.

Three men arrested in connection with the disappearance of the students admitted to having killed a large number of people believed to be the students, Murillo said.

Murillo said police officers handed the victims to the three men, who he said belong to the Guerreros Unidos gang.

Authorities have arrested Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca, called the "probable mastermind" in the mass abduction, and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda. They were captured while hiding out in Mexico City earlier this week.

Officials have said that when the mayor and his wife learned the students' protest would disrupt one of his events, the mayor ordered then-Iguala police Chief Felipe Flores Velasquez to stop the demonstration. The former police chief remains a fugitive.

Murillo on Friday repeated the claim that the order to abduct the students came from the mayor. The police confronted the students twice on their journey, killing three in one confrontation, and forcibly taking all of them to a police station the second time, the attorney general said.

The gang members transported the students in various trucks to a garbage dump, Murillo said.

There is no evidence to show that the students were involved with gangs, he said.

The suspects told police they don't remember exactly how many people they killed, but they were told by their leaders that there were more than 40, Murillo said.

The abducted men were then burned at the dump in a fire that was kept alive for at least 14 hours by adding diesel fuel, tires and debris, the attorney general said.

"I know the huge pain this information gives the families, a pain that we all share in solidarity," Murillo said.

The protests spread to the capital, where tens of thousands marched this week demanding that the missing students be found alive.

The governor of Guerrero state -- criticized for not acting quickly enough after the abductions -- has taken a leave of absence.
