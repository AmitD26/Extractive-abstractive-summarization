That was two years ago, after the world's youngest country split from its northern nemesis, Sudan.

"I remember the look on people's faces," Bucciarelli said. "Tired but happy, hopeful for a better future after a past full of pain and war."

His return in February was anything but.

This time, Bucciarelli found a nation on the brink of an abyss. Instead of jubilant faces of hope, he saw defeated faces haunted by a return of ghosts of past wars.

Months of ethnic violence had left thousands dead, 1.5 million people displaced and a looming famine, according to the United Nations.

Bucciarelli found despair cramped in tent camps, growing sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers.

His goal, he said, is to tell the stories of people rendered powerless by wars, provide objective images and shed light on human rights issues.

"It's hard to find front-line war photography of the kind we've seen in Libya or Syria," Bucciarelli said. "The images in South Sudan are different. They describe visually the effect of the impending war, lending you a view of the civilian and military populations and providing a glimpse of life inside a murky, not clearly defined conflict."

The latest conflict erupted in December last year, when President Salva Kiir accused his fired deputy, Riek Machar, of an attempted coup. Since then, militia loyal to both have battled each other and targeted civilians from rival tribes.

Bucciarelli's pictures provide a rare window into a civilian population under siege.

"South Sudan's war represents one of the longest and most forgotten African conflicts," he said. "Its tragic consequences are quietly fading away from the headlines, making these pictures even more crucial."
