Storm claims the Danish intelligence agency offered payments totaling 1.5m Danish Krone ($260,000) over a five-year period.

Instead he told Jyllands-Posten his extraordinary story -- which spanned five years and several trips to Yemen as a double agent -- as well as a close relationship with CIA officers, according to Storm's account.

The revelations, backed up extensive corroborating evidence, have sent shock waves through Denmark, and led to calls for greater oversight of the country's intelligence services. Danish law prohibits the security services from being involved in assassinations.

The Danish biker and the trail that led to Al Qaeda's most wanted

"We have documented clearly that the Danish secret service took part in mission to locate Anwar al-Awlaki and that raises the question because, it was known at the time the U.S. was ready to kill him if they had the chance," Jyllands-Posten editor Pierre Collignon told CNN.

The disclosure Sunday by Storm of the cash offer has heightened the political controversy in Denmark, and led to allegations Danish authorities were trying to cover up illegal activity.

Storm had previously provided Jyllands-Posten an audio recording from this summer in which one of his Danish intelligence handlers appeared to hold out the possibility of payments.

"What annoys me about is the way you treated me last year with Anwar," Storm is heard saying on the recording. "Yes, yes. But that's it, [we're] trying to make up for [it] now," his handler replied, according to Jyllands-Posten.

There is firm evidence that Storm, a former biker and petty criminal, moved within jihadist circles after converting to Islam in the late 1990s -- becoming known as Murad Storm.

Storm detailed three attempts by the Western intelligence agencies to locate and target al-Awlaki.

But al-Awlaki had already left.

Storm said he arranged the match after al-Awlaki had requested he find him a Western bride during a previous meeting. Though Storm said he was paid $250,000 by the CIA for arranging the match, the operation failed after the AQAP operatives told Aminah to repack her luggage before traveling from Sanaa to Yemen's southern tribal areas to marry al-Awlaki.

Storm said he felt betrayed after a CIA agent claimed to him, during a meeting that he recorded,  that a different operation had netted al-Awlaki, and this was a significant factor in his decision to go public.

Magnus Ranstorp, one of Scandinavia's leading counterterrorism experts, told CNN that Storm's decision to go public was likely a source of significant embarrassment to his handlers.

"It is so rare that two services completely mishandle, misjudge him, and he is able to come to meetings and he has a phone and he is able to record them," Ranstorp, the research director at the Swedish National Defence Academy, told CNN.

Al-Awlaki's Croatian bride's 'identity revealed'

The Croatian newspaper Vecernji List, in articles published Wednesday and Thursday, claimed it had unveiled the true identity of the Aminah, the Croatian women Storm arranged for al-Awlaki to marry in the hope she would lead the CIA to his location.

The newspaper identified Aminah as Irena Horak, 35, who had previously worked in a care home in Zagreb and had converted to Islam in 2008, and it posted several pictures of her.

The two started a long-distance relationship, but after throwing herself into her new religion, Horak came to feel her boyfriend was not sufficiently devout because he drank alcohol and failed to wake up for morning prayers. That resulted in her leaving him, according to the newspaper.

"She was looking for someone more radical and found him in al-Awlaki," the newspaper reported.

Family and friends of Horak told Vecernji List they had been shocked by the news that she had traveled to Yemen to marry al-Awlaki. She had told them she was going overseas for language study.

Storm told Jyllands-Posten he first came into contact with Aminah, the Croatian convert, in late 2009 through Facebook, and that she soon warmed to the idea of marrying al-Awlaki.

"This recording is done specifically for Sister Aminah at her request ... I pray Allah guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter. And guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this proposal," al-Awlaki said, in a section posted on the Jyllands-Posten website.

Storm said Aminah burst into tears when she heard these words.

She then recorded two short videos for al-Awlaki. In the first video, she wore a full black veil with just her face visible. Speaking in heavily accented English, she said: "I will accept everything that is needed to do now this way that I have chosen and Inshallah Allah will help us."

In the second video, Aminah took off her veil and said: "Brother, it's me without the scarf, so you can see my hair ... I hope you are happy with me, Inshallah," according to Jyllands-Posten.

After al-Awlaki's death in September 2011, Aminah continued to communicate with Storm through encrypted messages, unaware that he had been working with Western intelligence. A few months ago, she said she was working on Inspire, the online magazine of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP.
