The club, which is renowned as the home of golf, voted last September to end its male-only membership rule, breaking with a 260-year tradition.

Princess Anne, who is also a member of the International OIympic Committee, and Sweden's Sorenstam, were granted honorary membership status.

Princess Anne, the only daughter of reigning monarch Queen Elizabeth II, joins three other members of the British royal family in becoming an honorary member of the R&A.

The club, founded in 1754, organizes golf's oldest major, the British Open, and also administers the rules of the sport from its famous headquarters in St Andrews in Scotland.

The R&A had come under increasing pressure to admit women members, with former British prime minister Gordon Brown among leading public figures to voice their concerns on discriminatory grounds.

It eventually followed the lead set by the exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in the United States, which admitted its first two female members, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and business leader Darla Moore in August 2012.

In the R&A vote last year, 85% of its members backed the move to admit women members in an historic ballot.
