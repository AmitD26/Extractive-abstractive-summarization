Today Cordy Tindell "C.T." Vivian and Bayard Rustin were among 16 people honored with the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Civil Rights movement: No ammo necessary

Violent encounters of the Southern kind

C.T. Vivian got you into college

When Vivian created a college readiness program during the civil rights era, he said it was a way to "take care of the kids that were kicked out of school simply because they protested racism." Years later the U.S. Department of Education used his Vision program as a guide to create Upward Bound, which was designed to improve high school and college graduation rates for students in under-served communities.

Throw Jim Crow from the train

In the late 1970s Vivian founded the National Anti-Klan Network, an anti-racism organization that focused on monitoring the Ku Klux Klan. Soon after it was founded, the name and direction changed because "it was bigger than the Klan," said Vivian in a phone interview. "We called it the Center for Democratic Renewal because the whole culture had to be renewed if it truly was going to be a democratic one." Vivian said they viewed the Center For Democratic Renewal as "the political side" of  what they were doing with the SCLC, which was focused on the country's morality struggles during the civil rights movement.

A minority within a minority

Rustin faced oppression on two fronts:  as a black man in the Jim Crow era and as an openly gay man during a time when being "out" was effectively illegal. He was even arrested on a public indecency charge. His early activism as a communist was enough to raise the ire of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI, but it wasn't just before the March on Washington that the intelligence chief attempted to slow the movement's progress by attacking Rustin, the march's deputy director. Hoover reportedly supplied Rustin's arrest record to segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond, who used the information to publicly attack Rustin on the Senate floor.
