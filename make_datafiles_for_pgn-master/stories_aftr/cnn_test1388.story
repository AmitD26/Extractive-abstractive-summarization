(CNN) -- "This is not what I planned," Paris Hilton told Piers Morgan in reference to the infamous sex tape that the CNN host said "catapulted" the heiress "into the celebrity stratosphere" when it was released back in 2003.

The heiress, socialite, TV personality, model, singer, fashion designer and one woman brand is a guest on Tuesday's "Piers Morgan Tonight."

"I didn't want to be known as that," continued Hilton. "And now when people look at me they think that I'm something I'm not just because of one incident one night with someone who I was in love with.

"People assume 'Oh, she's a slut' because of one thing that happened to me and it's hard because I'll have to live with that for the rest of my life and explain it to my children. And it's something that's changed my life forever and I'll never be able to erase it."

Hilton was 20 when the tape was made and recently turned 30. She told Morgan that she feels like she's "really grown in the past couple of years." She said she hopes her new show on the Oxygen network, "The World According To Paris," will clear up the "many misconceptions" people have about her.

"This show is all real," she said. "I was finally ready to show who I really was, and I'm really honest in the show, and there's a lot of things in the show I can't even believe I'm going to let air. But I want it to be as real as possible and people to get to know me."

"Just growing up, my parents never spoiled us. They always made us want to do something on our own. I think I have a name where I have a lot to live up to and I didn't want to just be known as the Hilton granddaughter. I wanted to build my own empire and do something on my own and I think it's just something that runs in my blood, wanting to be creative and do big things."

"I've really grown a thick skin over the years and I've had so many things said about me, and it's hard," Hilton said. "But I feel like what else could happen at this point. Everything bad that could happen to a person has happened to me."

Kathy Hilton told Morgan that her daughter was a tomboy as a child, and that "she didn't even care about clothing or any of that until we moved to New York."

"I am so fortunate that my parents have been together forever," she said. "They're so supportive, they're there for me, they love me ... If I didn't have my parents, I don't know where I'd be today."

"I do very well for myself," said Paris. "I'm very proud of what I've done."

Hilton said her brand personifies "fashion, fun, excitement and amazing products."

He just makes me feel so safe," she said of Waits. "He's so loyal and he's my best friend. He's an incredible man. I'm honestly lucky."

While Hilton wouldn't say whether an engagement is in the immediate future, she said she couldn't imagine herself with anyone else, and that "I'd love to have a family and children in the next couple of years, definitely."

Asked how she wanted to be remembered, she told Morgan, "as someone who made people smile and one who enjoyed life to the fullest and was a good person with a good heart."
