Law enforcement officers have taken "one adult male into custody, and another adult male is being questioned" in relation to Arnold's case, the FBI said Friday in a statement.

Sidney Police Chief Frank DiFonzo told reporters later Friday that law enforcement officers in North Dakota -- including members of the Williams County Sheriff's Office, Williston police and the North Dakota Criminal Investigation Bureau -- helped arrest the first man, who is 47 years old.

That man is now being being held in a Williams County, North Dakota, jail.

The police chief declined to offer further details or answer questions "because this investigation is rapidly moving forward."

Arnold went running around 6:30 a.m. last Saturday in her small town in eastern Montana, but never returned home. Other than one of her running shoes found along her route, authorities had not indicated -- until Friday -- that there had been any sign of her.

A massive search effort involved hundreds of volunteers, as well as law enforcement authorities and National Guard members. Authorities on Wednesday "determined the prudent course of action is to scale back the ground search."

"We're such a small community, and crime is absolutely unheard of," said Christine Mullen, 26, a CNN iReport contributor who joined the search effort, even though she didn't know Arnold personally. "We don't lock our car doors. (We're) completely shocked."

Sidney Public Schools said that all sporting events for Friday had been canceled and "additional counselors (were) on hand" to help students cope.

He said that he couldn't fathom why anyone "would harm her in any way."

"She is a good person. She's kind, she's sincere," Arnold said of his wife. "She's a great teacher, a referee, she's a great wife and mother."
