(CNN)Jingle those bells, the holiday season is near.

Too near, for anyone who still hasn't managed to find something for that special traveler in their life.

We've got a selection of cool gifts for every type of traveler.

GoPro Hero4 Silver

That means whether you're diving, skiing, surfing or strolling through a quaint town, all those travel memories can be captured in high-definition and shared within minutes thanks to its built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

Hornet mini-stove

Admittedly there aren't many situations where kit needs to be streamlined so keenly that a camping stove that folds down to the size of a lipstick is desirable.

And, if anyone does find themselves huddled on the side of a mountain waiting for their tiny burner to warm up a vacuum pack of gelatinous gloop, it's maybe time to rethink their vacation plans.

That said, the tiny, lightweight (44 grams) Hornet is such a cool concept, it's worth slipping into the tiniest backpack just in case an emergency casserole is needed.

The Hornet FMS-300T Mini-Stove starts from about $44 and is available online at Fire-maple.com.

Some lucky travelers already get to enjoy Gilchrist and Soames' London collection in their hotel rooms.

The rest of us are grateful the toiletry collection is available online.

The Gilchrist & Soames London Traveller kit includes essentials like shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and lip balm, all in a felt travel tote.

Air passengers can deploy these to envelop themselves in a haze of red tea, soy and grape seed that will cunningly conceal the fact they've been in transit for 24 hours.

We don't just love this watch for its shiny, pretty face.

The globe at the six o'clock position displays time zones and a day/night indicator. And in case there's any doubt over whether it's EST or CST, major time zones are shown on the back of the watch.

Daines and Hathaway Triple Bar Set

Fill two of the flasks with gin, one with vermouth to create a to-go martini wrapped up in a neat leather case.

From $299, available for purchase at Pittards

"Travel: The Guide" by Doug Lansky

From "best of" guides to every Palookaville on the planet to navel-gazing meditations on the inner journey some find on the backpacker circuit, travel books come in all types.

No wonder Peter Moore -- author of "Vroom with a View," one of our 15 funniest travel books ever -- blurbed it as "seriously brilliant!"

This is no ordinary flap of cloth.

We've always loved putting on anything made by Michigan-based outdoor shoemaker Merrell.

Get it?

OK, it's a corny pitch line, but shoes like this are meant to be worn out not talked about.

Men's All Out Blaze ($130), women's All Out Blaze Aero Sport ($110). More info at Merrell.com

La Mer's Sculpting Collection

Nobody wants to lug their entire skincare collection on vacation, yet holidays are when our hides tend to take the worst beatings.

For those who've been exposed to too much sun, chlorine, salt water or dry airplane air, there's the La Mer Sculpting collection, which includes three signature power-treatments for skin: The Treatment Lotion, The Eye Concentrate, The Lifting Contour Serum and Creme de la Mer.

Those not familiar with the brand, owned by Estee Lauder, will become believers after one dose of the Creme de la Mer. Instant results.

$440, available at Cremedelamer.com

Bike-powered Siva Cycle Atom battery charger

Cycling and cell phones go together like Lance Armstrong and denial, so its a pity that GPS navigation and fitness apps aimed at riders suck down battery power so rapidly.

There's even a detachable battery so riders can carry away some power in their pocket after the cycling's done.

The Atom, $129, available at Sivacycle.com

Instagrammed-up cell phones have cast a long shadow over the old school wait-and-see funky photography of Lomo cameras.

The new Lomo'Instant, Lomo's first instant camera, redresses this by shortening the wait for film to be developed without compromising the camera's artsy vibe.

Lomo'Instant Sanermo camera comes with three lenses -- fisheye, portrait and closeup.

From $169, available online at Shop.lomography.com

Sarah Jessica Parker has one. So does Cara Delevingne.

Which means couture-obsessed travelers would probably also love Burberry's new color-block wool and cashmere reversible blanket poncho.

The sizable poncho is a stylish inflight snuggie as well as a functional off-flight fashion item.

Initials can be added when ordering.

From $1,395, available at Burberry.com

Then there's those middle-of-nowhere camping trips that see travelers willing to wrestle a crocodile if it'll get them a fresh cup of espresso to start the day.

This is where the Handpresso comes in -- a small, portable manual espresso machine that uses ground coffee or E.S.E. espresso pods.

The Outdoor Hybrid set comes with four unbreakable cups, an insulated flask to keep water hot and a small reusable napkin.

An unruffled suit is an elusive holy grail for business travelers.

A new piece of luggage, cleverly called "SuitPack," has taken a proven (we've tried it several times) creative approach to the problem. Several devices, including shoulder pads, are used for folding the suit.

To order and for more details: suit-pack.com

Jo Totes Georgia Nautical camera bag

A camera that's getting knocked around and filthy isn't going to take great travel photos.

The Jo Totes Georgia Nautical camera keeps equipment safe -- it's stylish, too.

It has adjustable interior pads and plenty of extra pockets, so it can be used as a stylish everyday bag or carryall weekender.
