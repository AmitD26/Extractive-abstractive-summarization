With world leaders gathering in hopes of forging a deal to reduce the emissions blamed for increasing global temperatures, Ban told reporters that "Nature does not negotiate with us."

"We have a chance -- a real chance, here and now -- to change the course of our history," he said. But both industrialized and developing countries "can and they must do more."

"This is a time to stop pointing fingers," Ban added. "This is a time to start looking in the mirror and offering what they can do more of."

John Holmes, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said the impacts of climate change are more likely to be felt by developing countries.

"This is something that's happening now," he said. "Climate change has a human face, and that face is represented in part by the most vulnerable and poorest people in the world."

But Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the summit's host, said he remained confident an accord could be struck by week's end if governments were "ambitious."

"We can do this by Friday," he said. "I've chosen to be optimistic about that."

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that Washington is ready to do its part to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, but other countries must play their part as well.
