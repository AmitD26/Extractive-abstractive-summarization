You can roll it, ferment it, dry it and put holes in it.

That's because it's served with live maggots.

It does have a fan base in Sardinia, where sheep farmers for centuries have made pecorino cheese and left it to rot and attract flies.

When the flies' eggs hatch the transformation takes place and the cheese becomes Casu Marzu.

It's then consumed with relish or perhaps trepidation -- it has an aftertaste that lasts for hours.

Where to try it: Casu Marzu contains live insects so it can't be imported. Sardinia is therefore still the best option at associations such as Agugliastra in Lanusei, Sardinia; www.agugliastra.it.

Milbenkase (Germany)

Just when you thought the Italians took the proverbial cheese for their maggots, along come the Germans with their mite excrement variety.

The mites excrete an enzyme to ripen the cheese that turns it progressively yellow, red-brown and then black, at which point it's eaten, mites and all.

Bitter and zesty, the cheese is said to have curative effects for allergies to house dust.

If you'd like some cheese with your mites, there's a mite-shaped memorial in Würchwitz -- in the hollow base there's some Milbenkase left for passersby to try.

Yak cheese (Tibetan communities)

When it dries out it's cut into pieces and allowed to dry, often over a wood fire.

It's earthy and tasty.

It's either suspended next to the ger/yurt entrance so anyone passing can stir it or it's tied to a saddle to achieve the same effect over a day's riding.

The airag is then added to boiled milk to curdle it, filtered through a fabric bag and pressed.

It can be eaten fresh or dried.

The dry variety is a popular snack out on the steppe, softened by soaking it in tea or soup.

Where to try it: Out on the Central Asian steppe in the ger/yurt of a nomadic family.

Nomadic herders across Africa have been milking their camels for centuries.

However, making cheese from camel milk is a more difficult process, so herders use camel rennet from pieces of the animal's stomach to coagulate the milk and create curds.

To enjoy camelbert options you'll have to visit supermarket shelves in Nouakchott, the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

It's also found in Kazakhstan.

Human milk cheese (New York)

When the freezer of New York chef Daniel Angerer started to overflow with his wife's breast milk, he decided to experiment with it rather than throw it out.

He blogged about the process online with photos of mother's milk with beets and romaine, dehydrated porcini mushroom and onion chutney.

For those feeling queasy, rest assured the cheese was never produced in his restaurant or sold.

As for commercial opportunities, lactating mothers can't produce anything like the quantity of breast milk needed to make large quantities of cheese.

Where to try it: Not yet commercially available.

American cheese

Technically, of course, American cheese isn't even real cheese -- ingredients include milk, whey, milkfat, salt, gelatine, milk powder, dyed orange, artificial flavors and oil.

The odd concoction is blended with a generic processed cheese to form the smooth, creamy and super-melty slices that are either loved, tolerated or abhorred around the United States.

Where to try it: Société d'Orignal, Montreal, Canada.

Reindeer milk cheese has been produced among the Sami communities in Finland for years.

The combined work of scientists and a cheese maker have resulted in the first cheese from the Kiwi bambi.

At $100 per liter, the rich deer milk isn't cheap, but with half of the world's farmed red deer production in New Zealand, farmers are getting excited about the possibility of having a product to sell beyond venison.

Where to try it: Buy it from Whitestone cheese company, North Otago, New Zealand.

Alpaca and llama cheese (Andean communities)

Comical though they may appear -- they even give the occasional spit and unusual noise -- they're a little tricky to milk.

Where to try it: Local markets, Andes region, South America.

Donkey cheese (Serbia)

About 25 liters are required to make just one kilogram of cheese.

That means the white, crumbly pule is both limited and costly.

Currently it goes for about €1,000 a kilo, or $576 a pound.

Cleopatra claimed her beauty was due to bathing in donkey milk.

Where to try it: In the Zasavica Special Nature Reserve, or buy it online at www.zasavica.org.rs.
