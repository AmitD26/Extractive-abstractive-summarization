Finding the most famous chimpanzees in the world is a task that would test the most intrepid of explorers.

Reaching the picturesque hinterland of Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania is just the start.

A two-hour boat ride across the vast waters of Lake Tanganyika follows. Finally, we disembark and begin to trek through the dense forests of Gombe for a further hour before the chimps in question are finally glimpsed.

It was close to this spot in 1960 that the Jane Goodall, the British primatologist widely regarded as the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees, began her near 55-year study of one specially selected chimp family.

The research of that one family and the subsequent generations it has spawned continues to this day, providing ever more fascinating insights into the behavior of the closest living relatives of human beings.

The magic of Gombe

"We have this incredible opportunity to know the chimps here now, and also their mothers and fathers and their grandmothers and all this incredible information that we have on them."

Researchers like Emily come from all over the world to study the chimps at Gombe.

There are an estimated 100 chimpanzees there today, broken up into three different communities. The group Goodall studied has the most, with around 60 members.

Meat eaters

Even after 50-plus years, researchers are still surprised by what they learn. Before the program began, chimpanzees were thought to be herbivores but Goodall saw them hunting monkeys and eating meat.

He points to the example of how chimps will look to reconcile and embrace one another after a fight or confrontation. "They have reassurance and forgiveness of things which go wrong," he said.

Human threat

In the dense forest and woodlands of Gombe, chimpanzees and other species are protected from the most destructive aspects of human behavior.

But that's not always the case in other sectors of the Tanzanian bush where large swathes of land have been transformed for agricultural purposes.

Sustainable farming

Through the Gombe-Masito Program, they aim to show villagers that sustainable agricultural techniques can bring both more income and a more vibrant habitat for all species.

Preventing deforestation also has the knock on effect of ensuring sediments from the forest continue to run into Lake Tanganyika, maintaining the finely balanced ecosystem beneath the water and the trade of the fisherman in lakeside communities as a result.

These deep environmental connections are enough to convince some that chimpanzees are key to the future of rural Tanzania.

"In my opinion, chimps are important for the country's economic growth," said Aristides Aloice Kashula, a Gombe-Masito Program forest officer. "They can be used as a national symbol for tourist attraction into this area of Tanzania, generating income which should later be used for sustainable development of the communities."

That's a sentiment that Jane Goodall herself would be sure to endorse.
