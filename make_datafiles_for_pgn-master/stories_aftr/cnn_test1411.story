"The idea comes from having to catch the next connection flight in three minutes when the gate is on the other side of the world and you need to move faster than those moving walkways," Zagar tells CNN.

Disappointed with available luggage solutions to this problem, Zagar used his background as an automotive engineer and his time waiting for flights to sketch up an alternative.

Now, after three years of "testing, testing, testing," and a soon-to-finish fundraising campaign on Kickstarter, the Olaf is ready to hit the streets.

'Hardcore engineering'

Even with this sensible feature, Zagar says travelers in some parts of the world may be wary to step aboard.

"What we learned is the typical reaction in Europe was 'oh cool, I want to have one, but how will I look? People are staring at me.'

"This is the problem in Europe, people don't want to stand out from the crowd. For sure, it's not for the shy ones."

Olaf clearly has considerable appeal though.

With the final hours ticking down, Ljubljana-based Olaf's Kickstarter campaign has raised well in excess of its $27,000 target.
