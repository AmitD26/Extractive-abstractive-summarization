(CNN) -- I once took care of an 84-year-old woman with end-stage heart failure who told me she couldn't bear feeling short of breath any longer and pleaded with me to help her die. "Is November 15 a good day for you?" she asked.

"If you were like me, you'd say the same thing, doctor," she said ruefully. "I'm half gone. Nobody wants to bother with you when you're like this."

A couple of days later, I went to the ethics committee at my hospital.

I explained that surgeons had deemed my patient's condition inoperable. Over the past couple of months she had been hospitalized several times with extreme shortness of breath due to congestive heart failure and treated with intravenous drugs. When the drugs were stopped, her heart failure symptoms quickly returned. This cycle was repeated several times before the day she asked me to help her die.

"She just doesn't want to suffer anymore," I said. "She doesn't want to go through another episode of heart failure. She is absolutely terrified of it."

"But she isn't currently suffering," I replied.

The problem was that she could go into a heart failure exacerbation very quickly. She could suffer for hours before her shortness of breath was brought under control, and that was in the hospital where nurses were with her around the clock.

In the end, I put my patient on a morphine drip. With her and her family's permission, we arranged for home hospice care. But she never made it out of the hospital.

I thought of this patient when reading a terribly sad column on CNN.com by Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old with brain cancer who moved to Oregon so she can legally get a prescription for a drug that will end her life.

Through Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, passed in 1997, more than 1,100 people have obtained life-ending prescriptions. About 750 have used them. The law does provide safeguards against clinically depressed or mentally incompetent patients getting lethal drugs to end their lives. Four other states have enacted similar laws.

The number of American hospitals offering palliative care has nearly doubled since 2000, growing to nearly 1,500 programs -- the majority of hospitals. Perhaps the most surprising finding from these programs is that hospice patients live a month longer on average than similar patients who do not receive such care.

As a doctor, I would like assisted suicide to be safe and available, but rare.

Managing end-of-life care for patients like Brittany Maynard is never simple. I often think of what the elderly woman with terminal heart disease who asked me to help her die told me: "My husband said the hardest thing to do is to die; I always thought it would be easy."

He says he gets terminal patient Brittany Maynard's desire to die, supports choice in rare cases

But he says hospice care better option for terminally ill; allows dignity, comfort of home, family
