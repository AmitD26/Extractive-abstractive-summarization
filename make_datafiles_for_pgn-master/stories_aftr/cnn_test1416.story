The man accused of killing a dozen people in a shooting rampage at a Colorado movie theater had offered to plead guilty if authorities would spare his life.

Speaking directly with dozens of victims' family members, Brauchler said, helped inform his choice.

Many of them watched the prosecutor announce his intentions in court Monday.

Bryan Beard, whose close friend was killed in the massacre, said one thought ran through his mind: "Thank goodness. I am so happy this is happening."

New trial date

But the legal wrangling in the case is just revving up, and Holmes' trial won't begin until next year.

Public defender Tamara Brady argued that it is important to provide enough time to present arguments in the case.

"Your honor, this case is the most important matter this courtroom and this courthouse will ever hear," she said. "They're trying to execute our client."

Prosecutors took the defense to task for publicly offering it, saying they hadn't been given enough information to even consider such a deal.

"Not only improper, but grossly improper," prosecutors said in a Thursday court filing.  "For the intended purpose of generating predictable publicity."

Federal agents have said the 25-year-old former University of Colorado doctoral student planned the attack for months.

Authorities said Holmes booby-trapped his apartment with explosives, then traveled to the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, armed with weapons, tear gas and body armor. He planned to ambush audience members during a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises," authorities said, and he did.

Witnesses who spoke to CNN said the gunman roamed the theater, shooting randomly as people tried to scramble away or cowered between seats.

Tom Teves, the father of shooting victim Alex Teves, told CNN's Piers Morgan Live Monday night that he thinks Holmes should get the same mercy he showed his victims.

Attorneys prepare an insanity defense

Holmes faces 166 counts of murder and attempted murder for the shooting.

His parents sat among reporters in the courtroom during Monday's hearing. As the prosecutor announced his plans to pursue the death penalty, Holmes' father put his arm around his mother. Both of them rocked back and forth.

Eerie sounds of cell phones amid disaster

In the documents filed last Wednesday, his attorneys said they were still exploring a mental health defense, "and counsel will vigorously present and argue any and all appropriate defenses at a trial or sentencing proceeding, as necessary."

Peter Burns was outraged at the possibility of an insanity defense.

"I think this is an act," Burns told CNN Monday. "I think this coward that shows up every day in court with this aloof look in his eyes that he's just spaced out -- well, I can't imagine somebody pulling off something like this to be in that case. I think as soon as he knows he goes into the courtroom, he knows exactly what's going on."

Burns said he wanted Holmes to receive the toughest punishment possible, but he questioned whether the death penalty -- with the lengthy court proceedings and appeals that come with it -- was the right approach.
