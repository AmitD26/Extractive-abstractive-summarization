In an effort to purge its national police force of corruption, the Honduran Congress voted to empower its military to carry out most police duties for at least 18 months.

"We cannot have an armed forces only for foreign threats when there are so many deaths in the country because of violence," Juan Orlando Hernandez, president of the Congress, said before the vote. "We are making this decision to support the Honduran people."

Honduras has the world's highest murder rate, with 82.1 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. According to a recent report by the country's own human rights commission, that rate could increase to 86 per 100,000 this year.

The military's expanded powers would be in effect for at least 18 months, during which a purging process of the police will take place. The decree gives the military the power to make arrests, searches, and execute warrants in police matters.

The approval of the decree is a sign that the country has admitted that the police force alone does not have the resources to reduce crime, he said.

But there is also a high level of distrust of the police among the public. Earlier this month, the country placed 176 officers under investigation for a range of alleged crimes, from corruption to murder.

As a result, there were cases in which the military had to let suspected drug traffickers or other criminals escape because there was not a police officer available to make an arrest, Flores said.

"The new decree authorizes the armed forces to make captures without a police presence," Flores said.

The military's new policing powers draw comparisons to Mexico's criticized military offensive against the drug cartels, but Flores said that isn't the case.

The locations for domestic military operations and their size will depend on what the president authorizes, but Flores estimated the initial force will involve between 1,000 and 1,500 troops.
