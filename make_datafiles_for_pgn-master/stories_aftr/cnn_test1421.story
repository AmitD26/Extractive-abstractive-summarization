"Are you open yet?" a passerby asked. It was 10 a.m. on a sunny fall day here, where a small group of staffers met a CNN camera crew outside of Smitten Ice Cream.

By the time the doors officially opened two hours later, a handful of others had inquired about when they could get a scoop. The people wanted their ice cream.

Using seasonal and local ingredients, Fisher's team creates creative flavors like cinnamon apple crisp, maple brown sugar squash and Meyer lemon gingersnap. Smitten doesn't use preservatives, emulsifiers or stabilizers in any of its ingredients.

"We do get super nerdy about our ice cream and we get nerdy because we think it makes a better product," said Fisher.

After a few years in the corporate world and attending the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Fisher decided to follow a childhood dream.

"My mom used to tell me that I had two stomachs and one of those was solely reserved for ice cream," Fisher said.

Each order takes about 90 seconds to make and many customers took full advantage of that wait by snapping pictures and videos of the Brrr machine in action. Brrristas pour in organic cream along with other ingredients and set the Brrr in motion. It whirrs and spins and the mixing bowls become surrounded by a fog of evaporating liquid nitrogen.

One of three different patents for the Brr machine is a double-helical beater that's designed to scrape every surface of itself and every surface of the bowl to develop the tiny ice crystals. It also has "smart" software that's programmed to know when the ice cream is ready to be served.

"A smaller ice crystal makes a smoother, more luscious texture," said Fisher, "so our ice cream is actually a lot creamier than other ice cream in addition to being a lot more fresh."

But before the brick-and-mortar store and the frenzy of foodie fans, Fisher had to hit the streets to dish out her treats. She rigged up a Radio Flyer wagon with a battery pack to power the Brrr and tweeted her location for the day.

"I tested a bunch of different flavors and I already had teamed up with our amazing chef, Robyn Lenzi, and so she made a different flavor every day. I'd pick it out at her house and go into the street."

The combination of fresh ingredients, the magic of the mixer, and word-of-mouth proved to be a winning combination.

Smitten plans to open up three new locations in the San Francisco area within the next year.
