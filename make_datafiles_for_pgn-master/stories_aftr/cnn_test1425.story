Police said they were investigating but did not know know who had toppled the monument. Ukraine's government news agency said a lawmaker with the nationalist Svoboda party claimed responsibility for the incident.

"This is the end of Soviet occupation," the party's Twitter account said. "End of (the) regime of shame and humiliation."

Kiev suspended talks with the European Union last month, angering many Ukrainians who say an EU agreement would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion.

The subsequent protests that have rattled the eastern European country are the biggest in Ukraine since the so-called Orange Revolution nine years ago, a populist movement that toppled the government.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Yanukovych on Sunday and told the Ukrainian president that he had "grave concern" about the situation, urging authorities not to resort to violence. Yanukovych told the U.N. chief that "consultations would be initiated to defuse the situation," the United Nations said.

Opposition leaders, who failed to force the government's resignation in a vote of no confidence in parliament last week, are counting on their supporters to voice their discontent.

Demonstrators flocked to the capital's Independence Square, many camping out in freezing weather as they demanded the government's ouster as well as early presidential and parliamentary elections.

Russia calls for 'stability and order'

Tens of thousands of anti-government activists met at noon in Kiev for a rally organizers hailed as the "1 Million March," hoping it would swell to 1 million people as the day went on.

The crowd waved Ukrainian and EU flags and chanted slogans such as "Ukraine is Europe." Some held pictures of Yanukovych's jailed chief political opponent, Yulia Tymoshenko.

In statements posted on her official website, Tymoshenko called on supporters to keep up their demands.

"Be prepared for the fact that the struggle will be long and difficult, instant victory impossible. But professional and well-planned, your joint struggle has a chance to finish the victory."

Opposition demands

Demonstrators held a similar rally December 1. The daily protests have mainly been peaceful, but there has also been some violence, drawing condemnation from Western governments.

The crowds often swell in size in the evenings as people leave work and join the protests.

Opinion: Why Ukraine's future lies with the EU, not Russia

"The two Presidents discussed current bilateral relations and preparations for the upcoming meeting of the Russian-Ukrainian Interstate Commission in Moscow," an official statement from Putin's office said.

One of the main reasons for Yanukovych's decision to backpedal on the EU talks is Russia's threat of trade sanctions and gas bill hikes. Yanukovych was also under pressure by the EU to free Tymoshenko.

The Orange Revolution that swept him from office in 2004, when he was prime minister, also swept Tymoshenko to power.

Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia in 2009. The United States and Europe see the punishment as politically motivated.
