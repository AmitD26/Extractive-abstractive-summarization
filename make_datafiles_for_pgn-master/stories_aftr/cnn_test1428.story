Its aim is to stay away from the "tyrant's financial system," ISIS said in a statement. It said it would issue another statement to explain the new currency's exchange rate, and where it can be found.

The currency will include seven coins: two gold, three silver and two copper.

The terror group, which calls itself the Islamic State, has seized large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.

How ISIS makes its millions

He said its funding comes from oil, ransom payments, taxes and the sale of stolen artifacts.

He added: "The difficulty, of course, with that kind of money is you can't just put that money in shoe boxes and place it under your mattress. It has to enter into the financial system at some point in time. So I think the Treasury needs to be focusing on banks -- banks in Qatar for example, and in Kuwait -- that may be the recipients and handling money for ISIS."
