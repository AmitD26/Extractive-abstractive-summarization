(CNN) -- Serena Williams shook off any rustiness after a month-long break from competitive tennis as she launched her quest for a sixth Miami title with a straight sets victory over Italian Flavia Pennetta.

The world No. 1 hasn't played since losing to Victoria Azarenka in the final of the Qatar Open on February 17 but made light work of her unseeded opponent winning 6-1 6-1.

Williams, a 15-time grand slam winner, pulled out of the Dubai Tennis Championships after her defeat in Doha complaining of a back injury but looked in good touch as she raced to victory in just under 80 minutes.

"I think I missed a few shots, but only because I think I was off footwork-wise," she told reporters. "But it's always just good just to win a match and stay in the tournament and keep going.

"I felt like I should be putting the balls away for my opponent but she was so quick and she was running every ball down."

"I was happy to have a quick match," Radwanska was quoted as saying on the WTA Tour's official website. "The first match is always a little bit tough and tricky, especially after Indian Wells, where we had a little bit of different conditions.

"I definitely have great memories from here. And the final was a very good match. Hopefully I can play the same level of tennis this year. I will do everything to hold the trophy again."

"I wasn't nervous before the match today, I was excited," Li told the WTA Tour website. "For the last six or seven weeks I haven't played any tournaments so I was happy to win my first match after such a long time.

"There were a lot of fans there to support me today, I was like, 'Wow!' My game was pretty good today, I followed the plan of what I should do. I just had to believe in myself that I could do it."
