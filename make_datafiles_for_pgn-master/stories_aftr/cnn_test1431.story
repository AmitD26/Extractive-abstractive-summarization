The family of a man who picked up a BB gun for sale at an Ohio Walmart and was shot dead by police has filed a federal lawsuit, claiming that the corporation and police are responsible for his death.

John Crawford III was black, and his family's lawyers Tuesday mentioned Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Michael Brown as they announced the suit -- evoking cases that have stirred international outrage because the three also were black and killed by police officers.

Grand juries chose not to indict officers in those cases, just as they decided not to indict police involved in Crawford's death in Beavercreek.

The shooting happened August 5. Crawford was shopping at Walmart and picked up a BB gun that wasn't packaged and had been sitting on the store shelf for two days, the Crawford family's lawyers said Monday.

Attorney Michael Wright said his legal team filed a federal civil lawsuit against two police officers; Beavercreek's police chief; the city of Beavercreek and its Police Department; and Walmart.

"We believe that had Mr. Crawford been white, he may have gotten a little bit more time to respond to the police officers," he said. "These officers came in, saw Mr. Crawford and shot him on sight. They didn't give him the opportunity to live."

Walmart spokesman Brian Nick expressed condolences to Crawford's family and to relatives of a mother who fled the scene of the police shooting with her daughter, had a heart attack and later died.

But Beavercreek City Manager Michael Cornell and police Chief Dennis Evers have requested that the FBI review the case to determine whether there were civil rights violations.

The Justice Department is investigating the police shooting.

"We acknowledge the family's right to bring this action and are confident the trial will be fair and impartial. We believe the evidence will prove that the officer's actions were legally justified," the city said in a statement.

The lawsuit asserts Crawford was an innocent shopper whom police gunned down.

The suit contends that the two officers "failed to take steps to assess whether any of the information provided by the 911 caller or dispatcher was accurate before Williams shot and killed Mr. Crawford, though they had an obligation to do so."

Ohio concealed carry laws don't regulate "open" care of firearms, so the open carry of firearms is "a legal activity in Ohio," the state's attorney general office says.

As such, the lawsuit contends, Crawford "was doing nothing wrong and in violation of no law or ordinance in the moments leading up to his death" and "was doing what people do in stores -- shop."

Williams shot and killed Crawford "approximately one second after Defendant Williams or Darkow first made contact with him," the suit said. "As a result, Mr. Crawford was shot before he even had time to react to the officer's presence, much less to comply with any verbal commands Defendants Williams or Darkow may have made."

The Crawford family is seeking at least $75,000 in compensatory damages and an unstated amount for punitive damages, the suit said.

The family alleges, among other things, that the police officers did not use due diligence to determine that Wright wasn't a threat; that the officers didn't give him enough time to put down the weapon; and that Walmart was negligent because the air rifle had been resting on a shelf, unpackaged and unsecured, for at least two days, the family's lawyers said Tuesday.

The suit also accuses the police chief of failing to properly train and supervise the two officers.

Crawford was the father of a baby son, Jayden, born last March, the suit said.
