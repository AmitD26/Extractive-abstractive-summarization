Police have ruled out suicide, Burbank Police Sgt. Chris Canales said. Plitt, 37, was shooting video with a small crew on the southbound track of the Burbank Metrolink station when an oncoming train struck him.

Witnesses told police the train horn was blaring at the time of the accident, Canales said. It is unclear whether the crew captured footage of the incident.

Bravo's Andy Cohen said Plitt "seemed invincible, like Superman," someone who was "as nice as he was beautiful."

Condolences and tributes also poured into his Facebook page.

"RIP Greg. You will always be remembered and will continue to motivate and inspire countless people!"
