Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)The embattled police here are testing something no other department in America has tried, in an effort to prevent another potentially explosive incident in which an officer kills an unarmed civilian.

Ferguson police are evaluating a new attachment to their guns that could give a suspect a chance to live in an otherwise lethal encounter with police.

This latest piece of weapons technology is called "The Alternative," and it's an orange-colored plastic device mounted on a gun barrel that turns the first fired bullet into a pingpong ball-sized projectile, designed not to kill.

"It's something we're testing for ourselves and seeing if this is even something feasible or reasonable to use for law enforcement officers," Mayor James Knowles told CNN.

Protesters condemned police tactics as brutal and excessive against minorities, citing other police killings of black men, often unarmed.

When the gun is fired, the bullet embeds in a golf ball-sized metal bulb, attached at the muzzle. The bullet fuses inside the metal sphere, and the unit morphs into a speeding ball.

"It's gonna feel like you had a professional baseball player hit you in the chest with a hammer, so it is going to hurt," said Christian Ellis, the CEO of Alternative Ballistics. "There is a possibility that this could kill you, but it is very slight when you compare that to a bullet."

"It was actually created by a retired sheriff officer. He did not like the fact that people were being shot when the officers do have time (to consider options) but they had no other option in lethal force," Ellis said.

"So this product gives the officer another option in that scenario when it's not reactive, and they do have the time to put it on," he said, referring to mounting the device at the end of a gun barrel.

Ellis describes the technology as one more tool for an officer's belt. It provides an option that could spare the life of a threatening suspect.

"It's like an airbag for a bullet. So the risk is worth the reward to have an airbag in the car, and the risk is worth the reward if the officer can safely use our technology," he said.

The device isn't without controversy. It could put an officer's life in danger, some retired law officers say.

"Our problem is not with the device, our problem is with the concept. This device ignores the human factor," said Charles "Sid" Heal, a retired member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and a consultant on alternatives to lethal force.

He pointed out that The Alternative would be used in situations that could escalate with little warning, forcing officers to make yet another decision in a critical moment their lives may be on the line.

Rather, it's to be used when an officer has three or more seconds to decide.

During that time, an officer can place the attachment on the gun while pointing it at a suspect.

So far, The Alternative has never been tested on the human body, and it has not been used in real-life situations.

The projectile will still hurt and can even kill upon impact, but it's designed to stop, not kill
