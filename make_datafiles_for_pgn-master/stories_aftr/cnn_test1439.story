"I believe the evidence, but this revelation in my life has really helped me to take the blinders off and start to see things differently," Shellie Zimmerman told NBC's Matt Lauer on the "Today" show. Zimmerman was referring to the couple's struggles since the verdict, including an ugly spat earlier this month that resulted in police being called -- and headlines being made.

"I think anyone would doubt that innocence because I don't know the person that I have been married to," she said.

George Zimmerman was acquitted on July 13 in the death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman told police he shot the teen in self-defense.

Despite her doubts about her husband's innocence, Shellie Zimmerman said she believes he did not profile the teen, who is black.

"Yes, I do," she said.

Shellie Zimmerman has not pressed charges but police are still investigating the case. They say it could take months to recover video evidence from the damaged iPad.

While she stood by her man through his trial and the months of living "like gypsies" in the woods leading up to it, she said everything changed after the verdict.
