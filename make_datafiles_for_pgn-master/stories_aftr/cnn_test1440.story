(CNN)Nigerian forces fought off Boko Haram militants in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, military officials said Monday, but the extremists seized another town in the same state.

Hundreds of Boko Haram gunmen launched a predawn attack Sunday on Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state.

But a simultaneous attack on nearby Monguno town  was a different story.

It's unclear how many people were wounded or killed during the battle for the two cities.

Both cities are near the Chad and Cameroon borders, which would give the militants an entry point into those countries.

Borno Gov. Kashim Shettima said soldiers will continue their crackdown on the militants.

"So long as we have the resources, we will continue to regard the efforts to reclaim peace our No. 1 area of commitments," he said.

" I want to reassure the good people of Borno State that we will never abdicate from our responsibility as those they entrusted with leadership."

Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.
