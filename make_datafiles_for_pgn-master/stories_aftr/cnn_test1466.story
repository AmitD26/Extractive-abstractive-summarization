(CNN)With her hijab, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha may have stood out.

But in every respect, she felt that she fit in -- as a proud, and blessed, American.

Even if most of her North Carolina neighbors didn't wear the same Muslim head covering that she did, Mohammad believed that there were "still so many ways that I feel ... embedded in the fabric that is our culture," meaning the American culture.

"That's the beautiful thing here, is it doesn't matter where you come from," she said last summer as part of NPR's StoryCorps project. "There are so many different people from so many different places, ... backgrounds and religions. But here we're all one.

"It's beautiful to see. People of different areas interacting and being family, one community."

Yusor Mohammad's light, her idealism, was extinguished Tuesday with gunshots that killed not only her, but her 23-year-old husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and 19-year-old sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. All three were shot in the head. A neighbor of the victims, Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, turned himself in to police the same night and has been charged with murder.

The U.S. Department of Justice issued a statement Friday afternoon that said the department's Civil Rights Division, along with the the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of North Carolina and the FBI, have opened "a parallel preliminary inquiry" to determine whether any federal laws, including hate crime laws, were violated.

"No one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship," he said. "Michelle and I offer our condolences to the victims' loved ones.  As we saw with the overwhelming presence at the funeral of these young Americans, we are all one American family."

But 150 Islamic, Arab, Jewish, Sikh, Asian-American and other civil rights and faith groups want a closer look. In a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, they said there is enough circumstantial evidence to "warrant a federal hate crime investigation," an inquiry they say is important to the victims' families and Muslims across the United States.

"Federal leadership is necessary in this case in order to send the strongest message to the public that acts of violence like these have no place in civil society and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," the groups write. "... As American Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim now, more than ever, fear for their safety, the American people need to hear a strong message from our nation's chief law enforcement officer."

They aren't the only ones demanding action out of Washington.

Her family members were targeted because they were Muslims, Suzanne Barakat said, adding that Hicks terrorized her family and the slayings should be considered an act of terrorism.

"It's time people call it what it is," she said.

The story has gotten traction internationally. Al-Azhar, an Egyptian center of Islamic scholarship, has called the killings a "terrorist cowardly act" rooted in "racism and Islamaphobia."

Before Obama made his statement, Erdogan said, "President Obama, Mr. Kerry, (Vice President) Biden, at this point have not made any declaration of respect. This is telling. ... And if you stay silent when faced with an incident like this and don't make a statement, the world will stay silent towards you."

"These three people, as young as they were, were a source of inspiration, warmth and light for our community," said one woman speaking at the vigil.

He said his daughter told him, referring to the neighbor, "Daddy, I think he hates us for who we are and how we look."

"We were completely shocked because it's not normal for you to have a disagreement of some sort with your neighbor and for you to go over there with a gun," Ata said.

When the news came out about the slayings, that neighbor jumped to mind. Ata said "the only thing that really makes sense is that he didn't like them because they were different."

"If he went and maybe killed all the neighbors, maybe then we can be like, 'Oh, he has an issue,' " she said. "They were our friends, and we feel like they were targeted for a reason."

Karen Hicks, who has been in the process of divorce, said her husband had been at odds with various neighbors of various backgrounds over parking. That's what this is about, she said, contending that what happened is not a hate crime.
