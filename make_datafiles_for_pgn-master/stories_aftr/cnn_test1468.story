Hundreds of dolphins that washed up on Peruvian shores died of natural causes, a government official said in a radio interview Tuesday.

"One of the things that we can confirm is that ... the deaths of the dolphins were not caused by any human activity, and this is a very important subject," Peruvian Production Minister Gladys Triveno told RPP Radio.

The appearance of nearly 900 dead dolphins in a 220-kilometer (137-mile) area in northern Peru so far this year, and the deaths of thousands of pelicans there and in neighboring Chile, have sparked concern among local residents and environmentalists.

At least one Peruvian environmental group has said loud sounds from nearby oil exploration could be to blame for the dolphins' deaths.

"We see that in their bodies there are air bubbles caused by heavy pressure. These animals are underwater holding their breath, facing a sudden and violent noise. These animals release nitrogen, and this forms the bubbles that end up destroying living cells," Carlos Yaipen-Llanos of the Scientific Organization for the Conservation of  Aquatic Animals told CNN en Espa√±ol this month.

Government officials have dismissed that assessment, arguing that it is not supported by evidence.

The report explained that the dead dolphins began washing up on the shore before the seismic activity started and that similar activity in the past has not been linked to marine deaths.

It also called for an awareness campaign about Peruvian ocean life and its conservation, aimed at the general public.

In February, 179 dolphins --108 of which were dead -- washed ashore in Cape Cod, in the eastern United States, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Marine biologists are still trying to determine the cause of those deaths.

In early March, amateur video taken from a beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, showed more than 30 dolphins on shore. In that instance, all the dolphins were safely returned to the sea.
