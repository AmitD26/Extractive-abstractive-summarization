(CNN)Once again, the lure of ISIS may have ensnared another group of foreigners -- this time, medical students suspected of traveling to Syria to work in ISIS-controlled hospitals.

Ediboglu, an opposition lawmaker, told The Observer that he had spoken with the students' families, who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for ISIS, and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring Syria.

"They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think," Ediboglu said, according to the newspaper.

"Let's not forget about the fact that they are doctors," he told The Observer. "They went there to help, not to fight."

They have since "disappeared," the statement said.

Eight of the group are medical students who've just graduated, and the three others are in their final year of medical school, he said. They'd been studying in Khartoum, Sudan.

At least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the Turkey-Syria border, pleading for their return, according to The Observer.

Dr. Maumoon Abdulqadir said he was sending a message to his daughter, Lena, who is one of the students.

"I know you want to help people and be of use. But you can do this in another way," he told the newspaper. "There are many who need your help. But this is not the way. Please, come back."

Officials have warned that a growing number of foreign fighters are traveling to join ISIS' ranks. Estimates about how many medical personnel the group has recruited are harder to come by.

CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Nimet Kirac and Radina Gigova contributed to this report.
