The conflict is one of many revelations in a newly released promo for an upcoming episode of "The Dr. Phil Show."  In the clip, Gordon cries and laments missing Bobbi Kristina and her mother, the late Whitney Houston.

"I miss Krissy and Whitney so much," a tearful Gordon says. "I want them back."

"Let me be very clear, Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit," Bobby Brown said last month in a statement through his lawyers. The terms were not revealed.

In a Facebook post on Friday, Bobbi Kristina's aunt Leolah Brown wrote an open letter to Dr. Phil, claiming that Gordon is being investigated by the police regarding what happened to her niece.

"If Nick Gordon does not have the courage to speak with my brother Bobby Brown and/or law enforcement about what happened the day my niece's body was found in a bathtub, he does not deserve to have a platform to speak to anyone of your caliber until this investigation is concluded," she wrote.

"You've been drinking a lot though, right?" Dr. Phil asks before telling Gordon, "I want you to go straight to rehab."

According to People, Gordon did check into rehab after filming. The episode is scheduled to air Wednesday.
