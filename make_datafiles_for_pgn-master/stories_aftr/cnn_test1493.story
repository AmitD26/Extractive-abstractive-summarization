Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)Grieving women carried her coffin high on their shoulders in scenes many said they had never witnessed before in the Afghan capital.

Early reports suggested that Farkhunda was mentally ill, but her tearful father, Nadir, told CNN affiliate TOLOnews she was a religious teacher who taught the Quran to children. He said there was no way his daughter would burn pages of the holy book, which has been cited as the motive for the horrific attack.

Twenty-six people have been arrested in connection with the brutal killing, Afghanistan's Interior Minister Noorul Haq Ulumi said Monday in a statement before parliament.

TOLOnews reported that "in order to save his job and life," the mullah reportedly began shouting accusations that Farkhunda had burned the Quran.

Witnesses said a crowd gathered and hauled Farkhunda into the street.

Afghanistan's Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs said it had found no evidence Farkhunda burned the Quran. Meanwhile, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the killing as "heinous" and ordered a commission to investigate it fully.

Farkhunda's father said those guilty of killing his daughter should face justice: "I don't want blood of my daughter go in vain."

"We're very interested particularly to see what happens in terms of the investigation of the police behavior," said Patricia Grossman, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch.

"That was, for us, one of the most troubling aspects of this case -- that the police did not intervene adequately and properly to save her when there was an opportunity to do so."

On Sunday, as they watched Farkhunda's casket being carried to her grave, the crowd shouted "Kabul police officials should be fired," according to Afghan human rights activist Ramin Anwari.

"We are encouraged by initial reports of the arrest of several suspects, but call on the authorities to investigate this incident fully and bring to justice all persons who actively participated in the killing, or aided and abetted it," said Elzira Sagynbaeva, the representative  in Afghanistan for UN Women. She said the rise in cases of violence against women and girls in Afghanistan had become a "major concern" and must not be tolerated.

Grossman of Human Rights Watch said the attack was unusual because it took place in public and in the capital. However, she added,"Violence against women is rampant in Afghanistan. That's the kind of thing we'd like to see people address beyond this particular case."
