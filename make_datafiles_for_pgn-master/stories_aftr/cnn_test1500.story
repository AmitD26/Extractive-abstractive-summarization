(CNN)This week brought a dramatic turn of events in a small community outside of Detroit: A man bloodied during a traffic stop was cleared of all charges, the police officer who arrested the motorist is charged with beating him and the community's police chief has stepped down.

On Monday, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced charges of assault and mistreatment of a prisoner against William Melendez. He's the 49-year-old former Inkster, Michigan, police officer who is seen in police car dashcam video grabbing the unarmed motorist, Floyd Dent, around the neck while he lay on the ground and punching him several times in the head.

"The alleged police brutality in this case cannot and will not be tolerated," Worthy said.

"He busted out crying and was very emotional," said Angela Martin, the assistant to Dent's attorney.

In the wake of the reversal of fates, Police Chief Vicki Yost announced Wednesday her resignation, according to Inkster City Manager Richard Marsh.

Marsh would not cite a specific reason for Yost's investigation, though she had been the face of the Police Department during the investigation into her former officer.

In a statement, Dent and his attorney Greg Rohl told CNN: "We are all ecstatic, especially Mr. Dent. This is another step in the right direction. The system is still working, and we are very hopeful the prosecutor's net will catch even more fish in the near future."

Melendez pleaded not guilty to the new charges brought against him in an arraignment Tuesday at Inkster District Court, according to his lawyer, David Lee.

"I didn't bite anyone. I didn't have time to bite anyone. He was too busy pounding me in my head," Dent said.

"My client's fingerprints will not be on that bag," Rohl told WDIV.
