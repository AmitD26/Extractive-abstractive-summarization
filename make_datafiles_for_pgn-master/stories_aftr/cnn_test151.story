Beijing, China (CNN) -- After much speculation, it is now official: The Communist Party of China (CPC) will convene its 18th Party Congress in Beijing during the "latter half of this year," a party official announced this week without giving specific dates.

The political conclave, held every five years, will shape China's future. It will also formalize the accession of a new generation of leaders.

China has seen dramatic socio-economic transformation in recent years, but its political system remains opaque and antiquated. The Leninist, top-down system still does not allow direct, open elections.

A total of 2,270 delegates have been elected from across the country to represent the CPC's 82 million members.

Who are these delegates?

Ni Yulan and the agonies of Chinese justice

Although the CPC claims to represent the working class, only 169 (less than 8%) of the total delegates are workers.

Theoretically, the delegates play an important role.

About 300-member strong, the policy-making body is a motley group of provincial and city leaders, technocrats, military officers and party functionaries, plus token representatives from other sectors.

The Central Committee will then elect a new Politburo, the inner council currently comprising 25 members. The Politburo in turn will elect a new standing committee, the elite cabal empowered to make important decisions on policies.

The committee currently has nine seats, led by Chinese President and General Secretary Hu Jintao. Hu, 69, is expected to step down later this year. Media reports say the party plans to cut the seats down to seven, but Wang says there is no decision on the matter.

Bo Xilai and the politics of Chinese succession

But the race to China's pinnacle of power remains opaque.

He earlier served as party chief of the prosperous provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang and Shanghai, China's financial center.

Xi is a "princeling," a descendant of revolutionary veterans. His late father Xi Zhongxun, a contemporary of Deng Xiaoping, had served as governor of Guangdong province.

Li is already ranked 7th in the Politburo and, as executive vice premier, holds important portfolios, including economic development, finance, climate change and health care reform. Like Hu, Li is a native of Anhui province and honed his organizational skills when he headed the 73 million-strong Communist Youth League, a training ground for the party's young cadres.

Many of upcoming leaders used to work at CYL, which is why analysts speak if a "tuanpai," or CYL faction.

Other rising politicians include:

Li Yuanchao, 61, the minister of the CPC's Organization Department, the equivalent of the H.R. department, and more. With this portfolio, Li holds all the personnel dossiers and wields considerable power in appointing party and government officials nationwide.

A few Gen-Y leaders may be lined up for meteoric rise.

Among them is Hu Chunhua, 49, the party chief of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. No relation to the Chinese president, he is nonetheless another protÃ©gÃ© and also served as head of the CYL and is known as "Little Hu."

The other influential politician is Bo Xilai, the former Party chief of Chongqing who was dismissed last April for "serious breach of Party regulations." Bo's wife Gu Kailai, accused of premeditated murder of a British businessman, is now awaiting a court verdict.

The party has yet to formally decide on Bo's fate, but the signals are clear.

Bo is not among the 2,270 party members elected as Party Congress delegates.

That, analysts say, spells the end of his career.
