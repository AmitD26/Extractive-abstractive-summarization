WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso met with President Barack Obama on Tuesday making him the first head of state to be hosted by the new administration.

It was a long trip -- 6,800 miles (11,000 km) -- for a short meeting -- one hour -- and happened as Obama was preparing his first address to a joint session of Congress.

Obama said the U.S.-Japanese alliance would be crucial in solving international problems including climate change.

Aso said the global economy was also on the agenda at their meeting.

"We are the number 1 and second biggest economies of the world. We will have to work hand in hand.

"I think we are the only two nations which are powerful enough to solve those very critical, vital issue," Aso said.

Another topic likely to have been on the agenda was Japan's Asian neighbor North Korea, which U.S. intelligence says is preparing to test a long-range missile. Pyongyang has denied the charge, instead saying it is making preparations to launch a satellite.

Last week his finance minister Shoichi Nakagawa announced he will step down after coming under fire for appearing intoxicated at a weekend news conference during the G-7 meeting in Rome.

CNN's Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report.
