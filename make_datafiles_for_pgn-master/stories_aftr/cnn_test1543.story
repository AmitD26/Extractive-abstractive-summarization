(CNN) -- Pontiac lovers are feeling nostalgic and mournful Monday amid General Motors announcement that it will end production of the car.

Pontiac models, such as the 1969 GTO, helped usher in the era of the muscle cars, enthusiasts say.

"I had two brothers, and they each had one of these cars," she said. "The GTO represented the suburban culture of its time, heavily laden with root beer and plain beer."

"Those were the days of Bob's Big Boy [hamburger restaurant], when girls wore skates. Back then we pleasantly wasted gas looking for fun. It was a social thing."

The GTO's success not only buoyed GM but helped jumpstart the high-performance market for Detroit's Big Three automakers -- and ushered in the era of the vehicle as status symbol.  Watch GM's CEO explain why the company is cutting Pontiac Â»

Pontiac's other emblematic performance car, the Firebird Trans Am, featured the outline of a firebird on the hood -- the whole hood. It enjoyed a rise in popularity and brisk sales after being featured in the "Smokey and the Bandit" movie franchise beginning in the late 1970s.

In February, GM announced the end of the Saturn and Hummer lines while casting a ray of hope for Pontiac enthusiasts by saying that the brand would survive but be scaled back to a niche product.

GM could file bankruptcy as a June 1 deadline looms. In the midst of pressure from the Obama administration to present a restructuring plan that shows the company's long-term viability, the automaker recently released a statement to downplay fears that brands Americans have patronized for generations are on the chopping block.

"General Motors has not announced any changes to its long-term viability plan or to the future status of any of its brands," the automaker said Friday in a statement on its Web site.

"I think it's crazy [to end the brand]," Max Thompson of Huntsville, Alabama, said. "I think they ought to streamline versions of Pontiac. Just take it to a few models. Make it special, but not get rid of it because it's too iconic." ireport.com: See Thompson describe his wheels

Thompson, 46, said his 1973 Firebird Formula had him sold when he saw the stylistic front end.

"I like the engine, I only got the V6. ... I want to get the G8," Hemgesberg said.

When asked if he pushed the engine, Hemgesberg, 22, let out a telling laugh. "Yeah," he said.
