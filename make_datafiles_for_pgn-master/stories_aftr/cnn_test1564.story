TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Marching in dramatic silence, many with tape over their mouths, hundreds of thousands of Iranians kept alive public support for opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi Wednesday even as the government stepped up efforts to thwart daily protests calling for a new presidential election.

Supporters of defeated reformist candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi line the streets of Tehran Wednesday.

Large crowds gathered in Haft-e-Tir Square in central Tehran Wednesday evening for a fifth day of protests, according to witnesses. The demonstrators are demanding that officials throw out the results of the balloting Friday that kept hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in power.

Referring to those who have died or been wounded "as a result of illegal and violent clashes" with his opponents, Moussavi urged people to gather in mosques and holy sites and wear "mourning symbols" in a show of sympathy and support for the families.

Iran is also investigating reports of violence at a Tehran University dormitory in the wake of rallies sparked by last week's disputed election.

Moussavi and former President Mohammad Khatami sent a joint letter asking Iran's courts to quell post-election violence and release protesters who have been arrested. The letter, posted on Moussavi's Web site, said, "the use of violence against ordinary people, raiding people's residences just because they chant the sacred phrase of Allh-o-akbar (Allah is great), beating up women and men, destroying buildings" is not in line with the standards of the Islamic Republic.

For a second day Wednesday, pro-Moussavi marchers urged their peers to march silently -- perhaps as a way of keeping a low profile in the face of riot police, witnesses told CNN.

Protesters held placards and posters reading, "Where is my vote?" and "Freedom," the witnesses said. Some held signs that said "Silence" and put their finger to their lips.

Several business owners reported that they closed up shop early so their employees could attend Wednesday's rally.

"The people of Iran are finally fed up with the lies, the temperament, the foolish actions of Ahmadinejad," a 20-year-old Iranian man told CNN.

Citizens were barred from using typical means of getting Iran's stories to the outside world, but amateur videos and photos blossomed on sites such as YouTube and CNN's iReport. The content was impossible to verify in most cases, and much of it was posted anonymously or through third parties, some with little information. iReport.com: On the ground in Iran

Iran's Revolutionary Guard corps said it will pursue legal action against Web sites that it said were inciting people to riot. The Guard, a military unit that enforces the government's Islamic codes and morality, blamed U.S., British and Canadian companies, including American intelligence agencies, for financially and technically supporting the Web sites.

Despite the Guard's threats, defiant Moussavi backers stood firm.

"We are fighting with our lives and the world is just watching," said Ali, a Tehran University student who requested his last name not be used. "They see how the government is trying to silence us, how they are beating us -- but they don't come to our help. It's OK. We will succeed, even if we have to fight alone."

Human rights group Amnesty International, which is monitoring the situation through media reports and a network of local correspondents, said people had protested in Tabriz and Bobol in the north, Shiraz in the south and Mashad and Zahedan in the east.

A video on CNN's iReport site by a third party showed several people who apparently had been shot, purportedly in the city of Esfahan, about 200 miles south of Tehran, and others attempting to treat them without medical supplies.

"The police are everywhere you look," she said. "They hurt and arrested so many people last night that no one wants to go out."

U.S. President Barack Obama has voiced "deep concerns" about the elections, as has the European Union. But neither has dismissed the election results outright.

Counter-demonstrations by Ahmadinejad backers have also drawn thousands, reflecting a deep fissure in the country.

Iran's all-powerful leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appealed to the citizenry to stand behind the Islamic republic. He is to deliver a sermon Friday that will be closely watched for a sign of how the government plans to resolve the stalemate.
