Walter Kendall Myers, 72, and his wife, Gwendolyn Myers, 71, are charged with conspiracy to act as illegal agents of the Cuban government, wire fraud and providing classified information to Havana, according to court documents.

U.S. Magistrate John Facciola ordered the couple Wednesday held without bail after a prosecutor said they posed a flight risk.

Investigators found a calendar showing that the couple planned to sail to the Caribbean in November, federal prosecutor Michael Harvey told the court.

The two have the financial means to obtain false documents and flee to Cuba with their sailboat or through Mexico or Canada, he said.

The judge allowed the couple to meet briefly with their son after the court proceedings, but turned down the request to allow them to go home.

A senior State Department official said Kendall Myers was an "upper-level civil service employee" at the Bureau of Intelligence and Research who "had come up in the ranks."

U.S. officials did not discuss the Myerses' motives for their alleged work for the Cuban government.

Conviction on the wire fraud charge would carry a sentence of up to 20 years; illegally acting as an agent of a foreign government would carry a sentence of up to 10 years; and the conspiracy charge would carry a sentence of up to five years.

Myers retired from the State Department on October 31, 2007. He had viewed more than 200 classified reports on Cuba in his final months, even though he was an analyst on European issues at the time, court documents say.
