Cutie, 40, announced last month that he was leaving the Catholic Church and joining the Episcopal Church.

Cutie, whose name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, is a native of Puerto Rico, and Canellis was born in Guatemala.

Cutie -- sometimes called "Father Oprah" because of the advice he's given on Spanish-language media -- shocked some in the Catholic community when photographs of him embracing a bathing-suit-clad woman emerged last month in TV Notas magazine.

He acknowledged having carried on a two-year relationship with the woman, who at that time had not been publicly identified.

"This is something I've struggled with," he told CNN in May. "I don't support the breaking of the celibacy promise."

Referring to his relationship with the woman, he said, "It looked like a frivolous thing on the beach, you know, and that's not what it is. It's something deeper than that."

John C. Favalora, archbishop of the Catholic Church's Miami archdiocese, said last month that Cutie's actions have "caused a grave scandal within the Catholic Church."

Favalora also had harsh words for the Episcopal Church's decision to accept Cutie.

"This truly is a serious setback for ecumenical relations and cooperation between us," he said.
