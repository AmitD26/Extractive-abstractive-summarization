(CNN) -- Prosecutors in Hungary indicted a Nazi war crimes suspect Tuesday with involvement in the brutal treatment and deportation of thousands of Jews during World War II.

Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary was allegedly "actively involved" in sending nearly 12,000 Jews to various concentration camps in the spring of 1944, according to the Metropolitan Chief Prosecution Office in Budapest.

Csizsik-Csatary topped the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of "most wanted Nazi war criminals" as of April this year.

Csizsik-Csatary was made commander of the "collection and deportation camp" in the brick factory at the beginning of May 1944, it says.

During that month, he "regularly beat the interned Jews with his bare hands and whipped them with a dog-whip without any special reasons and irrespective of the sex, age or health condition of the assaulted people," the indictment alleges.

According to the Wiesenthal Center, Csizsik-Csatary was previously convicted in absentia and sentenced to death for torturing Jews and his role in the mass deportation to Auschwitz.

He escaped to Canada after World War II but was stripped of his Canadian citizenship in 1997, and chose voluntarily to leave the country, the center claims.

He was rediscovered in the fall of 2011 as part of the center's Last Chance project, and was charged last July with the torture of Jews in the Kosice ghetto, it says.

In March this year, a Slovak court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment to enable Slovakia to seek Csizsik-Csatary's extradition from Hungary to stand trial for his crimes in Kosice, it adds.

Journalist Fanny Facsar and CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.
