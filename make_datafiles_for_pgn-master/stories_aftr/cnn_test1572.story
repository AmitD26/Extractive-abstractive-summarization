(InStyle) -- Drew Barrymore keeps evolving -- from star to producer, and now director.

But, at her core, she's still the irresistible free spirit we all know and love, as she revealed in the October issue of InStyle.

On being a celebrity ...

Barrymore said that while she loves her life, there are still moments she battles with being a celebrity. "Some days I want nothing more than a brilliant mask so I could look like someone else and go wander the streets and be free," she said. "I'm very peeved that Halloween only comes once a year."

Barrymore admitted her relationship with her mom is a topic she doesn't readily discuss, but the central love story between a girl and her mom in "Whip It" caused Barrymore to reflect on her relationship."I am OK with my dad, but my mom and I have yet to work it all out," she said, adding that she doesn't talk about it because "how do you talk about something you're confused about?"

On girl power ...

From "Charlie's Angels" to her new all-girl roller derby flick, it's no secret that Barrymore champions female friendships. "I like teams -- I like buddies. I don't understand women who are competitive, apart from positive forums like athletics. One person is a powerful thing, but a tribe is unstoppable."

On her first fashion faux pas ...

Barrymore is known for her ever-evolving, ever-eccentric style, but said anything she donned during the "E.T." era can be labeled as a fashion faux pas. Or can it?  "Velour and taffeta, together? Oh, no, no, no. Now I think it's brilliant."

On her first broken heart...

Barrymore recently broke up with The Strokes' drummer Fabrizio Moretti, and called the five-year relationship one of the most important in her life. But when it comes to her first broke heart, Barrymore said it was her "first big boyfriend, Jamie Walters."
