Nina Allam and Sean Barbary were married in the virtual world of Second Life before meeting for the first time.

Though meeting Sean Barbary in person for the first time, Allam was already married to him in the online virtual world of Second Life. Second Life iReporter Janey Bracken told their story, and others like it, on iReport.com.

To many of its inhabitants, Second Life is much more than just a 3-D online game. It has its own economy and millions of residents who own and create property, make friends and even get married, according to Secondlife.com.

Three weeks ago, they got engaged, and plan to marry next May. Oddly enough, they still want to have a Second Life wedding.

When Bungarz sent her iReport in November, she and her husband hoped to be living together in Winnipeg.

Second Life weddings happen often enough "in-world," as it's called in Second Life, that iReporter Hibiscus Hastings even visited a Second Life bridal show. There were about 40 vendors and over 800 attendees, according to its organizer. It even included a fashion show and panel discussion of "wedding do's and don't's." iReport.com: Check out a Second Life bridal expo  Avatars SeasonedRed Halfpint of Tennessee and Darrius Beresford of North Carolina married in Second Life and help other residents with their weddings.
