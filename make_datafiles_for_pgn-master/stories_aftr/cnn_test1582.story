BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China is shutting down a pair of smelting plants suspected of sickening several thousand children with lead poisoning, according to state-run media.

A Chinese boy gets treated for blood poisoning in Shaanxi province Aug. 15.

A second smelter also was closed Wednesday in central China and two of its executives detained, a local official said, according to Xinhua,

The plant opened in May 2008 without gaining the approval of the local environment protection bureau, said Huang Wenbin, a deputy environment chief in Wugang City, Xinhua reported. The plant was within 500 meters (about a quarter mile) of three schools.

The poisonings have occurred against the backdrop of China's rapid industrialization, which has produced economic success and wrought environmental havoc. Hundreds of millions of Chinese lack access to uncontaminated drinking water, and air pollution is blamed for myriad deaths and illnesses every year. Toxic air enshrouds cities across the country, one of the most polluted in the world.

The government has stepped up anti-pollution efforts in recent years, but many companies flout such campaigns and laws.
