(CNN)  -- South Korean star Park Ji-sung has signed a two-year contract extension at English Premier League champions Manchester United.

The attacking midfielder is now tied to Old Trafford until 2012 as reward for his dogged displays for United since joining from PSV Eindhoven in 2005.

"I am so pleased to have a new contract," Park told www.manutd.com.

Park has had to work hard to establish himself as a regular member of United's starting line-up and was devastated to be left out of the squad for their 2008 Champions League final success against Chelsea.

But last season he was a key figure as United completed a hat-trick of Premier League titles.

Park also gained selection for the Champions League final against Barcelona, becoming the first player from Asia to play in the European club showpiece.

Park has been rewarded with an improved deal worth a reported $5.9 million per year.
