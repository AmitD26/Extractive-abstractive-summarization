The Harley-riding Dr. David Ores has started New York's first health care cooperative for restaurant workers.

The Restaurant Worker's Health Care Cooperative, currently servicing 15 restaurants in lower Manhattan, provides free health care to all restaurant employees, from bus boys to bartenders. Every month the owner or manager of each restaurant contributes money into a common fund based on its number of employees. In return, their workers can go see Dr. Dave with any kind of health issue they may have.

"This is my first checkup ever," Asaf, a waiter at Macao Trading Co., told CNN in the waiting room. "It's an example of how someone finds an easy and fair solution to a serious problem or a need."

And statistics show there is, in fact, a need.

According to a 2005 study by the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, about 73 percent of all New York restaurant workers -- about 160,000 people -- have no health insurance.

The co-op comes as a relief to restaurant owners who would ideally like to provide medical insurance to their employees but cannot afford to do so.

The price for use of the co-op's services ranges from as little as $50 a month for an establishment with a couple of employees to $400 a month for a larger restaurant.

"I'm not against profit," he says. "I just don't think you can have a for-profit health system that provides everyone with proper health care. It's just never going to work."

In the meantime, Dr. Dave has plans to expand.

He also hopes to offer routine checkups for all workers, so he can catch illnesses early and hopefully prevent steeper medical costs down the road.

Although Dr. Dave started the program only eight months ago, he's no stranger to helping others.

"I would call him a pioneer in health care, I would call him a pioneer as a human being, and also as a doctor," says restaurant owner and longtime friend Julio Pe√±a, who has been benefiting from Dr. Dave's services for quite a while. "We've been trading pasta and cappuccinos for stitching somebody up with him for years, and now that he's doing it with other people, it's great."
