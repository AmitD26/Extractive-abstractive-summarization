The Spaniard, who suffered injury trouble for much of last season, was 6-3 7-6 (7-2) 3-0  down to the 22-year-old Scot when he pulled out of the match after struggling with his right knee for much of the third set.

"I came through a few tough moments at the start of the match but I thought I found the right tactics to win, I played really well tonight.

"I had to go for my shots and when the big points come keep them short, as you don't want to play long points against Rafa."

Murray's victory sets-up a semifinal clash with Croatian Marin Cilic, who underlined his growing reputation by hitting  20 aces and 63 winners to consign seventh seed Andy Roddick to defeat.

Roddick hit back with 15 aces and 47 winners but Cilic, who took the scalp of U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in the previous round, sealed his 10th win from 10 matches of 2010 to reach his first grand slam semifinal.
