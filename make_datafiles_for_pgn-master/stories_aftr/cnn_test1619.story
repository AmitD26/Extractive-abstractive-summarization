(CNN) -- Prince Albert of Monaco is engaged to former South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock, the palace announced Wednesday.

The 52-year-old prince and ruler of Monaco, the first child of Princess Grace and the late Prince Rainier, has never married.

Albert has two younger sisters, Princesses Caroline and Stephanie.

The prince and Wittstock have been photographed together many times in the past four years, leading to speculation they would eventually marry.

Albert has two children from previous relationships -- a 6-year-old son born to Nicole Coste, a flight attendant from Togo, and an 18-year-old daughter born to American Tamara Rotolo, a former waitress.

Monaco, a sovereign principality, is one of the smallest countries in the world, measuring just under two square miles. It sits on the French Riviera and is bordered on three sides by France, with a population of about 33,000 people.
