All the homicides have taken place since Dontae Morris was released from prison in April, Castor told reporters.

Morris, 24, is accused of shooting Officers Jeffrey Kocab and David Curtis during an early-morning traffic stop Tuesday near downtown Tampa. The officers, both 31, later died at a hospital.

Morris is also suspected in the killing of a man at an apartment complex, Castor said. That homicide occurred May 18, according to the Tampa Tribune.

"We are continuing to track down some very, very positive leads," the chief said, and police remain confident Morris will be apprehended.

Meanwhile, Morris' picture was featured on FBI billboards in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, authorities said Thursday.

"Beforehand, it would have taken the better part of a day or two" to get the photos up by contacting the companies, he said. While the initiative was on standby for the Times Square bombing attempt, it was not used, he said.

The billboards went up in Florida shortly after the crime occurred Tuesday, he said. Authorities recently decided to feature the picture in Alabama and Georgia. Other states can be added, too, he said -- authorities simply create the alert on a computer and use a drop-down menu to select states.

"The intensity will keep up until we capture him," said Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio. Anyone helping or harboring Morris is "making a huge mistake," she said.

Asked about some citizen complaints about being inconvenienced by the ongoing search, Castor said, "I am very sorry for anyone's inconvenience. We don't want to inconvenience anyone, but our ultimate goal is to keep the citizens of Tampa safe ... I believe that anger should be focused on Dontae Morris. He's the one that's causing all this."

Iorio said the evacuation of a building or the closure of a street is a "small inconvenience" given what authorities are trying to do.

Asked about officers' anger toward Morris, Castor said police are "reeling over the loss of two family members" but are professionals who will take Morris into custody safely if at all possible. She reiterated, however, that the best course of action would be for Morris to give himself up.

Public services for the fallen officers will be held Friday evening at a church in Lutz, Florida, Bay News 9 reported. Funeral services are planned for Saturday.

Curtis called for backup, and Kocab responded, police have said. As the two attempted to arrest the suspect, he pulled out a gun and shot them both, Castor has said. A gun was not found at the scene, she said, and police believe Morris still has it.

She defended the decision to release Brantly, saying "there is still a very, very distinct possibility she will be charged down the road ... The community needs to trust in the ability of the TPD."

Kocab's wife is due to give birth next week, police said at the time of the shootings. Curtis leaves a wife and four sons, ages 9, 6, 5 and 8 months.
