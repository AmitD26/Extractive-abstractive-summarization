In the study, 95 percent of patients with a BMI over 35 had a recurrence compared with 61 percent of other patients.

"What we are seeing suggests there is a difference in the way the cancer grows in obese patients versus those who are not," says study author Jason B. Fleming, M.D., of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. "That is an area, from a biology standpoint, that has not really been explored."

Overall, pancreatic cancer patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 35 (223 pounds or more for someone who's 5'6") were nearly twice as likely to have cancer recur or to die after surgery, as those who weighed less. Health.com: Are you afraid to go to the doctor because you're fat?

The patients with a BMI greater than 35 survived a median of 13.2 months compared with 27.4 months in patients with a BMI less than 23 (136 pounds or less, for someone who's 5'6"). At the last follow-up, 75 percent of the obese patients had died, compared with 52 percent of patients with a BMI less than 35. Ninety-five percent of patients with a BMI greater than 35 had a cancer recurrence compared with 61 percent of all other patients.

People who are obese are at greater risk of getting pancreatic cancer in the first place, according to Fleming. Other risk factors include smoking, long-term diabetes, hereditary disorders, and chronic pancreatitis. The pancreas is an organ located near the stomach; it releases enzymes to help digest food and produces insulin to control blood sugar.

Tae-Hwa Chun, M.D., an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says "there is good evidence" that obesity increases the risk for certain types of cancer such as postmenopausal breast cancer, and cancers of the colon, endometrium (the lining of the uterus), kidney, and esophagus.

Not all pancreatic cancer patients are obese or overweight. Recently, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had surgery for pancreatic cancer. Last year, actor Patrick Swayze was found to have stage 4 pancreatic cancer, which he attributes to smoking. Swayze has been reportedly undergoing chemotherapy. Other procedures, including surgery and radiation, can be used to treat the disease.
