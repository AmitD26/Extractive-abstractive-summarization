Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) -- Gil Shwed is an Israeli programmer and entrepreneur who is regarded as one of the fathers of modern Internet security.

He got his first job writing software at the age of 12, and by 1993, at the age of 24, he formed the Internet security company Check Point with two business partners and a borrowed computer in his associate's grandmother's apartment in Tel Aviv.

Check Point created the first firewall using "stateful inspection" -- the second-generation of firewall technology widely used today.

In the years since, hacking has become big business -- one of the fastest growing areas of crime, according to Interpol, with an estimated global cost of $1 trillion a year.

"In 1993, most people didn't know what the Internet is all about," says Shwed, who sensed the Internet would be big but had no idea it would grow to become as central to modern life as it has.

"I never imagined the Internet to have such a huge effect on the world or for Check Point to be a company that sells for nearly a billion-and-a-half dollars today," he said.

What's a firewall?

Some form of security is necessary to protect computer networks from hackers.

"It knows how to analyze the traffic and basically classify each type of connection."

"There are multiple layers and you need to provide... many different types of protection, many different types of the system," he says.

"Today, the firewall does probably ten more things: it knows how to encrypt your traffic when you communicate with mobile devices, it knows how to scan the data for potential leakage... It knows how to look for very sophisticated attacks; it knows how to look for bots."

Also known as web robots, bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the Internet, and are often used for malicious purposes.

How has the threat environment changed?

He said that "every business today is facing hundreds, if not thousands of attacks everyday. And these attacks can go from small things that slow you down to bad things that will stop your business right away immediately.

The extortion could take the form of a threat to take down a network if a sum was not paid, or a more subtle approach.

"We've seen several cases where somebody calls an organization and says 'I'm a security researcher, I've found that your company is being targeted. I'll let you know how to block it if you pay me my consulting fees.' It can start from small amounts, $5000, $15000."

But while large companies and governments were obvious and attractive targets, home computer users were just as vulnerable, as general attacks were aimed at security vulnerabilities, rather than specific targets.

"The general break-ins are not happening by targeted attacks, by somebody trying to attack you or your organization. The general attacks (come through) tools that scan the Internet and find the place to break in -- and wherever they can break in, they'll break into."

It sounds overwhelming. Are there any new approaches to the problem?

Shwed's company has a new product called ThreatCloud, which it bills as the first collaborative approach to fighting cybercrime.

"So what we came up with was that idea of a threat cloud. And ThreatCloud is like a collaboration network -- whenever a customer network sees an attack or sees something suspicious, it reports to the ThreatCloud service (which) analyzes threats from multiple sources.

"If it finds out that it's actually an attack, it can automatically update the rest of the world and let everybody enjoy that intelligence, that know-how that some attack has been happening and everybody should block that source."
