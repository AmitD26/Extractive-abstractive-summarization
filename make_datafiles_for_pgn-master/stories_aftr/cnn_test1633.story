He was 82. He died in Wisconsin after an extended illness, Mell's office said.

Rostenkowski first entered Congress in 1959, during the second half of the Eisenhower administration. Known for his booming voice and reputation as a power broker, he became chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee in 1981.

During his tenure as chairman, the powerful Democrat played a key role in passing major reforms of both Social Security and the tax code, among other things.

Rostenkowski was defeated in the Republican landslide of 1994, however, after becoming mired in scandal. Among other things, prosecutors alleged he used public funds for personal matters and to pay employees who did little actual work.

"Dan Rostenkowski devoted his life to his community, Chicago and the state," Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan said Wednesday.

"His efforts on behalf of the regular people who needed a friend to wade through the tangle of government are unparalleled."
