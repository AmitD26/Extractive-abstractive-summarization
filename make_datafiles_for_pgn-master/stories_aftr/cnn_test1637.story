(CNN) -- Australia captain Ricky Ponting insists it is "absolutely possible" that his side can regain the Ashes by thrashing England 5-0.

Ponting's side surrendered the famous urn to their bitter rivals last year when England won the Test series 2-1 on home soil.

"There's no doubt we made some mistakes in the last Ashes series in England that cost us the series. But we know now that we're a more experienced and probably a better team now than we were then."

They have been in good form of late but were recently held to a 1-1 Test series draw by Pakistan when the two sides met in England. Yet England are already 2-0 up in their own four Test series with Pakistan, with two games played.

And Trott suggested Ponting may have put unnecessary pressure on his team by talking up their chances of a resounding victory.

Speaking ahead of the third Test with Pakistan, he told reporters: "I don't know Ponting that well -- I don't know his character or what he would be meaning saying stuff like that.

"But if I were to say something like that I'd find it put pressure on me and the team more than if we just go about our business like I know we will."
