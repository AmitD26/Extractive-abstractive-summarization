The proceeds, which he hopes will exceed $1 millon, will be used to fund mental health services for youths who can't afford the counseling.

Artest became a poster boy for NBA bad behavoir after the 2004 melee, which resulted in his being suspended for 73 games, amounting to a loss of about $6 million in salary, he said. Artest was then playing with the Indiana Pacers, against the home team Detroit Pistons.

His court-order anger management therapy transformed him, he said.

"A great psychologist made me reach deep, deep into my lies, deep, deep into my vices. Then I had to tell my wife everything. That totally changed my life," Artest said, who's a father of four.

As one of the league's premier defenders, Artest made few excuses for his admittedly aggressive behavior, but then a secret slipped out.

Artest is also an aspiring rapper.

In a recent CNN interview, he revealed that while he publicly thanked a psychiatrist, he actually sees a psychologist.

"I didn't know the difference between a psychiatrist and a psychologist," he said.

"Having someone to talk to is very important. And there's no shame in asking for help," Artest said.

Artest kicked off his online raffle Wednesday night with a scheduled appearance on CNN's "Larry King Live."

Wealthy celebrities have offered to buy his ring outright, but Artest wanted all fans to have a chance at winning his ring. So he decided to hold an online raffle in which all bidders will enjoy a fair shot at the ring.
