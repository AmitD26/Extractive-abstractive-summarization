Minneapolis, Minnesota (CNN) -- For 13-year-old Arrianna Merritt, the words mother and hero go hand in hand.

Three years ago Sunday Arrianna watched her mother Kim Dahl drive a school bus loaded with children across the Mississippi River when the bridge began to buckle up and down. Thirteen people were killed in the bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  What Arrianna remembers most was the choice her mother made that day after the bus became tilted upward on a steep incline.

"Either you let us free fall -- or you hold that brake to the ground and you stay where you are."  Dahl held the brake with her foot until she could reach for the parking brake.

Millions of viewers saw the jaw-dropping images of the school bus as it teetered on the edge of a broken stretch of highway, with nothing but a guard rail separating it from a deadly fall.  Arrianna sat in the bus with her brother, 50 other children and eight adults.

The bus "went up, and then it went down," Dahl recalls, adding it soon turned into free fall and she was "hanging on for dear life." "I thought 'this is it,' I'm not getting out, and I'm going to die."

"We didn't want to leave our mom," David, now 8, remembers.

Dahl says she managed to break free herself after a jolt on the bridge seemed to release her seatbelt, which had been stuck.

Dahl broke her back in the fall and that's been the primary cause of complications since.

"Most of the time when my mom is in the hospital or getting surgeries, I have to step in and be the surrogate mother to my younger siblings," Arrianna explains. The family also includes another daughter, Brianna, age 11.

"And my dad is working a lot of the time so he kind of doesn't have much time."

"It kind of teaches me to grow up some and how to be a grownup and what it's like."

She adds it can get difficult once in awhile, but these days she simply reminds herself who she's doing it for.

"Now I kind of understand why I have to stand in and why sometimes I have to be the adult."

On Tuesday Kim Dahl and Arrianna visited the site of the collapse -- where the new I-35 West bridge stands. The sound of a jackhammer in the distance is enough to remind Arrianna of the construction noise taking place on the bridge at the time of the accident. It brings her to tears.

Thankfully mom is nearby.

"She is kind of like my counselor because she listens," Arrianna said. She no longer needs a therapist, but it's these rare moments when mom comes in handy.

Arrianna's advice?

"You need to move on, and you need to be strong and live your life to the fullest."

Those are words the family is living by.   Kim Dahl has had to give up what her husband Dave Dahl would call the "wilder motor sports," and the five of them have taken on a new hobby: road trips.

Kim Dahl says she'll never be able to drive a bus again -- something she misses more than anything. She had the same bus routes for years and knew the kids and their parents well.

But the family camper may be the next best thing. So far, they've made it as far as Florida to the east and Colorado to the west.

"My mom could never afford it...we never went anywhere," Kim Dahl recalls of her childhood. "And we went on [our] first trip and it was just awesome. To learn stuff and to see stuff was just amazing."

As Dave Dahl describes it, there's "no stress, there's no itinerary, nothing, we just go."
