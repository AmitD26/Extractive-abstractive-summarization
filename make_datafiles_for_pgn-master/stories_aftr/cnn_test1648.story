(RollingStone.com)  -- Bob Dylan has signed a six-book deal with Simon & Schuster, according to Crain's New York Business, encompassing two sequels to his acclaimed 2004 book "Chronicles: Volume One" as well as another book based on dialogue from his Sirius/XM radio show "Theme Time Radio Hour."

It's unclear what the other three books are going to be. According to the Crain's, Dylan's literary agent Andrew Wylie was seeking an eight-figure deal for the books.

"I think I can go back to the 'Blonde on Blonde' album -- that's probably about as far back as I can go on the next book," he said. "Then I'll probably go forward. I thought of an interesting time.

"I made this record, 'Under the Red Sky,' with Don Was, but at the same time I was also doing the [second] Wilburys record. I don't know how it happened that I got into both albums at the same time.

"Back then I wasn't bringing anything at all into the studio, I was completely disillusioned."
