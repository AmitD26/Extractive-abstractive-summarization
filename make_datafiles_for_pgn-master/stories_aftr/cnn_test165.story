• The arrival of Nathan Lane. We'll also meet his recurring character, the firm's appointed trustee Clarke Hayden, in the season premiere. "He becomes a foil to everyone, but primarily Diane and Will," co-creator Robert King says. "We've been studying a lot about law firm bankruptcies, and when you want to restructure to give yourself relief from your creditors, sometimes a bank or court will order in a trustee. A trustee is someone who represents the creditors' interest, and he or she is brought in above the managers, or the partners in this case. He basically can veto any decisions of the partners." It's an especially interesting time for Will, who'll be practicing again now that his suspension is over. "Because they are in this kind of bankruptcy limbo where they have to make a certain amount to pay off the creditors in a certain amount of time, it's a very bad time to find a conscience. Just like we're all struggling with that in this economy: How much do you let your ethics lead, and how much do you let your pragmatism lead? Will's gonna be struggling with that almost daily." And don't forget about David Lee. "David Lee's someone who has new clout given this bankruptcy and the fact that family law is doing so well. Given the world of Lockhart Gardner and how much it's struggling, David Lee is a commodity and will have a lot of confrontations with the Nathan Lane character."

• Eli's focused again on Peter. "We felt we made a mistake with Eli last year. Sorry to admit it now," King says, with a laugh. "But the thing is, Eli seems to have more fun when he has one overwhelming goal for the year, as opposed to little goals. And the goal for the year is to get Peter elected governor. And Eli has never played in the big leagues like this before. And to see an Eli, who is unhinged, try to get Peter elected is just going to be very fun I think both for Alan Cumming and the audience, who will see him dealing with a lot that we see now nationally with Romney and Obama — the mix of serious issues but also being tainted by frivolous issues. How do you separate the two and should you? How do you keep what's frivolous in the public's eye so they don't start questioning about Peter's past with a prostitute or Peter's time in prison? It's not just a defensive game, it's an offensive game, and Eli becomes a master at that game."

• A different kind of Peter. "The third season was a Peter who wanted to do things differently. This year is a Peter who really wants to win, and how do you keep your ethics when you really want to win? Do you just let other people around you do the dirty work for you, or do you engage on that?" King says. "Some of the issues from the year before will come back for him, supposed racism in his department and other issues. So what we want to see a Peter who has to deal with these things sometimes by ignoring them and letting Eli just handle them."

There's also Alicia's friendship with Maura Tierney's recurring character, wealthy businesswoman Maddie Hayward, who makes her first appearance in the second episode. Eli will want Maddie to endorse Peter. "The difficulty dramatically for characters on our show is where do you draw a line between the personal and the professional. And sometimes, more often than not, people don't draw the line. Everything that's professional is personal and everything that's personal is professional. And for Alicia, that's a very difficult balance. Sometimes she wants someone to be a friend and not there to be an agenda."
