Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Violence in Ivory Coast was ongoing amid a tense political standoff Wednesday, after at least five police officers were killed and three U.N. peacekeepers were wounded in an Abidjan neighborhood, and three other police officers were killed in clashes with protesters, officials said.

The three U.N. peacekeepers sustained minor injuries overnight when they "came under crossfire from both sides of the road" while returning from a patrol, the U.N. operation in Ivory Coast said in a statement Wednesday. The U.N. forces -- a joint team of military and U.N. police -- were forced to return fire, the operation said.

Five other people were killed earlier Tuesday in clashes between police and supporters of the nation's president-elect amid an ongoing political standoff in the West African nation, an official said.

The dead included three police officers and two demonstrators, the governor of Abidjan said Tuesday. The deaths came a day after the U.N. Security Council condemned the violence that has erupted since the country's November 28 presidential runoff election and "urged all parties to exercise restraint."

"Some of the worst armed clashes so far broke out in the city of Abidjan today," the organization said. An unidentified witness told Amnesty International of having heard "heavy exchanges of fire" around midnight and seeing Wednesday morning "three military vehicles burnt out" and the body of a member of the security forces, the statement said.

State-run RTI reported the government has imposed a curfew on the Abobo and Ayaman neighborhoods of Abidjan, where the violence occurred. The curfew is in place from Wednesday until 6 a.m. Saturday, it said.

The Security Council expressed its support for efforts by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States in pursuing a peaceful resolution of the crisis.

At the same time, the council repeated its readiness to impose measures -- including sanctions -- against those who threaten the peace process by blocking the work of the U.N. mission and others or "commit serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law."

Meanwhile, Ouattara is willing to add Gbagbo supporters to his Cabinet, provided the incumbent steps down, Ivory Coast's ambassador to the United Nations said this week.

Ouattara told CNN last week that he welcomes a proposal for direct negotiations with Gbagbo -- on the condition that Gbagbo recognize Ouattara as president.

But in a telephone interview Tuesday, Gbagbo spokesman Ahoua Don Melo rejected the idea, saying Ouattara "should first go to the Constitutional Council to get recognized as the president before making any proposal."

An independent election commission declared Ouattara the winner of the vote, but the country's Constitutional Council invalidated those results and declared Gbagbo the winner.

The U.S. Treasury froze Gbagbo's assets in the United States last week and barred Americans from doing business with him. His wife and three top aides also were sanctioned.

Ouattara remains in the Golf Hotel under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers.

The United Nations and an ever-increasing number of other nations have recognized Ouattara, a former prime minister, as the rightful election winner.

Gbagbo, however, has ignored those offers and has refused to accept telephone calls from U.S. officials.

The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it has sufficient relief supplies for about 30,000 people in Liberia and "is ready to mobilize stocks from Ghana for an additional 30,000 people if the need arises."
