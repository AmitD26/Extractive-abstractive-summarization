(CNN) -- Jose Maria Olazabal is looking forward to the biggest challenge of his career after being named as Europe's new team captain for the 2012 Ryder Cup.

The 44-year-old Spaniard takes over from Colin Montgomerie, having been one of the Scot's vice-captains as Europe regained golf's most prestigious prize from the the United States in October.

Olazabal is a two-time major winner having triumphed at the U.S. Masters in 1994 and 1999, and he is eighth on the European Tour's all-time list with 23 victories, but he has battled ill health in recent years.

His last Ryder Cup appearance was a winning one in Ireland in 2006, though he played only three events last year as he continued his fight against rheumatism -- a factor that had forced him to play down reports that he would become Europe's captain.

"That was the main concern. Regarding that, the last couple of months, since I played Valderrama last year, I felt a noticeable improvement in my health condition," Olazabal said.

"There should be no problem. I'm feeling much better and that's the reason why I said yes."

While Montgomerie said following the epic final-match victory at Celtic Manor in Wales that he expected changes to the team selection policy, Olazabal does not intend to make any drastic moves ahead of the qualification period starting in September.

The U.S. team allows for four captain's picks to be made outside the eight places on offer through rankings points, but Olazabal said he was considering asking to reduce his wildcard selection from three to two for the trip to Illinois.

"And to make the top 10, five through the world rankings and four through the European Tour rankings, you need to have an extremely great year. And it would be a shame to tell any of those guys, you're not in."
