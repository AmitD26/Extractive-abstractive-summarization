Hollywood, California (CNN) -- Larry King, America's interviewer-in-chief, ended his record-setting career as CNN's prime-time, talk-show host Thursday night with a serenade from Tony Bennett, a greeting from President Obama and a "Larry King Day" proclamation from California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Those guests and others capped his 25-year run behind the microphone with CNN.

"Welcome to the last 'Larry King Live.' It's hard to say that," King said in his opening remarks to his last show.

On several occasions, King stifled tears, especially when Maher put King in the same company as TV legends Johnny Carson, Steve Allen and Walter Cronkite.

King wore his signature suspenders -- a pair of red ones with a red-and-white polka-dot tie over a black shirt.

"I don't know what to say, except to you my audience, thank you. And instead of goodbye, how about so long?" King concluded.

His set then went black -- except for a spotlight illuminating his chrome microphone.

In his overall 53 years in broadcasting, King amassed 50,000 interviews, 6,120 shows in CNN's archives, 10 Cable ACE Awards, an Emmy, a Peabody and an entry in the Guinness World Records for having the longest-running show with the same host in the same time slot.

"Thank you," King said, adding this quip: "and keep this in mind: I'll be back."

King will be working on special projects for CNN.

"You say all that you do is ask questions, but for generations of Americans, the answers to those questions have surprised us and they have informed us," Obama said.

From a studio in New York, talk show host Regis Philbin tried to engage King in a song, but King was caught off guard.

Joining Philbin in New York was Donald Trump.

"You shouldn't be leaving anything, Larry," Trump said. "Nobody ever did it better."

"Now Larry," Armisen said, "what has been my favorite interview?"

Armisen: "Larry, what is the most interesting thing about me."

King: "Why. You see the best question of all, Lar, is why. Because it can't be answered in one word and it forces the person to think."

King: "I will not stop wearing them. No matter what I do in life, the suspenders will remain."

News anchors Katie Couric, Diane Sawyer, and Brian Williams joined talk show host Barbara Walters in extending farewells. They were also telecasted from a set in New York.

"All of us have done heads of state" interviews, Walters said. "No one has done more than you."

"You made NAFTA exciting and that's hard to do.

"And you scored the Paris Hilton post-jail interview," Couric recited.

King turned the question on McGraw: "How am I doing?"

"With grace," McGraw said.

"You never like to be the center of attention," McGraw later said. "You ask short questions." Turning to Seacrest and Maher, he added: "He told me years ago, if it's more than 2 sentences, it's too long."

King was then joined by his wife, Shawn, and two sons, Chance, 11, and Cannon, 10, to hear Tony Bennett sing "Best is Yet to Come" from Lake Charles, Louisiana.

"How about them apples," King said afterwards.

Chance said he looked forward to seeing more of his father.

Cannon then stole the show momentarily with an uncanny impersonation of his father, as if he were talking to him and then his mother:

"Get in the car. I'm too old for this. I've done this for 50 years," Cannon said, with an entertaining imitation of King's gravelly voice. "Stop doing your makeup. This is the last show. We're going to be late."

When King ended his last show and the airtime moved on to Anderson Cooper for his show, the anchor summarized: "a remarkable moment and a remarkable man."
