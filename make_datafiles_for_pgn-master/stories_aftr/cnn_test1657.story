"We do not want to copy others, but we shall define what we want," he said, according to Saba.

Saleh urged non-violent change through the ballot box, according to the state-run news agency.

In an attempt to quell growing discontent, Saleh, a key U.S. ally in the fight against an offshoot of al Qaeda in Yemen, has announced he won't seek another term in 2013 after being in power for 32 years. He also said he would postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for April to allow more time for discussions about reform.

Yemen's situation is exacerbated by the U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda, a Shiite uprising, a secessionist movement in its once-independent south, and a looming shortage of water.

Abdul Rahman Barman, head of the human rights group HOOD, corrected an earlier account he provided about one student supposedly being killed in the demonstration. Barman said the chaos at the scene caused the error.

Instead, that student, Bassam Othman, an anti-government demonstrator, was shot in the neck and was showing improvement while in Kuwait Hospital, said his brother, Sabri.

The brother accused pro-government gang members of firing upon the crowd and questioned why the riot police didn't step in and protect students who were demonstrating.

Four other injured persons were hospitalized and are in stable condition, said Khulaid Mashraqi, a local doctor. Two were shot in the leg while the other two had wounds to the head, he said.

"There were 30 to 40 pro-government gang members there that were randomly shooting at us," said Esam Al-Hajjaji, an anti-government protester who was shot in the leg.

Saturday marked the ninth consecutive day of protests in Yemen.

The Yemen parliament expressed its regrets Saturday for all the victims of the ongoing violent demonstrations, according to the state-run news outlet.

It rejected any efforts promoting "hatred and regionalism culture" and called on security forces to enhance stability and protect citizens, according to Saba. The parliament also called upon all Yemenis to put Yemen first among their priorities.

Saba reported Saturday that an official source at the Interior Ministry has denounced some reports that security personnel in civilian clothes participated in marches.

The source also said security personnel are present in uniform near all rallies of pro- and anti-government marchers to maintain security and public order.

The U.S. Embassy issued a statement Friday voicing concern for what it called "a disturbing rise in the number and violence of attacks against Yemeni citizens gathering peacefully to express their views on the current political situation."

On Friday, supporters of Ali Abdullah Saleh hurled rocks and plunged into a crowd calling for the longtime president's ouster in Sanaa as similar protests gained momentum in other Yemeni towns.

On Friday, Yemenis marched to Sanaa University, where security forces and riot police tried to stay between rival demonstrators.

"After Mubarak, now it's Ali's turn," chanted the anti-government protesters. "The people want the fall of the regime."

"I'm out here today because we want the president to go and we want to make sure that he and his family don't stay in power," said Khalid Amer, a student.

Despite concessions from Saleh, a rising tide of anger is sweeping through Yemen's youth, who say they are simply fed up with the status quo.

"He pointed out that there are schemes aimed at plunging the region into chaos and violence targeting the nation's security and the stability of its countries," according to Saba. "Those who commit acts of disorder and vandalism (are) simply implementing suspicious foreign agendas."
