(CNN) -- As ballots were being counted in Somaliland, a breakaway republic in northwest Somalia, officials said Sunday an observer from the electoral commission was killed.

Mohamed said the polling was peaceful, but acknowledged small outbreaks of violence, including the killing of the observer Saturday near the town of Lasa Anod. The observer's identity and further details were not given.

Security measures during the voting included a 12-hour ban on vehicles not carrying special permits, Mohamed said Saturday.

In the election, current President Dahir Riyale Kahin of the ruling party UDUD is opposed by two other candidates.

The northwestern region of Somaliland achieved independence from Britain on June 26, 1960, followed by the rest of Somalia, which became independent of Italy five days later on July 1, 1960, and joined Somaliland to form the state

Southern Somalia has not seen a stable government since the fall of the dictatorship and has been mired in civil war since its fall. The ongoing conflict has resulted in "an unprecedented humanitarian crisis," according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.

"In May (2010), the fighting intensified in Mogadishu and displaced more than 270,000 people, causing the number of internally displaced persons to reach 1.5 million people," according to a report on the UNHCR website.

CNN's Ben Brumfield and Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.
