(WIRED) -- As Sly Stone said, the nicer the nice, the higher the price.The question is, is the more expensive Xoom nicer than the comparable iPad?

The experience is markedly different, that's for sure. Anyone familiar with Apple's market-leading tablet -- and the Xoom invites the comparison -- will face a few moments of disorientation when picking up the Xoom for the first time.

A few details are unsettling to iPad users, such as the location of the power button (on the rear of the device), the lack of front-facing command buttons, and the unfamiliar location of the volume rocker.

Those details will be irrelevant to non-Apple users, of course, but even dedicated Android fans will find that the Xoom's version of the OS, Android 3.0 Honeycomb, takes a bit of getting used to.

The 1280×800 screen is pretty close to a standard widescreen aspect ratio, so videos can fill the whole screen with minimal clipping.

The Xoom is a little bit shorter than the iPad in landscape mode, but that means that when you flip the Xoom to portrait mode, the screen is skinnier and taller. This is actually perfect for reading books, scrolling down web pages, or catching up on Instapaper.

It's comfortable to hold the Xoom with one hand while you swipe with the other, and because the vertical page is so tall, there's less swiping than on smaller screens.

The rubbery back panel has enough grip that you don't really need to clamp onto the thing while you're reading. If you feel fatigued by holding your iPad one-handed for long periods of time like I do, you'll appreciate this.

In short, it's an excellent, basic media consumption device -- as long as your media doesn't rely on stellar audio. If you're planning on zoning out with a movie or a few videos, we'd recommend keeping a decent pair of headphones on hand.

The big problem with the sound? The speakers are in the back of the tablet. They sound fine if you turn the tablet around to face the speakers toward you, but if you're holding the Xoom so you can see its screen, the sound is projecting away from your head. Everything sounds muffled: movie dialog is harder to understand and music just sounds dead and lifeless.

On the other hand, being able to compose a photo while looking at something bigger than a 5×7 print is a real luxury, as it lets you see details you wouldn't otherwise notice on a small phone screen or camera viewfinder. It's awkward, but we suspect it will become commonplace within a few months now that every tablet is getting a camera built into the back.

For that reason we think fewer people are likely to jump on the Xoom bandwagon. Those who do will be attracted by the widescreen format, the ability to buy apps without going through Apple's restrictive App Store.

For those who want a more fully-finished, polished experience, however, we recommend waiting for a future Android tablet -- or the iPad. The Xoom is a credible contender, but it's not quite on par with the market leader yet.
