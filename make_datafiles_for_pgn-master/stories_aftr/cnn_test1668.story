That question carries an extreme amount of significance for those who are popping the question and for those who must answer.

While weddings have long been planned to a T and photographed and videotaped, marriage proposals are rapidly becoming public events with some videotaped for the enjoyment of family, friends and millions of strangers.

Posted on sites such as YouTube and Vimeo, the videotaped proposals can go viral overnight with millions of viewers. That's what happened to one video of an elaborately orchestrated proposal in a movie theater.

"We had no idea it'd be such a viral success, but there were particular elements that made it so successful," says Michael Escobar, the videographer who recorded both Matt asking his fiancee's father for her hand and Matt's epic route to get to the theater where Ginny was with her brother.

What is it about proposal videos that draw so many viewers from around the world?

"These videos reflect our need to 'connect' with one another," says Steven Sherwood, a sociology professor at Los Angeles Valley College. "They are therefore just the most contemporary version of the smoke signal of communicating what's important to us.

For Christina Nelson, 42, a Kenyan immigrant who's been married for six years, the emotional aspect of these videos are what touch her.

"I know what they're feeling and wow. I just love how they feel," Nelson says, adding that her girlfriends often pass links to such videos along to her.

Ashli Reese, a young bachelorette living in Atlanta, sums up her reaction to watching proposal videos: "I want that one day. I want that to be me. I want to feel the way they feel."

"I'll watch for the entertainment," says 24-year-old Tracy McClades. And even though he says he hasn't found "the one" yet, he admits he can "get ideas from them" and be prepared when he is ready to propose to his future wife.

Although he didn't have a video made of his proposal, he and his wife are reminded of their emotional moment every time they see the Olympic torch that he carried during the proposal hanging in the middle of their living room.

Escobar doesn't see the proposal competition as a bad thing.

"If it does have people step up their game, if it sparks a person to go the extra mile for the person they love, that's a good thing."
