(CNN) -- English Premier League side Arsenal and Italian Serie A Udinese have been drawn together in the final qualifying round for the European Champions League.

The two-legged tie will see last season's fourth place teams in England and Italy go head-to-head for a place in the group stages of Europe's premier club competition.

Udinese played in the Champions League for the only time in their history during the 2004/05 campaign, when they were eliminated at the group stage.

Van Persie, 27, was sent off during the match with Barcelona in March which saw Arsenal eliminated from last season's tournament, with Nasri handed a one-match ban for improper conduct in the wake of his teammate's dismissal.

French coach Wenger will also be banned from the touchline for the opening match following his reaction to Arsenal's defeat to Barca.

Elsewhere in the draw, four-time European champions Bayern Munich face Swiss Super League runners-up FC Zurich.

Portuguese team Benfica, who have won the European Cup twice in their history, take on Dutch runners-up Twente.

The first legs of the ties will take place across August 16/17, with the return matches to be played across August 23/24.
