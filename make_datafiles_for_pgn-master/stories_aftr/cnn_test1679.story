When Congress returns, members should not only support these new standards but also give people the necessary dollars to get on the path to fresh food. At the moment, $4.5 billion is attached to the bill, which only works out to six cents on the plate -- not much, but better than nothing if it can buy an apple for each child's breakfast or lunch tray.

Here's how you do it:

Drop into school and eat lunch with your child. See for yourself what is being served on the breakfast and lunch trays.

If you don't like what you see, find other parents in your school who are as frustrated and disgusted as you are. Band together and go to your school board and demand change.

Love your lunch ladies. Go visit them and thank them. Let them know you appreciate that they take care of your kids and that you want to help them get better equipment, training and information to make their jobs easier.

Make noise. Send e-mails, meet your school nutrition director, go to PTA meetings, get your kids involved. Take every opportunity to keep school food change front and center.

If this bill doesn't get passed when Congress comes back in November, then it's going to be another five years before we have another shot at fixing these regulations. Five years is too long to wait. Without this legislation, school food will stay in the Dark Ages of nutrition and your kids are going to suffer. They deserve better.

700 groups want this kind of law, he writes. Does Congress not value children's health?

Parents should see what kids are eating, Oliver says, and if disgusted, push for healthy food
