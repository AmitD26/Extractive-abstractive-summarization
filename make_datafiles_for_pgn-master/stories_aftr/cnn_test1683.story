NEW YORK (CNN) -- Working on your weekend isn't always fun, but it was for me this past Saturday and Sunday.

We had a lot of viewers ask about how we cover the elections, where our information comes from and what sort of gadgets we've got planned.

So it was off to New York City and our election HQ at the Time Warner Center.

If you're a coffee drinker (who isn't?) the first thing you notice is that my colleagues in the NYC newsroom have a view worth the national debt from...yes...the coffee room. Straight across Columbus Circle to Central Park in the fall/autumn.

Here in Atlanta, the view is of, well, the coffee machine.

Tonight's coverage involves not one, but two packed control rooms, several hundred people across the US and indeed the world, and some high tech gadgets I wanted to take home and play with.

They wouldn't let me.

There's the John King Magic Wall-- and yes, you can see your house from there. What a machine! The data stored in there is simply staggering -- you can compare county results from four elections back. How county populations can swing a State. How the primary result in one State stacks up against polling data from yesterday. I got the feeling only John King REALLY knows all the cool stuff it can do. And it's all done with taps and finger moves on the screen.  Watch King zoom in on voters' homes Â»

But for technology on steroids, wait till you see the hologram. Correspondents and guests in Chicago and Phoenix will magically appear in the New York studio, in a very Star Wars-ish manner.

It takes dozens of cameras (yes, dozens), infra-red thingies (I'm not very technical) and a bunch of computers to make this happen. We haven't been allowed to show the images yet -- they're being saved for tonight's coverage. But I can tell you it seems to work pretty darn well. An intern subbing for a correspondent in Chicago magically appeared on the screen in front of me, just a few feet from Wolf Blitzer in New York.
