Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Northern Ireland's Martin McGuinness will be the Sinn Fein candidate for president of the Republic of Ireland when elections are held next month, the party's executive committee voted unanimously Sunday.

McGuinness, a former leader of the IRA, is now deputy first minister of Northern Ireland.

Accepting his party's nomination Sunday, he said republicans have an obligation to "heal the wounds of their actions."

McGuinness has admitted that he was a leader of the Provisional IRA during the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland between pro-British and pro-Irish forces.

He referred to a recent upsurge in violence in the province in his speech Sunday.

"I know there will be a very strong temptation for people to drag us back to the past. God knows there are enough of them trying to do so, in a violent sense, at the moment," he said.

"People see me very much as a peacemaker, but, more importantly, they see me as a peacemaker who can be trusted," he said. "I have every confidence that the peace process will be strengthened by my participation in the presidential election."

The party's leader, Gerry Adams, moved from his west Belfast constituency in Northern Ireland to win a parliamentary seat in the republic, topping the poll in the Louth constituency.

If elected, he would resign from his position in Northern Ireland.

Ireland's president is a largely ceremonial role, with national elections held every seven years.

The president is the guardian of the constitution and has the power to refer contentious laws to Ireland's Supreme Court.

Mary McAleese has been the president since 1997 and is nearing the end of her second term of office.

On Friday, Irish Senator David Norris said he intends to re-enter the race.

However, Norris told Irish television Friday night he had changed his mind and is seeking support to relaunch his campaign following a "consistent outpouring" of public support.

An opinion poll published Sunday showed Labour's Michael D. Higgins leading Norris, who might be backed by the Fianna Fail party.
