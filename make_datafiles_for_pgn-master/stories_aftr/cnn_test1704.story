(CNN) -- Why Indianapolis?

Super Bowl visitors will enjoy the fabulous Super Bowl parties and the very best of this Midwestern city's arts, music and food festivals tailored specially for this sports-filled week.

A music scene that covers all the bases

Indianapolis has some world-class music talent that music writer Ryan Williams is always eager to share with out-of-towners. Williams focuses his music blog on the Fountain Square neighborhood but loves music all over the city.

The Melody Inn is Indy's version of CBGBs with a line-up that heavily favors punk and louder sounds, except for more roots and country material on Friday evenings. Radio Radio is a smoke-free space that puts together an eclectic blend of indie rock, rockabilly and touring artists.

The Vogue hosts dance nights most nights, but larger touring acts make their way through here as well (and those shows are usually smoke-free as well). Locals Only really does welcome everyone to their line-up of local rock, blues and hip-hop. Jazz fans can choose the small club feel of the Chatterbox  or the larger dinner/show feel of the Jazz Kitchen. The latter choice also features R&B, soul and hip-hop.

Local, sustainable food with a kick

To step back in time, head to the L.S. Ayres Tea Room at the Indiana State Museum, which recreates the historic Tea Room (open 1906-1990). A proper lunch is served Monday through Saturday and high tea is served on Sunday. Reservations are required on Sunday and are recommended the rest of the week.

For the history buff, and the shopper

Art history and Civil War buffs alike will enjoy the Herron-Morton Place historic district, which is named for two institutions: Camp Morton, a Civil War prison camp, and the John Herron Art Institute.

For children, or people who act like children

Often rated one of the best children's museums in the country, locals say the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, with a Dale Chihuly blown-glass permanent sculpture and working carousel, is not to be missed.

For the wanderer

Indianapolis has become friendly to people who like to walk and wander, as long as you're ready for temperatures ranging in the 40s during the day and the 30s at night. Bustling walkable areas include the Broadripple District's nightlife and shops, Mass Ave's galleries and theater and the music scene in Fountain Square.

The Canal and White River State Park, which has lovely walking paths, also features the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art and the Indiana State Museum. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay's collection at the state museum houses some of Irsay's NFL collection, Jack Kerouac's original manuscript for "On the Road" and musical instruments from Grateful Dead founder Jerry Garcia and others.
