This rollout incorporates three major changes for the site. The first is a redesign of the site based on user feedback.

It places the key Digg topics -- Gaming, Technology, Science, etc. -- at the top of the page rather than on the side.

The second part of the update focuses on profile pages and the return of profile statistics.

At the top right of every profile page are the Digg, commenting, submission and following stats for every user.

Finally, Digg has added a new slew of opt-in notifications for when your stories hit "Top News."

The changes are designed to counteract Digg's painful decline by adding the most-requested user features.

The new features will be rolled out over the next few weeks and will be offered at an opt-in basis. Overall, they're nice updates, but the company still has a long way to go to regain user trust and woo users back to its platform.

Every little bit counts, though, when you're trying to turn things around.

Check out the before and after screenshots, and let us know what you think of the redesign in the comments below.
