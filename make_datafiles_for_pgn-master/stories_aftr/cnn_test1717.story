(CNN) -- North Korea has more uranium enrichment facilities than it has admitted to previously, a U.S. scientist charged Thursday.

"When I saw the sophistication and scale of that uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon in a building that I had been in before that housed something totally different, it was clear that they started the program long before the time that they had said, which was April 2009. So my conclusion was, they had to have another site someplace else," said Hecker.

He is in South Korea attending international nuclear conferences ahead of the Seoul Nuclear Security Summit next week.

North Korea, although not officially on the agenda, will be discussed in bilateral meetings at the summit, which will be attended by more than 50 heads of state, including U.S. President Barack Obama.

Hecker's assessment comes just weeks after the United States agreed to a deal with North Korea in which Pyongyang would allow United Nations weapons inspectors back into the country in exchange for food aid. North Korea ejected inspectors from the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency from its Yongbyon nuclear complex in April 2009, about a month before it conducted its second nuclear weapons test.

"I wasn't so surprised that they would do a space launch," said Hecker, who is also the co-director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation. "What I was surprised at is, first of all they even agreed to a missile moratorium but then immediately turned around to say, 'We're doing this space launch' and quite frankly, that makes a mockery of the agreement."

North Korea says it has a right to a peaceful space program and invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said last week. The satellite would be sent into orbit in mid-April to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founder and current leader Kim Jong Un's grandfather.
