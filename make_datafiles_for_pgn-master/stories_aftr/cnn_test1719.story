"Ours is an experiment. Some parts didn't work," he explained to the crowd.

What many tea party conservatives can't stand about the Massachusetts health care law dubbed "Romneycare" is the plan's individual mandate that requires people in that state to buy medical insurance or pay a tax penalty.

The Wall Street Journal in an editorial on Thursday slammed Romney's reluctance to reject the individual mandate.

Republicans and Democrats alike see "Romneycare" as the prototype for what conservatives deride as "Obamacare." A similar mandate in the president's health care law is being challenged in federal courts.

It's a tight box for Romney: He must convince his fellow Republicans to look past the very health care reform provision that's at the heart of those court challenges.

"The individual mandate is a deal-breaker. People do not want to see government dictating that they purchase what is a private product. We think that's a disaster," said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity. The group is a prominent tea party organizer that also happens to be led by libertarian billionaire David Koch.

Phillips is one of countless tea party activists who want to hear Romney reject the mandate. "I think it will be difficult for a lot of voters to get around if the individual mandate is not repudiated," Phillips said.

That would be tricky for Romney who has repeatedly defended such mandates as a way to get the uninsured into the health care system.

"In order to get the tax exemption that you would normally get, you have to have health insurance because we want everyone in the system. No more free riders," Romney said in a 2009 interview with CNN.

In the same interview, Romney suggested that parts of the Massachusetts experiment could serve as a model for national health care reform.

The president worked in a dig at Romney.

"Mr. President, why didn't you call and ask how it worked," Romney responded at that GOP forum in New Hampshire.

Former Arkansas governor and potential 2012 rival Mike Huckabee has described "Romneycare" as "socialized medicine."

"We should learn from what's working and what's not working in Massachusetts," Romney told CNN in 2009.

The former governor, who has yet to declare his candidacy for 2012, has a new health care plan that he is to release Thursday. It would repeal and replace the national health care law. Instead, states would be allowed to conduct their own experiments in health care reform.

Romney's staff says don't expect an apology for "Romneycare." After all, this is a man whose latest book is entitled "No Apology."
