Last month, the country's production ministry said the authorities were investigating the deaths of more than 538 pelicans, and other birds, on the northern coast.

The health ministry advised anyone who might handle any of the dead birds to wear protective clothing, such as gloves and masks.

Peruvian Deputy Environment Minister Gabriel Quijandria told CNN last month the dolphins may have died from an outbreak of Morbillivirus or Brucella bacteria.

Morbillivirus is a class of viruses that are part of the same family as human measles; Brucella bacteria are the cause of many serious diseases in animals.

"When you have something this large, my gut would tell me that there's something traumatic that happened," Sue Rocca, a marine biologist with the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, told CNN last month. She raised a number of possibilities as to what could have killed the animals, including acoustic trauma.

Preliminary reports ruled out the possibility that seismic sound waves created by oil exploration in the area could have killed the birds, the environment ministry has said. Bird flu has also been ruled out.
