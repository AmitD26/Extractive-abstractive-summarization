Greensboro, North Carolina (CNN) -- A former aide to John Edwards testified Thursday about an unexpected pronouncement from a campaign videographer: She and the presidential candidate were in love.

Jurors on Thursday also heard from an interior designer who served as the conduit for hundreds of thousands of dollars of alleged coverup money from a wealthy Edwards benefactor. Bryan Huffman testified that neither he nor the donor knew that the money was to be used to conceal Edwards' extramarital affair with his mistress.

Prosecutors say Edwards broke federal law by accepting about $725,000 from heiress Rachel "Bunny" Mellon and more than $200,000 from Fred Baron, a now-deceased Texas lawyer who was his finance chairman.

Edwards is accused of hiding the money from the public and the Federal Election Commission, which polices political contributions, by filing false and misleading campaign disclosure reports.

Davis' testimony was the latest from Edwards staffers about their former boss's relationship with Hunter. Edwards, who was married at the time, eventually admitted to having carried on an affair with the woman and fathering her child.

Mark Kornblau testified Edwards had been told that if he signed the affidavit, the National Enquirer might consider not running a story about his affair with Hunter.

Prosecutors reacted with surprise to the testimony, asking the witness why he never told them about this in pretrial interviews.

Kornblau's response: Prosecutors never asked about the matter.

Davis, the former aide, testified he was surprised to see Hunter at a Detroit hotel in February 2007 because he thought her work as videographer had been completed.

The two exchanged pleasantries in the lobby.

Davis said he rode the elevator for a few floors with Hunter before getting off to avoid a longer ride with her.

"I would have preferred not to have seen her," Davis testified.

Minutes later, Hunter knocked on his door.

Davis also testified about a phone conservation involving Edwards after a September 2007 appearance on CNN.

Edwards was talking with a woman whose voice sounded like Hunter's, according to Davis.

Earlier testimony indicated Hunter believed she became pregnant in early May 2007.

But Elizabeth Edwards canceled the call, according to Davis.

Thursday afternoon's testimony featured Huffman, the interior designer from Monroe, North Carolina.

Huffman, a longtime friend of Mellon, said he understood money was welcomed because "Mr. Edwards needed financial support for a poverty center."

In all, Mellon who will turn 102 in August, gave $725,000 for something Huffman said she knew nothing about: Payment for Hunter's expenses.

Huffman suggested Mellon didn't consider her donations as specifically intended for the campaign.

The witness elicited a laugh from the courtroom audience when he admitted that Mellon said she knew individual contribution limits the 2008 election cycle but that Mellon considered the limits "a little low."

Mellon wrote several checks payable to Huffman ostensibly for a table, chairs and a bookcase. Huffman said he signed the checks, but instead of cashing them, he handed them over to the family of Andrew Young, the prosecution's star witness.

Young's wife, Cheri, endorsed the checks, but signed her maiden name.

Cheri Young testified Monday that Edwards told her that using money from one of his benefactors to pay his mistress's expenses was legal. Young said that she felt "disgusted" after being asked to endorse and deposit checks from Mellon.
