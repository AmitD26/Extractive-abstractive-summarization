Washington (CNN) -- At a gathering of his safety-minded peers, John Lee had a confession to make.

Last month, while driving to Madison, Wisconsin, Lee glanced down to review a playlist on his car's MP3 player. He scrolled through the titles, looking for Bruce Springsteen songs, "wanting to avoid the Adele songs that my wife had put there."

There was no crash. No one died.

Lee, an expert at human-machine interactions at the University of Wisconsin, had just co-authored a paper titled "Scrolling While Driving." And despite his own heightened awareness about the dangers of distracted driving, he had spent three to five seconds with his eyes off the road, a time lapse that placed him well into the danger zone.

The incident, he said, demonstrated the insidious creep of distracting technology into the automobile.

And if Lee -- who has forsworn cell phone and text messaging in his car -- can be lulled into a distracting experience, anybody can, he said.

"I've been very well-trained to the dangers of distraction, and yet I'm vulnerable," he said.

Lee and a panel of experts said that any distraction of two seconds or longer significantly increases the likelihood of a crash.

And the risk of a crash increases "four-fold" if a driver was on the phone, regardless of whether they were using a hand-held or a hands-free device, they said.

Some agreement; some dispute

Experts call it "looking but not seeing."

"The issue of cognitive distraction seems to have been left off the table -- forgotten a little bit," she said.

Distractions everywhere

But new texting technology creates a "perfect storm" of activities that create danger, prompting users to look and engage.

"The pace of change is daunting. The pace of change far outstrips the pace of regulatory response," he explained.

An often-quoted study on distracted driving known as the "100 car study" was conducted in 2003 and 2004 -- before the introduction of Facebook (2004), Twitter (2006), the iPhone (2007), and iPhone apps (2008), Lee said.

Driver distraction is a growing contributor to U.S. traffic fatalities, said Jeff Caird of the University of Calgary. In 1999, there were 4,563 distracted driving fatalities, accounting for 10.9% of all fatalities. In 2008, there were 5,870 distraction fatalities, 15.8% of the total.

But police reports are not a reliable source of information for the cause of distracted driving accidents, said Anne McCartt of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The cause of accidents is frequently not reported, and there are very large differences across the states, McCartt said.

The best studies, she said, used phone records to determine if drivers were possibly distracted at the time of a crash, she said.

Cell phones are more distracting than conversing with passengers, said Donald Fisher of the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Passengers can be distracting too, said Caird. Some modulate conversations; some don't, he said.

But for all the study on distracting driving, a lot is still unknown, the experts said. Experts, for example, don't know to what extent drivers self-regulate, confining dialing and texting to less dangerous times, such as at stop lights. And they don't know whether people who choose to buy hands-free devices differ from those who use hand-held devices, and how that may impact test results.

But experts at the NTSB forum say distractions of two seconds or more appear to divide safe driving from dangerous driving. The challenge, they said, was getting drivers to understand just how fleeting two seconds is.

Fighting fire with fire

The experts say the solution to technological distraction may be technology itself.

Industry has become a major force, using dashboard cameras to keep tabs on fleet drivers.

Increasingly, new cars are equipped with collision warning systems. And those systems are becoming more sophisticated. At the University of Iowa's National Advanced Driving Simulator, scientists have tested a seat belt that tightens to warn the driver of a possible crash.

"What we've learned is that auditory displays can be a nuisance," said Daniel McGehee, of the NADS lab. "They are annoying. They alert other passengers that something is going on and that's embarrassing to the driver." However, a seatbelt that tightens, a vibrating seat or a pulsing brake are "very driver-centric." "The driver can say, 'Oops, something's going on here' and sort of reorient their attention."

In John Lee's study, 50 people searched for songs on playlists of varying lengths using either an MP3 player or an aftermarket controller while driving on a simulator.
