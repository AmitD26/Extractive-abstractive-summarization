"Europe runs the risk of (being) squeezed between the muscles of low-cost China and the innovation of high-tech America," said Caio, a corporate high-flyer whose resume includes heading Cable and Wireless, Indesit and Olivetti.

"I am genuinely concerned that if Europe is not determined to go all the way we run the risk of having a 'half-baked cake' -- which would be very dangerous if ... digested."

"That is the challenge and that is the role of leadership in Europe -- (to) make sure we have the ideas, vision and new ability to mobilize the great forces and strength that Europe has for growth."

Watching the Vega's maiden launch from the Guiana Space Center in February had been exhilarating, said Caio.

"You put seven years of development on the line -- you have a few seconds in which the system needs to perform particularly well," he said. "It was a relief in the first 12 seconds, the first 24 seconds, and then it was off."

Made from carbon fiber, the Vega uses a solid propellant which gives it faster speeds than the Ariane 5.

Of the nine satellites launched into orbit by Vega rockets so far, seven had been developed by European students.

"Companies that have a mix of domestic and export are doing very well, indeed, because they have hooked on to growing markets," he said. "People who have been focused just on domestic market? Yes, they are suffering."

Avio was now looking to Brazil and China for growth, said Caio. "We're going where new consumers are learning the beauty of flight."
