(CNN) -- The stage is set for another classic men's grand slam final on Sunday after Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal set up a French Open showdown with much more than just the title at stake.

Djokovic is through to the Paris final for the first time after avenging last year's semi defeat against the man who ended his 43-match winning streak, Roger Federer.

The Serbian struggled to overcome Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in five sets in his previous match, but was dominant against the 16-time grand slam champion on Friday as he triumphed 6-4 7-5 6-3 in just over two hours.

His only defeat came against Robin Soderling in 2009, when Federer won the title to complete his career grand slam.

This year Nadal has not dropped a set in six matches, losing only 35 games in total.

"My level has improved slightly against last year ao I am satisfied and happy because I've already improved," said the 26-year-old, who is tied with Bjorn Borg on six titles.

Last year Djokovic beat Nadal in six successive finals, including two on clay, but he hasn't been as dominant in 2012 since overcoming his rival in the longest grand slam title match in history at the Australian Open in January. That followed his Wimbledon and U.S. Open successes in 2011, setting up his tilt at history.

"It's a dream to be in the final, but Rafa, who always plays so well here, will be the favorite."

"He played well under difficult conditions," the 30-year-old said. "But I had chances. There are no excuses.

"I tried and if I had won that second set, it would have been a different match. But it didn't work out."

Rod Laver is the last man to hold all four grand slam titles, and the Australian did it twice in a calendar year -- in 1962 as an amateur and then in 1969 as a professional.

American Don Budge also achieved the feat in 1938.
