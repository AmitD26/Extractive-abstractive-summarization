In the interim, David Cross wasn't waiting by the phone covered in blue paint, like Tobias Funke: he released his third comedy album in 2010, created and starred in "The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret "on IFC and guest-starred on "Modern Family."

I never really thought of it that way. I don't know of any project that's had a shelf life [like this]. It was about a four-and-a-half year window of people thinking, "OK, it might be any month now that it starts." You know, "Next month? Next year. Next year? Next two months. Tomorrow? Three years." And that process was four years, so it seems very present. That whole part was longer than actually shooting.

How does it feel to be back in the cutoffs?

I think it's going to be 13 episodes, not 10. There's too much story. Some characters will have two-parters. Everybody sort of participates, sometimes in a bigger way and sometimes in a tiny little thread that goes through everybody else's stories.

Is the new season going to be more serialized, like some of the later episodes?

Do you think the return of "AD" and the possible "Party Down" movie and the campaign to save "Community" have happened because fans have the Internet, or something else?

The networks finally caught up to the understanding of how people watch TV. If it was one year later, "Arrested Development" would still be on the air. Or, not currently, but it wouldn't have gotten canceled. Just one year! It took them a while to figure out what everybody else already knew, which is that people aren't watching the show the night it airs.

Netflix is great. They don't meddle at all. They know what they want. They're happy to have it. The idea of Fox and NBC and being kind of studio- or network-loyal is absurd. People don't give a s***. What is it? It's on the plane. It's on Netflix. It's on Hulu. It's on YouTube. It's on the Internet. That's how people watch TV.
