The South Sudan Referendum Commission (SSRC), which was formed last year by President Omar al-Bashir, said the preliminary results will be announced Saturday in Juba in Southern Sudan and on February 2 in Khartoum, Sudan's capital.

"If there is no appeal, the final results will be announced on February 7," said Justice Chan Reec Madut, deputy chairman of the commission.

"But if there is an appeal or appeals, they have to be discussed, and the final announcement will then be on February 14."

Preliminary results show 99% voted for independence with most of the count in the south completed.

"The law itself was framed in an unclear way with much repetition. ... It was shaky," he said.

Nevertheless, Khalil said, the referendum commission, which includes southern Sudanese and northern Sudanese members, worked easily together, "making decisions in accord."

Khalil said the commission did not have much time to conduct its work.

Both the federal government of Sudan and the government of south Sudan had committed themselves to funding the referendum with 400 million Sudanese pounds (about $160 million), Khalil said, but the commission only received 26.6 million SDG in the north, and 60 million SDG in the south.

Madut also pointed to "logistical difficulties" in the south during the referendum.

"We used human porters who delivered material on their heads to transport the materials and kits to the counties."

However, Madut said, the high turnout was historical.

"It is something that has never happened in Sudan; in fact some say it never happened anywhere."

Madut said once the counting is done, the rest will be up to the politicians.

Issues such as borders, the future of the oil-rich border district of Abyei, citizenship rights and how to manage international debts are yet to be resolved.

"So unless we are told to come back ... we we would like to take a beautiful vacation."
