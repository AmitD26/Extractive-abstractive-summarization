A Texas program lets Internet users around the world monitor live video from the Mexico border.

There, because of a $2 million grant from the state of Texas, anyone in the world can watch grainy live video scenes of cactuses, desert mountains and the Rio Grande along Texas' portion of the international border.

When Andrews spots something she deems suspicious -- perhaps a fuzzy character moving from right to left across the screen or people wading through the river with what appear to be trash bags atop their heads -- she and the site's 43,000 registered users can send e-mail messages straight to local law enforcement, who then decide whether to act.

"Today, there's a couple vehicles that are parked side by side next to each other," she said by phone, her 7-month-old cooing in the background, "but I can't tell what's going on, you know?"  See sample videos from BlueServo.net »

The video site's supporters see the 15-camera project as a stride forward in U.S. efforts to halt illegal immigration, drug smuggling and border violence. Run by the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, an association of 20 sheriffs from border counties, the project seeks to spread responsibility for the border's security across the nation's masses of Internet users.

About 20 million people have clicked on BlueServo.net since it launched November 20, and the Web site has gained national attention at a time when many eyes already were focused on the southern border of the United States.

Lawmakers are raising concerns about drug-related violence spilling into the United States from Mexico. And, bucking an upward trend, there has been an apparent decrease in illegal immigration into the United States because of the struggling economy, according to a report from the Department of Homeland Security.

Now, a virtual community says it's trying to fill gaps in that protection.

"It may take the efforts of many to get a small result, but that small result could be rewarding or great in the long run," he said.

But critics say the program tempts extremists to become involved in border security, which they say is a job better left to trained professionals.

Although there have been no reports of vigilante groups using the site to make arrests, Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, a Democrat from El Paso, said the program is "pandering to these groups to keep them politically engaged on this issue."

Since the site was launched in late November, only four arrests can be attributed to the cameras, said Don Reay, executive director of the sheriffs' coalition, which runs the project with money from Texas Gov. Rick Perry's office.

Those aren't the kind of results planners were looking for when they started the program, but Reay says the program's unseen value is in the fact that it prevents drug-related violence and trafficking.

Perry's office said the cameras prevent crime because they don't "allow the bad guys to op under the cloak of darkness anymore," according to Katherine Cesinger, Perry's spokeswoman.

He wants the program to expand "to cover every place where we don't have a fence" and says the primary goal of the camera program is to fight crime, not immigration.

"If a person wants to come, they'll find a point at which they're willing to cross," he said, adding that studies show that more people are drowning and dying of dehydration in increasingly daring attempts to cross the border as security increases.

Abernethy and Andrews, the two "virtual deputies," said they would like to see greater transparency in the project. Both said they have e-mailed notes of suspicious activity to law enforcement, but neither has heard whether their alerts were of any help.

"It's interesting. You see different things on there, but I just -- I don't know that it's doing any good," said Andrews, the stay-at-home mom. "I wonder if it's a waste of time."
