While the case highlights a recurring problem of theft at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, one law enforcement official said it illustrates an even bigger threat.

"If they (an unscrupulous employee) can be taking stuff out of bags, what can they be putting in? That's a serious issue," said the official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to talk about the case.

Port Authority police identified the man as Sean Henry, 32, of Brooklyn, and said he had been a TSA screener for 10 years.

TSA spokesman David Castelveter said the individual, who he did not name, "is being processed for removal from TSA."

"TSA holds its employees to the highest ethical standards and has zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace," Castelveter said.
