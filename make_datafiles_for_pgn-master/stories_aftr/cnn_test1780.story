Kelley, who triggered an FBI investigation that led to the resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus, claimed she was a high-level representative of the South Korean government, says the businessman, Adam Victor.

It's not the only time Kelley has claimed to have privileges because of a special diplomatic status. On Sunday, she called 911 complaining that a man she didn't know was on her property, describing herself as an "honorary consul general" with "inviolability."

Pillow talk: A spy agency's 'worst nightmare'

Kelley has close ties to several high-ranking military figures, including Petraeus and Gen. John Allen, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

Living not far from MacDill, home of the U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, Kelley and her husband, Scott, a doctor, hosted parties attended by high-ranking military officials. She even took part in a Special Operations Command-sponsored parachute dive, the Army said.

Hosting foreign guests was not unusual for the Kelleys, a high-ranking former CENTCOM military officer said.

In a May 14 e-mail obtained by CNN, Kelley invites Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn to join her at her home for dinner with "a group of VIP's visiting from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Napal, (sic) here by the authority of the State Department. ..."

Many guests at Kelley's parties were foreign liaison officers attached to the so-called Coalition Village at MacDill's sprawling compound, the source said. Most of those foreign liaisons were not cleared for sensitive classified access to military documents.

While the Kelleys opened their mansion to military brass, perhaps understandably, they haven't been as welcoming to members of the news media parked outside.

Kelley complained about it in an e-mail obtained by CNN that was sent to Buckhorn at 5:57 a.m. Tuesday.

"Bob," wrote Kelley, "Hope all is well. Can you help out with the obstruction by the paparazzi, since they're blocking our alley, our driveway and continue to trespass on my property. My kids are scared, and need their 'home' back."

Another e-mail from Kelley complained about Tampa police releasing recordings of her 911 calls last weekend.

Although 911 recordings released by officials often include caller phone numbers and addresses, most major news organizations do not release that information as part of the recordings.

Another fact that has emerged is that Kelley visited the White House complex three times since September 28, once for a tour with her family and twice for courtesy meals in its cafeteria with her sister and a White House staffer, a White House official said Friday. The staffer met the family during a visit to MacDill Air Force Base, the military installation near where the Kelleys live.
