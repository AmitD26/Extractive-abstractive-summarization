During the storm and for days after, the dome was a refuge of last resort for people who had nowhere else to go.   It was an iconic image of the city itself, and it became a symbol of all that went wrong with the evacuation.

Doug Thornton, senior vice president of SMG, a managing company in charge of the Superdome, watched as the city's crown jewel was shredded.

"There were projectiles that had actually been driven into the aluminum skin of the Superdome," he says. "We were very concerned about debris falling from the roof. We had no water pressure. We had no ability to remove trash and debris, and we were taking on more and more and more people. The Superdome was literally the poster child for misery and suffering."

Still, within days, he and his staff returned, called in architects, and began examining the Dome to see if it might be saved. For a month, they crawled through the framework, studied structural components, and finally decided that a restoration could be attempted. Maybe a long shot, but possible.

So mounds of debris were cleared. Anything that had been damaged beyond repair was removed, and the expensive process of replacing everything that had been lost began. The cost was staggering. A new sound system was put in for $7 million. Concession stands: $3 million.

So Thornton is grateful for every break that came his way. The crews replacing the roof hoisted a "No Hurricanes" flag as a joke to stave off any storms that would delay their efforts. It worked. They finished more than a month ahead of schedule.

Thornton knows better.   The work has continued nonstop for five years, and it goes on still.

This is the largest stadium restoration project ever attempted in this country on one of the largest rooms in the world. When it is all done, it will have cost more than $300 million.

And yet it is the small moments that Thornton remembers most as he walks the hallways, tending to this landmark of a beleaguered city.   Near one stadium gate, he points out a spot where every day during the crisis he saw an old woman crouching, helping tend to some children.   He says he still wonders, almost every time he passes, what happened to her.

But just as he did with the Superdome itself, he hopes for the best, and works on.
