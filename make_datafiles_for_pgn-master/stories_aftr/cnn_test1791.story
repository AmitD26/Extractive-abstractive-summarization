London, England (CNN) -- When I think back on this past week and the rollercoaster of emotions I have experienced at the Paralympics, I realize that everything happens for a reason.

Hours before the London 2012 opening ceremonies I learned that my appeal to overturn my reclassification had been denied. In that moment I felt defeat.

I think it was easy for me to get lost in the numbers -- the number of how many golds I could win -- but when this happened it forced me to reflect on my journey and what got me to this point. I realized I did all of that to become the best possible swimmer, athlete and person I could be for this very moment, medals or no medals.

I poured my heart, soul, sweat and tears into these past four and a half years to challenge myself, to see just how far I can push my body, to move forward with life, and most importantly because I absolutely love to swim.

As I went into Sunday's 50 meters freestyle, I knew what I had to do and I knew what I wanted. I had dreamed of that very moment for years and I wanted nothing more than to see our flag raised and hear the national anthem play.

I sat there and watched them stretch their legs as I stretched my arms and I knew that it would be an uphill battle, but I also knew that nothing is impossible. As I got out to the blocks, everything from that point on became a blur up until the point when I hit the wall and turned to see my face on the big screen.

Everything I had dreamed of came true. I proved to myself that no obstacle is too big to overcome. No matter what happens we all have the ability to overcome, and on Sunday I pushed my body to new limits and showcased my ability.
