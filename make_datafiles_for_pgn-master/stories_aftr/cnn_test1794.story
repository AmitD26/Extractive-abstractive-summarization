(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard sank a Japanese fishing trawler off the coast of Alaska on Thursday, more than a year after it was swept away by a tsunami off the east coast of Japan, authorities said.

The trawler capsized hours after the Coast Guard set fire to it, causing it to begin taking on water, said Petty Officer 1st Class David Mosley, a Coast Guard spokesman.

The U.S. Geological Survey advised the Coast Guard where the ship's sinking would have the least environmental impact.

The ship drifted from Canadian waters into U.S. waters on Saturday, and was located about 180 miles west of the Dixon Entrance in Southeast Alaska, the Coast Guard said.

The trawler was first spotted floating near British Columbia by a Canadian military air patrol, and it was then determined that it had been adrift since the tsunami, Canadian officials said last month.

The Japan Coast Guard identified the owner of the vessel after being contacted by Canadian officials, who were provided the identification number on the hull.

A Canadian vessel, the Bernie C, had expressed an interest in salvage, which delayed the operation, but officials deemed that it would be too unsafe to tow or attempt to salvage the vessel, said Coast Guard spokesman Kip Wadlow.
