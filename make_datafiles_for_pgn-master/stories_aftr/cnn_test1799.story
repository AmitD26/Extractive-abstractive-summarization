The Superstorm Sandy 2012 map was assembled by Google's Crisis Response Team to help residents of the battered East Coast, as well as their families and friends elsewhere, track the storm's progress.

-- Tracking data from the National Hurricane Center

-- Alerts, evacuation notices and other announcements from Weather.com and the U.S. Geological Survey

-- Current radar and cloud images from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory

By toggling through the options, users can display as many or as few of the pieces of data as they like at one time.

The map includes widgets that make it easy for users to share it via social media or embed it into their own websites or blogs.

The storm continued to churn through the northeastern U.S. Tuesday morning, bringing extreme weather conditions in a broad path that stretched from north Georgia all the way to Canada.
