Paul Stanley, pictured here  in April, co-founded Kiss with Gene Simmons in New York in 1973.

The apparent tachycardia happened while the band was rehearsing for a performance at a casino in San Jacinto, California, about 90 miles (145 km) east of Los Angeles.

"My heart spontaneously jumped to 190 plus beats per minute, where it stayed for over an hour necessitating paramedics to start an IV and give me a shot to momentarily stop my heart and get it into a normal pattern," Stanley, 55, wrote on his site www.paulstanley.com.

A call to Kiss manager Doc McGhee for an update on Stanley's condition was not immediately returned late on Saturday.

Hits during its heyday included such anthems of teen rebellion as "Rock and Roll All Nite" and "Shout It Out Loud." Stanley released a solo album last year. E-mail to a friend
