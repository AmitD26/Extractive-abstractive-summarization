(CNN) -- Teenage sensation Lydia Ko followed up her record-breaking round of 10-under-par on day one of the Women's Australian Open with a score of 69, but it wasn't enough to retain the overall lead.

Colombian Mariajo Uribe, whose round of nine-under on Thursday was overshadowed by her 15-year-old rival, again kept a bogey off her card as a 67 took her one shot clear on 15-under.

"I went out just wanting to get in the competition more, after two months without playing, so it was a fun round," Uribe told the tournament's official website.

"I made good putts, took advantage of the opportunities and the same thing I did today. So I feel pretty good.

"I think four-under is a pretty good score out there. I mean, it's not an easy golf course. I'm pretty sure it is a pretty good score for me," she said.

"I mean at some points, because my putting was so good yesterday when it didn't go in I was a little disappointed but I think I putted well out there and played well."
