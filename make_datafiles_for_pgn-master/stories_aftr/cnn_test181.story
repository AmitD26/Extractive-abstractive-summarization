(CNN) -- New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez had a "consulting relationship" with a Florida anti-aging clinic accused of providing banned drugs to baseball players, but there's no evidence he did anything to violate baseball's Joint Drug Agreement, one of his attorneys told CNN Monday.

Attorney Joe Tacopina said Rodriguez was one of many athletes who consulted for Biogenesis.

Fast Facts: Performance Enhancing Drugs in sports

"It's witness testimony from one witness -- a witness who's not going to be available, in my prediction, to either testify in arbitration or at some federal proceeding," he said.

When asked why he wouldn't say unequivocally that Rodriguez didn't use performance-enhancing drugs, Tacopina again cited confidentiality considerations.

"If I utter those words, I've just violated the confidentiality clause of the JDA -- that's the bottom line," he said. "... If you're a supporter or a detractor, what happened to him is not fair by anyone's standards. It's clearly a vendetta, it's clearly a witch hunt to get him 211 games -- not justifiable under anyone's scenario that is being objective."

"While we believe that your public comments are already in breach of the confidentiality provisions of Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program (the "Program"), we will agree to waive those provisions as they apply to both Rodriguez and the Office of Commissioner of Baseball with respect to Rodriguez's entire history under the Program, including, but not limited to, his testing history, test results, violations of the Program, and all information and evidence relating to Rodriguez's treatment by Anthony Bosch, Anthony Galea and Victor Conte," he wrote.

Rodriguez is playing during the appeal, which the players' union filed on his behalf two days after the suspension was announced.
