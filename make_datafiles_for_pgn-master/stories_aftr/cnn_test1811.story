"This week I am leading one of the biggest and most high-powered British delegations ever to visit China," Cameron said in a piece written for the Wall Street Journal.

"It is the biggest delegation ever to China, led by a British Prime Minister," Sebastian Wood, British ambassador to China, told a press briefing in the embassy prior to the visit, according to China's Xinhua news agency.

Wood said discussions will be held on a wide range of topics including trade, finance, energy and education.

"We will discuss our shared interests in international security. We want to work with China to help in global efforts to prevent Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon, and to put pressure on corrupt and intolerant regimes in Africa. We hope we can work closely together to prevent conflagration in North Korea and to improve the situation for the Burmese people."

Cameron's visit to China is his first as prime minister.

China reported last year that it recorded an 8.7 percent growth in its gross domestic product -- a broad mesaure of economic output -- defying global economic trends. Over the last 30 years, China's economic growth has averaged nearly 10 percent, surpassing Japan and moving into the No. 2 spot behind the United States.
