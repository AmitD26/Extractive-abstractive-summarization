(CNN) -- They came from all across America: from Connecticut to Florida to Illinois, and many points in between.

One had been in the Marines for nearly four and a half years, another for just a few months. Many served in Afghanistan, earning numerous honors before making it safely back home to the United States.

On Wednesday, the military released the names of the seven Marines killed Monday night during a training exercise at Hawthorne Army Depot in western Nevada. They were all under 26.

Those killed are:

"Remember him as he was and as who he could have been and in the future," retired Camp Lejeune Marine George Barrows told CNN affiliate WITN. "After all, he did it for our country."

"I not only salute him in his passing, but I salute everyone ... in the armed forces today," said Cmdr. David Gralla of Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 813.

Martino was engaged to his high school sweetheart and the couple were planning a wedding next year.

Like his fallen colleagues, he amassed a host of honors in his military career, such as the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and Sea Service Deployment Ribbon.

Muchnick played sports at Eastern Connecticut State University before leaving school early to enlist. The decision wasn't a surprise to his lacrosse coach Justin Axel.

"I knew that he would thrive in that situation. He was that kid that would do everything you tell him to do, was great at following orders," Axel told affiliate WTNH. "He was just one of those tough, hard-nosed kids that you'd just dream of having."

Ripperda was just nine weeks away from ending his career in the military, after serving tours in Haiti and Afghanistan, his father, Kurt Ripperda, told affiliate KSDK. His parents were relived once he came back to the States, figuring he was safer closer to home.

"No matter if it would've been nine weeks or three years, it just hurts," Ripperda said. "He was so close to getting out, but he was a good Marine. I was proud of him."

His fiancee Abby Malone said the couple was planning to marry in May, according to affiliate WOOD-TV. Malone told the station she is "more proud (of Taylor) than I can say."

At St. Stephens High School where he graduated in 2010, his former football coach Chip Watts said he was like a son to him and a tough team player.

"Pure tenacity. Work ethic. Desire," Watts told affiliate WSOC. "Whatever the kid did, he did it 100 miles per hour."

Hawthorne Army Depot, about 140 miles southeast of Reno, is used for storing ammunition and weapon stocks awaiting demilitarization. The facility also provides high-desert training facilities for military units.

The night after the incident, the Marines issued a statement saying that 60 mm mortar rounds and tubes used to fire them are being pulled pending the investigation.
