The average price of regular across the continental United States stood at $3.74 on Friday, a 5Â½-cent drop from the last Lundberg report on February 22, survey publisher Trilby Lundberg said. That comes after an increase of nearly 54 cents since late December, she said.

Crude oil, which makes up about 70% of the price at the pump, went down slightly in the past two weeks, Lundberg said. Most refineries have finished their seasonal maintenance and are gearing up for spring and summer driving demand, meaning fuel supplies are "more than adequate."

Average per-gallon prices in other cities:

Boston: $3.78

Chicago: $4.00

Houston: $3.56

Minneapolis: $3.68

Norfolk, Virginia: $3.59

Portland, Oregon: $3.77

Tulsa, Oklahoma: $3.50
