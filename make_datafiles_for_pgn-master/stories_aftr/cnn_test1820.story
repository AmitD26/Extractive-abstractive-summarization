Tal Kalakh, Syria (CNN) -- In the western town of Tal Kalakh, rebel fighters stand their ground as government forces loom just yards away. But here, bullets aren't flying.

That's because the two sides have agreed to something remarkable -- a cease-fire. While fragile, the agreement could be a blueprint for peace across more parts of the country, which has seen incessant bloodshed for 23 months.

If the local cease-fire continues to hold, it would defy failures at the national and international levels to implement a meaningful halt in violence.

"We are for peace. We don't want war. We are 100% committed to peace," said a rebel leader who goes by the name Al Abrash. "But if they want a war, we are ready for that. We didn't agree to the cease-fire out of weakness. We did it to protect the women and children."

The walls of buildings in the city center are still covered in revolutionary graffiti; "God is great! Freedom," one read and "down with the thug," reads another.

The cease-fire is a first step of a private "reconciliation initiative" led by a sheikh and a member of Syria's parliament.

"Before the agreement we reached, there were intense battles here. Many civilians, militants and soldiers were killed, a lot of blood was spilled. After the agreement there have been some individual violations like a soldier opening fire... but those have been dealt with straight away," Sheikh Habib al-Fandi said. "Compared to the past this is a state of peace and security."

Residents, surprised to see an international TV crew escorted by officials into their city, swarmed around the CNN team in the main square. More than a dozen people complained about harassment by government-backed militias known as "Shabeeha."

One man with his three young children said he could not leave the city out of fear government forces would detain him.

Another man said his two sons were among more than 400 Tal Kalakh residents detained since the uprising.

The governor of Homs, where Tal Kalakh is located, described the city as once being "extremely dangerous and volatile," but now he says he is able to visit and even meet with the militants.

He says Tal Kalakh is an experiment.

"If the media and military support of terrorism is stopped ... I am convinced Homs will go back to what it was like within four months," Governor Ahmad Munir Mohammad said.

While rebel and government forces keep their positions around town, an unusual meeting takes place between a parliamentarian and rebels.

The men agree on almost everything: They don't want a sectarian rift in Syria, they don't want foreign jihadist fighters entering the country, and they say government thugs must be stopped from harassing the population here.

"We have already tried to apply this concept in areas of Damascus ... so this can be applied anywhere in Syria, as long as there is no interference by other countries," the parliamentarian said.

Still, both sides acknowledge, the fighting could reignite anytime.

And there's one fundamental mission the rebels will not back down from.

"Our goal is to bring down the regime," Al Abbrash said. "It's impossible to change that -- impossible to back down from that goal."

Abu Udey says the men in his city were forced to arm themselves after peaceful demonstrations were met by violence from regime forces.
