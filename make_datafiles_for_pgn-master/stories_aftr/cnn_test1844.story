Placerville, California (CNN) -- California's attorney general is "actively reviewing" an animal charity executive who had agreed not to take a higher office with another charity after a state investigation into how her previous employer had spent its donations, a spokesman for the AG's office told CNN.

The woman at the center of the review, Terri Crisp, has been identified by SPCA International in its tax filings as one of its directors or officers. She also serves as the spokeswoman for the charity's "Baghdad Pups" program which, according to SPCA International, "helps U.S. troops safely transport home the companion animals they befriend in the war zone."

In the summer of 2007, Noah's Wish reached a settlement agreement with the state of California in which the charity agreed to forfeit $4 million in donations out of the $8 million raised by the charity.

Under that settlement, Crisp agreed not to "serve as an officer, director or trustee or in any position having the duties or responsibilities of an officer, director or trustee, with any nonprofit organization for a period of five (5) years from the date of the execution of this Settlement Agreement."

Yet in a filing with the North Carolina secretary of state's office last year, SPCA International named Crisp in its list of officers and directors.

The former bookkeeper, who wants to conceal her identity for reasons unrelated to her work at Noah's Wish, told CNN that donations came pouring into Noah's Wish soon after Hurricane Katrina. Crisp had appealed for donations on numerous television networks, including CNN.

"There was cash, there were checks, there were cashiers checks, there were letters -- heartbreaking letters from kids who, instead of having birthday parties, they wanted all the money to go to Noah's Wish to help those poor little animals," the woman said. "On a given day, we would have, oh my gosh, easily $20,000 ... just in checks."

And she said suddenly Terri Crisp changed, hiring her daughter and acting as if the money was hers to keep. Both made six-figure salaries, the former bookkeeper said.

When approached by CNN at her Placerville, California, home, Crisp told CNN she has "nothing to hide" but refused to answer any detailed questions without permission from the organization's communications director.

CNN requested an on-camera interview several weeks ago from Stephanie Scott, the SPCA International public relations director, but Scott never responded either by phone or e-mail.

CNN said now was her chance to correct the record she saw as inaccurate.

She added, "I can't answer any of your questions. Believe me, I would love to."

She did tell CNN that the Noah's Wish board of directors set her salary and that she is now an employee, not a director, at SPCA International.

A CNN investigation into SPCA International found that the charity raised close to $27 million to help animals worldwide but spent nearly all of that money on fund-raising expenses paid to a direct-mail company.

In 2010, SPCA International owed $8.4 million to Quadriga Art and its affiliated company, Brickmill Marketing Services, according to publicly available Internal Revenue Service 990 tax records.

Quadriga Art is one of the world's largest direct-mail providers to charities and nonprofits. It is the same fund-raiser hired by two veterans charities that spent tens of millions of dollars for its services -- triggering a Senate investigation last month into whether one of the charities should retain its tax-exempt status.

There's no question that a charity needs to spend money to raise money, according to Bob Ottenhoff, president of the charity watchdog group Guidestar. But he said that SPCA International's tax records raise "a number of red flags."

Of the $14 million raised in 2010, SPCA International reports it spent less than 0.5% -- about $60,000 -- in small cash grants to animal shelters across the United States. It also said it spent about $450,000 -- about 3% of the total raised in 2010 -- to bring back animals from Iraq and Afghanistan as part of its "Baghdad Pups" program.

On its website and its tax filings, SPCA International describes as a program that "helps U.S. troops safely transport home the companion animals they befriend in the war zone."
