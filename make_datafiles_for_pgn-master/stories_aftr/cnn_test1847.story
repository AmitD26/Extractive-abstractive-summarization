(CNN) -- It's time mass worker casualties stopped seeming so commonplace.

And on Monday, more than 100 people died in a fire at a poultry factory in northeastern China, not far from North Korea -- an area the Wall Street Journal says is known as "the Iowa of China." Sounds wholesome, huh? All but one of the gates to the burning building were locked during the blaze, trapping people inside, according to state and international media reports.

What's arresting is that most China experts quoted on the disaster expressed little surprise. Many have compared this week's fire to a similar one at a toy factory in 1993, which killed 87 workers. In both cases, doors were locked. Workers trapped.

"(T)he lack of proper fire safety equipment, exits and training for workers are all too commonplace in China's factories," the China Labour Bulletin says in a news release.

These events should ignite international outrage.

Opinion: The bloodshed behind our cheap clothes

Their questions -- Why were the doors locked? Why haven't we been able to see the bodies of our family members? -- should be answered. And I'll hold out hope they will be, if not by the government than by a crusading citizen.

The result was a fitting tribute to the dead. A work of art.

In addition to gathering the names, with the help of volunteers, Ai created a wall of children's backpacks in Germany. He called it "Remembering." The 9,000 backpacks, viewed from afar, spelled out this sentence, which reportedly was spoken by a family member of a child who was killed in the earthquake.

"She lived happily for seven years in this world."

Will someone in China take up the cause of the new victims?

In Bangladesh, too, there are signs the tragedy may lead to safer work conditions, but there is still much progress that needs to be made.

So obviously everyone signed that, right?

Nope. Walmart and the Gap are notable standouts, according to the International Labor Rights Forum, which is organizing protests of those U.S. companies.
