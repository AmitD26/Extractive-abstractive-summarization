In fact, she is head of the charity, Save the Children International.

As the first global chief executive of the world's largest kids' not-for-profit, she leads the organization with the business acumen and astute professionalism of a Fortune 500 company.

But in the long term, the organization's remit is centered around improving the way children are treated across the world.

"We want to play a role as a catalyst to really challenge some of these fundamental wrongs that can't be allowed to continue into the 21st century," says Whitbread.

There's no room for vague ideas of "wanting to do good" in a charity like Save the Children.

"You can't just expect to be praised for doing good, you've got to be running a professional organization."

"I do think it's a business where our bottom line is children's lives," says Whitbread, 49.

"We have to be the most efficient we can possibly be, we can't afford to be sloppy and just trying to do the right thing."

To engage with business leaders in Davos, Whitbread needs to emphasize the economic case for the charity's work.

"If I went around talking about children, I don't think that I would get very far," she says. "But if I talk about young people, democratic dividend or the fact that many of these countries are now emerging markets with increasingly young potential workforces, business people can relate to that. It all depends on how you pitch it."

WEF is not only an opportunity to make the business case for the welfare of children, but it's also an ideal forum to strike up relations with companies keen to give back and be a part of the solution.

This includes accepting pro-bono work from the likes of Boston Consulting Group to forming corporate partnerships with Bulgari, GSK, IKEA, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever.

Save the Children has been criticized in recent years, accused by some of being inefficient after Haiti's 2010 earthquake.

"If there is genuine criticism then we look at ourselves and say 'Ok, how could we be better coordinated? How could we be more efficient?'"

"We have got enrollment in school up to rates that were never the case before the earthquake, so I also think that sometimes the criticism can be unfair."

In 1999, she left her job with Thomson Financial and moved her young family to Senegal in west Africa to become regional director for Oxfam.

It is not a job that affords much rest. Just back from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone, Whitbread is about to leave for North Korea.

"One of the great things about the work that I'm doing now is it's appropriate to bring one of my kids along sometimes. So my daughter came with me to India, my son to China, they've seen quite a bit of the world."
