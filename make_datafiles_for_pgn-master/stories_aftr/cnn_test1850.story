"My campaign is for all Egyptians and especially a campaign for the poor and the alleviation of the struggle between classes,' he said, according to the MidEast News Source.

"As a new president for a new Egypt, my first decision will be a quick rise in salaries for most of the working citizens, either in the public or private sectors, and also aid for poor people the very first moment I am in the (presidential) palace."

Egyptians head to the polls beginning Wednesday for historic elections -- the first democratic vote since President Hosni Mubarak was forced from power early last year.

The charismatic candidate has unique popularity. He's neither an Islamist nor a status-quo candidate. And, he's the most viable candidate for idealists, liberals and revolutionaries who turned out in Tahrir Square to protest the rule and help bring about the end of Mubarak's rule.

Sabahy identifies greatly with the revered Nasser, an Arab world hero whose nationalist and populist rhetoric reverberated on the impoverished streets of Cairo and other towns in the 1950s and 1960s.

He first got involved in politics during his student days at Cairo University, where he expressed full-throated displeasure with Anwar Sadat, Nasser's successor. He also opposed Mubarak, who became president after Sadat was assassinated. Over the years, he has been imprisoned for his activities.

His stirring message of economic justice, accompanied on the campaign trail by Nasserite nationalist tunes, has been well-received by citizens across society -- organized labor, youth and rights groups, academics and public figures.

"He is our protector," said Mohamed Mowafi, a Baltim electric company worker. "We trust Sabahy... he's always among us and serving us. Even when he was a member of parliament, he remained here with us."

The Middle East Media Research Institute -- which monitors, translates, and studies Arab, Iranian and Turkish media, schoolbooks, and religious sermons -- translated a 2005 TV interview with him espousing violence against the United States in Iraq.

"When a weapon is pointed at the Americans, it is good," he said. "Any kidnapping or slaughtering of an American in Iraq is good."

He called al Qaeda in Iraq, the militant group that conducted attacks against U.S. troops and Iraqi forces, a "resistance" group and a "positive phenomenon."

Speaking in the interview on Dream 2 TV, Sabahy said, "one must salute this organization (al Qaeda) when it kills any American soldier -- soldier, not a civilian."

In the present day, he has opposed an amnesty deal for military rulers if they face charges after they leave power.

"I have no option but putting anyone who participated in the killings and attacks on protesters to fair trial, even if those are members of the ruling military council," Sabahy told McClatchy.

Sabahy's backers say their man has touched a chord with the masses and hope he gains momentum at the polls.

Aswat Masriya, a news outlet, quotes Amr Helmy, former minister of health, as saying "Sabahy has been a true revolutionary since his college years, he also has a detailed program that has room for all types of Egyptians."

Abdel Haleem Kandil, a prominent columnist, said he decided to cast a ballot for Sabahy after hearing him talk "about peasants and workers with details that shows he has a direct relation with them, something that no other candidate has."
