Beijing (CNN) -- China's recent economic downturn is spurring a new wave of worker strikes, which experts say are the only effective channel for them to air their grievances.

"A dozen workers got injured during the clash and were sent to hospital."

China labor unrest flares as orders fall

In June, workers at the Toyota and Honda Motor plants in southern China went on strike, halting production and forcing pay hikes. Experts attribute the spike in protests to employers maximizing their shrinking profits at the expense of workers.

"There are a broad range of complaints but they are basically related to being squeezed by their employers who are themselves making less profit," said Crothall.

"Also many businesses in the Pearl River Delta are planning to relocate inland and this is creating uncertainty and anxiety among the workforce."

China's economy has become the world's second largest after three decades of rapid growth, and much of that growth has been driven by exports and large infrastructure projects. But lately, the economic engine has been running out of gas.

China's mighty industrial engine is stalling

Chinese officials have tried to boost the economy with wage increases. Several provinces and cities have increased wages this year. Shanghai raised its minimum wage by 17%, while Guangdong, China's export base, boosted theirs by an average of 21%.

Some experts say the salary hikes will accelerate the country's industrial restructuring, saying higher labor costs will force enterprises to be more technologically advanced and transform China's export-oriented economic growth model to one that is boosted by domestic demand.

"Labor unrest is a glaring reminder to them that their attempts to reduce social injustice and income disparity are not working," opined Crothall.

"They are trying manage social and economic disputes in the usual administrative top-down manner without giving workers a voice in resolving their own grievances. That is why workers have no choice but to take to streets to make their voices heard."

Workers can only turn to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a government-sanctioned organization whose primary mission is to support Communist party policies and seek basic compensation for workers. With no means of collective bargaining, workers resort to petitioning the government -- or illegal protests.

He Yuancheng, who works at the Laowei Law Firm, said workers typically go on strike due to lack of labor union or organizations that can genuinely represent their interests.

"To protect worker's rights is to protect stability," he added. "Only when rights are protected can stability be realized."
