(CNN) -- An official tally of Mexico's presidential election returns -- including individual recounts for more than half the ballots -- confirmed Enrique Pe単a Nieto as the winner of the election.

The official tally included individual ballot recounts in 54.5% of the country's electoral districts.

Amanpour: Can Nieto save Mexico?

For his part, Pe単a Nieto told CNN that "I am president by the majority decision of the Mexicans."

If Lopez Obrador, who was the candidate for a leftist coalition, continues his challenge, the process could stretch out for months.

The federal electoral tribunal, known as TRIFE, will begin on Monday to accept complaints of voting irregularities.

The tribunal will have until September 6 to complete its investigation and ratify -- or reverse -- the official election results. The new president will be sworn in on December 1.

Lopez Obrador's supporters protested nationwide. In Mexico City, they staged sit-ins and blockades.

Officials have called this election the most transparent in Mexico's history. It was the first election in which scanned copies of district-by-district election returns were posted on the Internet.

But accusations have arisen of electoral manipulation by the PRI.

Its apparent victory last weekend would mark a triumphant return after 12 years of rule by the right-wing National Action Party, known by the acronym PAN.

An anti-Pe単a Nieto youth movement said it received 1,100 complaints of irregularities. And the group Civic Alliance found in a survey it conducted that 30% of voters reported witnessing at least one type of irregularity.
