(CNN) -- Vera has found a good man.

Although undocumented, Lucio was able to find work as a contracting muralist in Houston, where Vera -- a U.S. citizen -- was born and raised. He learned to speak English in less than three years for work and the need to communicate with the "love of his life" as he put it.

"I love this country and have made it my home. I want to be able to contribute to this country and give back in any way I can," said Lucio. He said he got his Tax ID number as soon as he started working because he wanted to get started on the right path and pay his taxes.

Vera also depends on Lucio for emotional support as she suffers from PTSD. She is a victim of sexual molestation and suffered mental and physical abuse while growing up.

Come March, many mixed-status families will breathe a sigh of relief knowing they won't have to remain separate for a long period of time while they apply to become legal residents in the U.S., according to a new rule made by the Department of Homeland Security announced last week.

"I'm so relieved he gets to stay here while we go through this process, it makes a big difference," Vera said.

Sarah Monty, Lucio's immigration lawyer, is optimistic that his waiver will be approved.

USCIS Director Alejandro Mayorkas said in a press release: "The law is designed to avoid extreme hardship to U.S. citizens, which is precisely what this rule achieves."

"The change will have a significant impact on American families by greatly reducing the time family members are separated from those they rely upon."

"This final rule facilitates the legal immigration process and reduces the amount of time that U.S. citizens are separated from their immediate relatives who are in the process of obtaining an immigrant visa," said Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano in a press release.

Monty fears that because the eligibility is so specific to a certain group of people, many undocumented immigrants are going to be confused as to why they do not qualify and suggests they seek out legal counsel. She said the new regulation was a huge step forward and sadly long overdue.

Undocumented immigrants married to a U.S. citizen are the most vocal group said Monty, and if this provision works, this might extend to other groups.

The new rule does not apply to U.S. children with an undocumented parent. In other words, you cannot give birth to your own waiver. The child, whether undocumented or not, must have a U.S. citizen as a parent.

"Applying for this waiver means that you are putting yourself out there. ICE told me that their priorities are to go after criminal aliens," said Monty, but added, "Undocumented immigrants without a criminal history do not need to worry."

The National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum applauds the Obama administration for their rule change.
