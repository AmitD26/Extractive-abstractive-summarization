(CNN) -- Investigators probably will have to use dental records to identify some of the eight people who were killed in a wreck involving a church bus and two other vehicles in eastern Tennessee, a Tennessee Highway Patrol official said Thursday.

"The crash is so horrific ... it's probably the worst that I have seen in my career ... and I've worked in several, several counties in my" 17 years on the job, Miller said.

The bus, owned by a North Carolina church, was carrying a group of seniors on their way back home from a religious conference when one of its tires malfunctioned, sending the bus across a median on Interstate 40 and crashing into an SUV and a tractor-trailer, authorities said.

Two of the 14 other people who were hospitalized after the wreck had been released by Thursday morning, said Travis Brickey, a representative of the University of Tennessee Medical Center.

Two people were in critical condition; seven were in serious condition, and three were in stable condition, Brickey said. None of the victims' names was released.

The group of senior citizens was called "Young at Heart," said Rick Cruz, the church's pastor.

The wreck happened about 2 p.m. Wednesday in Jefferson County, about 40 miles east of Knoxville, the Tennessee Department of Safety said.

Video from the site showed smoke rising from the tractor-trailer. Some people walked out of the bus on their own, but emergency personnel had to extricate others, Miller said.

"This was such a horrific crash that determining if seat belts were used or not ... may be extremely difficult to impossible to determine," he said.
