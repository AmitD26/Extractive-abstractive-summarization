News headlines of the past week portray an administration engulfed in potential scandal, providing opponents of President Barack Obama with plenty of ammunition to try to derail his agenda in the early months of his second term.

The scenario invites comparisons to previous presidents who faced controversies in their "lame duck" second terms, such as the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reagan administration and Bill Clinton's impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

However, a rocky start to a second term doesn't mean certain derailment of a president's goals or agenda. For example, Reagan and Clinton both signed major fiscal legislation during their lame duck terms, noted Howard Kurtz, the host of CNN's "Reliable Sources."

In question is whether Republicans intent on focusing attention on potential scandal will be willing to work with Obama and Democrats on such major legislation. Already, the president has seen stiff GOP opposition derail gun legislation he proposed in the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre.

Carney spoke as Attorney General Eric Holder announced a Justice Department investigation of whether any laws were broken in the IRS political targeting. Congress also is looking into the matter, with a House committee hearing scheduled for Friday.

According to the AP, U.S. officials have said they were probing how details were leaked in May 2012 about a foiled bomb plot that targeted a U.S.-bound aircraft, and that the Justice Department collected two months of telephone records for some AP reporters and editors without notifying the news organization.

The Republican National Committee called for Obama to demand Holder's resignation over the matter. If not, said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, it will show that "the president of the United States believes his administration is above the Constitution and does not respect the role of a free press."

Even Democrats such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada condemned the secret subpoena of AP phone records.

"I have never seen anything quite like this except in the past during the Nixon years," veteran Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told reporters in an allusion to the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's impeachment and resignation.

Carney also avoided specific comment on IRS political targeting, saying it would be inappropriate until the upcoming release of an inspector general's report on the matter. He noted Obama's remarks to reporters on Monday that if the reported allegations of political targeting proved true, they would be "outrageous" and require immediate action against those responsible.

However, Carney criticized the continuing GOP focus on the administration's response in the immediate aftermath of the Benghazi attack last September 11 as a "sideshow that's driven purely by or largely by political interests."

In particular, Republicans accuse the administration of not bolstering security prior to the attack, of botching the response to it, and of misleading the public in its slow-to-evolve explanation of events less than two months before the November election.

An independent review of the Benghazi incident, led by Former Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen and former ambassador Thomas Pickering, found no wrongdoing by Clinton.

CNN's Chief National Correspondent John King noted that history shows popular politicians can overcome links to scandal.

In 1988, Democrats tried to use the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reagan administration, which involved weapons sales to Iran that funded anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua, against then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, he said.

The scandal involved an attempted cover-up, televised congressional hearings, criminal charges and resignations, but in the end, Bush won the presidential vote.
