That scene played out Wednesday in Spain, leading U.S. residents to ask, "Could it happen here?"

Where the United States, like most of the world, has a standard track width of 4 feet, 8.5 inches, the Spain train was designed to run on both that gauge and on wider tracks that are used in much of Spain and Portugal, Harrod said.

"The wheels on this train actually move, so you can imagine the complexity that adds," he said.

"It's an enormously complicated train, nothing like the U.S. or North American continent has ever seen," Harrod said.

In the crash video, he said, "the train looks like it peels off the track between the diesel engine and the first coach." This is the weakest juncture in the train, he said, because the coach car is far lighter than the engine.

America's slower locomotives

While Harrod said there are routes between Chicago and St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit where trains can top 100 mph (the Spain train was reportedly running about 118 mph), the closest the United States has to high-speed rail is the Acela Express that runs between Washington and Boston at advertised speeds of up to 150 mph.

But that's a bit misleading, some say. The trains rarely travel that fast because along many stretches the tracks aren't rated for that kind of speed. Amtrak announced in September it plans to run test trains at 165 mph in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

While Acela trains could potentially derail, Federal Railroad Administration requirements demand they be heavier than similar trains in Europe, making them less likely to fly off the tracks, according to an excerpt from "Waiting on a Train: the Embattled Future of Passenger Rail Service," posted on the publisher's website.

"The high-speed corridors in Europe and Japan are straight, level, sealed from intrusion, and set aside solely for fast passenger trains," McCommons writes. "To create such a corridor in the Northeast with its dense population would cost tens of billions of dollars and require the purchase or condemnation of more land and neighborhoods."

The curves, traffics and tight tunnels may actually make U.S. trains safer, Harrod said, because engineers have to pay more attention, especially since there's far less automation in American trains than in European ones.

American trains also have an auto-stop feature, so if an engineer misses a stop or caution signal, either inside or outside the cab, the brakes are applied automatically.

President Barack Obama used the 2009 economic stimulus package to dole out $8 billion for high-speed rail projects, and in 2011 proposed spending $53 billion over six years to promote construction of high-speed lines around the nation.

More than two years later, there's been little progress.

While the federal government offered money to spearhead high-speed rail efforts in states such as Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida and California, Republican governors in Wisconsin and Florida killed the projects.

In California, voters in 2008 approved a 520-mile high-speed rail project that would have carried riders between San Diego and San Francisco at nearly 200 mph. Since then, the cost estimate has gone up, speeds have come down and the route has been limited to a roughly 200-mile stretch between Fresno and Burbank.

A private company has proposed a line in Texas, while another private proposal would bring high-speed rail linking Miami and Orlando, Florida.

But for high-speed rail to make significant inroads into the United States, the nation would first have to make significant improvements to basic infrastructure, such as tracks and bridges to allow freight and passenger traffic to coexist, said Brookings' Puentes.
