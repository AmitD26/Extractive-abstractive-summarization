Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two attackers and a security guard were killed on Wednesday during an assault on a Red Cross building in Afghanistan and a gun battle between police and militants, an Interior Ministry spokesman said.

NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Afghan personnel secured the scene. The ICRC confirmed an incident occurred at the building.

On Friday, attackers wielding suicide bombs, grenades and machine guns in Kabul struck the compound of another foreign agency -- the International Organization for Migration.
