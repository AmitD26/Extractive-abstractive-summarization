(CNN) -- Most people would struggle to place it on a map, but Socotra is one of the world's last unspoiled island chains -- an archipelago off the coast of Yemen that has wildlife so diverse it has been described as the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean.

German photographer Claudius Schulze had been fascinated by Socotra since reading about it in a magazine, but he was led there by an old proverb.

"I had a project that didn't work out and we have a proverb in Germany about being 'ready for the island' if you are exhausted -- so I thought it was time to go to Socotra," he said. "I started looking up flights and applying for a visa straight away."

The population of the islands is estimated at 44,000, according to the Socotra Governance and Biodiversity Project (SGBP). However, Schulze said there appeared to be far fewer people, with official figures including many who now live elsewhere.

Although the official language is Arabic, most people speak an unwritten Socotri language of pre-Islamic origin, according to the SGBP.

Schulze received hospitality from the Bedouin people of Socotra, staying in their homes and eating with them, but said he was never quite able to bridge the cultural divide he felt.

Schulze said he also witnessed the devastating impact of industrial fishing on the island's small boats.

"They are often victim of pirate European fishing trawlers illegally depleting their stocks, because neither Yemen nor (nearby) Somalia has effective coast guard to stop them.

"I realized for the first time what overfishing means. It's not about running out of tuna in 10 years' time, it means people will starve now because they don't get their daily fish."

He visited Socotra three times over a year, each time for three weeks, in order to see it in different seasons.

In addition to its endemic plants, reptiles and snails, Socotra has 192 species of land and sea birds, including many threatened species, and diverse marine life, according to UNESCO.

The SGBP says the local population has developed strong traditional rules to protect the island's natural resources because of its isolated position and history of self-sufficiency.
