(CNN) -- Utah's roller coaster few weeks regarding same-sex marriage has taken yet another sharp turn, with the state tax board announcing that legally married gay and lesbian couples -- even those wed in the brief period of limbo in Utah -- can file joint returns.

The Utah State Tax Commission detailed the apparent policy change posted on its website, explaining that same-sex couples who are eligible to file a joint federal income tax return can likewise file joint returns in Utah. In other words, the state -- for tax purposes -- will treat them just like heterosexual couples.

"This is just one agency, one decision," Roberts said.

Whatever the rationale, this shift marks a significant milestone for LGBT supporters in the traditionally conservative state.

Judge's ruling ignites same-sex marriage frenzy

The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals declined to immediately stay the lower court ruling, leading Utah officials to ask the Supreme Court to intervene.

The high court did just that in a two-sentence order on January 6 that, without comment, put same-sex marriages on hold in Utah until the constitutional questions are fully resolved.

That apparently unanimous order in favor of the state sends the matter back to an appeals court for expedited consideration. The Denver-based appeals court is expected to consider the case again in coming weeks more thoroughly, with a ruling possibly affecting all states in its jurisdiction: Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma.

That last state, Oklahoma, is in a similar situation after a federal judge struck down its same-sex marriage ban. But he immediately stayed his own ruling, as the matter works its way through the courts.

Still, what's happening in Utah was and remains less clear-cut. While the federal government has said it will recognize same-sex marriages performed between late December and early January in the state, the state had hinted that it would not.

This week's tax commission announcement, though, does signal at least parts of the state government are recognizing such unions. It applies not just to the hundreds married in Utah, but also to those gay and lesbian couples who might have gotten legally married in other states then moved to Utah.

Roberts, the state tax commission spokesman, explained that authorities -- including his group's director and the attorney general -- decided over the past 10 days that it made sense to have Utah play by the same rules, tax-wise, as the U.S. government until the legal situation plays itself out.

"We feel this brings us in line with the current judicial situation," Roberts said.

This shift may surprise some given Utah's reputation politically. It's the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, whose leaders have been vocal in efforts to limit marriage to a man and woman. Its voters have voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election since 1968. And its officials now have stood behind the legal efforts to defend their state's existing law.
