(EW.com) -- The Time Lord has conquered the box office.

A special nationwide 3D screening of the Doctor Who 50th anniversary TV special "Day of the Doctor" grossed a stunning $4.8 million at the U.S. box office.

What makes this particularly impressive: That's from one night. The 75-minute "Day of the Doctor" screened in 660 theaters as a one-night-only special event Monday and averaged $7,155 per location, with 320,000 tickets sold. Granted, the tix were $15 a pop, so that certainly helped.

In fact, the BBC's cult favorite show was the No. 2 movie in America on Monday, behind only The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Its gross is nearly as much as The Wizard of Oz in 3D made during its entire run earlier this year ($5.5 million). And it was more than indie fav Much Ado About Nothing ($4.3 million) or bomb The Fifth Estate ($3.3 million).
