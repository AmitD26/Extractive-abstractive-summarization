(CNN) -- Soccer may be the number one sport in most of Africa but basketball is growing fast and the NBA has set its sights on the continent to provide future stars, and tomorrow's fans.

In recent weeks, Amadou Gallo, managing director of NBA Africa, has embarked on a continent-wide tour including stop-offs in Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Africa. The talent hunt is part of the NBA's "Basketball without Borders" program, a community outreach project for young people, and is key to expanding the sport's global reach.

Basketball without Borders takes the top youth players, aged 19 and under, from all over the world and invites them to train with NBA stars and coaches. Launched in 2001, the program aims to promote basketball outside the U.S. and also offers young people the chance to develop life skills and education with their mentors.

"Part of making the game accessible is also putting it on the televisions," Gallo Fall said. "More players are going to come from the continent so we are going to have (NBA) games here, just like in Europe," he added.

In August, the NBA signed a multi-year deal with South African broadcaster SuperSport to televise games from the 2013-14 season in 47 Sub-Saharan territories.

Incoming NBA Commissioner Adam Silver -- who will succeed incumbent David Stern in February 2014 -- said the NBA is growing "exponentially" outside the United States.

Although he recognizes that soccer is Africa's most popular sport, Gallo Fall sees no reason for competition. "Basketball is the number two sport globally and that holds true in Africa," he said.

While more recently Chicago Bulls' Sudan-born Luol Deng, who played as an All-Star in the 2011-12 season, and Cameroonian Luc Mbah A Moute of Milwaukee Bucks have broken into basketball's elite league.

He said: "Some tribes in Sudan and Senegal have an average height of 6-foot-6, which also happens to be the size of the average NBA player. People in Nigeria, Mali and Congo tend to be very big and physical. We need to build a strategy to go into these regions and cultivate the talent through infrastructure and instruction."

"We think there is a huge opportunity," said Silver. "I mean, there's roughly a billion people on the continent of Africa, so just a little small sliver of those billion people can result in a very successful business for us."
