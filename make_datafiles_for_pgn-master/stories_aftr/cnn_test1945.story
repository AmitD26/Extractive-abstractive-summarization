Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- Tucked between snow-topped mountains, Lebanon's Bekaa Valley is home to dozens of ramshackle camps housing Syrian refugees who have little to protect them against the cold.

It was the image of children with no shoes in the bitter winter and mud that Hala Habib Qiblawi, a designer and mother of three, couldn't get out of her mind over the past year.

"It was the first thing ... the only thing that stayed in my head," she says.

This year, she decided to do something about it.

That's when Qiblawi realized she wasn't the only one who felt compelled to do something.

"Everybody was so angry, angry at the government, angry at the silence," she says. "Everybody was thinking of the refugees. And seeing that anger -- and I myself worried and angry -- I launched it."

She started a Facebook campaign, "Rain Boots for Syrian refugee children," with a target of 2,000 pairs of boots. The response stunned her. She achieved her goal within the first 24 hours, ending up with thousands more pairs.

"It's like really seeing, realizing that there is still humanity on earth, especially in this part of the world," Qiblawi says.

Helping to organize the distribution is Sawa for Syria, a nongovernmental organization started over coffee with friends by Rouba Mhaissen, a 25-year-old Lebanese Syrian.

A Ph.D. candidate living in London, Mhaissen came back to Lebanon two years ago for a visit and just couldn't leave.

"The number of refugees has reached a ceiling of 2 million in Lebanon with a complete chaos in NGOs, a complete lack of institutional coordination. So grass-roots organizations like us and many other initiatives are taking the lead to try and do something, but still the need is very very high."

Sawa for Syria now has some 2,000 members, all volunteers, and helps manage and distribute aid to camps across the Bekaa Valley.

Amina, 9, shows off how she can write her name in English. The other girls chatter about wanting to go back home to Syria.

But Suzanne, a 5-year-old with large brown eyes, stays silent as she slips her hand into mine, clutching it tightly.

"My eldest, her husband died recently too. They had three kids," she says, her heart so broken she seems numb to it all. As for so many other Syrians, hardship and pain are the norm.
