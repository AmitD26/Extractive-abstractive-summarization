First Up: Terror Indictment

AZUZ: First up, a new charge against Najibullah Zazi, one of the suspects arrested in connection with a terrorism investigation. He's been indicted on a charge of conspiracy "to use weapons of mass destruction." Zazi was arrested last weekend. This is all part of a Justice Department investigation into an alleged plot to set off explosives in the U.S. In a hearing yesterday, another suspect, Ahmad Afzali, who was arrested on charges of lying to authorities, was released on bail of $1.5 million. But his travel is being restricted.

AZUZ:  Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council is looking to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. All 15 countries who are members of the group voted for a resolution that would tighten control on nuclear materials. The measure also supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The presidency of the Security Council rotates between the member nations. This month, the U.S. has it, which is why President Obama ran yesterday's meeting.

Pittsburgh Summit

AZUZ:  After the U.N. summit, he and other world leaders headed to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for a gathering of the G-20, a group of the world's leading economic powers. They're not the only ones in town, though. Protesters have flocked to the city to take part in demonstrations. Yesterday, an unauthorized march turned violent as protesters clashed with police officers. As for the G-20, the global economy has improved since the last time it got together. But as Ed Henry reports, there's still a lot of work to do.

U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We finished a very productive summit that will be, I believe, a turning point in our pursuit of global economic recovery.

(SOUND OF PROTESTERS)

HENRY: The president acknowledged to CNN's John King that unemployment may get worse in the next few months, which is why he will be pushing his counterparts to sign on to a specific pledge to make the global economy more balanced.

OBAMA: We can't go back to the era where the Chinese or the Germans or other countries just are selling everything to us, we're taking out a bunch of credit card debt or home equity loans, but we're not selling anything to them.

HENRY: But getting the Chinese to sign on will be difficult, especially after Mr. Obama slapped a tariff on Chinese tires, which raised questions about whether leaders are reneging on free trade promises they made in London.

STEVEN SCHRAGE, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC & INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: So, is the United States going to be standing up and stopping this slippage? Or is it going to be further pushing the world down towards trade conflicts and possibly a downward spiral of new types of protectionism?

Disaster Declaration

AZUZ: Catching up on a couple other headlines now, starting with the recovery process in Georgia following this week's deadly flooding. President Obama has issued a Federal Disaster Declaration for four counties in the state. That will free up money and aid to help with the relief efforts. Requests for federal aid in other counties are being reviewed.
