But he'll always be the first.

On Tuesday, according to his former team, Schectman died at age 94.

The history was made November 1, 1946, when the Knicks traveled to Canada to take on the Toronto Huskies. Video from that game -- the first in what was then the Basketball Association of America, which a few years later became the NBA -- shows him finishing a give-and-go with a layup.

"They score a clean first basket," the announcer says on the video. "Dazzling passing."

By the time that shot went through the hoop, Schectman had already made a name for himself on the court.

He would perhaps be most associated with that pro team if it were not for his time with the Knicks, including the first points in its first game, which New York won 68-66. His on-court prowess helped land him spots in the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, Long Island University Athletic Hall of Fame and New York City Basketball Hall of Fame.

Schectman was accomplished outside basketball as well.

As LIU noted in a profile upon granting Schectman with its distinguished alumni award in 2013, he served in the U.S. Air Corps during World War II.

He and his wife, Evelyn, had two children and two grandchildren.

Still, it's that one shot in the fall of 1946, immortalized in the documentary film "The First Basket," that many most associate him with, now and for decades to come.
