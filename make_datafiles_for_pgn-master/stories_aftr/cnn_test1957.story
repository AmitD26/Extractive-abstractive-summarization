"No," replied Peres. "I say they have difficulties too, but I think President Obama is serious about (the deal), because he knows the outcome if they were to stop it at the moment. It may turn the Middle East into a nuclear region. It's (already) complicated (enough)."

Despite the tensions between Israel and Iran, Peres said he was still open to meeting with Rouhani should the opportunity arise.

"The Iranians are not our enemies historically. We don't have a joint border -- I don't see any reason why we should have a conflict," he said.

"The problem with Rouhani is his positions... But if he really (does) what they (say they will do), why not?"
