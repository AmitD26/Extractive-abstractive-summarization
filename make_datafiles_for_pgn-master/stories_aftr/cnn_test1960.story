The Giudices allegedly faked documents and lied on applications to get more than $5 million in loans over eight years before they joined the "The Real Housewives of New Jersey" cast in 2009.

The husband and wife are due in court in Newark for the added charges on Wednesday, according to U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman. The new counts stem from a $361,250 mortgage loan that Teresa Giudice, 41, got in 2005, Fishman said.

Teresa Giudice, in a written statement released after she was charged in July, said she would stand by her man.

"Today is a most difficult day for our family," she said. "I support Joe and, as a wonderful husband and father, I know he wants only the best for our lovely daughters and me. I am committed to my family and intend to maintain our lives in the best way possible, which includes continuing my career. As a result, I am hopeful that we will resolve this matter with the government as quickly as possible."

The indictment accuses the Giudices of exaggerating their income by faking her employment history while applying for loans. They allegedly failed to disclose rental and business income after filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2009.

The Giudices are free on $500,000 bond each, but they had to surrender their passports.

If convicted, the couple faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
