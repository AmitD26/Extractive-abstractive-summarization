London (CNN) -- During the 1970s, Britain's car industry was the sick man of Europe: many models were poorly designed and built, politicians and the nationalized company management lacked strategic vision while workers were often on strike.

Belying the moribund state of the global economy, sales of luxury models are now leading the charge. On Monday Rolls-Royce posted its best results in its 107-year-history with 3,538 cars -- which cost upwards of £200,000 ($308,000) -- sold in 2011, a 31% rise over the previous year's figure. This growth is powered by surging demand in Asia: China now joins the United States as the BMW-owned marque's most significant markets.

"We had an outstanding year in 2011 and we should take a moment to reflect on this Great British success story," said the company's CEO Torsten Muller-Otvos. Rolls-Royce spokesman Andrew Ball told CNN the company was profitable but declined to detail any figures.

The booming Rolls-Royce sales figures come days after its former sister company, Bentley, posted a 37% rise in global sales, also on the back of rising sales to China and the U.S. The Volkswagen-owned company, based in Crewe, in northern England, in 2011 sold more than 7,000 cars, the prices of which start at £133,000 ($208,000).

Toyota has recently created 1,500 jobs at its plant in Derbyshire in a £100 million investment while Jaguar Land Rover said it would double the size of its factory on Merseyside providing 1,000 new jobs.

Motoring journalist Iain Reid of What Car? magazine said part of the reason behind R-R's success lay in its product range. "If you make the right models people will buy them. The Ghost car is proving successful because it is a bit more affordable and less ostentatious than the Phantom."

Industry analyst Paul Nieuwenhuis said that while many customers bought luxury cars "by the meter" -- that is to say they care more about the image than the machine -- modern Rolls-Royce cars were exceptional vehicles. "They are surprisingly agile, and don't feel nearly as big as they actually are. And their attention to detail is unrivaled."

Nieuwenhuis, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School, said Britain had a global reputation for building luxury cars. "This is something that we are doing well, despite our own car market doing badly." He added that the Rolls-Royce sales figures showed that "rich people still have money" especially in China.
