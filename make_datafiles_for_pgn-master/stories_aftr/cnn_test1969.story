We had spent the night in Odessa, famous for its giant stairway featured in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film, "Battleship Potemkin."

They assured us it was the quickest way out of town, but I was anxious because we had just three and a half hours to reach Kherson where we'd be joining the 43 observers from the Organization For Security and Cooperation (OSCE) international observer team as they attempted to cross into Crimea.

The delegates were all from various militaries. Punctuality had been drilled into them. They would not wait for a late television crew, even if we had been given exclusive access to their convoy.

When we arrived in Kherson, the OSCE observers were getting a briefing about their planned route to Crimea.

Yes, they expected to meet armed pro-Russia military forces.

No, they did not like their chances of getting through, but it was their mission to try.

For almost three hours, we drove in a police-escorted convoy through sparse countryside and dilapidated Soviet-era towns.

It was a joy to see the Black Sea but at the same time, I felt some trepidation as it indicated we were approaching the Chongar checkpoint and we really didn't know what to expect.

We knew the men guarding the checkpoints up ahead were armed with assault rifles. The OSCE delegates we were travelling with were not carrying weapons and the Crimean authorities had made it clear they regarded any attempts by the OSCE to enter the peninsula as a provocation.

The team of observers had already been blocked on a different route to Crimea the previous day. This was their second attempt.

The men guarding it were indeed armed and wore balaclavas and military fatigues with no insignia. They stood below Russian flags.

Along the roadside, signs warned of land mines.

While the armed guards looked threatening, they were remarkably calm as they faced not only repeated demands from the OSCE observers but were taunted by pro-Ukrainian protesters who had followed our convoy.

A shake of the head was the only response he got from one of the masked guards.

For two hours, the OSCE officials repeatedly pressed their case, insisting they had a right to enter Crimea, but eventually they decided their efforts were futile.

The armed men would not budge. The weather was turning foul. The delegates turned their convoy around and headed back to Kherson to assess their next move.

As we waited to be waved through, two shots were fired. Up ahead, we could see gunfire smoke near a car waiting to pass from Crimea into Ukraine.

The pro-Russian forces manning the checkpoint immediately assumed defensive positions and stood back to back, weapons at the ready.

As we passed the white sedan that had been shot at, we could see that no one in the vehicle was hurt, but the front tire had been shot out.

After five days in Crimea, our team was due to head back to Kiev.

We would have to look for alternatives. By car or by rail.

We had witnessed one of these gunmen shoot out the tires of a vehicle trying to cross into Ukraine at a checkpoint in Chongar. We didn't want to risk a similar situation.

So with road travel struck off the list, we turned to the train timetables. So it seemed, had everyone else wanting to get out.

The Kiev-bound service was booked out but we managed to snare the last tickets on a train to Donetsk, another region in eastern Ukraine which identifies more strongly with Moscow than Kiev.

So we boarded the Sevastopol-Donetsk express at 7.55 p.m. and immediately negotiated our way into first class to accommodate the 12 bags of camera equipment and personal luggage that we'd been dragging around the countryside from Kiev, to Odessa, to Simferopol and Sevastopol for the past seven days.

Still, it was a markedly better and safer way to travel than by car. The carriages were full of young families and senior citizens heading to the Ukraine ahead of Sunday's referendum, there was a plentiful supply of tea with lemon and sugar, and at $15 for a standard ticket and $40 for first class, it was a bargain.

We are now all proud owners of these small glowing souvenirs of a journey that may have left us parched from the heat, but which gave us one of the few remaining routes out of Crimea. At least until after the referendum on Sunday.
