(CNN) -- Seth Meyers had big shoes to fill on Monday night.

The Daily Beast, which thought Meyers got "off to a rocky start on 'Late Night,'" noted that the newcomer "had a few missions to accomplish when we ran into him on Monday night."

From 'Saturday Night' to 'Late Night'

"He had to prove that Fallon's reign isn't a fluke, that late night really can be a home for the affable and good-natured," the Daily Beast's Kevin Fallon wrote. "And, most importantly, he had to show that the acute and observant brand of humor he displayed for 12 and a half years on 'Saturday Night Live,' many of those years spent as head writer and host of 'Weekend Update,' translates to the late-night talk show format."

Meyers even paid homage to Fallon in the form of a letter he wrote to his predecessor, and which he read during the opening of the show. So many nods to his "SNL" past seemed to make sense to The Los Angeles Times, which observed that Meyers' "monologue was reminiscent in style and cadence to his 'Weekend Update' segments, full of rapid-fire one-liners about the day's headlines."

Entertainment Weekly's Darren Franich gave the debut a grade of "B."

Music critic Ken Tucker was impressed, tweeting, "Jeez, @sethmeyers @LateNightSeth makes eye contact, subtly refers to cards, responds to what guests say ... he's, like, an actual TALK show host!" Others, too, seem willing to give Meyers some time to find his footing.

Michael Starr of the New York Post wrote that Meyers "eventually found his sea legs and drove his new 12:35 p.m. show to a solid, if unspectacular, debut. ... He's charming with a certain 'aw shucks' demeanor that doesn't seem forced or contrived, and he'll have plenty of time to grow into his new role as a late-night host," Starr said.
