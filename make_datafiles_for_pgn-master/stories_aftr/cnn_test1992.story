(CNN) -- David Beckham was always adept at curling the ball around a wall -- but when it came to the barrier of homosexuality in football, he broke straight through it.

Former England captain Beckham, who announced his retirement from football Thursday, was the first superstar footballer to embrace his "gay icon" status, freely giving interviews to gay magazines and openly talking about his gay fan base.

"I always liked to look good, even when I was a little kid. I was given the option when I was a page boy once of either wearing a suit or wearing knickerbockers and long socks and ballet shoes -- and I chose the ballet shoes and knickerbockers."

Once Newkey-Burden spent five months trying to organize an interview with the midfielder, only for the player himself to sanction the piece after reading one of the journalist's articles on football and homosexuality in Four Four Two magazine.

"David read the piece I did about how far football had come in dealing with homophobia," Newkey-Burden recalled.

"Look, there are 92 league clubs in England with each squad having around 20 players, so statistically, there must be some gay players, " added the journalist.

"One day it will be common place for footballers to come out and David Beckham will have played a part in that.

"He opened the door and it is the person who opens the door who makes the difference.

"Beckham said to the world: 'I'm straight, I'm the England captain and I think it's cool people are gay.'"

Despite Beckham embracing his "gay icon" status, football continues to struggle with homophobia.

Last February, U.S. football star Robbie Rogers announced he was retiring from football after "coming out" -- leaving Swedish player Anton Hysen as the only openly gay player in Europe.

Beckham was also key in footballers becoming fashionistas and attracting interest from the mainstream media, according to Newkey Burden.

"Gay football fans don't want 11 neatly coiffured and manicured players to admire," said the journalist and celebrity biographer who has written books about Adele, Brangelina, Michael Jackson and Paris Hilton.

"They're more attracted to the old-fashioned kind of player like Vinny Jones or Alan Shearer if I'm honest.

"But Beckham was someone who was proud to be a gay icon and made it cool too.

"It's now OK for players to have silly, floppy hair and dress in the way they do. He did that."

While former Spice Girl Victoria has gone on to establish herself as a leading fashion designer, it is Beckham who brought men into the 21st century with his eye for the latest trends.

Whether it was by provocatively modelng in his Armani underwear or being paraded in front of the press in another exquisitely tailored suit, Beckham set the bar high when it came to looking sharp.

"Sure he made some mistakes along the way (cornrows), but that's what made him a trendsetter -- he always led and never followed.

"He was certainly one of the first celebrities to de-stigmatize grooming pursuits that were previously seen as girls-only (his early penchant for highlights comes to mind).

"Lots of people would say that it helps he has an athlete's body, but there are plenty of sportsman who dress appallingly.

"I think it's his willingness to try new things combined with a clear appreciation for a good tailor.

That infamous sarong, which he was pictured wearing in 1998, was certainly one "eye-raising item" but as Newkey-Burden explains, Beckham had no regrets.

"When I interviewed him in 2006, I asked Beckham if he regretted wearing that 'dress'. He said: 'No, that's one of the things I'd do again!'"
