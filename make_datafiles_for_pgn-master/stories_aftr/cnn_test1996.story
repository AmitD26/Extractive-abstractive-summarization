Dubai, UAE (CNN) -- Call it a perfect market storm of wealth creation.

Since the start of 2013, the Dubai stock market has registered a near 200% gain to become the best performing financial market in the world.

The Gulf emirate's securing of the World Expo in 2020 is likely one factor behind this success as is the wider UAE's reputation as a safe-haven in a region riddled with uncertainty.

Oil averaging more than $100 a barrel for three years running, meanwhile, is driving growth towards record spending on infrastructure.

"The Dow Jones exceeded 165,000 points," said veteran Dubai trader Zakaria Al-Assar. "Still, Dubai (is at) 5,000, we are looking for more, inshallah."

These strong expectations have led to an upgrade for the UAE from the riskier investor category of frontier market to emerging market by financial index firm, MSCI.

Alongside neighboring Qatar, which was also upgraded this week, the UAE is now considered by MSCI to have the same investment status as the likes of China and Brazil.

Achieving emerging market status has been a long journey for both Qatar and the UAE.

The trading floors in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha may be quaint, with limited trading sessions, but they are active.

On the day CNN visited the Dubai exchange, banking stocks were trading up 15% after a wild correction earlier in the month.

"You have to remember just a couple of weeks ago we went through quite a correction and a number of blue chip stocks we were looking at came down between 20-30%," said Khokhar.

Expect more bumps, shocks and opportunities along the way.
