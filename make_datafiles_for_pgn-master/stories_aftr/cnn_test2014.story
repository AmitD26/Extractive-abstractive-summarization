The Army said federal law requires that officers retire "at the highest grade" at which they served satisfactorily and McHugh determined that in Harrison's case, it was one step below his current rank, the statement said.

An Army investigation found that Harrison mishandled sex assault allegations reported to the command, Lt. Col. Alayne Conway said. No other details were provided.

Harrison was suspended from his post as head of U.S. forces in Japan last year amid the investigation.

The military has struggled with the issue of sexual misconduct reports within its ranks.

A debate in Congress over whether to remove that decision-making process from the command structure was the subject of political infighting earlier this year.

Harrison joined the Army in 1980 served in numerous capacities around the world. He is due to retire in October.
