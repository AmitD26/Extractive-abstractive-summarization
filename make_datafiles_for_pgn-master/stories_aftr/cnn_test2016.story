(CNN) -- Filippo Inzaghi has scored some big goals in his time -- but his next goal may prove the most important and arguably the toughest.

Inzaghi's joy is his former teammate Clarence Seedorf's misery with the Dutchman dismissed after Milan finished eighth last season, ruling the club out of European football for the first time in 16 years.

"AC Milan wishes to communicate that coach Clarence Seedorf has been sacked, and the first team has been entrusted to Pippo Inzaghi until June 30, 2016," said a Milan statement.

Seedorf only arrived in January after replacing Massimiliano Allegri, but was unable to resuscitate Milan's flickering European hopes.

He remains the club's most successful striker in European competition with 43 goals to his name, 70 in total following his time with Juventus

Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson once joked that Inzaghi "must have been born offside," testament to the Italian's predatory instincts in front of goal.

After arriving at Milan in 2001 following a move from Turin, Inzaghi won the 2003 Champions League and helped the Rossoneri repeat the triumph four years later by scoring both goals in the 2-1 win over Liverpool.

Inzaghi, who scored 25 goals in 57 appearances for Italy, retired in 2012, netting the winner on his final club appearance against Novara.
