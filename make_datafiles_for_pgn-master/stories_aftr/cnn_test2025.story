10 most non-traditional celebrity engagement rings

The couple sparked engagement rumors in March after Cyrus was seen wearing a diamond ring on her finger at an Arizona event, but representatives for both denied it.

"She makes me really happy," he said. "When you start (filming), you want to be professional, but when you're filming those scenes with someone and pretending to love them, you're not human if you don't feel something."

Meanwhile, Cyrus expressed gratitude to her supporters Wednesday on Twitter. "thank you for all the love today :)" she tweeted. "i'm happy to share this news with you all. I feel like all my dreams are coming true."

"All I ever hoped for as a daddy was to see my kids reach their dreams," tweeted her father, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. "To find happiness...peace of mind...and someday know...true love."
