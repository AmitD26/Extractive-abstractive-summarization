(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said Saturday he is committed to resolving the crisis in his country as long as peace efforts are conducted in "neutrality and independence," state media reported.

Brahimi, who recently replaced Kofi Annan as the U.N. and Arab League point man for the conflict, highlighted the need for both sides to find a resolution and reiterated that the Syrian people are his first priority.

"I believe that the president is more aware than me of the scope and seriousness of this crisis," Brahimi said after his meeting with al-Assad.

For now, Brahimi said he has no plan for bringing an end to the Syrian conflict.

Brahimi plans to open an office in Damascus, and al-Assad told him the government will enable him to carry out his duties.

Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister and U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, plans to meet opposition figures and other groups during his visit.

Brahimi was named to the post after Annan resigned in August, blasting the Syrian government for not implementing a cease-fire he negotiated in April and complaining about the "escalating military campaign" of the opposition.
