London (CNN) -- What do you do if a potentially valuable Banksy graffiti work appears on one of your buildings? If you're the local council in the English seaside resort of Clacton-on-Sea, the answer is: remove it fast.

To most observers, it would appear to be a sharp piece of social commentary highlighting anti-immigration rhetoric, but it sparked a complaint Tuesday to the local council that it was itself offensive and racist.

The Tendring District Council's graffiti team moved in, and as of Wednesday morning, the Banksy was no more, the council's communications manager, Nigel Brown, told CNN.

But at the same time, if they considered that the image could be seen by some people as offensive or racist, they had a responsibility to remove it, he said.

"It's damned if you do, damned if you don't," Brown said. "But there is a 'whoops it's a Banksy' moment."

From graffiti to galleries

Banksy's social comment comes at a sensitive time in local politics. A special election is taking place on October 9, triggered by the defection of the Essex district's member of Parliament from the Conservative Party to UKIP.

Immigration is a key issue for the two parties, with UKIP committed to limiting the number of migrants entering Britain.

Is Bambi the female Banksy?

The words on the mural could have caused distress, Brown added, if the reader did not understand the irony. "It's not the sort of thing we would want to be on one of our own buildings in Clacton," he said.

Other Banksy artworks have become tourist attractions in their own right or have been snapped up by collectors willing to spend big bucks.

It seems Clacton-on-Sea won't get to reap similar benefits.
