In addition to fundraising events, Romney was in Washington to hold talks with DeMint as well as legislators from Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which hold primaries next month. The legislators included House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, according to GOP aides.

Adding that "I just think we just need to look at where we are," DeMint strongly suggested that rival candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich should drop out to end the nomination fight and focus the party's efforts on defeating Obama in November.

"I just hope at some point they'll realize whether they can win or not," DeMint said of Romney's top opponents. "If they can't, the best thing they can probably do is to help the one who is going to win."

This apparent call for unity contrasted sharply with the message offered Thursday by Santorum, who has been Romney's foremost challenger in large part thanks to support from conservative voters.

He was referring to earlier comments from a top Romney adviser, Eric Fehrnstrom, who said his campaign will "hit a reset button" to take on Obama in the fall if Romney wins the GOP nomination. He added, "It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again."

Romney quickly blasted Santorum's remarks, saying in a statement he was "disappointed to hear that Rick Santorum would rather have Barack Obama as president than a Republican."

"Any of the Republicans running would be better than President Obama and his record of failure," he added.

They said the adviser's remarks bring into question whether Romney will drop his conservative stances, some of which are different from others he'd taken earlier in his career, in favor of more moderate positions ahead of the general election.

A website unveiled Thursday by the Gingrich campaign features the Fehrnstrom quote above an Etch A Sketch that highlights Romney's policy shifts when viewers hit a prompt labeled "shake." Written on the drawing toy is "Mitt's Etch A Sketch Principles."

On the Tea Party Nation website, blogger Judson Phillips wrote Thursday that the Etch A Sketch image "is what conservatives have been warning about for months with Romney."

"He is a liberal. He has no core convictions and as soon as he becomes the nominee, he will move far to the left," Phillips continued.

In an interview broadcast Thursday on Public Radio International, Obama said Romney was "pretending" the health care plan he helped institute as governor of Massachusetts differed from the national plan that Democrats in Congress passed two years ago.

Santorum and other conservatives have repeatedly attacked Romney over the Massachusetts health care plan, while Romney says he never called for implementing such a program at the federal level.

In the radio interview, Obama pointed to similarities between the two plans without mentioning the Republican front-runner by name.

This week's Illinois result gave Romney at least 41 of the 54 delegates at stake in the contest to face off with Obama, increasing his total to 562, according to CNN's estimate. Santorum is second with 249, Gingrich third with 137 and Texas Rep. Ron Paul last with 69.

A total of 1,144 delegates is needed to clinch the GOP nomination.

Santorum said he expects to do better in coming primaries and caucuses, including Louisiana on Saturday.

The former senator has made a strong showing in traditionally conservative Southern states, winning Alabama and Mississippi a week ago while Romney finished third.

"Almost everywhere I've campaigned, because of the way of the money, we start behind and then we gain ground," Gingrich told about 100 supporters in Lafayette, Louisiana.
