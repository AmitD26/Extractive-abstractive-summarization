(CNN) -- She's not so much the pinup girl of British horse racing as the "pinned-together girl."

Hayley Turner has been a trailblazer for female jockeys in the UK, but it's taken its toll on her tiny frame -- and she doesn't mind at all.

"I could break bones all day long," says the 31-year-old, who once received fan mail addressed to "Hayley Turner -- Hospitalized somewhere in Cambridgeshire."

"It's not a man's world, not at all. Okay, more men do it but there are women too."

She had moved her mount Seal of Approval to the inside rail to vie for victory in the home straight, but the horse clipped the heels of a rival and crashed to the ground at full pelt on top of her.

Her pelvis was broken, along with three vertebrae, just 10 days after she returned to racing following five weeks out with a broken ankle -- which to this day is still held together by screws.

"I don't remember a thing, which is odd as I think I was conscious at the time," she says.

She made a full recovery but was then told by authorities she could not race for a full year, a decision she later appealed with the backing of her family -- and won 60 races that shortened season.

"My family hate the injuries as it's always a case of 'let's go to hospital and see how bad it is,' " she admits, "but when I'm not training I'm just annoying, ringing them the whole time, asking what they're doing.

"So I think they're happier when I get back riding."

She was the first past 500 career victories, the first outright Group 1 winner and, in reality, the first from Britain to have forged a full-time career in horse racing.

"I feel happy for what I've done, personal pride, but anything more than that I don't think I'll appreciate until I stop riding," says Turner, whose first race was in 2000 -- almost three decades after women were first permitted to compete by the Jockey Club.

"I might look back and think, 'Actually, I did quite well with that.' But as I said, I work with the lads and like the lads. I don't feel any different and I don't get treated any differently by the other jockeys or trainers."

Despite her down-to-earth tomboy attitude, she did wryly admit to Tatler's website this year that she had once won a race on a horse called Wonderbra -- whose mother was named Supportive.

But more of an honor has been riding winners owned by Britain's Queen Elizabeth -- the grand patron of the nation's racing and breeding scene.

Her mother used to be a freelance horse-riding instructor and now runs a business finding new homes for retired racehorses, but the track was never a great interest in the Turner household.

"She'll look up my races the night before and know where I'm riding. If I win a race she always tells my mum so, after every win, I'll get a text from my nanna and my mum."

Not once have her family asked her to give up the sport she loves: "I think they know it would make me even more determined."

She does, though, with her warped sense of humor, like to blame her previous brain injury on "when I do stupid things, which is often" -- but the reality is there are no scars from that 2009 incident.

"I'm just happy to be riding. It's not been my best season but I'm not too worried by that -- there's been some tough times to come back from," Turner says.

"You can be forgotten quickly as a jockey but I'm getting my foot back in the door. I'm getting plenty of rides and I'm happy with that."
