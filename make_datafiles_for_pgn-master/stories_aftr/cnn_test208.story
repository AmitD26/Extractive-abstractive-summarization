(EW.com) -- My relationship with the who-should-play-Christian-Grey timeline goes as follows: I wanted Matt Bomer the entire time I read the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy ... right up until Charlie Hunnam was announced. Then I inexplicably got very excited for Hunnam's portrayal of the troubled billionaire. And now that Hunnam has dropped out of the film, I'm left feeling 50 shades of empty and confused. Do I want Matt Bomer again? Or do I want someone like Hunnam, with a lesser-known face (or one that's usually covered in hair)?

He's good at dark-and-twisted. Christian Grey is a tortured soul. His journey is a dark one, and his obsessions all stem from a very raw, emotional place. And if DiCaprio can do anything, it's play a character that is so layered and broken down and yet puts up this playboy front for the crowd (Gatsby, anyone?).

He would give the film a certain credibility. No one can deny that seeing DiCaprio's name on the Fifty Shades of Grey poster would add an additional level of credibility to the film, both in that the standard of acting would automatically increase, and DiCaprio's acceptance would mean that the role intrigued him. And to be honest, I can see how it would. The books might be considered soft porn to some, but Christian really is a fascinating character, if you're able to look past the exterior.

He would expand the film's audience. Much like I argued that Hunnam would bring in a new Sons of Anarchy audience, DiCaprio's universal appeal would reach out to many more than just those who read the books.

Although I by no means expect this casting to happen, it certainly expanded my views on who could play Christian. What about you? Are you still waiting on Matt Bomer, or are you ready to accept the next twist thrown at you?
