Davis was just 21 years old when her husband, an Army corporal, was killed in Iraq. Four months after his death, she created the American Widow Project. The nonprofit has connected more than 900 young military widows through the Internet and weekend retreats since 2007.

CNN asked Davis for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011.

Taryn Davis: I was getting everything ready for an American Widow Project retreat in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Widows were arriving as I was on the phone.

CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to the American Widow Project?

Davis: This means that more widows will know they are not alone. It may seem like a simple statement, but more than 3,000 widows had their lives changed with two men at their door. After they get that news, the real struggles start. And that's where the American Widow Project comes in.

CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero?

With nine to 10 events held nationally throughout the year -- with hopes to do more -- these are a major aspect of the organization and connecting this generation's widows. This money will truly go toward not only saving lives, but the legacies of our nation's heroes.

CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work?

For this generation's military widows and widowers, their wounds can't be seen (even) though they are some of the most severe. It is due to that fact that most of those suffering from the most major of losses don't receive the support and compassion they so deeply deserve.
