(CNN) -- Joe Woyjeck last talked to his son Kevin, the outdoors enthusiast who took up his father's firefighting profession, on the phone just hours before Kevin died.

The deaths are under investigation, but officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under fire shelters, blankets meant to protect against flames and heat, as a last resort against an inferno that overwhelmed them.

For Hotshot firefighters, no such thing as a routine wildfire

He appeared suited for a hotshot crew, a group of top-shelf wildfire battlers who are called to get close to the blaze, dig barriers and clear out the brush and other material that otherwise would fuel it.

"Always wanted to be a fireman. He loved the outdoors. Sleeping in the dirt was not a big deal to him; he actually enjoyed it, I think," Joe Woyjeck said, remembering a son who always had a fishing rod in his car. "Just a great kid, not a mean bone in his body ... always looking forward to becoming a firefighter like his dad.

The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a largely youthful group:14 were in their 20s. The eldest, unit superintendent Eric Marsh, was 43.

The physical challenge appealed to Ashcraft, a father and husband who wanted to be a firefighter since middle school.

Ashcraft "wanted to do hotshot work until he physically no longer could do it" and trained feverishly, said his mother, Deborah Pfingston.

Deployed for the summer, the group missed their families but enjoyed the camaraderie, Pfingston told CNN on Monday.

"They loved each other. It was almost a band of brothers. These guys ate together, they slept on the ground together when they were fighting fires, these were his comrades," she said.

"He worked out as a cross country runner, (but) he didn't even excel in running until he graduated from high school, because he knew the hotshot thing, you had to be the best," he said.

Now, the elder Woyjeck says he and his wife feel stuck in a sleepless nightmare, coming to terms with their loss.

"My wife and I and our daughter and my other son have kind of sheltered ourselves from the exact incident," he said. "When the time is right, we'll dig in and figure out exactly what happened."
