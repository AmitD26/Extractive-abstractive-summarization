And if ISIS were to attack the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, that number would shift much more dramatically, with 72% saying they'd then support sending ground troops to the region.

"Support for sending U.S. ground troops into combat operations against ISIS forces is growing, although a majority continues to oppose 'boots on the ground' in Iraq or Syria," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "But that could change in a hurry if the situation worsens in Iraq."

The poll also found a war-weary public with little faith in Obama, high confidence that a terrorist attack on U.S. soil will happen again soon and expectations that fighting ISIS will be a drawn-out engagement.

Those surveyed said they aren't expecting to see ISIS quickly defeated. More than four in five said U.S. military action against the group will be long and difficult.

Opinion: Is killing ISIS leader a good idea?

That number is up from 55% in a September poll -- a small enough increase, Holland said, that it can't be attributed to a changed public mood after last week's attacks on the Canadian government.
