If you know the real Ferguson, you already know why the riots happened, and you can predict what will happen once the grand jury makes its decision.

A little background: I went to elementary school about 40 minutes south of Ferguson, in the St. Louis military suburb of O'Fallon. I'm pretty familiar with the area, a frothy mix of the South, the Midwest and the Rust Belt.

While the black population in the St. Louis metro area has grown and moved out of the city, teachers, firefighters, hospital employees and most importantly cops in the suburbs are largely white. My school district didn't hire its first African American teacher until 1986, and my elementary school has never had a black teacher despite having a sizable number of African American students.

This is the St. Louis area in a nutshell, black suburban expansion, slow white acceptance and a dull Midwestern peace as the first integrated generations live together.

Unfortunately the image you get of Ferguson is perfectly encapsulated by this opening I saw from a national television reporter commenting on the fact that the median income is "only" about $37,000 and apartments rent for as little as $450 a month.

I don't think the media misunderstanding is intentional, but there's been an inherent bias in the way the city and the conflict have been covered.

Ferguson, O'Fallon, Florissant -- all of the small suburbs outside of St. Louis proper are where black folks moved to in the 1990s and 2000s to get away from violence and poverty in the city. As I walked along the very street where Michael Brown was shot, I looked around wondering where the "bad" neighborhood would actually start? Better yet, where did the "poor" neighborhood start?

I saw townhouses and apartments. I saw wooden decks and lawnmowers. This looked like Everytown U.S.A. -- not a car on blocks or a busted window pane in sight. If you have any doubt, just ask the residents.

The infamous "QuikTrip" gas and snack station that was burned down is a prime example. If you talk to locals, they'll tell you that QuikTrips are generally located in nicer neighborhoods, just like there are high-end grocery stores and low-end grocery stores.

The fact that the Ferguson Police didn't release a police report until weeks after the incident, which was full of redactions, and under pressure from the Department of Justice leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth. This is not a rabble-rousing community. There's no history of mass civil action, as a journalist friend of mine from nearby Florissant told me, "the civil rights movement skipped St. Louis."

Had the police been forthcoming from day one, everyone would have been back to their regular lives within a week. However, when you ignore people, even regular folks, and treat them like collective criminals in their own community, that's when people get angry.

Then, to quote Matthew McConaughey's character from "A Time To Kill": Imagine they were white. I'm pretty sure our national understanding, and sympathy for Ferguson, would be very different.
