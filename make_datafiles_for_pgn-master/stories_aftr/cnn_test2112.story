The national Sigma Phi Epsilon organization said it is "indefinitely closing the chapter."

"Without suggesting that every member had knowledge of this questionnaire, the questions asked in the document are deplorable and absolutely inconsistent with our values," Brian Warren, the fraternity's executive director, said in a statement.

The university said its investigation into the matter will continue and will likely take several weeks to conclude.

"We will gather all relevant information and examine it to determine whether policies or laws have been violated, and by whom," the UVM statement said.

The national fraternity said it will collaborate with the university "to consider the potential return to UVM at the appropriate time, which would occur only by mutual agreement."

It added that "any behavior that demeans women is not tolerated by the fraternity."

"SigEp will strengthen its efforts to provide college men with education focused on respect for women and the development of healthy inter-personal relationships," Warren said.
