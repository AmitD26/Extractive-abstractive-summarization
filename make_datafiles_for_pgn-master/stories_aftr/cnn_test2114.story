(CNN) -- In West Africa, the bodybuilder is a popular subject for photographers. Since the 1950s, the musclemen have peered out from stark images, symbols of "strength, power, pride and status," in the words of gallery owner Jack Bell.

In the photographs of Leonce Raphael Agbodjelou, the image goes deeper.

Leonce, who's based in Porto-Novo, Benin, did a series of photographs called "Musclemen" in which he showcases the local bodybuilders. In one photo, a fit, smiling man holds ... plastic flowers. In another, three men pose together, all with bouquets. That's not all: The men pose in colorful, patterned pants and in front of equally dazzling backdrops.

"Benin is all about color -- Porto Novo is like a visual assault," he says in an email on behalf of his client. (Leonce does not speak English.) "The images are straight out of urban market scenes and the hurly burly of bars, street stalls and traffic jams. Leonce is part of a generation experiencing rapid change and his photographs capture this energy and unfettered zest for life."

"The photographer's studio is, like the hairdressing salons of Porto-Novo, a meeting place for a diverse demographic and a site of exchange," he says.

Father and son have their differences, Bell observes.
