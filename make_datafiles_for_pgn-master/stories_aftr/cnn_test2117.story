(CNN) -- Late last month in Aleppo, Syria, civilians who have cell phone subscriptions received a foreboding text message in Arabic: "Game over."

Those on prepaid phones -- including many opposition fighters and activists, who tend to throw their devices away after several uses to avoid detection -- did not receive the text, or subsequent messages, signed by the Syrian Arab Army, telling them to surrender their weapons.

"The government was sending a message to the rebels through people who subscribe," says Taufiq Rahim, a Dubai-based Arab affairs analyst -- an act of psychological warfare carried out by cell phone.

The texts have increased Syria watchers' concerns that the embattled government has realized both the full potential of using the Internet and mobile carriers to communicate with its leaderless opposition, and the importance of the networks as domestic and international lifelines for the rebels.

Last month, the network was down for 10 days in Aleppo, the current focal point of the fighting, with activists and rebels communicating largely by satellite phone until service was restored September 20.

Since the summer, smaller, infrequently reported outages have plagued Damascus, Aleppo and other hard-hit cities.

"The outages we've seen in the last couple of months appear to be because of physical damage from fighting, or from power outages. They're short-lived, they flicker on and off. We've seen some Internet being (purposely) disabled in more disruptive parts of the country, like Aleppo."

Two weeks ago, rebels angry with the government's mass text intensified their attacks against forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. The escalation resulted in the partial destruction of Aleppo's storied covered souk, a heritage site since its days as a Silk Road trading post.

Who is arming the Syrian conflict?

"It's a country with state control over the Internet," Madory says. "There's no free market."

Fadi Salem, a Syrian scholar and activist, believes it's in al-Assad's best interest to keep the networks running. "They're interested in measuring and assessing what's happening and trying to listen in, and even penetrate, and spy on activists and collect information," he says.

"It's the only reason why they haven't taken it down."

"Much of the opposition rely on satellite phones more than anything else," Salem adds. During Aleppo's 10-day blackout, "activists there were still able to upload videos and the like."

It's hard to predict twists and turns in Aleppo, where there is general lawlessness.
