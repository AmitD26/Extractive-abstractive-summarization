The Obama administration and the Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday they intend to phase out the rubber boots on gas pump handles now used to capture harmful gasoline vapors while refueling cars.

According to the EPA, 31,000 affected gas stations in mostly urban areas where smog is a problem will each save $3,000 apiece once the ruling is fully implemented.

Since 1994, gas stations that did not meet air quality standards have been required to use gas vapor recovery systems.

When drivers refuel, gas vapors can escape and contribute to smog and harmful air pollution. To combat the release of these vapors, most gas stations have installed special gas pump nozzles that include the rubber boot to block vapors from escaping.

The EPA says the rubber fittings will be phased out as part of the new rule.

The White House decision is the latest government-wide review of federal regulations. The White House said in a statement it hopes Thursday's move will save consumers and businesses almost $6 billion in the next five years.

But for drivers, the decision will mean less hassle trying to get the rubber boot to fit over their gas tank opening. Motorcyclists and some recreational vehicle drivers have long complained that the environment-friendly gas nozzles were incompatible with their vehicles.
