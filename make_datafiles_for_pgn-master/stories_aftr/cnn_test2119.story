(CNN) -- As a father of three, I felt Tricia Lammers' pain as she spoke about her son Blaec.

He is 22 years old and six feet tall, with a goatee. But like most mothers, she still sees her son as a little boy. When I visited her at her home in Bolivar, Missouri, she was delighted to show off her scrapbooks filled with pictures from his childhood.

She told me Blaec loved anything where he could use his hands. He played football, baseball and basketball and did karate. In ninth grade, she told me with pride, he aced his classes one term, and made the dean's list.

Every day when his father came home from work, Blaec was there, ready. The pair used to ride dirt bikes together. When the family had to sell the bikes to save some money, it crushed Blaec. He told me he would have done anything to spend a little more time with his father.

Blaec spent that Christmas in prison instead.

His parents told police Blaec had purchased two assault rifles at Walmart. They warned authorities he had been hospitalized several times while struggling with mental illness. Tricia Lammers believes that was her son's only crime.

He didn't shoot anyone or hurt anyone in any way.

Tricia and her husband, Bill, laid their lives bare in an unforgettable interview that left me stunned. They let me talk to Blaec's doctors to get a better understanding of Blaec's mindset and diagnoses. They also gave me permission to visit Blaec in the Jefferson City Correctional Center in Jefferson City, Missouri, the maximum security prison he now calls home, so I could ask all my questions and draw my own conclusions.

Sharing experiences with mental illness can help

The couple looked into private camps, but the nearly $100,000 price tag was not within their reach.

As we reported this story and talked to experts in psychiatry, criminal justice and law enforcement, the same questions came up again and again: Should people like Blaec Lammers be prisoners or patients? And how do you reasonably distinguish between the two?

When Tricia pleaded with the judge in January, he told her 70% of the people that stood in front of him suffered from mental illness. A review from the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows that startling statistic to be a national trend, particularly among younger inmates. In the United States, 70% of local jail inmates 24 and under have been diagnosed with mental health problems.

When police brought Blaec in for questioning about his gun purchase, the nation was in the aftermath of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting. Everyone was on high alert, anxious to prevent another awful tragedy.

It was a sharp contrast to what his family and his doctors described to me.

Blaec's psychiatrist Dr. H.J. Bains pointed out that unlike a patient with diabetes, Blaec will not get treatment for his illness in prison and will likely leave worse off than when he went in.

Near the end of my interview with Tricia Lammers, I realized there was another reason for her pain. She had been the one to alert the authorities about Blaec buying the guns. She found a receipt in his pocket and became worried.

She told me Blaec had asked her just days before if she felt he was a failure in life. She says it wasn't a mass homicide that concerned her but a lonely suicide.

We all worry about our kids, and we strive for their happiness, first and foremost. The Lammers family is no different, and in this case Bill and Tricia believe they failed their son.

His father wonders out loud if he should have spent more time with his boy and less time traveling. He wonders if there were signs he should have seen. He second-guesses his decision not to mortgage his home to pay for a special camp so many summers ago. He wonders if he should have kept those dirt bikes.

When I reminded him Blaec bought the guns as a present, with the hope he could one day spend more time with his father, Bill was at a loss for words.
