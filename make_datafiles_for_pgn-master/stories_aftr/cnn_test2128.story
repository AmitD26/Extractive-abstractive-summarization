(CNN) -- When a teenage gunman opened fire at students in a high school cafeteria in Washington state, a relative said, he was not shooting at random targets.

Jaylen Fryberg, who witnesses said gunned down students at Marysville-Pilchuck High School, is the cousin of two of the wounded.

His 14-year-old grandson, Nate Hatch, is among four wounded in the rampage Friday that left Fryberg and a female student dead.

"I'll say, 'I feel for you and I'll pray for you,'" he said.

The shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Marysville police spokesman Robb Lamoureux said.

The girls were identified as Shaylee Chuckulnaskit and Gia Soriano, both 14, according to Providence Regional Medical Center Everett's chief medical officer Dr. Joanne Roberts. They were in critical condition with head injuries.

At a news conference Saturday, Roberts read a brief statement from Soriano's family: "Our family is in shock. We appreciate your thoughts and prayers during this tragedy. Our hearts go out to the other victims and their families."

Roberts said dead tissue was being removed from the girls' head wounds and surgery was conducted to allow their brains to swell and contract.

"The next three days are going to be crucial," she said.

Of the victims' families, Roberts said: "They are having all of the reactions that you or I would have if we were in their circumstances. Much of the day yesterday was spent trying to make identification. That was terribly stressful for them. We've seen tears. We've seen anger. They are just grieving."

Lunchroom in shock

He saw Fryberg go up to a table of students, "came up from behind ... and fired about six bullets into the backs of them," Luton told CNN. "They were his friends, so it wasn't just random."

"When I saw him, I was like, 'Oh my God, that's Jaylen.' I would have never expected it would have been him, out of all people," she said.

Someone called 911, and by 10:40 a.m., police swarmed the building, guns readied.

They went room to room, placing tape over doors to mark the ones they'd secured.

"I've got 30 students at the gym ready to go to the northwest," police could be heard saying over radio. "We're going there to evacuate more students."

The Snohomish County sheriff's office said Saturday that investigators interviewed more than 100 students and confirmed that "a cafeteria worker attempted to stop the shooter."

It was bought at Cabela's in Tulalip, Washington, a federal source said.

Grief, disbelief

Alex Pietsch, a sophomore, told CNN on Saturday that the shooting keeps replaying in his mind.

By all accounts, Fryberg was a popular student. Just a week ago, he had been named the high school's freshman homecoming prince, according to a YouTube video of the ceremony and accounts provided by students to CNN.

"It's weird to think about, because you see him and he is such a happy person," Pietsch said. "You never really see him be so angry and so upset. ... People were telling me who it was when I was getting in my mom's car and I was like, 'What? This is not happening. ... This is crazy.' It was just surprising to me that him out of all people would be the one."

Multiple social media accounts in Fryberg's name depict him frequently hunting and using rifles. Those accounts say he was a Native American and a member of the Tulalip Tribe.

But a Twitter account in his name gave a very different picture, that of a teenager with a broken heart.

Luton could not confirm reports that Fryberg had been bullied. But two weeks ago, according to Luton, Fryberg got into a fight after somebody said "something racist" to him.
