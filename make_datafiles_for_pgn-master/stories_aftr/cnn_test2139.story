(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, on Saturday that "Russia should not intervene in Ukraine under the guise of humanitarian convoys or any other pretext of 'peacekeeping,'" according to a senior State Department official.

Kerry urged "all parties to work through international organizations" to provide humanitarian assistance in eastern Ukraine, the official said.

In a separate call Saturday, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko agreed that any Russian action in Ukraine, even for purported "humanitarian" purposes, without the formal, express consent and authorization of the Ukraine government would be "unacceptable and a violation of international law," according to the White House.

Despite claims by Ukrainian officials, the pro-Russian separtists hold firm that Ukrainian forces "have never been able to take over the Donetsk districts" -- the hotbed of violence in eastern Ukraine.

The self-proclaimed leader of the Donetsk people's republic said on Saturday that pro-Russian separatists would consider a humanitarian cease-fire to bring aid to civilians but they are not ready to surrender their territory and would "fight to the death."
