Sydney (CNN) -- Impossible to explain, harder to believe.

Enough headlines have already told us that Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes died as a result of a freakish accident. Hit on the head by a ball delivered at about 140 kilometers an hour.

In this age of the relentless news cycle, story angles have been sharpened and pointed. Questions need to be asked. One in particular: Could the accident have been avoided?

The simple answer is "Yes," but then comes the "If only."

Not just one, but a crowd of them. If only Phillip's head had been at a different angle. If only his helmet had provided greater protection. If only bouncers were banned. If only... the words are never more tormenting than at times of tragedy

But we do.

Unscripted theater

Why do we want to watch?

Well, he or she may not always enjoy every moment of it, but the opportunity to negotiate the fragile line between invincibility and fallibility is one of the most enticing challenges of any risk-associated sport.

When cricket administrators sit down and analyze frame by excruciating frame of Phillip's last stand, they will see a picture that is much more complex than a split second of disaster.

Nowhere has this become more apparent than in the United States where the NFL has discovered that playing fields stretch well beyond the turf to the courtroom.

At the core of the issue are accusations that officials concealed the danger of concussions while encouraging players to get back on their feet and charge into the fray again.

It's what the fans wanted. It also made for good promo reels. And that of course helped the bucks roll in. Other high impact football codes across the world are taking notice. The days of smelling salts are over.

Athletes are commodities

Needles, Lance Armstrong, and the Tour de France immediately come to mind.

And so does English soccer where justice is being sought for Jeff Astle. Twelve years ago an inquest ruled that he had died from brain trauma caused by heading heavy leather balls in the 1950s through to the 70s. Across many sports, there remain many lessons to learn.

Sport is always evolving. These days, it is a multi-billion dollar industry.

Now, he will never get that chance.

It's up to all of us to decide what that really means.
