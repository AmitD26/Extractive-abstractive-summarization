(CNN) -- "Sitting in class, second grade, teachers would put me outside the hallway because I had been ticking so loud I was a 'distraction,'" recalled 25-year-old Amber Comfort. "Teachers would walk by me back and forth and say 'you'd better stop that before you get into my class next year.' Things that were just completely obscene, that you would never expect the world to be, and I had to deal with on a daily basis."

For almost 20 years, the condition has shaped every moment of her life. "I don't remember any parts of ever being tic free," she said. "There's not a day that's gone by that I don't remember moving or making noise when I couldn't help it."

Deep brain stimulation

The delivery of electricity is at the root of what makes DBS work. The electrodes are attached to an impulse generator, or pacemaker, implanted under the patient's skin, which provides electrical impulses to the affected region of the brain.

DBS was first approved for tremors in 1997 and since then more than 100,000 patients have had the procedure. But Comfort's surgery would be the first time the technique had been used for Tourette's.

This urge to tic is a daily woe for people like Comfort. "It's like having 15 mosquito bites that you can't itch," she said. "There's no way to ever tell they are coming."

Until now, treatments available for Tourette's have been behavioral therapy and drug medications. These treatments, however, only manage the severity of tics to make them less disruptive and do not prevent them. "Without my medications, I am one of the worst cases the doctors have ever seen in the United States," said Comfort.

Experimental surgery

In September 2014, Comfort had the DBS electrodes implanted in her brain -- a 12-hour process that involved six operations. In addition to the standard electrode leads, she had a new grid-like device implanted on top of her brain -- an experimental procedure intended to gather information from her brain that could not only lessen her tics, but maybe someday stop them.

Not only did Comfort have four holes drilled into her skull, but she was awake throughout the process. "The way sedatives work is by suppressing brain activity, so we get better recordings if we don't use any sedatives," explained Dr. Kelly Foote, also co-director of the Center for Movement Disorders, who performed the surgery.

The team uses music to help relax the patient while the painless, but stressful, procedure is carried out. "We let them pick the music to take the focus off the fact that I am drilling a hole in their head, and cutting their scalp and that sort of thing," said Foote.

Comfort's surgery was a success, but implanting the stimulation and recording devices is just the start of the DBS process. Okun and Foote will now monitor Comfort's brain activity over the next six to 12 months. The grid will provide insight into the underlying cause of her Tourette's syndrome and allow the doctors to regulate the electrical impulses so that they can begin to manage and maybe someday, eliminate her tics.

For Comfort, this is her chance to finally live a normal life.
