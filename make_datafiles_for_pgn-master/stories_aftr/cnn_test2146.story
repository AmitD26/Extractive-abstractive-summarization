"King of Pop" Michael Jackson, seen in 2005, made the "Thriller" video with John Landis more than 25 years ago.

Jackson "wrongfully refused to pay or account for such profits," the suit, filed against the singer and Optimum Productions, says. The suit characterizes Optimum as "a defunct corporation" Jackson has used as an alter ego.

The suit accuses Jackson of "concealing the extent of net profits" by not giving an annual accounting for at least the past four years, and maintains that Jackson is "guilty of fraudulent, malicious and oppressive conduct."

Jackson's lawyers have not responded to the suit, which was filed on January 21.

The Nederlander Organization, a Broadway production company, announced Tuesday that it had signed a contract with Jackson to produce "Thriller" on stage. The show, which Jackson is to be involved with, also is to include music from other Jackson albums, the company said.

The court has set May 11 as the date for lawyers to hold a conference with a judge concerning the lawsuit.
