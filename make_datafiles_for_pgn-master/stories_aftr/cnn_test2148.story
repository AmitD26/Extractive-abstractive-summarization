(CNN) -- Get to know the name Craig Wayne Boyd -- he's officially music's newest "Voice."

On Tuesday night, Boyd was named the winner of the seventh season of NBC's "The Voice," beating out three other finalists who were coached by Adam Levine.

Team Levine's Damien came in fourth place; Chris Jamison came in third; and singer-songwriter Matt McAndrew was the runner-up.

All four of Tuesday's finalists were popular with fans, as evidenced by how quickly their original songs charted on iTunes. During Monday's episode, Damien, Jamison, McAndrew and Boyd all revealed new singles, and all four are now in the top 10 on iTunes.

That includes Boyd's "My Baby's Got A Smile On Her," which he performed again after his big win on Tuesday.

His present isn't looking too bad, either. After performing "Sweet Home Alabama" with Lynyrd Skynyrd during Tuesday's finale, the legendary band sent Boyd a congratulatory note.
