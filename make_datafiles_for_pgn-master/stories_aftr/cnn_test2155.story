1. siege

2. the Santa Maria

2. In what region of Texas did wildfires start burning this past weekend? As of last night, what was the status of these fires? How much damage has been caused by them? According to the video: How common are wildfires in the U.S.? What percentage of wildfires are caused by people?

4. What kind of "gut feeling" did former Sgt. Kyle White have as he and his fellow soldiers met with village elders in northeast Afghanistan? What happened at the meeting? What happened when the soldiers left the meeting? What heroic actions earned White the Medal of Honor? Who does White say are the heroes of this battle? Why?

5. Where is Arlington National Cemetery? For how long has it been used as a military burial ground? Who was the first soldier buried there? Whose graves will you find there? What are the plans for the cemetery's future?

Discussion Questions:

1. In the video we hear that wildfires are relatively common in the U.S., and that most of them are caused by people. Given the dangers and destruction of these fires, what are some suggestions you could offer for preventing them? What would you include in a televised or online message about wildfire prevention?

2. What types of evidence do you think that historians would need to confirm that the wreckage found by Barry Clifford is the Santa Maria? How might today's technology help to determine the age and origin of the ship's materials? How might technology be used to determine if the ship was one of the fleet commanded by Christopher Columbus?
