(CNN)An English soccer club has abandoned an attempt to sign a convicted rapist after death threats were made to its staff amid an atmosphere of "unbearable pressure."

Evans -- who insists he is innocent and is appealing against his conviction -- released his own statement Thursday, apologizing "for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned."

And after Oldham's snub there are serious question marks as to whether any club will offer him a route back into the game.

"The whole issue has divided opinion and the club has been put under unbearable pressure as a result," read a statement on Oldham's official website.

"Proceeding could have placed significant financial pressure on the club and continued to be a divisive influence. As a consequence the deal could not go ahead.

"We deplore and condemn the vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff whilst this process has been in the public domain."

Upon his release from prison, the club's plan to allow Evans to train with them provoked a public backlash, with 160,000 people signing a petition against the move.

A proposed deal with Hartlepool was also dropped following a similar outcry, the town's Labour MP calling Evans a "pariah."

Prior to confirmation the deal was off Evans released his own statement through the Professional Footballers Association, in which he apologized for the effect the case has had on his victim's life.

"Upon legal advice I was told not to discuss the events in question," he said. "This silence has been misinterpreted as arrogance and I would like to state that this could not be further from the truth.

"Finally it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so."

"The whole episode has divided the town and public opinion and there are no winners in all this -- not least of all the reputation of our club and town," Jim McMahon said.

"In recent days we've seen an horrendous 'trial by social media' with intimidation, abuse and harassment on a scale that has cast a terrible shadow.

"I am urging people on all sides of this debate to please now take stock, show some restraint and calm."

"As it stands Mr Evans has been found guilty in a court of law and has not yet completed his sentence. However, I take no pleasure in this outcome."

The case has reached the highest level of British politics, with Prime Minister David Cameron repeatedly asked to comment on Evans' potential return to football.

He said he "understood" the view of Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill after she told Sheffield United she wanted her name removed from one of the stands at its stadium should Evans play for it again.

"But as they do that, they have to recognize that football players are role models for young people and they have to think about what will the impact be on the club, what will the impact be on young people.

"As for people who are in this position, surely the position is to recognize when you have done something wrong and you have been punished, rightly punished, you've got to work your way back.
