It's been more than a week since that violent night of shootouts in Iguala, Mexico. Authorities say three students were among six people killed in the September 26 violence, and 43 students remain missing.

Where are they? Authorities and witnesses fear they may be close to unraveling the mystery.

Along a dirt road in a remote part of Mexico's Guerrero state, authorities turned up unmarked graves full of human remains on Saturday.

A tip from suspects detained after the shootouts led them to the grave sites, authorities said.

"Help us find them!" the website says, offering a reward of 1 million pesos ($74,000) for information leading to the missing students.

State officials, who've faced sharp criticism over the students' disappearance, released a statement Sunday detailing their investigative efforts. So far more than 30 people have been detained, including 22 local police officers.

"NOW IT IS MORE DANGEROUS TO BE A STUDENT THAN A CRIMINAL," one post on a Facebook page dedicated to the school said.

Witnesses have accused police of orchestrating and participating in the shootings.

Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre has defended his government's response and called for calm in the face of protests.

"To the family and friends of those who were savagely massacred, I offer all my solidarity and support," he said in a series of Twitter post Saturday. "It would be highly condemnable, those who want to take advantage or politically profit from a situation like the one that today overwhelms and saddens us."

A bus carrying members of the third division Chilpancingo Hornets soccer club was also among those ambushed in what authorities described as three attacks on September 26. A 15-year-old player on the team was killed.

Omar Sanchez, one of his teammates, described the ambush to CNN en Espa√±ol.

The case has left many troubling questions unanswered. Key among them: Who gave the orders to open fire, and what was their motive?

State prosecutors first said last week that the violence started after the college students commandeered three buses, and city police opened fire.

In 2013: 54 bodies found in mass graves in Mexico

Figures released by Mexico's National Statistics and Geography Institute last year painted a grim picture of kidnapping throughout the country.

A survey revealed that there were more than 105,000 kidnappings nationwide in 2012, the institute said, but only about 1,300 of them were reported to authorities.
