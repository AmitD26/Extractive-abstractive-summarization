(HLNtv.com) -- An Ohio man who confessed in a viral video that he killed a man while driving drunk kept his word Wednesday, pleading guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide and driving under the influence.

Fais asked Cordle, who wore handcuffs and a khaki jail uniform at the hearing, multiple times about his decision-making on June 22, the date of the accident. Cordle told the judge he did not remember the events of that night because he "blacked out" from drinking too much.

Cordle also told Fais that he has not drunk alcohol since the night of the accident, and he attended a two-week alcohol rehabilitation program.

Several days after the video appeared, Cordle surrendered to authorities and was charged for his involvement in the wrong-way crash.

Fais said in court Monday that he had not seen the video of Cordle's confession.

Cordle will be sentenced October 10. Ron O'Brien, the attorney who is prosecuting the case, told CNN that Cordle faces a maximum sentence of 8Â½ years in prison for his charges.
