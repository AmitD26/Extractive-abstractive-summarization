More than a week after a raid on an al Qaeda stronghold in Yemen to free hostages, an American captive, who was not rescued, appears in a video, begging into the camera for his life.

Somers also gives a short statement asking for help and identifying himself.

"My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life," he says.

Militants drove them to a cave over 65 miles away from the town of Hajir al-Saiyer.

They also freed eight chained up hostages, who told them that militants had moved five more hostages, including Somers, to another location.

The Yemeni account did not mention the U.S. Special Forces, but a U.S. official confirmed their participation. CNN, at the request of the government, delayed reporting the information about the raid, so as not to endanger the search for Somers and the other hostages at that time.
