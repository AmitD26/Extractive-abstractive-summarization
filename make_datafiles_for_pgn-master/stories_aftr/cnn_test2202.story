Seven decades after being sent to Nazi concentration camps, survivors of the Holocaust will have the chance to get retribution -- from the government of France.

France signed an agreement Monday with U.S. authorities to pay $60 million to Holocaust survivors transported to concentration camps, said Arnaud Guillois, a spokesman for the French Embassy in Washington.

Patrizianna Sparacino-Thiellay, France's ambassador at large for human rights in charge of Holocaust issues, said Monday the agreement "is a further contribution to recognizing France's commitment to facing up to its historic responsibilities.

"The reparation programs set up immediately after the war, and those introduced in the past fifteen years, are the tangible symbol of the official acknowledgment in 1995 of France's 'imprescriptible debt' towards the victims of the Holocaust," Sparacino-Thiellay said.

"In this year marked by the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy and Provence, this agreement further strengthens the historic friendship and ties between our two countries," the statement said.

A few thousand people may be eligible for some of the fund, according to Guillois.

One piece of proposed legislation, the Holocaust Rail Justice Act, stated that more than 75,000 Jews and thousands of others were moved from France to Nazi concentration camps on SNCF trains. Those transported included U.S. citizens and their relatives, as well as American military pilots shot down during the war.

This isn't the first time that France, which was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940 before reaching an armistice agreement with Adolf Hitler's government later that year, has borne some responsibility for the Holocaust.
