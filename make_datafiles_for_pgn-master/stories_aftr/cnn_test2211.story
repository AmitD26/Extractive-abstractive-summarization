Heavy rain continued to lash the northern Philippines on Wednesday, a day after flooding put more than half of the Manila region under water.

The relentless monsoon rains, intensified by a tropical storm at sea, have so far led to eight deaths.

The muddy flood waters have swamped roads and buildings, bringing life in many areas to a standstill.

La Mesa Reservoir, in a densely populated area of the Manila region, is overflowing, the national disaster agency reported, prompting the evacuation of thousands of residents from surrounding neighborhoods.

Widespread disruption

Brought about by days of fierce rain, floods have disrupted air and land transportation, and caused the closure of schools, businesses and nonemergency government offices.

At one point Tuesday, as much as 60% of the Manila metropolitan region was flooded, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report. The region, known as Metro Manila, has about 12 million residents.

The waters later subsided, leaving about 20% of Metro Manila under water, the U.N. office said.

'It was raining nonstop'

Lorie Pascua, said she and her family had been trapped since Monday in their house in Cavite, one of the hardest hit provinces near Manila.

"The water in our village surrounding our house was over six feet high for three days." she said. "It was raining nonstop."

"It floods here all the time but this is the worst so far," Pascua said.

Lighter rain

Trami, the tropical storm that exacerbated the monsoon rains over Luzon in recent days, has moved farther away from the Philippines in the past 24 hours. The storm is forecast to brush past northern Taiwan on Wednesday and make landfall in the Chinese province of Fujian on Thursday.

An annual disaster

The national disaster agency reported that eight people have died as a result of the rain and floods in Luzon, mostly by drowning. Four more people are missing and 41 have been injured, it said.

The pouring rain and rising water are grimly familiar to Manila residents as August is generally the area's wettest month.
