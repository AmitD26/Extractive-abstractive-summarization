When Arsalan Kazemi was picked 54th overall in the 2013 NBA Draft, he knew his elevation to the sport's elite competition was about more than progressing his own career.

"It won't be easy. But it's been like that for me since the day I moved here."

His journey began at the 2007 West Asian Games tournament when Kazemi's ferocious rebounding and defensive skills against Syria gained the attention of Texas-based sports broadcaster Anthony Ibrahim.

"His team lost the ball half-court," Ibrahim said. "Arsalan chased the ball opposite floor and out of nowhere you see him come from the left side all the way to the basket to block the shot."

While most scouts saw no reason to take the risk of traveling to the Middle East, Ibrahim often visited the region to bring young, talented athletes back to the States.

Ibrahim used their athletic ability to help secure scholarships at schools across the nation.

"My goal was always to get these kids education through basketball," he said. "But when we saw AK's level of talent...I said wait a minute, he's got a chance to go pro."

Ibrahim took video of Kazemi to a friend, the general manager of the Lebanese national team; they both decided he "needs to play at a higher level."

He pitched the opportunity to Kazemi's parents, but given the political tensions between the United States and Iran, they worried about how their son would be received.

His faith in Ibrahim along with the opportunity to study and play basketball persuaded Kazemi to agree.

Securing a student visa was the next challenge. The U.S. hasn't had an embassy in Iran since the hostage crisis more than 30 years ago.

It took six months before Kazemi landed in the U.S. in February 2008. At the time, he didn't speak English and he was held at the airport for seven hours of questioning by immigration officers.

"They kept asking me 'What are you doing here? Are you a terrorist?' And if I was here to harm the country."

Kazemi enrolled at The Patterson prep school in North Carolina, easing his homesickness by talking to his mother every day.

"It was really hard on me, I knew just enough English to get by in school," he said. "I was so homesick I carried my laptop everywhere to talk with my mom. I was nicknamed the 'laptop guy.'

"It was so bad, he would be on Skype in the car, in the mall, in the gym," Ibrahim added. "At one point we said 'OK that's enough put the laptop down tell Mom nice talkin' to ya. You're going to be OK'."

He was missing home, but Kazemi was taking the basketball court by storm and college coaches were noticing.

Upon graduating from Patterson, Kazemi was heavily recruited by college teams and offered scholarships across the nation. He chose the academically prestigious Rice University in Houston, which has a large Iranian community and is where Ibrahim lived.

During his three years there, he led his Conference in rebounding and ranked among the top three rebounders nationwide.

He says he also came face to face with the type of situation that had concerned him before he left Iran.

After his junior year, he asked for and received a National Collegiate Athletic Association hardship waiver to transfer to Oregon where he competed in his senior year.

The athletic director, Rick Greenspan, who has since left Rice himself, denied any allegations of discriminatory treatment during Kazemi's time at Rice.

With the Ducks, Kazemi got lots of playtime and instantly became a fan favorite.

Fans were intrigued by his superstar ability on the court, but also his facial hair. At games, students would wear fake handlebar mustaches to support their favorite player.

The Ducks had a deep run in the tournament, but lost the Sweet Sixteen game to the No. 1 overall seed and eventual champion Louisville

In that game, Kazemi dropped a double-double, scoring 11 points and grabbing a dozen rebounds -- a performance that put him on the radar of NBA scouts.

"He looked at me and said 'we really did it,'" Ibrahim said. "I said no you did it, AK. He got on the court and worked hard for six years. Youngsters in that region are looking up to that boy, he's a great role model."
