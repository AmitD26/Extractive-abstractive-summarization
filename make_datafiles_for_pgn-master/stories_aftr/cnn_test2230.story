Balotelli quickly deleted the Instagram image, before tweeting: "My Mom is jewish so all of u shut up please," a reference to his foster mother, Silvia.

He apologized Tuesday on Twitter explaining the post "was meant to be anti-racist with humor."

He added: "I now understand that out of context may have the opposite effect. Not all Mexicans have mustaches, not all black people jump high and not all Jewish people love money.

Liverpool said they plan to speak to Balotelli, who has missed the club's last three games due to a groin injury he picked up on international duty in November.

"We are aware of the posting which has since been promptly deleted by the player," said Liverpool in a statement.

"We abhor all forms of racism, wherever it is found," Johnson, who is the current chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, told the Daily Telegraph.

Playing iIn Italy, Balotelli frequently faced racist abuse in stadiums, while in September Merseyside police investigated racist remarks on Twitter made to Balotelli after he posted a message during Manchester United's 5-3 defeat against Leicester City.

The minimum ban for race-related rule breaches is five games under the FA's social media guidelines.
