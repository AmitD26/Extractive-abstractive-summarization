While the results may be an indicator of what Puerto Ricans want, statehood will not be possible without congressional action in Washington, something that is not guaranteed.

An economic downturn and shrinking population were the factors that contributed to the support for statehood, where referendums in 1967, 1993 and 1998 failed, Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock said.

"I think people just came to realize that the current relationship simply does not create the number of jobs that we need," he said.

But some analysts say the views on statehood have not changed, despite Tuesday's results.

"This isn't to say that support for statehood hasn't increased; it has," Benitez said. "But the only thing we can decipher with certainty from the vote is that the people of Puerto Rico want a change to the current status.

"It isn't clear what change we want, but we want change," he said.

The results of the referendum met with other criticisms, too.

There were voters who prefer the current status but didn't agree with the way it was defined on the ballot, thereby inflating the number of votes against the status quo, said Luis Agrait, a history professor at the University of Puerto Rico.

The referendum is nonbinding, but it compels lawmakers in Washington to act, he said.

"The people are withdrawing their consent to be governed the way they are governed," McClintock said, citing the Declaration of Independence, which states that a government's power comes from the consent of those governed.

"Congress will have to address this and will have to pay attention," he said.

The roughly 4 million residents of Puerto Rico are American citizens but can't vote for president.  However, the almost 5 million Puerto Ricans living in the 50 U.S. states have full voting rights.

Last year, President Barack Obama made an official visit to Puerto Rico, the first such visit by a president in 50 years.
