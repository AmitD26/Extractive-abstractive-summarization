The blame game over "The Interview" is intensifying.

The different sides kept up their sparring over the weekend, with President Barack Obama accusing North Korea of "cybervandalism" and Pyongyang claiming that the U.S. government was behind the making of the movie.

North Korea

After the FBI's assertions that North Korea was responsible for a hack into Sony's computer systems, Kim's regime is still steadfastly denying involvement. On Saturday, it said the U.S. accusations were "an attempt to frame us for this crime" and suggested the two countries work together to investigate the hacking.

But by Sunday, it was making less conciliatory noises, offering the bizarre claim that it had "clear evidence that the U.S. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie."

President Obama

The U.S. President told CNN on Sunday that the hack was "an act of cybervandalism that was very costly, very expensive" but that he doesn't consider it an act of war.

Obama said in the interview that the United States is going review whether to put North Korea back on a list of states that sponsor terrorism.

The President had previously said at a news conference Friday that the United States will "respond proportionally" to the attack on Sony without giving specifics.

Obama has also chided Sony for its actions, saying he that thinks the studio made "a mistake" in pulling the movie and that he wished the company had called him first.

He expressed concerns to CNN's Candy Crowley on Sunday about the broader implications of pulling "The Interview."

Sony

Sony Entertainment Chief Executive Michael Lynton has defended the company's actions, denying that the studio had "caved" by scrapping the planned release of "The Interview" in theaters.

In an interview with Fareed Zakaria that aired Sunday, he blamed movie theater companies that opted not to show the film, saying they forced Sony's hand.

The hackers

On Saturday, the Guardians of Peace, the group of hackers who claim responsibility for the cyberattack on Sony, mocked the FBI in a new statement.

"The result of investigation by FBI is so excellent that you might have seen what we were doing with your own eye," said the statement posted on the file-sharing website pastebin. "We congratulate you (sic) success. FBI is the BEST in the world. You will find the gift for FBI at the following address. Enjoy!"

The FBI investigation linked the malware, infrastructure and techniques used by the Guardians of Peace in the Sony hack to previous North Korean cyberattacks.

China

North Korea's closest ally has so far been staying out of the fray.

Wang stressed that China opposes all forms of cyberattacks and cyberterrorism, the statement said, omitting any mention of North Korea.

U.S. Republicans

In Washington, Republican Sen. John McCain criticized Obama's response to the Sony hacking.

He rejected Obama's characterization of the North Korean hack as "an act of cybervandelism," instead calling it "a new form of warfare" on CNN's State of the Union.

The President does not understand that this is a manifestation of a new form of warfare when you destroy economies, when you are able to impose censorship," McCain, a Republican from Arizona, said. "It's more than vandalism. It's a new form of warfare that we're involved in and we need to react and we need to react vigorously."

In a letter to their CEOs, RNC chairman Reince Priebus wrote: "As a sign of my commitment, if you agree to show this movie, I will send a note to the Republican Party's millions of donors and supporters urging them to buy a ticket -- not to support one movie or Hollywood, but to show North Korea we cannot be bullied into giving up our freedom."
