Ibadan, Nigeria (CNN)Along the Niger Delta, an abundance of vivid purple flowers are blooming gently on the surface of the water, adding a touch of color to the inland waterways.

But that's where the beauty ends because these striking flowers are water hyacinths -- an aquatic weed wreaking havoc in local communities and ruining water supplies.

Not only does this fast-growing water pest curtail access to waterways and cause problems for local fishermen, it also depletes nutrients from the water, which in turn reduces fish populations.

But where many see an invasive aquatic nuisance, Nigerian entrepreneur Achenyo Idachaba identified a business opportunity.

Setting up shop in Ibadan, a city in the south-west region of Nigeria, she began harvesting the water hyacinth and transforming the waste product into intricately handcrafted everyday items.

"What we do is take an environmental problem and turn it into a win-win solution," Idachaba explains.

"We help them to see the invasive weed through a different lens in terms of this could actually become a source of livelihood," she says. "We go in and train them on how to harvest the material from the waterways, we tell them how they are supposed to dry it and then we teach them how to weave the water hyacinth. We also demonstrate the type of products that they could make.

"We want to see ourselves as the number one maker of eco-friendly handicrafts -- that are telling this very unique story about how we have transformed Nigeria's problem of water hyacinth into a beneficial solution."

She adds: "And to build on that (to) become one of the major non-oil sector exporters of products from Nigeria."
