"Frequency modulation," exclaims South African radio shock jock Gareth Cliff in an online video posted earlier this year.

"Which f***ing Hitler used in World War II for propaganda!" Cliff -- who is famous for his outrageousness on the airwaves and is sometimes compared to American radio personality Howard Stern -- tries hard to stifle a grin that betrays a mischievous mixture of exasperation and comedic bombast.

"Is this a medium we should be proud to use?"

Sure, there may now be digital radio and more interaction between programs and their listeners today, Cliff explains.

But much of the original formula where a presenter broadcasts to a passive listener interspersed by advertisements remains.

It was this stasis that eventually pushed Cliff to earlier this year quit his popular morning show at national station 5FM and take a leap into the unknown.

Radio Revolution

He has since founded Cliff Central, a web-only "un-radio" venture that aims to merge online broadcasting with social media and instant messaging platforms.

No longer is he constrained by regulatory guidelines -- meaning he can drop the F-bomb live on air without a rap on the knuckles -- nor does he have to pay for a broadcast license.

"Mobile is definitely where the action is," Cliff says. "We have phones with us wherever we go."

This is increasingly the case in Africa.

The rise of mobile

All shows are also available via live streaming, podcast and for online download after the event.

The major difference with Cliff Central's WeChat platform is that broadcast and discussion all happen within one app.

"We've got 120,000 WeChat official account subscribers to Cliff Central. I don't know if that's a lot or a few as I don't really have a frame of reference to compare it to," Cliff explains.

It's this engagement that Cliff explains is proving attractive to advertisers.

In the future, rather than being subjected to five or six minute advertisements for products that may or may not be relevant -- as currently happens on the radio -- he foresees companies targeting consumers more directly through the app and podcasts.

This will leave greater time for programming and should prove more fruitful for advertisers.

"I think that's a real value proposition to an audience," Cliff says. "It's also a very big commercial proposition and it ties radio in most especially in a measurable way."

Relaying the instant message

Elsewhere, Buzzfeed have added a Whatsapp sharing button on their mobile stories while WeChat has stated its intention to move into Nigeria and other African countries where smartphone usage is high by working with local media organisations.

Closer to Cliff Central in South Africa, other web-only stations have popped-up in recent years. 2Oceansvibe Radio was one of the country's first online-only outfits and paired up with WeChat a few months after Cliff Central launched.

But Botha is quick to add that it's difficult to tell how successful they have been so far because they have "been quite cagey in terms of the data they are sharing with advertisers."

Cliff even admitted earlier this year that releasing a rate card at the wrong time could "kill us."

Then there are the potential added data costs for listeners streaming content on their phones.

For Cliff, these are challenges, but they are not insurmountable. He is clear that he doesn't want to replace radio in South Africa, rather offer something different.

Advertisers "really get this. The people who really know about these things (media, digital advertising and branded content) are as excited about this as we are," he adds.
