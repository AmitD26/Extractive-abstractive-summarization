President Barack Obama hinted at the intensified effort in an exclusive interview on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday, saying, "I'm going to be doing everything I can to close it."

"It is something that continues to inspire jihadists and extremists around the world, the fact that these folks are being held," Obama said. "It is contrary to our values and it is wildly expensive. We're spending millions for each individual there. And we have drawn down the population there significantly."

Once a detainee is deemed no longer a risk, they are either transferred back to their country of origin, or a third country that is willing to take them.

Sixty-four of the 132 remaining detainees have been ruled eligible for transfer.

The official said there are ongoing talks to try to find countries to take all 64 detainees approved for transfer.

An additional 20 detainees from Yemen still are considered too dangerous to be transferred, as are several detainees accused of involvement in the 9/11 attacks, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

The administration of then-President George W. Bush claimed that, since Gitmo detainees weren't held on American soil, they could be considered "enemy combatants" and be denied some legal protections. Almost all of the 800 detainees were held without charges.
