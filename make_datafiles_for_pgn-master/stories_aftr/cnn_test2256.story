More American women have had medical help to have their babies than ever, according to the latest annual report from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology.

Their report showed that doctors at these clinics performed 165,172 procedures, including IVF, with 61,740 babies born as a result of those efforts in 2012.

This growing trend doesn't necessarily mean Americans are having more trouble having children. It may point to the fact that couples are having babies later. American women are having babies a lot later in life than they used to: In 1980, the average age of a new mom was about 22. Now, the average age of a new mom is closer to 26, according to the CDC (PDF).

Although women today are generally healthier, fertility does decline as people age.  A woman's body produces fewer viable eggs when she gets older, and men's sperm doesn't swim as well as they age.

Women can't wait too long to seek out treatment, though. That is also clear from the annual report.

The IVF success rate was significantly higher for women under the age of 35 compared with those who were older.

Looking only at the IVF treatments that used fresh embryos from non-donor eggs, the number of women under the age of 35 who gave birth using IVF was about 40%, compared with only 31% for women between the ages of 35 and 37. Only 3.9% of 42-year-olds got pregnant as a result of IVF treatment.

The number of multiple embryos being transferred in IVF treatments has also declined, according to the report.
