She may be 65 years old, but outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is not retiring. Instead, she's considering helping the foundation led by her husband and leaving the door open to a possible presidential run in 2016.

She suggested she may also add her muscle to the work carried out by the Clinton Global Initiative, which is led by former President Bill Clinton.

She noted that their daughter, Chelsea, has also been involved in philanthropic work after Tropical Storm Sandy. "We just have public service in our DNA," Clinton said.

Clinton acknowledged that her legacy includes unsolved problems in some of the world's hot spots, but noted that she assumed the job four years ago at a time of great uncertainty. "I think we have to go back to my beginning in January '09 to remember how poorly perceived the United States was, how badly damaged our reputation was, how our leadership was in question, how the economic crisis had really shaken people's confidence in our government, our economic system, our country."

Opinion: President Hillary Clinton? If she wants it

Clinton said she had sought initially simply to restore international confidence in American leadership, "sometimes against pretty tough odds," which included a crisis in the world's economy and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The challenges went on to include responding to the Arab Spring, forming international coalitions to inflict sanctions on Iran and North Korea and dealing with changes in Burma, Europe, Latin America and Africa.

"I'm very proud of what we've done," she said, adding, "We began to practice diplomacy in a different way -- not that we jettisoned everything done before, but added new tools to the box."
