Kanye West is paying a price for not ignoring a swarm of paparazzi surrounding him at an airport this past summer.

A no contest plea is treated the same as a guilty plea for purposes of the sentencing.

Rubin said he will review the community service to make sure he is getting no special treatment.

Photographer Daniel Ramos told the judge he wanted West thrown in jail.

The video recorded the following exchange:

"Now come on, Kanye, I don't want to fight with you."

"I told you, don't talk to me, right. You're trying to get me in trouble so I step off and have to pay you like $250,000."

"I simply asked him a question, and I didn't use any vulgar language," Ramos told the judge Monday. "In fact, I gave him a compliment and told him that he was cool."

Lawyer Gloria Allred has filed a civil suit against West on behalf of the photographer.

Beverly Hills Police investigated an incident in January in which West was accused of assaulting a man at a Beverly Hills chiropractor's office.  West avoided criminal charges by reaching a civil settlement with the man.
