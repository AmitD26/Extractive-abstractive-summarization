About 500 people showed up to the historic State Theatre in Falls Church, a suburb of Washington, D.C. to witness Clinton's smiling re-emergence on the political scene, showering her with applause when she made even the slightest allusion to running for office again.

But here are three important takeaways from Clinton's first big political speech since leaving the State Department earlier this year:

She was relaxed

Never a dynamic speaker on the stump in 2008, Clinton was instead relaxed, confident and authoritative on Saturday.

It's not hard to see why.

This was a supremely low-risk event for Clinton -- as perfect a re-entry into national politics as she could have asked for. Barring some kind of wacky collapse in the final three weeks of the race, McAuliffe is generally expected to defeat his Republican opponent Ken Cuccinelli, though some Democrats here expect the winning margin to be a few points smaller than the eight-point lead he holds in the polls, given the usual GOP turnout edge in an off-year.

The former secretary of state has a close personal friendship with McAuliffe, a longtime fundraiser, poker buddy, cheerleader, political fixer and all-purpose confidant for the Clintons.

The event's frame -- it was billed as a "Women For Terry" rally -- was right in Clinton's strike zone, giving her a chance to talk about politics in terms she feels most comfortable.

Add it all up, and Clinton was completely at ease on Saturday, campaigning in front a fawning audience in the Washington suburbs, talking about women's issues and propping up one of her longtime pals.

She wasn't afraid to jab Republicans, however gently

Clinton stayed mostly positive, but she didn't shy away from taking a few shots at Republicans, albeit not by name.

Clinton also made sure to highlight Republican efforts to enforce stricter abortion regulations in Virginia. McAuliffe, she said, would "stand up against attempts to restrict women's health choices."

Rounding out her speech, Clinton alluded to Alexis de Tocqueville, the French writer who described Americans as having "habits of the heart" when he traveled to the U.S. nearly 200 years ago.

Clinton on possible presidency: 'I'm realistic'

She executed the McAuliffe game plan

No one in Virginia is surprised that his campaign deployed Clinton at this late stage of the game, an effort to stir up scads of press attention and drown out the cash-strapped Cuccinelli, who is not even airing television ads in the crucial northern Virginia media market this weekend, two ad-buying sources told CNN.

Cuccinelli spent Saturday rallying the conservative base with Mike Huckabee in central Virginia.

The Democrats' goal is to lock in McAuliffe's lead and keep their boot on Cuccinelli's neck as they head into the final stretch.
