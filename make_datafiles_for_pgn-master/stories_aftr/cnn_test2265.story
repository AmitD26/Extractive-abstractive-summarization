Ayotte stepped down from the attorney general's office to run for the Senate nomination after being encouraged to run for the open seat by national Republicans. For months, polls suggested that Ayotte was the frontrunner in the seven-candidate contest, which also included businessmen Bill Binnie and Jim Bender. But recent surveys in the Granite State indicated that Lamontagne had narrowed the gap with Ayotte.

Local Tea Party groups, the conservative New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper and influential conservative Sen. Jim DeMint all backed Lamontagne. The Union Leader, the state's largest paper, has also been critical of Ayotte.

But the biggest difference with the Delaware race was that Sarah Palin endorsed the more conservative Christine O'Donnell there. In New Hampshire, the former Alaska governor backed Ayotte.

In a robo-call, Palin called Ayotte a "Granite Grizzly" and added that "she's the true conservative running for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire."

The winner of November's general election will succeed retiring Republican Sen. Judd Gregg.
