(CNN) -- She tackled one of the toughest jobs any nurse could take on -- treating a highly contagious Ebola patient. And somehow along the way, she contracted the deadly virus herself.

Now, Nina Pham tries to recover in the same Dallas hospital where she works.

Here's what we know about the 26-year-old Texan:

"I'm doing well and want to thank everyone for their kind wishes and prayers," she said, according to the hospital. "I am blessed by the support of family and friends and am blessed to be cared for by the best team of doctors and nurses in the world."

Pham was in good condition, said Wendell Watson, spokesman for Texas Health Resources.

She's Vietnamese-American

Pham grew up in a Vietnamese family in Fort Worth, Texas.

She didn't go far away for college, attending Texas Christian University in the same city. Pham graduated with a nursing degree in 2010.

Ha taught Pham in Bible class at his church.

"She comes from a family that is (of) a very strong faith," he said. So he wasn't surprised "that she (did) more than her duty called for in order to make sure the patient had a chance to survive."

How did she contract Ebola?

She loves her job

Ha, the family friend, said nursing isn't just a job for Pham -- it's a calling.

"I think that she takes it (as) more than a career. I think it's a vocation, because her family, from the time that we met, they always serve other people," he said.

What's a hospital supposed to do if an Ebola patient shows up?

She's a good teacher

Joseph said she also has faith that those taking care of her now will help their colleague recover.

"I have full confidence they'll be able to get her through this."

Among the boards she set up on her Pinterest account are two filled with funny e-cards: "Laughter is the best medicine" and "Nurse things."

She adores her dog

After Spanish authorities euthanized an Ebola patient's dog last week, many in Dallas feared Pham's dog might face the same fate.

But Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed said Bentley is safe and being cared for in quarantine.

"That dog was very important to her," said Mayor Mike Rawlings. "We want to make sure that dog is as healthy as can be at this point and being taken care of."

Officials emailed a video of Bentley to Pham on Monday night, he said, hoping that it might boost her spirits.
