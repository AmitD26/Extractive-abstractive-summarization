Partisan hyperbole has ratcheted up as the Obama administration grapples with thousands of young undocumented immigrants surging the U.S.-Mexico border and facing angry protesters on the way to overcrowded detention centers.

Obama and many Democrats say House Republicans are to blame for rejecting Senate-passed immigration reform last year without coming up with their own plan.

And in the latest development on Monday, the White House said most children involved probably won't be allowed to stay in the country.

Over roughly the past year or so, however, both the numbers and home countries shifted dramatically. Where previously Mexican children made up the bulk of them, a surge more recently from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador has been seen.

"In reality, there is no single cause. Instead, a confluence of different pull and push factors has contributed to the upsurge," the institute's analysis found. "Recent U.S. policies toward unaccompanied children, faltering economies and rising crime and gang activity in Central American countries, the desire for family reunification, and changing operations of smuggling networks have all converged."

An administration program that defers the deportation of children brought in illegally by their parents or guardians has also had unintended consequences, immigration policy and law experts say.

Although most children pouring over the border now would not qualify for "amnesty," drug smugglers have used misperceptions about the program to entice kids with the promise of "permisos," or a pass to stay in America, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a congressional committee recently.

Inaction by the House on immigration reform has also exacerbated the problem, experts say.

Such reforms would help stabilize employment prospects for immigrants who left their kids behind. As a result, those children might not feel as compelled to flee, experts say.

2. Should government have seen it coming?: Yes.

The same agencies have also realized those "children present unique operational challenges" for Border Patrol and Health and Human Services. The administration was also aware that it couldn't simply deport them.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which was signed into law and reauthorized several times during President George W. Bush's administration set guidelines on how to best handle unaccompanied immigrant children.

Should Obama use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform?

Obama has discussed Mexico's role with Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto and Vice President Joe Biden brainstormed strategies with Central American leaders in Guatemala.

He stressed sending children to smugglers who sneak them across the border is dangerous and illegal.

Immigration officials also released graphic ads over the weekend with the same message. There is also an effort against drug cartel smuggling rings, and consideration of deploying more Border Patrol agents.

White House to spend millions to curb undocumented children crossing border

Though now, the administration plans to spend roughly $100 million in aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help the immigrant children get back home and stay there.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday the "law will be enforced."

This means children who have been apprehended "will go through the immigration court process" and it's unlikely that most who do so "will qualify" to stay in the country.

4. Would an immigration bill have prevented this? Perhaps, immigration law and policy experts say.

5. Will Obama go to the border? He is in Texas for fundraisers and for an economy event this week. However, White House officials say he has no plans to visit the border now.

The White House feels that things are in hand. "The President is very aware of the situation that exists on the southwest border," Earnest said, noting that other officials have traveled there and what they've seen "is troubling."
