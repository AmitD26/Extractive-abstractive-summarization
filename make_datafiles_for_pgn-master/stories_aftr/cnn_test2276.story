First on CNN: Obama will name Ron Klain as Ebola Czar

"While the President's pick may have the ear of the White House and experience from the campaign trail, I am concerned he doesn't have significant relationships in the medical community that are imperative during this current biological emergency," House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said.

Another Texas Republican wasn't impressed, either.

"We don't need another so-called 'czar'; we need presidential leadership. This is a public health crisis, and the answer isn't another White House political operative," Sen. Ted Cruz said in a statement.

A former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden and also to then-Vice President Al Gore, Klain is currently president of Case Holdings and general counsel of Revolution, an investment group. He has clerked for the U.S. Supreme Court and headed up Gore's effort during the 2000 Florida recount.

Midterm campaigns swing through Ebola hearing

GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona suggested on CNN last Sunday that the administration needed one point person.  "... I would say we don't know exactly who's in charge. There has to be some kind of czar," McCain said.

But the White House initially resisted the idea, and pointed out that McCain said in 2009 that the Obama administration had "more czars than the Romanovs."
