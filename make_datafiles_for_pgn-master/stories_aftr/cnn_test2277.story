Nine years after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, a seismic event in Lebanese history, the trial of four men accused of his killing opened Thursday in a special United Nations-backed court.

However, the stand at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon in The Hague was empty, with the suspects -- alleged associates of the Shiite militant group Hezbollah -- still on the run.

"This is a historic day for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon as it marks the transition from complex and difficult investigations to the new phase of trial," said Marten Youssef, a spokesman for the tribunal.

The hearing is being streamed live online.  In Lebanon, television stations -- except for Hezbollah's Al Manar --  broadcast it live.

"A day for Lebanon"

Youssef said the case was the "first trial for a crime of terrorism in an international tribunal." It is being held in Leidschendam, on the outskirts of The Hague.

Hariri's son Saad, also a former prime minister, and other family members have traveled to the city.

Speaking outside the court building, Saad Hariri thanked the Special Tribunal for Lebanon "for the opportunity to find justice against the criminals who committed this heinous crime."

"Unfortunately the names of those who perpetrated these crimes are Lebanese, they follow a certain political party," he said. "They are innocent until proven guilty. This is what we want ... justice, not vengeance. We never seek vengeance and hopefully by the end of this trial we will find out the truth and we will get the justice that we called for in Lebanon."

He said the start of the trial was "a day for Lebanon; today is a day we fought for nine years."

Car bomb

Shortly before the trial began, a bomb blast ripped through the northeastern Lebanese city of Hermel, killing three people and injuring 26 others, state news agency NNA reported.

The explosion took place near city offices and a number of banks.

Hermel is in the northern Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border and is known as a Hezbollah stronghold.

Hermel has been targeted before, with missiles launched from Syria, where Hezbollah has sent fighters and military advisers.
