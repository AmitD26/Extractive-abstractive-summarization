"We were looking at how we can engage the youth in the right areas into a meaningful venture," says company founder and CEO Kwabena Danso, who last year launched Booomers as a subsidiary enterprise of a development organization called Yonso project. "[I've been] engaging them in the bamboo bicycle business."

Whilst there are bikes being crafted by other manufactures in Ghana, at the root of Booomers lies not only innovative design but a social conscience with climate change mitigation and rural poverty alleviation among their primary goals. Danso takes his rural youth teams through the entire manufacturing process -- from the harvesting of bamboo through to the final assembly of bespoke bicycles -- to ensure they're equipped with a diverse skill set. Some apprentices have had the pleasure of being trained by Calfee himself. "We managed to get him to come down to train people," says Danso.

Overcoming hurdles

But despite such limitations he is determined for his bicycles to travel the globe. "In the next five years we want to conquer the world," he concludes. His wish is for Boomers to become a resource not only for bicycles, but also furniture, household items and even houses made of bamboo. "We want to make this place the point where you come and get everything from bamboo."
