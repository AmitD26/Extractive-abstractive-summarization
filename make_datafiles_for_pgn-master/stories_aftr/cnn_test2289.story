"She has got a lot of depth in policy, but she is looking for new ideas," the source said. "She is also being very thorough about the path to the nomination and the path to the presidency. There are a lot of strategy meetings with tactics focused on that."

In the run up to what is now an all-but-certain 2016 announcement, Benenson has been tapped chief strategist for the Clinton campaign, according to reports from the Washington Post and Politico. The source said that specific title has not been solidified yet, but the Democratic pollster is playing a big role in this pre-campaign process.

"She [Clinton] likes him for more than just reading poll results," the source said, noting that he would play a larger role than campaign pollster.

John Podesta, a top White House adviser who is slated to leave the White House in early February, has also been named campaign chairman, the source said. Politico was first to report his top campaign slot.

"If she runs, as I hope she will, I will do whatever she asks me to do," Podesta said on the Charlie Rose Show in November. "Right now she hasn't made a decision to run, so I am expecting to return to what I was doing before."

Clinton's meetings at her home in New York seemingly explain her month long absence from the speaking circuit and Twitter. The former secretary of state has gone over a month without a high-profile speaking gig, a dearth in events that is noticeable considering how many event Clinton headlined last year. Clinton will headline her first event in over a month on Wednesday in Winnipeg, Canada.

Although some structural decisions have been made, the source said the Clinton camp has not solidified the overall architecture of the operation as well as heads of the communications, field and digital operations.

"There are these structural things to do and then, really I think once that is done, the thing she is going to end up spending a lot of time on is her plan and her message," the source said.

Clinton's 2016 team, though early, is already shaping up to be a departure from the team that surrounded her in her during her failed 2008 presidential run. Instead, Clinton is pulling heavily from Democrats who successfully won Obama the White House twice.

Emails to the a Clinton spokesman about the meetings and hiring went unanswered.
