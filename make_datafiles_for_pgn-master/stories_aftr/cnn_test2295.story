Sumptuous velvet, delicate sequins, intricate beading: They are dresses fit for a princess -- Princess Diana, that is -- and if you've got a big pocketbook (with a designer label, naturally), they could have been yours.

The entire collection fetched $1.2 million (800,000 British pounds), the auctioneer said.

Auctioneer Kerry Taylor told CNN before the auction that putting a price on such items was "difficult," but that their high profile added value.

"You can look at what they sold for, you can look at how simple the thing is," she explained. "If it was worn on a state occasion, or if it was for a private dinner, are there photographs of the princess wearing it, are there film reels of the princess wearing it, and is there a human story that adds to it?"

For example, as Taylor pointed out, a bottle green velvet evening dress, also by Victor Edelstein, bears what could be the traces of a young prince: "what looks like a little boy's (or little child's) handprint -- sticky fingerprints on the fabric." The dress sold for $36,281, including the buyer's premium.

The outfits were originally sold in a charity auction at Christie's in New York in June 1997, just months before Diana's death in a Paris car crash in August of that year. Kerry says that despite the passing of the years, the princess remains hugely popular.

Taylor also auctioned off the skimpy mesh dress worn by the Duchess of Cambridge -- then known as Kate Middleton -- during a fashion show at the University of St. Andrews, at which she is reputed to have attracted the attentions of her future husband, Prince William.
