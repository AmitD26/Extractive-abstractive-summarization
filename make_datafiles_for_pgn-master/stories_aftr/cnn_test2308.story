It's a powerful thing: the airline window seat.

First, let's take a look at the aisle seaters, who are passionate in their own right about airline seating. Screw the view; these folks are all business.

Aisle seaters sacrifice frequently standing up and sitting down -- and returning their "folding trays to their full upright position" -- to make way for the middle and window seaters.

For window seaters, it's not just about the view (or something to lean on). It's about the experience! These fliers often are the true romantics.

It's been a century since the first U.S. commercial airline took to the sky. In that time, the window seat has become for many the best part of flying in an industry where complaints are all too frequent and the novelty of flight has faded. It attracts certain kinds of travelers, but it also can transform them.

"It's a calmer seat," Scott says.

Stats on airline seats are hard to come by, but anecdotally, front aisle seats are "generally considered most desirable" among Travelocity customers, Scott says.

At Expedia, 21% of customers over the past year picked window seats, 20% chose the aisle, and the rest had no preference. A United Airlines satisfaction survey for Airbus A320 passengers showed slightly higher preference for windows over aisles.

"Window choosers are more likely to be younger, female, shorter and more casual than their aisle compatriots," Hunch wrote. "They're also more likely to be into nature."

Here's what's changing: Airlines are charging premium prices for some window and aisle seats. And that's forcing passengers to choose the dreaded middle seat. It also makes it more difficult for families to sit in the same row if they're not willing to pay extra.

Fliers stung by window, aisle fees

It's not all blue skies with the window seats. The American College of Chest Physicians issued new health guidelines this year warning that sitting in window seats on long-distance flights can increase some people's risk of developing life-threatening blood clots called deep vein thrombosis.

Combine that with a higher risk of wetting yourself and stepping on strangers' toes, and you can see how far passengers are willing to go for those killer views.

Guidelines dispute "economy class syndrome"

And of course, who better to ask about the best air views than airline pilots?

They tell us that -- generally -- window seaters love flying in and out of New York LaGuardia; Vancouver, British Columbia; Sydney; Hong Kong and San Francisco.

Washington's Reagan National Airport has an eye-popping approach known to pilots as "river visual," says pilot Justin Schlechter. The plane flies low over the Potomac, giving passengers on the left side amazing views of the Kennedy Center, the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall.

And then there's the constant reminder that you're in a metal tube at 30,000 feet.

"It taps into that universal thought of 'if God intended us to fly, we would have wings,' " the "Star Trek" star told Business Jet Traveler. "A lot of people getting on an airplane to this day still can't figure out why it flies."

Window psychology factored into Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner, says John Barratt, CEO of the Teague design firm. Barratt told Fortune magazine that designers wanted to "bring some romance back" to air travel by reconnecting passengers "to actually flying." Result: bigger windows.

Dreamliner windows measure 19 inches tall, 65% larger than the industry standard, according to Boeing. The cool factor on these portals is high: a gel inside the glass allows passengers to brighten or darken the outside sunlight with the touch of a button.

Finally, a word of advice from award-winning travel blogger Geraldine DeRuiter of Everywhereist.com: Don't be the "inconsiderate window seat guy."

If sunlight is burning through your window when many passengers are trying to sleep, please shut your shade.

Otherwise, DeRuiter writes, you'll be called out as "heinous and rotten and selfish."
