Richardson, 24, was last seen leaving a sheriff's station in Malibu after being detained by sheriff's deputies on a citizen's arrest complaint made by a restaurant manager in September.

The remains, which included a human skull, were found Monday by park rangers searching the area for marijuana groves, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore.

"It's incredibly treacherous terrain," Whitmore said of the remote site. "There is no road, no trail even if you know exactly where you are going."

The woman's father reacted angrily after watching the sheriff's news conference from the rear of the room.

Richardson said he was holding sheriff's deputies responsible for his daughter's death, either because of negligence or criminal intent.

After deputies determined she had no money to pay, the manager lodged a citizen's arrest complaint against Richardson. Her car was towed, and she was taken to the sheriff's station.

"Based on my daughter's mental condition that night, she wasn't able to fend for herself," Richardson said. "Mel Gibson gets driven to his car, and Charlie Sheen gets taken to his house."

Her family has said the college honors graduate and former beauty queen suffered from mental health issues.

"Is an $89 bill enough to take someone into the jail? There is more than one way to handle a problem," Baca said.

"I guarantee you the Mitrice Richardson law will say no one -- man, woman or child -- will be released in Malibu for some predator that wears a five-star badge to attack or do whatever they want." he said. Richardson said he was suggesting it might have been the work of "someone in law enforcement."

"It's clearly a set up by someone," he said.

Mitrice's mom angered by leaks

Her mother did not learn she was released until 5:30 a.m. the next day, it said. She then filed a missing persons report, which began the search for Richardson that did not end until this week.
