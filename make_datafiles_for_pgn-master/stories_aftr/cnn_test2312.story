(CNN)A deal has been reached for 200 Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces to pass through Turkey to help Syrian Kurdish fighters in the besieged town of Kobani, just over the border in Syria, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday.

The Syrian Kurdish fighters had originally declined the deployment of Peshmerga troops, but Erdogan told reporters in Riga, Latvia, that he'd learned Wednesday that an agreement for the reinforcement force had been reached.

However, an aide to the minister for Peshmerga in Iraq's Kurdish Regional Government told CNN that talks are ongoing.

Kurdish fighters have been battling alongside Free Syrian Army forces to repel ISIS forces from the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani.

This means they now surround Kobani from three sides: the east, west and south, it said.

Strong accusation

Erdogan went on to say the U.S. was pushing arms to the PYD, which he accused of affiliation with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S., Turkey, NATO and others.

"We had said that there are commanders from the PKK in the ranks of PYD fighting in Syria," Erdogan said. "We had said that any U.S. aid to this group is going to a terrorist organization."

There had been hopes that foreign airstrikes and airdropped supplies could help Kurdish fighters turn the tide against the ISIS militants. But the onslaught has continued.

ISIS has said that at least some of the airdropped supplies made it into its fighters' hands.

One of the 28 bundles dropped in and around Kobani on Monday drifted away from its target zone, a U.S. official said. The U.S. military said it went back and blasted it.

CNN cannot independently confirm whether the items in the video are from a U.S. airdrop, but according to Anadolu, Erdogan said ISIS had seized some of the weapons.

"The rest, they also were seized by another terrorist organization, the PYD. Turkey did never lean toward such military aid and the U.S. did that despite Turkey," the news agency quoted him as saying.

Fight for strategic hill

A Kurdish fighter and a media activist in Kobani also told CNN that ISIS militants are pushing toward the western outskirts of Kobani after attacking checkpoints manned by the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, and the Free Syrian Army.

The attacks forced them to withdraw from the strategic Tall Shair Hill area, they said.

But, they said, neither ISIS nor the YPG is able to control the western outskirts of Kobani as fighting for control of the hill rages.

Clashes also continue between ISIS and YPG fighters on the eastern outskirts of Kobani, leaving at least five Kurdish fighters dead.

ISIS militants were also killed in the clashes, but it was not immediately clear how many.

Rights group: Syria airstrikes killed 553

In total, 464 ISIS militants were killed, the Observatory said. The airstrikes also claimed the lives of 57 fighters from al Nusra Front, a rival Islamist group fighting in Syria.

The figures do not include any casualties in neighboring Iraq, where the coalition has also been targeting ISIS forces.
