South Korea and Japan on Friday postponed the signing of a landmark military intelligence pact after the prospect stirred discontent among Koreans.

Japan occupied Korea for 35 years during the first half of the 20th century, and anti-Japanese sentiment still lingers.

The planned pact is intended to "provide a legal framework on sharing classified military information," including the threat from nuclear-armed North Korea, Cho Byung-jae, a spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry, had said Thursday.

But as news of the proposed deal suddenly emerged this week, Koreans expressed misgivings.

The idea of a military deal between the two countries appeared to revive some of that anger.

"I don't want this treaty to take place," Choi Jong-kwan, who works for a legal firm in Seoul, said before the postponement of the pact was announced. "I am especially not happy at the fact that the signing will take place in Japan."

Tokyo and Seoul have also been arguing about who has sovereignty over a group of small islands, known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan.

Japan has long claimed the islets in the sea east of Korea as its territory, but Seoul insists all Korean territory was returned after  independence in 1945.

"The treaty was inevitable given the current trend in northeast Asia including that of China's growing influence and its ties with North Korea," said Kim Tae-woo, the head of Korean Institute for National Unification.

"South Korea is good with human intelligence, while Japan has an upper hand in technology intelligence," said Kim, who is also a former vice president of the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. "The two nations are likely to cooperate when it comes to the North Korean threat."

Some South Koreans said they thought it was time for Seoul and Tokyo to move on from the past.

"For the sake of the interest of the country, we need to put historical factors behind us," said Park Sung-kwon, who works for a construction company in Seoul. "I support the deal."
