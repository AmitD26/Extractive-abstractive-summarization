"We have read with interest about your desire to contribute your services to achieve peace and reconciliation between Colombians," FARC said in a statement on its website.

"We salute your willingness to travel to Havana at the same time that we invite you to make the trip to exhibit the development of the process of talks."

"Rest assured that there is complete willingness to respond to your concerns and to value your opinions as a valuable contribution to peace," the statement said.

FARC started as an insurgency in 1964 and continues to champion leftist causes. But with Colombia being one of the world's top cocaine producers,  the rebels have added drug trafficking to their list of atrocities.

The group is estimated to make $500 million from the illicit trade per year, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

The United States and the European Union consider FARC a terrorist organization.
