(CNN)Six suspects linked to terrorist activity referred to Syria and Iraq as "the beach," and used other coded language to avoid detection in the United States, authorities say.

The Bosnian immigrants, including a husband and a wife, were arrested this month in Illinois and St. Louis, according to court records released Friday. Three of the suspects are naturalized American citizens.

Suspects named in the indictment are Nihad Rosic,  Armin Harcevic, and married couple Ramiz and Sedina Hodzic, all from St. Louis, along with Illinois residents Mediha  Salkicevic and Jasminka Ramic.

Also named in the indictment is Abdullah Ramo Pazara, who allegedly traveled to Syria and Iraq to support terrorists.

Pazara traveled to Syria in July 2013, and allegedly started receiving money from the defendants within a month.  Shipments of military equipment soon followed, according to the indictment.

Federal prosecutors indicted the six suspects this month in St. Louis County.
