"It was a tough match. I needed to fight all the way through every set, and I served well when I needed to and played my best tennis when it was most important."

On his next opponent, Pella, Djokovic added: "I know he's one of the specialists on clay; a new player that is coming up and he made some surprising wins.

"I'm going to have to prepare myself and be on top of my game because, especially in the opening rounds, you're playing players that have nothing to lose so I'm sure that he's gonna be very motivated to play his best."

Elsewhere in the men's draw, Australian Bernard Tomic retired hurt after losing the first two sets in his clash with Romania's Victor Hanescu.

The 20-year suffered a muscle tear and at a press conference after his match said his controversial father would remain his coach.

John Tomic is facing criminal charges after allegedly headbutting his son's training partner Thomas Drouet earlier this month, though he is claiming self-defense.

Two other players were forced to retire during their matches on Tuesday.

The No. 9 seed, Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka, eased past unseeded Dutchman Thiemo Be Bakker 7-5 6-3 6-7 7-5 while Russia's Nikolay Davydenko is also through to round two after a comfortable 6-3 6-4 7-5 win over France's Florent Serra.

Djokovic was forced to wait for his first round match after home favorite Marion Bartoli edged a tense three-hour encounter with Russia's Olga Govortsova on Court Philippe Chatrier.

Bartoli took the first set on a tiebreak but surrendered the second 6-4 before securing the decider 7-5.

World No. 9 Samantha Stosur disposed of the oldest player in the competition -- Japan's 42-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm -- thanks to a 6-0 6-2 victory in just over an hour.

A total of 57 players in the women's singles draw had not been born by the time Date-Krumm first appeared at the French Open back in 1989 but despite defeat, she became the third oldest female player to participate at Roland Garros.
