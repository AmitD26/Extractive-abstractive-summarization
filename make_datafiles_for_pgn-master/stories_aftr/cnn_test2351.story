(CNN)Dynel Lane, a former nurse's aide accused of stabbing a pregnant Colorado woman, was charged Friday with criminal attempt to commit first-degree murder, unlawful termination of pregnancy, and other crimes for allegedly cutting a fetus from the womb.

The victim, Michelle Wilkins, 26, who was seven months' pregnant, survived this month's attack, which occurred when she went to a Longmont home to buy baby clothes advertised for sale on Craigslist.

"Now, I understand that many in the community -- and heaven knows I've heard from a lot of them -- would like me to file homicide charges," Garnett told reporters.

"However, that is not possible under Colorado law without proof of live birth. A prosecutor cannot file murder charges when a baby who is killed has not lived outside the body of the mother. For similar reasons, I cannot bring charges of child abuse resulting in death," the district attorney said.

The fetus' lungs never inflated, Garnett said. The fetus' exact cause of death, however, isn't immediately known and is expected to be revealed when the final autopsy report is released in six to eight weeks, he said.

Wilkins and her partner, identified only as Dan, named the female fetus Aurora, the prosecutor said.

Lane was also charged with two counts of crime of violence, two counts of first-degree assault, and two counts of second-degree assault, Garnett said.

Wilkins was released from the hospital on Thursday, relatives said.

The coroner's office performed an autopsy on the fetus and said Wilkins was 34 weeks pregnant.

"An autopsy has been completed," Hall said. "At this time neither the autopsy or the investigation have provided any evidence that the baby exhibited any signs of life outside of the womb, therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth. No evidence of trauma or injuries were found on the body.

The coroner's finding apparently contradicts earlier claims made in police reports that the fetus "gasped" and that emergency room personnel described the fetus as viable.

David Ridley, the 35-year-old husband of Dynel Lane, told police he found his wife "covered in blood" in the family home and later found "a small baby lying in the bathtub," a Longmont police report said.

"He rubbed the baby slightly then rolled it over to ... see it take a gasping breath," the report said.

Without referring to Ridley by name, Garnett cited how media accounts took note of the police report and how a "witness observed Aurora taking a gasping breath."
