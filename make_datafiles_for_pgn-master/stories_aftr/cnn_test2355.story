Hong Kong (CNN)Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are two dynamic leaders at the helm of the world's two most populous nations.

When India successfully placed a spacecraft into orbit around Mars last year, Modi reveled in the moment.

"History has been created today," he said. "We have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved the near impossible.

"The success of our space program is a shining symbol of what we are capable of as a nation."

Soon after the galactic feat, he took to the stage at New York's famous Madison Square Garden and received a welcome so rapturous that Jon Stewart called him "America's First Modi."

And all along, Modi has issued his call to "Make in India," encouraging companies all over the world to manufacture their products in India where there is a vast talent pool and low-cost production.

While Modi's India is out to put its economy on the fast track, China's economy is slowing after over 25 years of breakneck growth. President Xi is managing the slowdown with efforts to boost domestic spending, while cracking down hard on corruption.

And it's been predicted that India could outpace China as the world's fastest growing economy as soon as this year.

"China is still pulling away from India," the Beijing-based reporter said. "If India grows 7.5% this year and China grows 7.4%, I think it makes a good headline.  But I think people shouldn't get carried away about what it means in terms of a gap between China and India."

"In terms of education, having access to different resources, and job creation, China has done well. It has progressed far better compared to India," said Infosys China CEO Rangarajan R. Vellamore.

"Even though there is free movement across the country (in India), the paradox is there are a lot of basic issues related to access to water and basic education."

In a recent budget, the Modi government announced plans to boost infrastructure spending as well as cut taxes on businesses among other initiatives to spur economic growth.

But despite Modi's big pro-business push, India simply can't size up against China's raw economic might.

"It's not just about lower labor costs. You have to have a complex industry cluster of supply chains. You have to have the knowledge. You have to have the skills. You have to be connected to the international market," she said.

But that's not to say the autocracy has the advantage on all fronts, especially when it comes to winning hearts and minds in the region.

"There no question that India's rise is far less threatening than China's rise."

With the 1962 border dispute still vividly remembered by many in India, the impression of China as a threat stands in the way of further economic integration between the two countries.

So when Modi touches down in Beijing next month for his second meeting with Xi, can both leaders cast aside areas of political tension to get down to business?

Eased by the pragmatism of two ambitious leaders, the elephant and the dragon could together leap at the opportunity for a strong economic alliance.

"If these two countries come together, 40% of the world's people are going to be prosperous," said Vellamore.
