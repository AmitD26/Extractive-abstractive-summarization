The Mercedes driver blamed the quicker degradation of the Italian manufacturer's products for the scenario which has seen four race winners in as many starts this season, and much closer competition between the drivers.

"We drive like on raw eggs and I don't want to stress the tires at all. Otherwise you just overdo it and you go nowhere."

Pirelli replaced Bridgestone as F1's sole tire supplier in 2011, winning a three-year contract. Bridgestone had been the sole provider from 2007-2010, after Michelin pulled out.

However, Pirelli has argued it should be congratulated for such an open, unpredictable season. The manufacturer claimed it was simply responding to calls for more eventful racing, with director Paul Hembery saying: "We are pushing the limits.

"It's a very, very aggressive approach that we took. It's what we were asked to do. We were asked to bring challenges to the teams and this is what we've done."

"I find it a big challenge for us drivers and an interesting challenge. It's different but very interesting," he told CNN.

However, the former Ferrari star is proud to see younger compatriots such as Rosberg, Nico Hulkenberg of Force India and Marussia's Timo Glock with him on the 24-strong grid this season, and he reserved special praise for Red Bull's double world champion Vettel.

"Being good friends, particularly with Sebastian, sort of makes it even more special because he grew up on my go-kart track," Schumacher said.

"We know each other from childhood. His childhood mainly -- I was a little bit grown up by that stage. And seeing him do well makes me proud."

The Mercedes cars have been a lot more competitive this season, and Schumacher hopes they can transform their improved pace with more consistent race results.

"We have got one win under our belt. Got a bit unlucky in that race -- could have been a one-two without a doubt -- but it proves that we made a huge step because we have to consider where we come from," he said.

"Last year wasn't really what we were looking for. Starting the Silver Arrow new generation we had media success and finally we managed a victory, and I'm pretty sure we can have other good races this year being on the podium, and maybe even being on top of the podium."
