Matt Whitton has been fired from his job as a police officer because of his role in the hoax.

"It's just a big hoax, a big joke," Dyer said.

"It's Bigfoot," Dyer explained. "Bigfoot doesn't exist."

At a news conference in California last week, the two men had stood by their claims that they had discovered Bigfoot's corpse and had it on ice. Scientific analysis would prove it, they said.

Now the two Georgia men admit that the hairy, icy blob was an Internet-purchased Sasquatch costume stuffed with possum roadkill and slaughterhouse leftovers.

Whitton and Dyer say that when they came up with the hoax, they had no idea it would become a media circus.

"It got legs and ran. It's crazy now," Dyer told WSB.

Co-hoaxer Whitton agrees: "It started off as some YouTube videos and a Web site. We're all about having fun."

"He lied on national TV," Turner says of Whitton, "so a defense attorney now could say, 'How do we know you're not lying now?' "

Whitton and Dyer had announced that they had found the body of a 7-foot-7-inch, 500-pound half-ape, half-human creature while hiking in the north Georgia mountains in June. They also said they had spotted about three similar living creatures.

Two days later, after signing a receipt and counting the money, Dyer and Whitton showed the Searching for Bigfoot team the freezer containing what they claimed was the carcass: "Something appearing large, hairy and frozen in ice," Kulls wrote on the Web site.

It was, as many had suspected, an ape-like costume stuffed with entrails.

After the news conference last week, Dyer and Whitton disappeared from view. The truth came out over the weekend.

In a Web posting this week, Kulls wrote that "action is being instigated against the perpetrators."

"There have been some threats made to them for both civil and criminal prosecution," Lister said.

The attorney says the Bigfoot incident "got out of hand."
