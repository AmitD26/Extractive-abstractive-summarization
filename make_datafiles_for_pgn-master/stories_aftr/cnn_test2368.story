(CNN) -- One of Zimbabwe's top officials blamed his country's spreading cholera outbreak on what he calls "a genocidal onslaught" by Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler -- Britain.

Zimbabwean clinics have been overwhelmed by the cholera epidemic, according to aid organizations.

"Cholera is a calculated, racist attack on Zimbabwe by the unrepentant former colonial power, which has enlisted support from its American and Western allies so that they can invade the country," Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu told reporters. Britain ruled the country as a colony until 1965.

Ndlovu's claims triggered quick and pointed reaction from Britain and the United States.

In Washington, State Department spokesman Rob McInturff called Ndlovu's accusations "patently ridiculous."

Referring to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, McInturff said Friday that, "Mugabe is clearly unwilling to take any meaningful action (to stop the cholera outbreak)."

Malloch-Brown made the comment during a one-day trip to South Africa, where he visited a Johannesburg church housing 1,600 Zimbabweans who have fled their country, the newspaper said.

Cholera has ravaged Zimbabwe, causing nearly 800 deaths and infecting more than 16,000 people, the World Health Organization says.

Like the general Zimbabwean economy, the country's health delivery system is strapped, lacking modern drugs and machinery, while doctors and nurses have been striking for over a month.

On Friday, the State Department issued a travel warning for U.S. citizens because of the cholera outbreak and violence that has flared as Zimbabwe's economy has deteriorated.

"The public health system in Zimbabwe no longer provides even basic services due to a lack of staff, electricity, clean water, and medical supplies," the travel warning said. "Americans who fall ill while in Zimbabwe may find it difficult to find treatment."

"The number of cases of cholera -- statements from Robert Mugabe notwithstanding -- is going up, not down," McCormack said. "The crisis has not ended. People's lives are in danger."

Health experts say the Zimbabwean government can win the battle against cholera only if it imports adequate stocks of water-treating chemicals and disposes of refuse and sewerage properly.  Watch shocking footage of Zimbabwe's humanitarian crisis (Discretion advised) Â»

A Doctors Without Borders epidemiologist in Zimbabwe said, referring to the capital city, that "the scale and sheer numbers of infection, especially in Harare, is unprecedented." He said the group has treated more than 11,000 patients since August and has 500 international and local staff members treating people in cholera centers across the country.

Charamba said the country continues to want international assistance to combat the disease and has declared a state of emergency.

The opposition Movement for Democratic Change, which rivals Mugabe's ZANU-PF party, issued statements deploring the Mugabe government's "indifferent and casual approach" to cholera and saying it was "alarmed by Mugabe's irresponsible and false remarks" on Thursday.

"The ZANU-PF caretaker government is in a denial mode. The MDC believes that it is such careless and reckless statements that have not helped the situation," MDC said.

He also made reference to U.S. President George W. Bush and Rice: "To the outgoing warmongers, please leave in peace and not in pieces."

"They take photos (of) people dying (in) the DRC and Darfur and say these are cholera victims from Zimbabwe," he said, making reference to the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Darfur region of Sudan.
