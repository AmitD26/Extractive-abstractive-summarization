The president signaled more "give" to the idea of a six-week deal to hike the debt ceiling during a private White House meeting with House Democrats, said the lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The revelation comes amid a stalemate that has Republicans trying to use spending and debt limit deadlines as leverage to wring concessions from Obama and Democrats.

CNN has been reporting that senior House GOP sources are signaling openness to the idea of a short-term increase in the debt ceiling, as long as Democrats agree to negotiations on how to reduce the debt and deficit during the time the debt ceiling is increased.

The lawmaker left the White House meeting with a "small measure of hope that this becomes an exit strategy."

The president warned if Republicans want to propose a short-term fix and Democrats say no, then the firm ground Democrats think they're standing on now would soften.

Boehner and Republicans are demanding that Obama and Senate Democrats negotiate on deficit reduction steps that would be part of legislation to reopen the government and raise the limit on federal borrowing needed to pay the bills.

Obama has refused to enter formal talks until the shutdown ends and the debt ceiling has been raised to remove the threat of default.

A senior House Republican told CNN that GOP members may be willing to go for a short-term debt ceiling hike -- lasting four to six weeks -- as long as the president agrees that negotiations will occur during that time.

However, no specifics were immediately available about how such legislation would take shape or how the talks would occur.

So what would Democrats be willing to talk about? The lawmaker said House Democrats are open to hearing what Republicans have in mind with a short-term deal.

GOP seeks leverage

Days of back-and-forth rhetoric and jibes between the leaders have brought no direct negotiations, but plenty of accusations and political spin.

Boehner, who earlier this year told his GOP colleagues that he was finished negotiating one on one with the president, has called for Obama to sit down for what he calls a "conversation" on how to reopen the government and prevent what would be the first-ever U.S. default as soon as next week.

"It is our hope that this will be a constructive meeting and that the president finally recognizes Americans expect their leaders to be able to sit down and resolve their differences," said a statement by a Boehner aide.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama was disappointed that Boehner was limiting attendance at Thursday's meeting to fewer than 20 of the more than 200 House Republicans.

"The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country" about the potential harmful impacts from the shutdown and a possible default, Carney said in a statement, repeating that Obama "will not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job."

Ryan's plan drops Obamacare

Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman who was the party's vice presidential nominee last year, argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Democrats and Republicans should focus on "modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code."

"Right now, we need to find common ground," Ryan wrote in the column posted online Tuesday night. "We need to open the federal government. We need to pay our bills today -- and make sure we can pay our bills tomorrow. So let's negotiate an agreement to make modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code."

However, Ryan's column never mentioned Obamacare, focusing instead on forced spending cuts to domestic and military programs, as well as reforms to Medicare.

Ryan's Obamacare omission appeared to anger conservatives, who took to Twitter in response.

"Much like White House press, Paul Ryan doesn't mention Obamacare in WSJ oped," tweeted Dan Holler, spokesman for the conservative group Heritage Action.

Boehner insists that the government must reduce deficits, declaring that Republicans won't raise the debt ceiling without steps toward that goal.

Boehner demands cuts for debt limit increase

The source acknowledged Boehner may lack support from some or most of his GOP caucus, requiring Democratic votes for the proposal to pass.

Democrats planning

The GOP-led House passed a measure on Tuesday to set up a special negotiating team comprising members of both parties from the House and Senate, but Obama and Democrats rejected the concept as the latest Republican gimmick to force talks before raising the debt ceiling.

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats announced they will propose a measure to increase the debt ceiling beyond next year's congressional elections with no additional issues attached.

All the partisan bickering -- and lack of progress -- is taking its toll not just on furloughed workers, shuttered government facilities and programs, but also on Americans' confidence in their government.

Poll: Most angry at both parties

In a national poll released Monday, most respondents said the government shutdown was causing a crisis or major problems for the country.

"It looks like there is more than enough blame to go around, and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

Will 2014 election solve anything?

With two vacancies in 435-member House, 217 votes are currently the minimum needed for the measure to win approval in the House.

However, not enough Republicans are willing to join Democrats in a procedural move to force Boehner to hold a vote on the Senate plan.

The speaker has previously allowed measures to pass the House with mostly Democratic support, which has weakened his leadership among conservatives. Doing so now could cost him his leadership post due to the conservative backlash in would likely unleash, analysts believe.
