"Portrait of a Musician Playing a Bagpipe" was done in 1632 by an unknown artist.

The painting, "Portrait of a Musician Playing a Bagpipe," was done in 1632 by an unknown painter from the Northern Netherlandish school, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in southern New York.

Stern, who died in 1987, left no heirs. He and his wife had founded the Max Stern Art Restitution Project, which directly benefits Concordia University and McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, according to a statement from U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The painting was returned Tuesday -- Holocaust Remembrance Day -- to Clarence Epstein of Concordia University on behalf of the executors of the estate, said Lou Martinez of the immigration agency.

It was returned in a ceremony at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York, he said.

Immigration agents used information from a Holocaust claims office in the New York state Banking Department to look into Steigrad's gallery.
