(CNN) -- The body of a journalist who was hacked to death in southeastern Nepal was cremated Tuesday as businesses and public transportation in the town of Janakpur remained shut for a second day to protest the killing.

Uma Singh, who was murdered in Nepal Sunday, had talked about the difficulties of practicing journalism.

"Journalists and human rights groups have descended on the town, and shops are shuttered in what almost seems like a spontaneous protest," Jayashi said.

The killing of Singh, 26, is the latest in a "troubling trend" of attacks on reporters, the United Nations' human rights office in the country said. It asked the government to investigate the case and prosecute death threats against other journalists.

"I am very very shocked," said Dharmendra Jha, president of the Federation of Nepalese Journalists, which is leading the protests. "If the government is not ready to provide any kind of security to journalists, it will be very difficult to do journalism in a free mode."

The group said it will announce a new phase of protests Wednesday.

Authorities do not have a motive for the killing. In some of her articles, Singh spoke out against the dowry system, where a bride's family is forced to give cash and property to the groom's family before the wedding.

In recent months, the number of attacks on journalists in Nepal have shot up. The federation released a year-end report, recording 284 incidents -- including three deaths and a kidnapping.

The party is led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, or Prachanda -- a man who led a decade-long bloody insurgency before being sown in as prime minister.

During the decade-long civil war, Maoist forces under him carried out numerous attacks on journalists they believed were opposed to their cause, Human Rights Watch said.

Three years ago, Singh's father and elder brother disappeared. Her family has all along accused local Maoist leaders of being behind the disappearances, Jayashi said.

Singh, herself, talked about the difficulties of practicing journalism in an interview with the United Nations last year.

"Various armed groups that are mushrooming have been a major challenge for us. We have been compelled to dance to their tunes. ...This makes us helpless," she said in the interview.
