However the South-African born Pietersen must undergo a "reintegration program", before England team director Andy Flower can pick him.

"ECB and Kevin Pietersen confirm that agreement has been reached concerning a process for his reintegration into the England team during the remainder of 2012," said an ECB statement.

"Upon completion of the program, the England selectors will consider Kevin for future matches."

Two years ago the allrounder was man of the tournament when England, captained by Paul Collingwood, were crowned T20 world champions in the Caribbean.

"Kevin Pietersen has apologized to Andrew Strauss and wishes to express to all those who support England his regrets at the impact the recent controversies have had on the England team," continued the ECB statement.

"He now wishes to put the events of the summer behind him and to focus on regaining his place in the England team."

"Kevin conceded that the messages exchanged were provocative. The ECB is satisfied, following receipt of this binding assurance, that to the best of his recollection, Kevin did not convey any messages which were derogatory about the England captain, the England team director, the ECB or employees of the ECB.

"Furthermore, there was no tactical information whatsoever provided to members of the South African touring party."

"Kevin has signed a central contract today," Clarke told a media conference. "Andy Flower will determine the progress of the reintegration process. It could be soon, it could be much later."

Pietersen admitted the situation had been difficult, but insisted he was focused on regaining his place in the team.

"It's been a horrible situation for all involved," said the 32-year-old cricketer.

Before he was dropped, Pietersen has been integral part of the England Test team since making his debut in 2005.

He has scored 21 centuries in 81 Test matches for his country and was given the honor of captaining England's one-day team in 2008.
