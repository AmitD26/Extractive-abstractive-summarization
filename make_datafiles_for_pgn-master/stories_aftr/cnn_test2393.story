JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Police armed with rubber bullets were patrolling neighborhoods in Johannesburg on Tuesday in an effort to quell a recent spree of violence aimed at foreigners that police say has killed 22 people and displaced an estimated 13,000.

A crowd armed with clubs, machetes and axes rioted on the outskirts of Johannesburg on Tuesday.

Evidence of the violence was seen in smoke rising from burned homes in one Johannesburg neighborhood. Locals angry about the rising number of foreigners arriving in South Africa had set homes ablaze.

Firefighters said they had fought more than 100 such blazes since Thursday.

Standing outside a row of charred homes, Diamond Minnaar said there is a solution for foreigners.

"Most of them just have to go back to their country and leave us in peace," Minnaar said. "That is the only solution. Or they are just going to get killed. Look at how many shacks have burnt down."

The attacks and looting have drawn condemnation from South African officials and other African leaders. iReport.com: Are you there? Send photos, video

The violence began a week ago in Johannesburg's Alexandra Township, police say, and has been concentrated in the city's poorest areas.

On Monday, South African President Thabo Mbeki called for an end to the violence.

Police director Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said that at least one foreigner was burned alive over the weekend, while others saw their houses torched, their shops looted and their possessions stolen.

Tuesday there was a large police presence in the neighborhoods were the violence had occurred, according to a CNN producer on the scene.

Despite the police presence, sporadic looting still took place in several townships east of Johannesburg.

Mbuso Mthembu, provincial manager at the Red Cross office in Johannesburg, said that the number of people fleeing is continuing to grow and that violent attacks seem to be spreading into other areas.

"We have delivered blankets, kids clothing, baby formula," he said. "But we need more."
