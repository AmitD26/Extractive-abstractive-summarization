(CNN) -- A man accused of killing eight people in a shooting spree at a North Carolina nursing home is the husband of a woman who worked there, police said Monday.

The two may have been separated, said Carthage, North Carolina, Police Chief Chris McKenzie. He did not say if the wife was in the building at the time.

All the wounded are expected to survive, McKenzie said.

"If that's not heroism, I don't know what is," he said.

Garner is "in very good spirits, resting at home," he added. McKenzie said he did not know the latest on Stewart's condition.

The alleged gunman's motive remained a mystery.

Meanwhile, his ex-wife, Sue Griffin, told CNN affiliate WTVD-TV in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, "He did have some violent tendencies from time to time." She added that when she heard the news of Sunday's shooting, "I couldn't believe it -- then I stopped, thought about it and thought, 'It is possible. It's possible.' "

The tragedy draws attention to what McKenzie called the toughest part of training police officers.

Officers are told not to wait for backup when there are many lives on the line, he said. "That's the hardest thing -- to try to convince them you can't wait, you have to go."

The slain patients ranged in age from 78 to 98, Moore County District Attorney Maureen Krueger said.

A witness told CNN affiliate WRAL-TV in Raleigh-Durham that Stewart was armed with a rifle, a shotgun and other weapons.

Jerry Avant Sr. told WRAL that his son, Jerry Avant, a 39-year-old registered nurse, was the employee who was killed in the shooting. He said a doctor told him that his son had been shot more than two dozen times.

Stewart faces eight counts of first-degree murder  and one count of felony assault on a police officer, and other charges are pending, Krueger said.

Carthage is about 60 miles southwest of Raleigh.  See map showing Carthage and Raleigh Â»
