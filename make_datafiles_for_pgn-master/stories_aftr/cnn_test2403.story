(CNN) -- Two snowmobilers died Wednesday in an avalanche on Logan Peak north of Salt Lake City, Utah, a sheriff's department official said.

Two people died after being trapped on Utah's Logan Peak during an avalanche.

"Two people were trapped," he said. "They have both been recovered."

Though the area is not off limits to snowmobilers, they had been warned of the danger after a recent snowstorm.

"Every year, there's a few avalanches," he said.

The area is also popular during the summer, when hang gliders launch themselves from the peak.
