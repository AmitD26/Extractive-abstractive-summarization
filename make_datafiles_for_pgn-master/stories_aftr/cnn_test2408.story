White supremacists taunt black protesters who marched Tuesday in Paris, Texas.

Two white men were initially charged with murder, but the charges were dismissed last month because of a lack of evidence.

White demonstrators waved a flag emblazoned with a Nazi swastika and taunted the black marchers, shouting through a megaphone: "White power, white power."  Watch the confrontation Â»

Paris, in northeast Texas, has 25,000 people, 70 percent white and 20 percent black.

No violence or injuries were reported but two white men were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for trying to incite the protesters, Lt. Danny Huff of the Paris Police Department said.

McClelland's mother, Jacqueline McClelland, told CNN the demonstration was not about race but was aimed at achieving justice for her only child.

CNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.
