WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal officials will travel to Standish, Michigan, on Thursday to tour a state prison that could be used to house terror suspects detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, U.S. government officials said Wednesday.

The prison in Standish, Michigan, is slated for closure but would stay open if Guantanamo detainees are sent there.

"I think most people are for this," Nelson said. "Anything to keep the prison open."

Another location often mentioned for housing Guantanamo prisoners is a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Republican Sen. Sam Brownback and other officials vehemently oppose placing prisoners there.

Administration officials have said they are looking at installations that could hold courtrooms for federal criminal trials as well as military commissions.

President Obama announced plans early in his presidency to close the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay by January. The center has 229 detainees.
