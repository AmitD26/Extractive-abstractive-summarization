(CNN) -- It was the kind of phone call military families dread receiving from Iraq and Afghanistan -- not from Texas.

Bono was one of 30 people hurt when a soldier opened fire on a military processing center at Fort Hood, the place where soldiers report before they head to war. They get medical and dental checkups there. They settle finances and even make out their wills.

Thursday, the center turned into a killing field, and 13 lives were abruptly cut short.

America watched in horror the news of the shootings, the deadliest ever on a military base. Some of the victims, such as Bono, were preparing to head to Iraq or Afghanistan. They were felled instead in the place they called home.

When the shouts of "Shots fired! Shots fired!" started, one soldier pushed and shoved people to get out the back of the readiness center. And run.

The soldier, who did not want to be identified, heard more screaming.

Soldiers were dragging bodies away from the shooter. They snatched tablecloths off tables, cut up their own sage-green digital combat uniforms, even their tan undershirts, and turned them into tourniquets and pressure bandages. Everyone tried to render CPR and medical aid. Some were medical personnel. Others were simply friends helping friends.

Most of the injured were awake and alert, witnesses recalled. They just weren't talking.

It felt too much like Blohm's tour of Iraq.

The shooting suspect, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, was a psychiatrist who had an office at Darnall. Now, the hospital was taking in the doctor's alleged victims.

Sirens, installed after the September 11, 2001, attacks, sound routinely at Fort Hood during emergency drills. Pam Stephenson, the wife of a Judge Advocate General officer, was used to the blaring noise.

Her husband called and told her not to leave the house. She turned on the television and learned the grim news. The gunman, she discovered, was a soldier.

"When you hear it's soldiers gone crazy -- you don't know what kind of ammunition or guns they have," she said.

She checked on the soldier's wife and worried about Patrick.

Finally, at 7:15, she was able to see her baby.

Many miles away in Punta Gorda, Florida, Roxanne Johnson was chitchatting with her son, Justin, on the phone. He was a young track vehicle mechanic who was heading to Afghanistan come January.

Mother and son joked and laughed, like they always did.

What was that? she wondered.

"At first I thought he was just kidding around and turning up the video game, and then I said, well, maybe it's a training exercise," Johnson told CNN affiliate WINK News in Fort Myers, Florida.

Her son's voice was gone. She refused to hang up until she could hear Justin again.

Hours passed before Johnson learned the fate of her son. He was one of the shooting victims. But Justin Johnson was one of the lucky ones. He underwent surgery and was recovering Thursday night.

Roxanne Johnson breathed a sigh of relief and was able finally to disconnect her phone.
