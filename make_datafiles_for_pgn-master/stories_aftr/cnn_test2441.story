Using a network of Iranian journalists and eager volunteers back in Tehran, the 27-year-old former student collates reports, pictures and video for his Web site astreetjournalist.com.

Having fled Iran following the June demonstrations, Valadbaygi set up the site in November -- his latest attempt to beat what he says are government hackers and offer news and views about the unrest in Iran.

With international media operating under restrictions in Iran, independent journalists using blogs and social networking sites have become an important source of information.

"What's happening in Iran is not being reflected globally. We want to let the world know and let the state know that the world is watching," said Valadbaygi.

"We've already experienced a large number of viewers on our blogs and web sites and therefore we have been hacked by the regime of Iran repeatedly and unfortunately have lost access to many of our web sites. But introducing this web site (to) professional colleagues and also lots of viewers who are currently collaborating with us has helped in achieving wonderful results in the past few days."

Valadbaygi believes in the power of social media. He is active on Facebook and Twitter and maintains a blog called Revolutionary Road.

"Facebook and Twitter have turned into a strong tool for people in spreading news. Citizen journalists have the most effect on news and today we clearly see that each citizen in Iran is acting as a media. Therefore we have the responsibility in gathering the news in one place to achieve a better result against the regime's censorship," he said.

Meanwhile, Valadbaygi worries about his parents, brother and sister in Tehran. He says his brother was recently arrested. He communicates with his family using multiple email accounts while his parents use public phones to minimize the risk of the call being traced.

And he acknowledges that his network of correspondents in Iran, which he says is spreading to cities beyond Tehran, contact him in the full knowledge that they could attract the attention of the authorities. "They could track the IP addresses and this could cause problems in the workplace or university."
