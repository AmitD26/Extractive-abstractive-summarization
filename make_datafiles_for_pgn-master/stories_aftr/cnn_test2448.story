James, a motorcycle designer and reality TV star, has been the target of controversy and publicity since his separation with actress Sandra Bullock soon after she won a best actress Oscar earlier this month.

A citation is the equivalent of an arrest, Sgt. Zapalski said.

The Long Beach city prosecutor will decide if the cases will be prosecuted, she said.

Detectives with the city's violent crimes section met with the lawyer for Rios Thursday morning to obtain a copy of the video, attorney Mark Haushalter said.

The video shows James confronting Rios, who is sitting in a vehicle park across the street from West Coast Choppers, a business owned by James, Haushalter said.

The lawyer for James did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment.
