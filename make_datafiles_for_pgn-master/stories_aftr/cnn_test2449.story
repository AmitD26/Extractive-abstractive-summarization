Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)  -- A previously unknown armed group said Friday it attacked a Nigerian oil pipeline this week on the first full day in office for Nigeria's new acting president.

The attempt by the Joint Revolutionary Council (JRC) of the Niger Delta was not successful, a spokesman for the military said. But it indicates not everyone in Nigeria is happy with the way the new president, who hails from the Niger Delta region, was given power.

But Lt. Col. Timothy Antigua, a spokesman for the Nigerian military, said the attack failed.

The JRC said its attack Wednesday followed another last weekend, and that both are aimed at incapacitating the export terminal and fighting the "occupation" in Nigeria.

Acting President Goodluck Jonathan was approved for the role Tuesday by Nigeria's House and Senate to fill the political void left after President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua departed in November for medical treatment in Saudi Arabia.

In his first address to the nation Tuesday, Jonathan praised the "resilience and unity of purpose" with which Nigerians reacted to the recent political upheaval, saying there were "no winners and no losers" and that it is now time to move forward.

He called on all Nigerians and the country's political parties to "tackle the various challenges which we face as a nation," including those in the areas of power, infrastructure, security and job creation.

Jonathan also vowed to pursue the "war against corruption" more robustly.

His appointment has stirred controversy in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, with some arguing that the articles of the Nigerian constitution were not followed with the transfer of power.

Nigeria's constitution says the president must formally communicate to the National Assembly that he is empowering the vice president to act as president in his absence.

While no such formal communication was given, the Senate declared Tuesday that a January 13 BBC interview with Yar'Adua from his hospital bed could constitute such a notice.

In the interview, the president acknowledged that he could not perform the duties of his office and would not be able to return until his doctors declared him fit.
