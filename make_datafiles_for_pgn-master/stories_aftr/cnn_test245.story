(CNN) -- Austria has produced many of the world's greatest skiers, and another made her mark on the history books in front of her home crowd on Sunday.

Marlies Schild claimed the 35th World Cup slalom victory of her career in Lienz to take sole ownership of the record from Switzerland's Vreni Schneider.

It was the 2011 world champion's second successive slalom victory after topping the podium in the French Alps earlier this month.

It kept the 18-year-old two points ahead of Schild in the slalom standings, while Hofl-Riesch now has the same advantage over previous leader Tina Weirather in the race for the overall World Cup title.

Meanwhile, Aksel Lund Svindal moved 195 points clear in the men's World Cup with the 25th victory of his career in Sunday's downhill in Bormio.

The Norwegian, third at the Italian course last year, finished 0.39 seconds ahead of Austria's defending champion Hannes Reichelt.

"Bormio is a tough race. Usually it is decided on the last section; when everyone is tired you have to try and push that bit extra," Svindal said.

"I am going south to do some windsurfing and relax on the beach for four days over New Year's. I want to have some fun before the World Cup continues in January. It's healthy for me to walk barefoot on the beach and relax a bit after being in the cold all the time."
