Roy Pearson sued the owners of this dry cleaning business for $54 million over a missing pair of pants.

He filed a lawsuit Thursday in federal court accusing city government and others of an "unlawful demotion and subsequent termination."

As an administrative law judge, Pearson would hear cases involving zoning law and certain business disputes.

A city panel that decides reappointments had notified Pearson during the controversial lost trousers trial that his status was under review.

A source on that panel said at the time that any judge must meet certain standards of conduct "on and off the bench."

The source, who was among the members of the panel at the time of Pearson's review, said "a judge is a judge 24/7; whether or not they use good judgment in all aspects of their lives is what we can consider."

A pair of trousers that hung by the witness stand was a featured part of the trial last summer. The owners testified that the pants belonged to Pearson, who denied under oath that they were his.

In court documents made available Friday at U.S. District Court in Washington, Pearson, again acting as his own attorney, relies on what he considers Washington's "Whistleblower Protection" law to try to establish illegal retaliation.

The trial over the lost trousers generated a storm of criticism among fairness advocates, who accused Pearson of abusing the system. The latest litigation has begun to produce the same reaction.

"He lost his job because he proved he did not have the legal requirements to fill the job, namely a judicial temperament," said Darren McKinney of the American Tort Reform Association.
