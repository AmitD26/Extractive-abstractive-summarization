(CNN) -- Newly-crowned Dunhill Links champion Martin Kaymer could prevent Lee Westwood from replacing Tiger Woods as the world's number one golfer.

Westwood failed to achieve the second-place finish which would have seen him end Woods' 279-week reign on Sunday, but the Englishman could still top the rankings on October 31 providing the American does not change his plans and play before then.

However, Kaymer's decision to enter the Andalucia Valderrama Masters in Spain at the end of this month means the 25-year-old could yet be the one to take over from the off-form Woods.

"I was never expecting it and I don't really have an answer for why I am playing so well at the moment," he said.

"I've always played solid golf and my short game has improved big-time the last two years and especially the last few months."

"The way he played with me last week was absolutely amazing. He played so solidly," Kaymer said.

"His putting was good, chipping -- the entire game was fantastic. I really see him as a role model."

It is expected the 37-year-old will return for the season-ending championship in Dubai which starts on November 25.

The only way Woods can retain his five-year long stint as world number one is to play another tournament in October, but he is not due to return to action until the HSBC Champions event in China on November 4 -- where Westwood was also scheduled to appear.
