(CNN) -- Passengers who disembarked from a Carnival Cruise Lines ship that was towed to port after losing power earlier this week gave mixed reviews on the experience, with several declaring it "an adventure."

"A lot of things went wrong, but it was really fun," said one small passenger, Ryan Harlan, who was traveling with his parents. "We went to the Kids' Camp."

Some 3,300 passengers left the ship Thursday after the three-day ordeal that began with a fire in the ship's engine room Monday. Engineers were unable to restore power to the ship after the fire was extinguished, leaving passengers without air conditioning, hot showers or decent meals. Instead, they had to settle for Spam and Pop-Tarts dropped off by the USS Ronald Reagan, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier that came to assist.

"It was absolutely deplorable," Horace said. At one point, the ship ran out of food, he said, and "they started making mayo sandwiches."

He said he ate a lot of bananas and dry cereal, but at one point didn't want to eat anymore because the smell of overflowing toilets, spoiled food and rotten milk was overwhelming.

Once the USS Ronald Reagan showed up to assist, passengers felt safer, he said. And the Navy provided good food -- Horace said he particularly enjoyed the bean burritos.

"We tried to make the best of it," said Horace, who was traveling with his best friend for both of their birthdays. "It just completely got ruined."

Horace said passengers brushed their teeth with bottled water, and "showering in the dark is not fun."

He told CNN affiliate KFMB some of the floors were "saturated with feces and urine" after the toilets backed up. "It was really nasty," he said.

One woman, who said she worked for the cruise line, was wearing a T-shirt that said, "I survived the 2010 Carnival Cruise Spamcation." Vendors met passengers at the port, selling the shirts for $20.

"The first part of it was OK," King said of the cruise. "The food was great, staff was great." But after the fire, he said, the food "actually got worse. The toilets didn't work for about 12 hours."

Several people said the experience was "an adventure."

The vessel became stranded Monday off the coast of Mexico after the fire.

While Carnival said Wednesday that most passengers knew that the Splendor's crew was doing the best it could, there were reports of passengers pledging not to take up the company's offer of a free replacement trip.

Because the ship was without most of its power, the company decided to wait until daylight Thursday for tugboats to deliver the Splendor to a dock, Carnival Cruise Lines CEO Gerry Cahill said at a news conference.

One passenger, David Zambrano, a KUSA-TV employee, called his Denver, Colorado, station Wednesday from his cell phone and said many passengers were in the dark in their cabins and had to wait in line for two hours to eat the cold meals, which were being delivered to the ship by helicopter from the USS Ronald Reagan.

"Many of the people I have talked to said that they will never take another cruise again, especially with Carnival," said Zambrano. Others, however, said they would return.

In addition to offering a free cruise, Carnival has promised passengers a refund and said it will cover their transportation costs.

"Conditions on the ship have been challenging," said Cahill, reiterating the cruise line's apologies to families.

"We're disappointed about it. Reports from the ship show guests believe we are doing the best we can," Cahill said. "We ruined their vacations. I am optimistic they will return."

Cahill said the crew did the best it could to make passengers comfortable, including offering free drinks.

Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz acknowledged the unpleasant conditions.

"We know that the conditions were challenging and our crew worked extremely hard to make our guests as comfortable as possible until we could return them home safely. We sincerely apologize," de la Cruz said.

"We've been in business for 35 years," Cahill said. "We've never had anything like this happen before."

"One thing is for certain though," Heald added. "I doubt anyone onboard will ever, ever want to eat a sandwich ever again."
