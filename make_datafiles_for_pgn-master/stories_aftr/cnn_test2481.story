A man in Haiti identifies a woman he sees on the street as the missing person whose photo is posted on CNN's iReport. A husband reels off the names of missing college students and a stranger hundreds of miles away confirms they are safe.

iReporter Wolin Delerme sent in a frantic video about her sister who had left for Haiti on Monday, a day before the 7.0-magnitude quake struck. Minutes after her plea aired on CNN, a man in Haiti contacted her.

"He saw my sister not too far from where he's standing," Delerme said.

Len Gengel and his wife have endured a parent's worst nightmare. Their daughter Brittany was visiting Haiti with a group of students from Lynn University in Florida.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has set up a Web site for people trying to find information on the fate of relatives in Haiti. However, inside Haiti, the Red Cross has not been able to collect and publish identities and whereabouts of survivors.
