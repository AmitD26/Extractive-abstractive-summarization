(CNN) -- Sometimes you get a good feeling about something.

With just one letter revealed -- "L" -- Burke correctly guessed the seven-word phrase: "I've got a good feeling about this."

Burke, who lives in New York, said she is a huge "Wheel of Fortune" fan and often impresses her family and friends by solving puzzles when they watch at home.

The show aired last week.

When asked what advice she could offer to aspiring contestants, Burke said practice. "Watch the show and think positive."
