Scientists from NASA hope that rubber ducks will help them better understand glacier movements.

Scientists remain unsure as to why glaciers speed up their movement in the summer months and it is hoped that the rubber ducks -- labeled with the words "science experiment" and "reward" in three languages, along with an email address -- will shed some light on the phenomenon.

It's thought that this base water acts as a lubricant to speed up the movement of the glacier towards the sea.

It is hoped the ducks will help show how the water moves through the ice.

So far, neither the probe nor any of the ducks have turned up.

Alberto Behar of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California told Reuters: "We haven't heard back but it may take some time until somebody actually finds it and decides to send us an e-mail that they have found it."

The Jakobshavn Glacier is responsible for seven percent of all ice which is peeling off Greenland and its ice sheets could contribute to sea levels rising this century.
