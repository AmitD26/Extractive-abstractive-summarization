(CNN) -- Northern Michigan University officials say the situation "is under control" after a telephone threat against students, faculty and others prompted a lockdown of the Marquette, Michigan, campus Wednesday morning.

However officials continued to urge students to remain in their dormitories and visitors to stay away from the campus until further notice.

Cindy Paavola, the university's director of community relations, said campus police took the threat seriously, thus prompting the administration to close the university as a precautionary measure.

"The caller threatened that there would be harm to students, faculty, staff and administrators," Paavola said. "They didn't identify particular people, but it was a wide-ranging threat and we are taking it seriously."

"We don't know the seriousness of the threat because we haven't caught up with this person. Rather than be sorry, we're going to be safe," Paavola said.

State and local law enforcement authorities are assisting university police in the investigation, she added.

The Marquette Area Public Schools also sent students and staff home, interim superintendent Debra Veiht told CNN.
