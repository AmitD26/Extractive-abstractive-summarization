(CNN) -- Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, who has been living in exile in South Africa for seven years, has been issued a new passport to return home, the Haitian interior minister said Wednesday.

That removes a major obstacle that has prevented Aristide from making the journey back. However, Kurzban said last month that Aristide would still need the cooperation of South Africa and the United States to make the journey home.

Kurzban also said last month that Aristide had no intention of re-entering politics. But Washington has already signaled its displeasure.

"We do not doubt President Aristide's desire to help the people of Haiti. But today Haiti needs to focus on its future, not its past," State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said last month. "This is an important period for Haiti. What it needs is calm, not divisive actions that distract from the task of forming a new government."

The former Roman Catholic priest, who became a voice for Haiti's impoverished, remains a polarizing figure but commands a large following in his homeland.

"It will be the greatest party of this decade," Francois said. "Once again the world will see that President Aristide is the most revered politician in the history of Haiti."

Aristide left Haiti on a U.S. jet in 2004 after a bloody revolt by street gangs and soldiers. The leftist former president says he was shuttled out by Western powers.

"Once again I express my readiness to leave today, tomorrow, at any time," Aristide said in a January statement. "The people of Haiti have never stopped calling for my return to Haiti."
