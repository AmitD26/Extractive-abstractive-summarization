(CNN) -- Germany made it seven wins out of seven with a comfortable victory over Azerbaijan to put themselves on the brink of qualification for Euro 2012.

Goals from Mesut Ozil, Mario Gomez and Andre Schurrle helped Joachim Loew's side to a 3-1 triumph in Baku as they moved 11 points clear in qualifying Group A.

It would take an unlikely series of events for them to be caught by second placed Turkey, who have a game in hand on their rivals.

Real Madrid midfielder Ozil was first to find the net, collecting Benedikt Hoewedes' cross before firing a drive into the corner.

Ibrahimovic came on as a substitute in the first half and registered his hat-trick within 22 minutes. Kim Kallstrom and Emir Bajrami added the other goals.

Hungary moved within three points of Sweden after they beat San Marino 3-0, Zoltan Liptak, Imre Szabics and Vladimir Koman finding the net.

In the same group, Haris Medunjanin and Darko Maletic were on target for Bosnia-Hercegovina as they beat Albania 2-0 to move into third, two points off Belarus and three points behind France.
