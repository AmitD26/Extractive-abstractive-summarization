(CNN) -- Tournament favorite Maria Sharapova powered into the Wimbledon women's singles semifinals on Tuesday, crushing Dominika Cibulkova for the loss of just two games.

Fifth seed Sharapova, the 2004 champion and only grand slam winner left in the women's draw, proved in a different league to Slovakian Cibulkova, taking just under an hour to reach the last four 6-1 6-1.

The 24-year-old Sharapova told reporters: "It's an honor to be in the semifinal at Wimbledon.

"She's confident and playing great grass court tennis," continued Sharapova, who has yet to drop a set in the tournament so far.

Ninth seed Bartoli came into the tournament on a high after winning the warm-up event at Eastbourne, and she maintained that momentum by putting out defending champion Serena Williams in the last 16.

Both players had reached the last four of last year's tournament, losing to Serena Williams and Vera Zvonareva respectively, and it was eighth seed Kvitova who got there again -- going through 6-3 6-7 6-2.

Kvitova is aiming to become the first left-hander to win the women's title since Martina Navratilova in 1990.

The final semifinal was held up because of heavy rain at Wimbledon, and was eventually switched to Centre Court under the roof, where fourth seed Victoria Azarenka claimed a comfortable 6-3 6-1 victory over unseeded Austrian Tamira Paszek.

The 21-year-old Belarussian had lost her four previous grand slam quarterfinals, but was never in danger against her unseeded opponent, who was reaching her first grand slam quarterfinal.
