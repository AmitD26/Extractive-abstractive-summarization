No incidents and additional arrests were reported overnight, authorities said.

Many had crossed the bridge -- the same place where more than 700 had been arrested last month -- chanting, "This is what democracy looks like -- This is what America looks like," according to the New York movement's official Twitter feed.

This time, they marched in the pedestrian walkway and did not block the roadway.

Occupy protesters also took to the streets in all corners of the nation -- from Miami to Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon and Boston -- marking two months since the activist effort aimed at the nation's wealthiest 1% began in Manhattan.

Police said a total of 245 people had been arrested around the city Thursday.

Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said at least seven police officers were hurt Thursday during exchanges with protesters.

Five of those officers were injured when a unidentified liquid was thrown on their faces, Kelly said, adding that they experienced a burning sensation and required hospitalization.

It is not clear how many demonstrators have been injured during the clashes.

Authorities constructed barricades at Zuccotti Park in front of the New York Stock Exchange and along Fifth Avenue in an apparent attempt to keep demonstrators off the roads and on pedestrian walkways.

Earlier Thursday, protesters lifted metal barricades around Zuccotti Park, a former home-base for the movement, defying authorities and blocking traffic.

Bloomberg said the day's protests had "caused minimal disruptions to our city," but added that some demonstrators had "deliberately" pursued violence.

In cities such as St. Louis and Milwaukee, thousands responded to the "day of action" plea.
