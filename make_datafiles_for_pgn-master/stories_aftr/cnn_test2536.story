The United States, she said, knows the Haqqani terrorist network operates out of havens in Pakistan.

"We intend to push the Pakistanis very hard," Clinton said, calling it a "time for clarity."

"Our message is very clear: We're going to be fighting, we're going to be talking, we're going to be building," she said. "And they can either be helping or hindering. But we are not going to stop our efforts to create a strong foundation for an Afghanistan free from interference, violent conflict and one that has a chance to chart its own future."

She is expected to meet with Pakistani officials, including Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, to stress that transitioning to Afghan security is in the interest of Pakistan, senior officials said.

The top U.S. diplomat said she was working toward a peaceful Afghanistan.

"No people in the world deserve it more," she said.

Earlier Thursday, Clinton met with representatives of Afghan civil society, including human rights activists who address various issues including education, gender-based violence and youth empowerment.

"These are some of my heroes," she said as she greeted them at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.

Her visit comes as the nation pursues peace with the Taliban after years of insurgency.

Rabbani was killed at home last month by suicide bombers posing as Taliban peace mediators.

"He tried to do the right thing," she said.

In addition to the reconciliation efforts, Clinton also was to discuss Pakistan's relations with the nation and the upcoming Afghan transition.

Coalition forces are in the process of transferring security control to Afghan forces ahead of a U.S. drawdown set to be completed by the end of 2014.
