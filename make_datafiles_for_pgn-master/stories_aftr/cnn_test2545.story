The two sides remain far apart, Stern said from the NBA meetings. He added that no further talks are scheduled.

"We know our backs are against the wall in terms of regular season games and what those consequences will be," he said then.

Stern has said that last season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners, who want cost-cutting help from players.

Less than a week ago, the NBA canceled its preseason, which meant the loss of about $200 million in revenue, Stern said.

One of the battles has focused on the owners' rejection of the players union's call for an average $7 million player salary in the sixth year of a new labor deal.

Other big issues include a fight over a move by owners to get a bigger share of revenues and whether the NBA will strengthen its salary cap.

The last work stoppage occurred in 1998.
