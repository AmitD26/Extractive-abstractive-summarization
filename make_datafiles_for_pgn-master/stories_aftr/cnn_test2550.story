It said dealers in about 10 states were involved, but there was no evidence the U.S.-based businesses were aware of the Hezbollah connection.

The filing says the bank permitted Hezbollah-related entities to move as much as $260,000 a day through their accounts, without disclosing the source or purpose of the money.

Prosecutors on Thursday demanded the bank's assets be forfeited due to the alleged wrongdoing.

The chairman of Lebanese Canadian Bank, Georges Zard Abou Jaoude, told CNN on Thursday, "We deny any relation whatsoever with Hezbollah."

"We never had any transaction or any connection with any name which was blacklisted. The moment a name appeared on the screen, we froze the account," he said.

CNN was not able to reach Hezbollah officials immediately for comment. But the group's chief political strategist, speaking to The New York Times this week, said the group had no relationship to the Lebanese Canadian Bank and dismissed the American allegations of a drug connection as politically motivated propaganda.

On Tuesday, prosecutors in Virginia also indicted a Lebanese man they allege was at the center of the laundering network and who they say has ties to Hezbollah -- although he is not a member of the group. They assert that Ayman Joumaa coordinated the smuggling and sale of at least 90 tons of cocaine destined for the United States and laundered hundreds of millions of dollars for drug gangs in Mexico and Colombia such as the notorious Zetas. According to the indictment, Joumaa laundered as much as $200 million a month and made bulk cash deliveries to South America in amounts as high as $4 million.

"He moved the money," said Brian Dodd, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who coordinated the Joumaa investigation. "He couldn't have survived without Hezbollah. And he was a source of revenue for Hezbollah."

Joumaa is not in custody, and officials would only say they believe him to be in the Middle East.

Hezbollah, which the United States has designated a terrorist organization, is an influential member of the government in Lebanon. But it also has a history of terror attacks against American interests, dating back to the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1983.

"The worldwide demand for drugs is actually helping terror groups fund their activities," Maltz said. "And these groups want to destroy America."

Jonathan Schanzer, an ex-Treasury Department terror finance analyst who is with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said, "Hezbollah can do a lot of damage, and the more money that rolls in, the more problematic that will be.

"Their arm gets a little bit shorter," he said, "and their influence begins to wane just a little bit."
