eMalahleni, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African coal-mining company is cleaning up its act by building cheap, eco-friendly housing using its industrial waste.

Now, AngloAmerican is mixing the waste by-product -- a mineral known as gypsum -- with cement to make energy-efficient bricks it uses to build houses there.

"We've built 62 houses so far," said Peter Gunther, AngloAmerican's head of sustainable development, and the driving force behind the initiative.

Gypsum is a basic mineral compound of calcium and sulphur. The non-toxic mineral is soluble in water, but becomes harder and more adhesive the hotter and dryer it gets.

Because gypsum is malleable when wet, its most common commercial application to date is as the main ingredient for household plaster.

"Actually, there are 50 different uses for it -- from dental surgery to fireproofing doors," said Gunther.

And Gunther believes that his new bricks have significant advantages over the heavy cement ones typically used in the area: "The bricks are generally harder than traditional cement bricks, they're also better heat and sound insulators," he said.

But, most crucially for one of the fastest growing urban areas in South Africa, the gypsum bricks have a lower environmental impact.

"Because it (gypsum) is such a strong binding agent, we need much less cement to make (the bricks)," said Gunther.

According to figures from the Cement Sustainability Initiative, about 5% of all the world's man-made CO2 emissions stem from the chemical and combustion processes involved in cement production.

Gunther claims that his low-cement bricks save, on average, three tonnes of carbon dioxide for every home built.

But can gypsum -- a product that AngloAmerican had been discarding as waste before last year -- really be such a wonder material?

Andrew Bloodworth is head of minerals at the British Geological Survey. He says that gypsum, "a relatively common mineral geologically," is indeed a great heat insulator and can be very strong -- but only as long as it stays dry.

"The brick mixture has been subjected to the most rigorous trials by the South African Bureau of Standards, and passed without any problems," he added.
