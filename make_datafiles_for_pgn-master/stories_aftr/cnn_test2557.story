(CNN) -- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga boosted his Australian Open hopes by overcoming difficult conditions to beat fellow Frenchman Gael Monfils in the final of the Qatar Open on Saturday.

The 26-year-old claimed the first title of the 2012 ATP Tour season and the eighth of his career, showing the sort of form that took him to the final of the year's opening grand slam in Melbourne four years ago.

"It was difficult. The surface was very slippery especially on the 'Qatar' sign painted on the court," Tsonga, who won 16 of the last 19 points, told reporters.

"It was dangerous but they did enough to make it okay. This is a good win for me going into the Australian Open, it's just amazing."

Tsonga took his place in the final after world No. 3 and three-time defending champion Roger Federer withdrew before their semifinal due to a back problem.

Meanwhile, world No. 4 Andy Murray will take on Ukrainian third seed Alexandr Dolgopolov in Sunday's Brisbane International final.

Murray, last year's Australian Open runner-up, reached his 31st career final after eliminating the 42nd-ranked 19-year-old.

The 31st-ranked Raonic, named 2011 ATP Newcomer of the Year after winning his first title in San Jose, defeated Spanish second seed Nicolas Almagro 6-4 6-4 to reach his third final.
