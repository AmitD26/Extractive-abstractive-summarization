(CNN) -- World No. 2 Rafael Nadal is still on course for his first Miami Masters title after beating the Czech Republic's Radek Stepanek 6-2 6-2 in the third round of the U.S. hard-court tournament.

Spain's 10-time grand slam winner has been runner-up at the event on three occasions, including last year when he lost to Novak Djokovic, who went on to dethrone him at the top of the rankings.

World No. 4 Andy Murray reached the last 16 without hitting a ball, after his in-form third-round opponent Milos Raonic was forced to pull out due to an ankle injury in Key Biscayne.

"The doctor doesn't think it's anything big. It probably just needs a couple days of rest and, with treatment, it should be OK in a week," said the Canadian, who has already won titles in Chennai and San Jose this year.

Murray will now face Gilles Simon for a place in the quarterfinals after the French 13th seed won 7-6 6-4 against Austrian 22nd seed Jurgen Melzer.

In the women's section, the unseeded Venus Williams, who was handed a wildcard to compete in Florida, is also through to the last 16.

She next faces fellow former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic. The Serbian 15th seed overcame Slovakia's No. 20 Daniela Hantuchova 6-2 7-6 (7-2).

World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, the defending champion, thrashed British wildcard Heather Watson 6-0 6-2.

The Australian Open champion will play No.16 Dominika Cibulkova after the Slovakian beat China's Zheng Jie.

Polish fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska set up a clash with Spanish wildcard Garbine Muguruza Blanc, who shocked Italy's No. 24 Flavia Pennetta 6-2 1-6 7-6.
