(CNN) -- When my wife woke me up before dawn about three months ago to tell me she was having contractions, one of the first things I did was grab my iPhone from the nightstand.

No, I wasn't ignoring my wife to check my e-mail or send a tweet. I picked up my smartphone so I could use a 99-cent app to track the duration and frequency of those contractions.

You might think that using apps and gadgets right before and after your child is born will take away from this life-changing experience. But for my wife and me, having the right tech tools enhanced the experience and made us feel more connected to our out-of-town friends and family.

LaborMate iPhone app (99 cents)

Each time my wife signaled that a contraction was starting, I tapped the app's start button and when it was over, I hit stop -- generating a report that made it easy to track her progress. I could e-mail that data to our OBGYN, or if I was really bold, share it on Twitter or Facebook.

Using the app provided some order and calmness to what is often a chaotic experience.

Total Baby iPhone app ($4.99)

At the first pediatrician visit, the doctor wanted daily totals for the number of dirty and wet diapers as well as more details on the frequency and length of breast- or bottle-feeding sessions. What were his height, weight and length at birth? When he left the hospital?

We also used the app to keep track of upcoming and past doctor's appointments, to write down questions for the doctor and track Jack's growth.

The iPad is also great for storing and displaying pictures. When relatives visited, I set the iPad to slideshow mode and propped it upon the living room table to use as a digital picture frame.

To make loading photos onto the iPad easier, I bought the $29 iPad Camera Connection Kit to transfer photos and videos from an SD card and my iPhone. It's easier than dumping photos onto a computer, but you will need two hands.

Web Albums iPhone/iPad app ($1.99)

Like any new parent, I was eager to share photos of our son on Facebook, but I didn't always have my computer handy. There's no official Facebook iPad app (yet), and the iPhone app only lets you upload one photo at a time.

The app also let me upload multiple photos and manage albums on Google's Picasa service. It even saves photos for offline viewing and the app features a nice slideshow function.

Amazon Mom & Subscribe & Save

We heard lots of opinions on the best place to buy diapers and other baby stuff. We joined Amazon's free but unfortunately named Amazon Mom club (the account is in my name) to get discounts on lots of stuff.

For diapers and wipes, we signed up for Amazon's subscription service called "Subscribe & Save." The service delivers items to your door at set intervals of your choosing. You can cancel at anytime or change the type of diapers or wipes.

For instance, with the Amazon Mom discount, a shipment of 234 Pampers diapers costs about $31, or 13 cents a diaper. That's about $12 less than Target.com.
