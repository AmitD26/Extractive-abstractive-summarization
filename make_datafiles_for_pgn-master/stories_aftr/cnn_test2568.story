President Sepp Blatter said that the figures proved it was the right decision to award the 2010 tournament to South Africa, despite fears that hosting the biggest event in football on the continent was a financial risk.

"I am the happiest man to announce that the World Cup in South Africa was a huge, huge financial success for everybody -- for Africa for South Africa, for FIFA," Blatter told reporters after a meeting of the executive committee of football's world governing body in Zurich on Thursday.

Deputy secretary general and finance chief Markus Kattner confirmed that FIFA earned $4.189 billion over the last four years -- 87% of which came from the 2010 World Cup.

Kattner said that the the bulk of the organization's earnings came from the sale of broadcasting rights and marketing or sponsorship contracts from the tournament.

However, as a non-profit organization under Swiss law, the $631 million surplus raised by FIFA in 2010 will be distributed among footballing nations to be re-invested back into the game.

Blatter has been president of FIFA since 1998 and was recently criticized over his handling over the World Cup cash-for-votes scandal.
