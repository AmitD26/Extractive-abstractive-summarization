The heavily favored American hoopsters -- referred to, like past Olympic squads, as the Dream Team -- used a balanced effort Friday night to defeat Argentina 109-83 and advance to Sunday's final.

The Argentina squad is no slouch, boasting NBA stalwarts Manu Ginobili, Luis Scola and Carlos Delfino. But they were no match for the U.S. team, which was ahead five points after the first quarter and steadily pulled away thereafter.

In Olympic Stadium, meanwhile, America's top female sprinters outpaced their Jamaican competitors to earn gold in the prestigious 4 x 100-meter relay -- though their long dominant countrymen fell just short in the 4 X 400-meter men's race.

The Bahamas team of Chris Brown, Demetrius Pinder, Michael Mathieu and Ramon Miller won the latter event, rallying to pass the U.S. squad, which has had a stranglehold on this relay for decades, on the final lap. Trinidad and Tobago took home bronze.

One man who made headlines in the race, without winning, was South Africa's Oscar Pistorius. Prior to running his nation's final leg of Friday's relay final, Pistorius -- who runs on special carbon fiber prosthetic limbs and was once prevented from competing against able-bodied athletes -- had made history as the first double amputee athlete to compete in the Olympics.

The day's first track and field gold medal went to Ethiopia's Meseret Defar, who bested Kenya's Vivian Jepkemoi Cheruiyot by less than half a second to win the women's 5,000-meter race.

A short time later, Turkey's Asli Cakir Alptekin beat her fellow countrywoman Gamze Bulut and Bahrain's Maryam Yusuf Jamal to earn gold in the women's 1,500-meter final.

The women's hammer throw gold, meanwhile, went to Russia's Tatyana Lysenko, while France's Renaud Lavillenie narrowly bested a pair of competitors from Germany to win gold in the men's pole vault.

Gold in the men's open water 10-kilometer swimming marathon in the Serpentine, the lake in London's Hyde Park, went to Tunisian Oussama Mellouli. Germany's Thomas Lurz earned silver and Canada's Richard Weinberger the bronze.

Mellouli's victory in the grueling race, in front of hundreds of spectators living the banks of the Serpentine, gave Tunisia its first gold medal of the 2012 London Games. He also took bronze in the pool last week in the men's 1,500-meter freestyle race.

A Colombian, Mariana Pajon, won the gold in women's BMX cycling, with Sarah Walker of New Zealand getting the silver and Laura Smulders of the Netherlands the bronze.

Winds off Weymouth, on England's south coast, remained light Friday, posing a challenge to the men and women battling for medals in sailing events.

Gold in the 55-kilogram freestyle category went to Russia's Dzhamal Otarsultanov, who beat Vladimer Khinchegashvili of neighboring Georgia.

In men's boxing, defending superheavyweight champion Roberto Cammarelle of Italy narrowly defeated world amateur No. 1 Magomedrasul Medzhidov, of Azerbaijan, 13-12, on points to wrap up a night of semifinal fights. He'll face Great Britain's Anthony Joshua in Sunday's gold medal bout.

Ireland's John Joe Nevin and Great Britain's Luke Campbell will battle for the gold in the bantam 56-kilogram event Saturday night after winning through their respective semifinals.

The Netherlands defeated world champion Argentina 2-0 to earn gold in Friday night's women's field hockey final, shortly after Great Britain topped New Zealand 3-1 to earn the bronze.
