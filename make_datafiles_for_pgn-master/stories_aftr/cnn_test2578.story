Madrid's new blue clay courts have been the talk of the tennis world for all the wrong reasons. But is the furore justified?

After all, isn't this the same surface -- just a different color?

It's the nature of sports stars to be hyper-sensitive about their office environment. As one British journalist argued, a malfunctioning computer can waste your morning's work, but a ridge in a tennis court might spell the end of a career.

Ion Tiriac's baby

He pioneered the first blue hard courts at his indoor event in Stuttgart -- a lead followed by the Australian and U.S. Opens.

Tiriac argues the color increases the visibility of the yellow ball and points to scientific tests proving the contrast is at least 15% better on blue than red.

The fact it's also the color of Madrid's major sponsor, Spanish insurance giant Mutua Madrilena, has not been lost on his critics.

But really, it's just a color right? According to Tiriac the blue clay court is made exactly the same way as the red, with bricks ground into tiny fragments and spread over the ground in two different layers.

However, in Madrid these bricks are stripped of their iron oxide (the chemical that provides the original color) and then treated with dye.

Tiriac acknowledges the cost is almost double that of the red clay, but says the extra expense is worth it.

Players see red

So what's all the fuss about? World No. 2 Rafael Nadal's shock exit in the third round on Thursday has only added fire to players' complaints that the new surface is too slippery.

"I never was in control of the match, I didn't know how to win a point," Nadal told reporters, before suggesting he will not show up next year unless the controversial blue clay surface is changed.

But even before his huge upset, the 25-year-old was critical of the new surface, tweeting: "The history of clay court was on red. It wasn't on blue. Only one person wins -- the owner of the tournament."

World No. 1 Novak Djokovic also threatened not to step on Madrid's blue clay again after he lost to Janko Tipsarevic.

It's not just the texture of the surface raising eyebrows -- on the most basic level it just looks different.

But it's not all blue. American star Serena Williams didn't see what all the fuss was about.

Technically speaking

According to experts the lack of traction has nothing to do with the color but the implementation of the clay -- which has been playing much faster than usually expected on such a surface.

"The problem is not the fact that the color is blue, even though the change from the traditional brown is quite a shock. Let's not forget the Australian Open changing court color from the green to that bright blue! The players had a lot to say about that too," he said on his Facebook page.

"It's that the amount of clay covering the surface is lesser than normal. If you dig your foot into the surface and remove some of the clay, you will notice that the underlying surface is a hard rubber-like mat. When water is sprayed on the surface, it become slippery. This, in my opinion, is what's causing the main problems."

Former world No. 3 Ivan Ljubicic tested the blue clay at Madrid last year and admitted it did "look a bit slippery."

And besides, the biggest challenge at Madrid isn't the clay -- it's the altitude. Balls fly faster through thinner air and Madrid is 650 meters above sea level.

Eyes on the prize ... no, the other prize

The issue isn't just about Madrid, of course. The tournament is seen as an important buildup to the real clay-court crown -- the French Open.

Players have argued it's difficult enough adjusting to the conditions in Madrid, without then having to change their game at Roland Garros at the end of the month.

"Players should be agreeing to the change -- there should be some value in what they say," Djokovic told reporters.

Ljubicic added that even when players did raise objections, they were ignored.

"Players were asked at the council meeting if they would support the idea of having blue clay courts. They clearly refused the idea -- only to see that the decision was made anyhow that the surface will be blue," he said.

The ATP has granted permission for a one-year trial of the tournament, and says it'll be taking into account players' feedback.

Judging by the response so far, Tiriac will have a battle on his hands to keep blue in 2013.
