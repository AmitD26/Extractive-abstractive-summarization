Sure, there have been runners since who have been more than capable of breaking the record. They just always came up short when it counted.

The record, though, was not the most pressing issue on Galen Rupp's mind when he stepped up to the starting line on a cool, crisp night last week at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon.

Rupp, who had already qualified for the 10,000 meters, was running against the Kenyan-born Bernard Lagat, a favorite.

Unseen, though, was another opponent: Prefontaine, whose presence decades after his death on May 30, 1975, at the age of 24, has loomed large over long distance running in the United States.

There are eerie similarities between Rupp and Prefontaine: Both were born and reared in Oregon, trained at the University of Oregon and later ran for the Oregon Track Club.

And both matured as runners following their first Olympic appearance. Rupp finished out of the medals in the 10,000 meters at the Beijing Games in 2008.

His following was huge by track standards, with thousands attending his races. At one point, an opponent donned a "Stop Pre" T-shirt to counter fans, dubbed "Pre's People," wearing "Go Pre" shirts.

By most accounts, he was a favorite to medal, if not win gold, at the 1976 Games in Montreal.

The crowd of thousands roared with the start of the race, just like they had decades earlier for Prefontaine's race.

"This is the only place in the country, possibly the world, that you're going to get that kind of reception for the 5,000," Rupp said later.

It wasn't surprising that Rupp led the last laps. The surprise was the finish, after Rupp was overtaken by Lagat in the final lap and then surged the final 20 meters to the finish line.

"To hear I got the record, that's unreal," Rupp told reporters shortly after the race.

"Anytime you're mentioned in the same breath as Steve Prefontaine, it's a huge compliment."

But more than that, Rupp's record-breaking run opens the door for U.S. long distance runners to be considered contenders at the London Olympics.

Maybe, just maybe, Rupp will bring home the medal that eluded Prefontaine.
