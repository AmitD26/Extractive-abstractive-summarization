(CNN) -- Shirley Manson recalls how Garbage came to call their new album "Not Your Kind of People."

"Butch came in one day and he said, 'I've got this title for a song that I think you're really going to like. It's we're 'Not Your Kind of People.' And I was like, 'Ooh yeah, I do love that title. Actually, I think that would make a great title for the record!'"

Manson was 28 when she burst out of the Madison, Wisconsin, music scene in 1995 with guitarist Steve Marker, bassist Duke Erikson and drummer Butch Vig. As the man who produced the Smashing Pumpkins' "Gish" and Nirvana's "Nevermind," Vig may have had the name, but it was Manson who became the face of Garbage: a flame-haired Scottish vixen who prowled the stage in boots and a minidress, taking "Stupid Girls" to task and pouting that she's "Only Happy When it Rains."

The group's subversive wit and sonic collision of pop, alternative rock and electronica placed them squarely outside the mainstream, yet it was the mainstream that embraced them. Over the course of four CDs, they sold 13 million albums worldwide.

She blamed many of those problems on their old record company.

"We were an indie band signed to an indie label, and then we got sold as a commodity to a major label that had very little interest in us, and it was a miserable experience for us."

Manson is now 45. With her signature red hair and creamy complexion, she's as appealing as she was in the mid-'90s. The new record picks up where Garbage left off seven years ago, not veering too far from their meticulously crafted layers of goth-tinged pop-rock.

"We took some time off. We just felt a little burnt out, if truth be told. And then I guess we just had enough life happen that we felt ready to create again," she said.

"I called the band up and said, 'Are you into this?' And they said, 'Yup! We're in. Let's do it.'"
