"It's not possible to cut down on food and ingredients because we're going to have friends and family over," she said.

The spending power of Akmalzen and 242 million other Indonesians shows why this secular Muslim nation is a bright spot in a darkening global economy. Thanks to strong economic demand, this emerging market was able to shake off sagging exports due to eurozone troubles and slowing demand from China. The latest figures Monday from Southeast Asia's largest economy showed Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.4% year-on-year last quarter.

Global Insight, an economics consulting firm, predicts the Indonesian economy will grow five-fold by 2030 to become a $4.5 trillion economy - roughly the size of Germany's economy today.

"That's very important -- not only does it mean Indonesia's GDP and per capita income are going to rise very substantially ... but also it's very important for the rest of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), because Indonesia is going to act as a growth driver for other ASEAN economies and for Asia regionally," Biswas said.

Experts also talk about spurring more equitable growth that reaches Indonesia's poorest.

"People look for tofu and soybean curd because that's what they eat. So for the poor, it's very difficult. If the prices are too high, who suffers? It's the poor," tofu vendor Haji Siti told CNN.

Consumer prices were up 4.5% percent last quarter from a year earlier. Despite the country's growing investment, its infrastructure lags behind other developing economies such as China.

"I'm very bullish but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't introduce policies that would both accelerate growth further and improve the quality of growth," said Milan Zavadjil, senior representative for the International Monetary Fund in Indonesia.

"Particularly more investment in infrastructure is absolutely essential to get rid of some of the current (traffic) bottlenecks, more investment in education to improve human skills and allow industry and other sectors to move up the value chain," Zavadjil said.
