(CNN) -- Chelsea has lodged a formal complaint with the Football Association after alleging referee Mark Clattenburg used "inappropriate language" towards John Obi Mikel during their Premier League defeat by Manchester United.

English FA to probe claims of racist abuse by referee in Chelsea match

"Following Sunday's Premier League game against Manchester United, club board members were quickly made aware, upon entering the home dressing room after the final whistle, that there were allegations of inappropriate language directed at Chelsea FC players by Mr Clattenburg during the game.

"Since reporting the matter to the delegate, the club and outside legal counsel have conducted further investigations. Having completed that process we have now followed the correct protocol and lodged a formal complaint with The FA regarding John Mikel Obi. There was not sufficient evidence to support a second claim to The FA with regard to the alleged verbal abuse of another first team player.

"We will cooperate fully with The FA and the Police as they each investigate the matter. As events on Sunday are now subject to those investigations we are unable to comment further until those processes are complete."

Meanwhile, Mikel played 45 minutes as Chelsea defeated Manchester United 5-4 in a thrilling Capital One Cup encounter.

Ryan Giggs gave United a 22nd minute lead before David Luiz equalized from the penalty spot to bring Chelsea level.

Javier Hernandez put the visitors back in front, his sixth goal in nine games against Chelsea, before Gary Cahill headed home a second equalizer.

Giggs netted a penalty to make it a nervy last couple of minutes but Chelsea held out to book a quarterfinal place against Leeds United.

Elsewhere, Tottenham suffered a 2-1 loss at Norwich after Clint Dempsey failed to score a last minute penalty.

Cup holder Liverpool was also beaten, going down 3-1 to Swansea.
