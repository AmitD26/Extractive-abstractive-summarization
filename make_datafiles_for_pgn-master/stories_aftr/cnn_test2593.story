Miami, Florida (CNN) -- The so-called "barefoot bandit" suspect will be sent to Washington state to face charges there, a federal judge in Miami, Florida, ruled Friday after Colton Harris-Moore waived his right to an extradition hearing.

He will be transferred in the next two weeks aboard a secure federal transportation service called "con air," said Barry Golden of the U.S. Marshals Service.

He appeared in Miami Federal Court Friday morning dressed in government-issued socks, sandals and shackles.  Before the hearing, the young defendant appeared relaxed and even shared a few laughs with another detainee.

Harris-Moore did not speak during the session, which was a continuation of his first appearance earlier this week.

The Washington attorney, John Henry Browne, on Friday filed the request to waive the extradition hearing so his client could be immediately transferred to Washington.  Magistrate Judge Robert L. Dube granted the request once he confirmed through the public defender that Harris-Moore has legal representation.

He was sought in a string of home and airport break-ins in various U.S. locations, along with thefts of vehicles.

In the Bahamas, Harris-Moore pleaded guilty to a charge of illegally landing a plane, paid a $300 fine and was ordered deported, his lawyer said. Police said the plane was a Cessna that was stolen in Indiana and flown to the Bahamas, where it was found in the shallows off Abaco Island.

Typically in extradition cases, the accused makes a first appearance in the federal court closest to where he was arrested, said Emily Langlie, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington. The Southern District of Florida, in Miami, is the closest jurisdiction to the Bahamas, she said.

A conviction on the charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.

"He seems to be very remorseful," Monique Gomez, a Bahamian lawyer who represented Harris-Moore in Nassau,  told CNN in a telephone interview.

Authorities in Madison County, Nebraska, issued an arrest warrant for Harris-Moore last month on charges of burglary and theft by unlawful taking or deception. The affidavit supporting the warrant alleges the youth waged a crime rampage.

The teen had been on the run since he escaped from a juvenile halfway house in Renton, Washington, in 2008. The FBI had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.
