However, the hunt is now presumed to be for a body rather than in the hope of finding April alive.

Bridger remains in custody and continues to be questioned, said Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan, of Dyfed-Powys Police.

Hundreds join desperate search

April's family has been told about Bridger's arrest on suspicion of murder, he said.

Scores of local volunteers from the small, close-knit community had been helping police and mountain rescue teams hunt for the girl in the town and surrounding hilly and wooded countryside.

April's parents spoke Tuesday of how the abduction of "our beautiful little girl April" had "shattered" the family.

There has been no trace of the pretty brown-haired child since she was last seen Monday evening, climbing into a vehicle that then drove off. She had been playing on her bicycle with a friend.
