Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Prosecutors are expected to rest their case Friday in the seven-week-long trial of model Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend and two doctors.

They are expected to call their last witness Friday afternoon. And defense lawyers said they will likely not call any witnesses.

Smith's boyfriend Howard K. Stern and two doctors are on trial for allegedly conspiring to feed her drug addiction and using false names to obtain the drugs.

One expert witness for the defense, a pain medications expert, has already testified for the defense. Dr. Perry Fine testified early because of scheduling issues.

Jurors watched a video on Wednesday of the Playboy model singing, kissing and bathing with her infant daughter just two months before her February 2007 death.

The defense does not deny Smith took a lot of drugs, but they contend Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor were treating her for chronic pain that other doctors had also diagnosed.

"I expect some charges will likely survive in some form," Perry said.

The three are charged with a conspiracy to provide drugs to a known addict and using false names on prescriptions for Smith.

They are not charged in her death, which a Florida medical examiner ruled was from an accidental overdose of a sleep aid, a lethal mix of prescription drugs and a viral flu.

While much of the past seven weeks have been tedious testimony about medical practices and drugs, the video shown in court Wednesday captured the jury's full attention.

"Love the water," Smith said to her child.

In one moment, Smith and Stern seemed to joke about their rivalry for the baby's attention.

They repeated that exchange several times before Stern said "She made a funny face, she pointed to the camera."
