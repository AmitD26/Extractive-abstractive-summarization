The report is so powerful that an administrator at Claremont McKenna College, a small, elite liberal arts school in California, submitted inflated data in order to enhance the college's standing.

Is anyone surprised by this revelation? Just as athletes use steroids and gambling happens at Rick's, colleges and universities succumb to their own set of pressures, including the desire to be on top in the rankings.

A college degree has become a 21st-century economic necessity. Getting into the "best" college is a national obsession. Many believe it's a passport to a golden future. Let's play a numbers game: 100 high school seniors each apply to 10 colleges; 1,000 applications are now in play. Each college hopes to enroll 10 students; 100 freshman spots are in the air. All of the 100 students will have a place to go to college but not every one will get into his or her first choice, nor will every college get its highest-ranked applicant.

To stand out from the crowd of applicants, students try to game the system. They take prep courses to improve their SAT scores; enroll in "easy" classes to get higher grades; search out exotic internships; and play sports or music, or master additional foreign languages -- not because they necessarily want to but because they believe they have to in order to look outstanding. This is an unfortunate outgrowth of an overwrought system.

And it should not be surprising to learn that schools also game the system by slicing and dicing their numbers in a fashion that makes them appear more appealing in one or more U.S. News category, and thus more attractive to potential students and their families.

Americans love lists and rankings. And if a person can start out at the top, then all the better. For many people, scarcity breeds adoration: Everyone wants to go to Harvard because not everyone can go to Harvard (nor should they).

As Super Bowl season comes to a close, we will sneak up on March Madness. There is an inexplicable correlation between the NCAA Final Four participants and increases in applications to those four schools. Everyone loves a winner. This is parallel to product placement in TV shows or movies. See James Bond drive an Aston-Martin and perhaps you'll come in to the showroom for a test drive. See Duke play basketball and perhaps you'll come to campus to meet Coach K.

Colleges must do a better job of educating applicants to the limits (and some values) of the rankings "racket." The public must remember that there is no 'best' college for any one student. After an hour's conversation, I'll give a student a list of 20 schools where he or she will (a) get an excellent education (b) have a wonderful time (c) be able to afford the tuition, and (d) graduate. And I'm pretty sure my list of 20 and U.S. News' list of 20 are not necessarily the same.

Is vichyssoise better than chicken soup with matzoh balls or just more satisfying to some people than to others? Frequently, it's a matter of taste more than nutrition.
