(CNN) -- The company at the center of a deadly meningitis outbreak was warned by its own environmental monitors of bacterial contamination of its facility months before the first cases were reported, a government report said Friday.

Clean rooms are intended to be sterile environments in which drugs are produced.

FDA warns higher-risk patients amid meningitis outbreak

Tainted medications from the compounding center have been blamed for the outbreak of fungal meningitis that has caused 25 deaths and 338 illnesses.

The FDA's preliminary findings were released following an inspection of the compounding center this month. In addition to documented reports of bacterial contamination, FDA investigators observed "greenish black foreign matter" and "white filamentous material" in vials of methylprednisolone acetate -- the steroid linked to the meningitis outbreak.

The FDA report comes the same week that the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy voted to revoke permanently the compounding center's license to operate in the state as well as the licenses of the company's three principal pharmacists.

A damning nine-page report released Tuesday by the same state board "identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public's health at risk."

Authorities were first alerted to the outbreak when a cluster of six rare fungal meningitis cases were reported in Tennessee on September 24. The patients shared several risk factors, including an epidural injection of a steroid -- methylprednisolone acetate 80 mg/ml preservative free -- that had been compounded at the center.

Since then, the outbreak has grown to 18 states.
