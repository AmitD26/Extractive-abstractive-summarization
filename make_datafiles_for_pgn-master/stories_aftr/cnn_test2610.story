Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Police in South Korea have detained a man suspected of abducting a 7-year-old girl from her home and raping her, local police officials said Friday.

The city's police officers called for backup and 160 personnel from nearby police stations joined the search for the girl, he said.

The girl was found at 12:55 p.m. Thursday on a sidewalk near a river in the city, according to Kim. She was naked, wrapped in a blanket and showed signs of having been raped, he said. She underwent an operation for organ damage, Kim added.

Body fluid samples have been taken to the Criminal Investigation Laboratory, according to Kim.

According to CNN affiliate YTN, Lee apologized for the authorities' failure to prevent the attack from taking place.

South Koreans responded with anger on social media to news reports about the case.

"The offender should get the highest punishment possible," a person using the name Yeonbang1996 said on Twitter. Others called specifically for the attacker to be castrated.

People over the age of 19 who have sexually offended against children under the age of 16 and are diagnosed with pedophilia can be subject to the treatment, according to the Justice Ministry.

Journalist Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report.
