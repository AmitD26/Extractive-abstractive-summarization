"Shared security and responsibility between respectful neighbors cannot be constructed by violating the law and violating trust," Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade said Tuesday.

"Mexico is convinced that the practice of espionage committed constitute a violation of norms, an abuse of the trust built between partnering countries and does not honor the historic friendship between our nations," he added.

Speaking in Geneva, Meade said he would summon U.S. Ambassador Anthony Wayne upon his return to Mexico.

His comments come days after Germany's Der Spiegel news magazine published allegations that the U.S. National Security Agency "systematically" eavesdropped on the Mexican government and hacked the public e-mail account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon.

On Sunday, Mexico's government said such spying would be unacceptable, illegitimate and against the law.

Mexico will also conduct its own investigation, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told reporters.

The new allegations drew a sharp response from Calderon in a series of Twitter posts on Monday.

"More than personal, it is an assault on the institutions of the country, given that it was done when I was the president," Calderon said. "I will be following the steps the Foreign Ministry takes to demand explanations from the United States and the corresponding account of responsibility."

The NSA said it would not "comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity, and as a matter of policy we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations.

U.S. spy chief says reports of NSA logging French phone calls are false

And on Monday, the U.S. ambassador to France met with French diplomats over allegations the NSA intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in the European nation over a 30-day period. Those allegations were reported by France's Le Monde newspaper, citing documents leaked by Snowden.

CNN has not independently verified the reports citing leaked documents by Snowden.
