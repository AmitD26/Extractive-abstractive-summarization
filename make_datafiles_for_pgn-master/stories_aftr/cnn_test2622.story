(CNN) -- When former Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner went on a vengeful killing spree this month, one couple found themselves under the protection of the same officers with whom they serve.

Phil and Emada Tingirides, a captain and sergeant in the LAPD, respectively, experienced moments of fear that stretched into days of uncertainty after Dorner killed four people and wounded three others as part of a vendetta against his former comrades.

Phil Tingirides was on the disciplinary board that terminated Dorner's employment with the police department in 2008, and was considered a primary target of Dorner's because his name appeared on a manifesto written by the renegade cop.

In the document, which announced his planned rampage, Dorner said nothing had changed in the LAPD since its scandals of the 1990s, the Rodney King beating and the Rampart police corruption case.

The Tingirides were among some 50 families that were placed under police protection because they were named as targets of Dorner's rage.

Phil Tingirides had never met Dorner before his disciplinary hearing years ago, and never spoke to him afterward. What a surprise for him, then, to be dragged into an unfolding nightmare this month.

"We shut the TV off after the first day," she said.

With television news ruled out, the family spent their time watching other channels and playing board games. Quality time, it turns out.

The 33-year-old former Navy officer holed up in a cabin after a shootout with law enforcement that left a sheriff's deputy dead and another wounded, McMahon said.

The cabin caught fire when police shot tear gas canisters into it.

On Tuesday, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said the department would review Dorner's firing and all the claims made in his manifesto.

The chief says the review is an act of transparency, to reassure the public that the department polices itself.

Beck also said a process is underway to determine how much reward money may be paid out, and to whom.
