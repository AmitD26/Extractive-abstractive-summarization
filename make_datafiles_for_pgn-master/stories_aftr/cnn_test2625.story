(CNN) -- Nora Ephron, the screenwriter and director whose sharp, edgy romantic comedies featuring strong women took her to the top ranks of a film industry mostly dominated by men, has died.

She was 71.

Ephron died Tuesday surrounded by relatives at a New York hospital, where she was undergoing treatment for acute myeloid leukemia, her family said in a statement.

She wore many hats: essayist, playwright, journalist, novelist, an Oscar-nominated screenwriter and a movie director.

An accomplished screenwriter, her romantic comedies featured strong but appealing characters who tackled relationship issues with a comic insight into their situations.

"An amazingly talented girl who was able to accomplish everything she set her mind to with great style and will be missed enormously," actor Martin Landau said in a statement.

Ephron also wrote and directed "Julie & Julia," which earned Meryl Streep a best actress Oscar nomination in 2010.

Ephron was born on May 19, 1941, into a family of writers.

Her parents, Henry and Phoebe Ephron, wrote screenplays for "Carousel," "Desk Set" and "There's No Business Like Show Business."

While her parents' works live on through movie rentals and classic film channels, perhaps the elder Ephrons' true legacy is their daughters.

Nora Ephron made her directorial debut with the 1992 comedy, "This Is My Life," which she co-wrote with her sister, Delia.

Both sisters also put together a production fashioned around Ilene Beckerman's best-selling book "Love, Loss and What I Wore."

Ephron believes her parents' humor was a big part of her productions.

She married screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi in 1987, eight years after she divorced investigative reporter Carl Bernstein. Her failed marriage to Bernstein was the basis of her book and movie, "Heartburn."

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Ephron's stories set in his city are classics.

"You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle," her romantic comedies starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, were among her movies that featured a lot of the city's iconic buildings as a backdrop.

It included "life is too short" and "location, location, location," an appropriate sentiment for a director whose romantic comedies focused on seizing the moment in major metropolitan cities.
