Supporters hope to pass the measure before Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine leaves office. Gov.-elect Christopher J. Christie, a Republican who takes office January 19, has said he opposes the bill.

On Thursday, a Senate vote on the legislation was postponed.

After hours of heated debate January 4, the bill passed the Assembly Appropriations Committee, 7-4, and the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, 8-6. Both votes were along party lines.

If signed into law, the bill would be the 11th of its kind. There are similar laws in California, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Washington.

New Jersey Assemblyman Samuel Thompson, a Republican, said the bill discriminates against U.S. citizens who attend New Jersey colleges and universities but don't live in the state. Thompson believes illegal immigrants do not have the right to a reduced tuition.

"You can call it undocumented, you can call it whatever you want. But you are not legal and you are not entitled," Thompson said.

Assemblywoman Valerie Huttle, a Democrat, expressed frustration with misconceptions of the bill that label it as a "free ride" or "state-funded" education.

"These students have been here for decades, have gone through the school system here and should pay the same as their counterparts who have gone through school with them," she said.

Assemblyman Michael Carroll, a Republican, questioned the validity of a bill that improves illegal immigrants' access to education when their illegal status prohibits them from giving back to the state in a meaningful way.

However, proponents of the bill believe that the young students will be resources for the state. Democrats say that the backlog in applications for citizenship is the real culprit and that the controversy highlights the need for immigration reform on a national level.

Thompson had blunt words for immigrants whose illegal status he felt nullified their right to education, "Go back home, apply, come legally, and I'll welcome you with open arms."

However, students who have lived illegally with their families in the United States see the opportunities the bill would give them. One such student -- Aura, who would only give her first name -- has been praised by teachers for her high grades.

"This bill would just make our school dream possible. They're not giving it to us for free," said Aura, who is now a U.S. citizen. "If they open up this channel for us, we'll do the rest."

To qualify, immigrants must be enrolled, must apply for legal status or say they'll do so
