Why is Cyprus facing financial problems?

In a March 16 statement on the agreement, the Eurogroup -- an informal body of eurozone finance ministers -- said the "current fragile situation of the Cypriot financial sector" was linked to its large size relative to the country's GDP. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said Cyprus' banking sector was more than five times the size of GDP and the group predicted that the island's public debt would reach 100% of GDP in 2020.

The money would be used to prop up Cypriot banks that were badly exposed to the financial crisis in Greece. The Financial Times reported that the depositor levy was demanded by a German-led group of creditor countries to bring down the bailout's price tag from €17 billion ($22B).

British Chancellor George Osborne told the BBC on March 17 that the UK government would compensate any of its military or civil servants serving in Cyprus affected by the levy.

On Tuesday, the Cypriot parliament soundly rejected a €10 billion bailout offer from the European Union because of public outcry over the proposed tax on bank deposits. In trying to convince Cypriots to support the EU deal, President Nicos Anastasiades warned that the alternative --- bankruptcy, exit from the euro and devaluation -- would be even more painful. After the vote, Germany's finance minister said that European officials were disappointed. "Cyprus has a banking sector that is way too big and they are insolvent with that model and no one outside of Cyprus is at fault for that," Wolfgang Schaeuble said on German public broadcaster, ZDF.

Anastasiades and the leaders of Cyprus' political parties will now meet on Wednesday to try to hash out an alternative plan, but they'll have to come up with a workable solution quickly. Banks are due to open Thursday for the first time this week and the chance of a run on deposits is high.

Will any deal a precedent for other European countries?

It is the first time in the EU. In 2001, the IMF released a report on bank debit taxes that had been imposed in Latin America -- however, these taxes were on financial transactions not an outright grab as is being proposed in Cyprus.

Won't this cause a run on banks?

At least 35 banks from around the world have branches in Cyprus, according to the country's central bank. Cyprus' parliament needs to approve the deal but Cypriots rushed to withdraw their savings from bank ATMs after news of the plan. CNN's Isa Soares said some banks were already refusing to release cash or putting limits on withdrawals. Cyprus has extended its Monday bank holiday until Thursday. Writing for CNNMoney, Brookings Institution fellow Douglas J. Elliot said there was a "grave risk" that the bank levy would "eventually lead to serious bank runs in other parts of the eurozone."

What will happen if a revised deal doesn't go through?

In an address to the nation on March 17, President Nicos Anastasiades said the bailout option was "very difficult" but one that would eventually lead to economic recovery in Cyprus. He said failure to agree to the package would "lead to disorderly bankruptcy as a result of the decision of the European Central Bank to immediately discontinue the provision of emergency assistance to preserve the liquidity of the two large banks." This would have meant depositors would have lost access to their deposits, and a large number would have faced significant losses, he said. This would mean depositors will lose access to their deposits, and a large number will face significant losses, he said.

What's Russia's involvement?

Nearly a third of the money in Cyprus' banks is Russian, CNNMoney reported. It said a 10% corporate tax -- half that of Russia's -- meant Russian firms had been using it as a tax haven since the early 1990s. The top proposed levy could result in a $3 billion loss for Russian citizens.

Cyprus' finance minister was due to meet his Russian counterpart later Wednesday.
