(CNN) -- The WBO said Wednesday it will review Timothy Bradley's controversial victory over Manny Pacquiao at the welterweight title fight.

Saturday night's split decision rocked many who follow boxing and Pacquiao's home country of the Philippines.

Two of the ringside judges had the fight 115-113 for Bradley while the other judge scored it 115-113 for Pacquiao.

Bradley, a native of Cathedral City, California, remained unbeaten with 29 wins, along with one no-contest.

Pacquiao suffered his first loss since 2005.

Now, the question is what Bradley's win or Pacquiao's loss will mean for boxing. After the bout, both announced they were interested in a rematch. Many fans have called for a potential showdown between Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr.

"People were in shock and disbelief," said Lito Tacujan, sports editor of the Manila-based Philippine Star daily. "Everybody felt furious with the result. They thought the match result was set up or scripted."
