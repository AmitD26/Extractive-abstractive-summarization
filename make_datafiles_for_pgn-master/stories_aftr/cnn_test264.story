Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- An anti-government protest leader was shot to death Sunday as demonstrators blocked a voting station in Bangkok, police said.

Protesters have been calling for the democratically elected Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to step down. They want to replace her administration with an unelected "people council," which would see through electoral and political changes.

On Friday, a Thai court ruled that elections scheduled for next month could be postponed.

Thararin's death came after anti-government protesters blocked a voting station and shut it down after officials agreed to suspend the voting, police said.

Meanwhile, more than 45 out 50 polling stations have been closed due to obstructions by opposition protesters from the PDRC, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Surapong Tovijakchaikul said.
