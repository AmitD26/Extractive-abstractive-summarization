(TIME.com) -- The month in which babies are born can affect how their immune systems develop, and even how vulnerable they are to autoimmune diseases.

Now a study published in JAMA Neurology shows that this hunch may be correct, and suggests a mechanism for how the vitamin might be driving immune system development.

Researchers in the UK studied 50 babies born in London in May and 50 babies born in November between 2009 and 2010. They sampled blood from the newborns' umbilical chords and recorded levels of vitamin D and a specific type of immune cell known as autoreactive T-cells.

T-cells are the white blood cells that battle pathogens like bacteria and viruses, but autoreactive T-cells are aberrant versions that mistake the body's own cells as foreign and attack them as they would an unwanted infection.

So it's not clear yet whether supplements of vitamin D could help to lower rates of the disease â€” especially for those conceived in July and born in May. In fact, experts continue to debate how much vitamin D is appropriate for otherwise healthy people when it comes to preventing disease, since studies on the subject are conflicting. The Institute of Medicine currently recommends that adults get about 600 IU daily.

More research is needed to figure out whether pregnant women might need to take more vitamin D in order to strengthen their babies' immune systems, but doctors now have a better understanding of what birth months have to do with how the immune system develops.
