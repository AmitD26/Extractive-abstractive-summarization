(CNN) -- New York's attorney general wrote NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday, urging him to firmly state that potential players won't be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation.

NFL to investigate whether Nick Kasa was asked about sexual orientation

In February, Nick Kasa, who played tight end at the University of Colorado, told CNN that during the combine he was asked: "Do you have a girlfriend? Are you married? Do you like girls?"

"Those kind of things, and it was kind of weird," he told CNN. "But like they would ask you with a straight face, and it's a pretty weird experience altogether." Kasa did not say who asked him those questions.

University of Michigan quarterback Denard Robinson told a sports radio talk show that he was asked whether he had a girlfriend.

On Thursday, Aiello reiterated the league's position that all teams must follow federal and state employments laws.

The combine is a skills audition for NFL general managers and coaches to evaluate players before the draft, which this year will be held April 25 to 27.

The National Football League is based in New York.
