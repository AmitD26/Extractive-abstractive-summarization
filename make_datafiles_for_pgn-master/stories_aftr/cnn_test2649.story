Saturday's attack, Karzai said, shows "that Taliban want longer presence of foreigners -- not their departure from Afghanistan."

'No reason to support instability'

Dunford took exception to that characterization.

"President Karzai has never said to me that the United States was colluding with the Taliban. All I can do is speak for the coalition to tell you that it's categorically false, and that we have no reason to be colluding with the Taliban," he said.

Dinner to smooth things over

On Sunday, several hours after Karzai made his remarks, he met with U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel over dinner in the Afghan capital.

The meeting was an attempt to smooth over the latest dispute in the already strained relationship between the two allies.

Hagel told reporters he tried to reassure Karzai that the United States had no unilateral back-channel talks with the Taliban.

"The fact is, any prospect for peace or political settlements -- that has to be led by the Afghans. That has to come from the Afghan side," Hagel said. "Obviously, the United States will support efforts if they are led by the Afghans to come to some possible resolution."

Hagel, a former senator who took the helm at the Pentagon last month, made his first trip to Afghanistan as defense secretary.

Karzai, meanwhile, has been increasingly critical of American forces in recent months.

While there have been reconciliation talks in the past, the United States has not said any such talks are currently underway with the Taliban.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack at the Afghan defense ministry in Kabul, which killed at least nine people and wounded 14 others.

A Taliban spokesman expressed pleasure with Hagel's proximity at the time, calling the attack "a message to him."

ISAF rejected suggestions that the Taliban even knew of Hagel's trip when they planned the operation.

Tensions ahead of pullout

Afghanistan's National Security Council, chaired by Karzai, recently accused "armed individuals named as U.S. special force" of torturing and murdering innocent people in Wardak province. The government demanded members of the elite U.S. military units leave the province west of Kabul.

But the council also said the United States rejected such suggestions.

U.S. military officials said all allegations of misconduct are taken seriously, and that the military was looking into the allegation.

Last year, Karzai called for U.S. troops to pull out of outposts in Afghan villages and return to their main bases.

In October, he complained the United States was failing to supply Afghan forces with weapons needed to fight insurgents.
