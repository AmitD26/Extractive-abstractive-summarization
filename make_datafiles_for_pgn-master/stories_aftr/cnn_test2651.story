(CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws.

There's a perception that California has "more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded," said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health.

Californians have a stake in their health and the environment, because they want to enjoy the state's natural landscape, said several people interviewed for the article.

"What brings many people to California is the climate and the culture," said Matt Rodriquez, California's Secretary for Environmental Protection. "That means people who do come here have an interest in preserving ... a beautiful environment, clean air and clean water."

The willingness to innovate in health laws is part of the California's culture, said Marice Ashe, founder and executive director of Public Health Law & Policy in Oakland, California.

Since California started allowing ballot initiatives in 1911, its voters have swept in many several pioneering health laws.

One of California's biggest examples of its influence on public health law is tobacco regulation. In 1988, voters approved a proposition to become the first state to tax cigarettes to fund a tobacco control program. Ten years later, California banned smoking in public places such as trains, planes, buses, workplaces and restaurants. Now, about half of the states have similar policies about smoking in public places.

The state also has a long history of limiting air pollution. California was the first state to ban a chemical used in laundromats called perchloroethylene, prohibit leaded gasoline, require smog checks and reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The state's air resource board passed another rule in January requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and putting more zero-emission vehicles on the road.

California, home to more than 37 million people and the world's ninth-largest economy, has major clout.

In certain cases, California laws have gone too far, according to the courts. Last year, the Supreme Court struck down a California law that would have banned selling violent video games to children. The state asserted that it had a legal obligation to protect children from graphic interactive images, but the court ruled the law violated the First Amendment.

California's cities often grab headlines with health-oriented initiatives. The City of Los Angeles recently passed a law requiring all adult film workers to use condoms to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Pornography filmmakers have responded by threatening to move elsewhere.

Santa Clara County, located in northern California, became the first to ban fast- food restaurants from handing out give free trinkets with their kid's meals in 2010. San Francisco quickly passed a similar law and New York City's leaders have also indicated interest.

"The amount of cultural and income diversity in the state, the huge size of low-income population puts health equity to test here," said Ashe, a lawyer who specializes in public health issues. "We are not the healthiest state despite innovations; we have challenges that we embrace and try to offer solutions."

Pearce, author of "Crazifornia: Tales from the Tarnished State" said all the regulations have hurt California's economy. The state has lost manufacturing jobs and companies because of too much regulation, he said. For years, California has faced budget shortfalls, and its governor, Jerry Brown, is now calling for tax increases in sales and high-end income.

"It's a love-hate," Pearce said about his views of California. "There's so much to the government, it drives me a little crazy."

Ashe said people who blame regulations for economic woes don't see the bigger picture.

"People love to beat up on the nanny state and point a finger at regulation," said Ashe. For example, she said that not regulating air quality means more people would have health problems such as heart disease and asthma.

"If we don't do something, we are costing the state untold billions of dollars," she said. "It'd be worse without protection."
