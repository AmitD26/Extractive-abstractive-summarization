The game opens back on Pandora, a planet with a Wild West mentality and penchant for outlaw justice. It begins five years after the ending of "Borderlands" and the opening of the Vault, a location of rumored riches that actually contained a huge alien beast with massive jaws and multiple tentacles.

The writing team at Gearbox Software really delved deep into each character, making them unique and giving them purpose. Players can connect with them and that sense of immersion raises the level of "Borderlands 2" from just a simple shooter to something more.

Dialog from the characters helps cement that attachment, as well as providing some comedic moments.

Some of the death screams of enemies are almost "Monty Python-esque" and the humor helps take the edge off all the dying and suffering that goes on around you.

Banter between characters is laugh-out-loud funny. Serious soldiers have lighthearted moments and comedic foils are portrayed in serious moments. The range is what you'd expect from real people, not typical one-dimensional game characters.

The story progresses through a mission/quest based system. There is the main quest (beat Jack, save the day), but there are numerous side missions that help raise your experience while helping you understand what's going on with Pandora. Interaction with other characters is a must.

"Borderlands 2," like its predecessor, is all about the loot -- specifically weapons. There are hundreds of different weapon configurations to be found or bought.

Do you keep a pistol because it does acid damage or opt for the shotgun with more power? The choices can be exhausting, but can really be tailored to fit your style of play.

There are boxes containing loot at nearly every turn. Unless you are in open terrain, it's hard not to find one of these boxes around. Players will get overwhelmed by the amount of treasure they find and will, at times, have to leave some behind because they can't carry it all. You'll sell off a lot, but end up spending that money on more ammo or better shields.

And nearly every enemy you kill will drop something. Makes you wonder where that spider-ant is hiding that sniper rifle, but hey, he obviously doesn't need it anymore.

Oh, and outhouses scattered throughout Pandora are real treasure chests. I guess people didn't notice they were dropping their weapons as they were taking care of business.

The customization extends from the armory into the player characters themselves. There are four characters to choose from.

Characters can also be visually customized. Change your character's head or clothes and you can still stand out in a crowd of Zeros.

Graphically, the game looks and plays like "Borderlands." Controls are basically the same with only a few changes. Environments are noticeably different, though, looking sharper and more vibrant than before. There are also barrels full of acid, electricity, explosives and the like on battlefields, so make use of them to take care of large groups of enemies.

"Borderlands 2" took what was fun from "Borderlands" and added interesting characters with a range of emotions, and a deep, telling storyline worth following. You'll laugh, you'll get angry and you are likely to grip your controller a bit tighter as the tension mounts.
