(CNN) -- It didn't take Maria Sharapova long to find a new coach.

The coaching shuffle comes about two weeks after the U.S.-based Russian was upset by qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito in the second round at Wimbledon.

"Due to personal issues, (Hogstedt) was not able to travel in the near future and we both agreed it was the right time to move our separate ways," the world No. 2 had said. "I am very thankful for all his work and wish him much success in the future."

When his playing days were over, Connors kept a relatively low profile and mostly stayed away from tennis circles. That changed when he decided to work with a slumping Andy Roddick in 2006.

The move paid instant dividends for Roddick, as he reached the U.S. Open final two months later. Their association lasted two years, with Roddick saying he resigned.

It was under Hogstedt, a former touring pro from Sweden, that Sharapova completed her grand slam collection last year at the French Open.

Sharapova's movement noticeably improved under Hogstedt -- adding to her fierce ground strokes and intense desire to win.

But their last tournament together didn't go as planned, with Sharapova slipping twice on the grass at Wimbledon against Larcher de Brito and suffering her earliest grand slam exit in three years.

Hogstedt left Li Na to work with Sharapova at the end of 2010, with the Chinese baseliner then reaching the final at the Australian Open while Sharapova crashed out in the fourth round.

Li, the French Open winner in 2011, has the same agent as Sharapova in Max Eisenbud.

Sharapova formerly worked with Michael Joyce and her father, Yuri.

Earlier this week, another former No. 1, Ana Ivanovic, severed ties with Nigel Sears, the father of Andy Murray's girlfriend.
