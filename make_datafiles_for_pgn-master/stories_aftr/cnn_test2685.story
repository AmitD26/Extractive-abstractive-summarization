After a lengthy investigation, authorities dropped the charges in November.

The district attorney and police were still investigating the case, and would not "make any further statements that might compromise that investigation," Gibbons added at the time.

Last Wednesday, Sheahen filed a complaint against the LAPD seeking unspecified punitive damages and the reimbursement of $100,000 in legal expenses.

Attorney Sheahen said the suit against the LAPD claims false arrest, malicious prosecution and civil rights violations.

"It was their complete lack of training and over-zealousness. The LAPD seemed motivated by their own twisted need for publicity," said Sheahen.

"They did not go by the book. They alerted the media to the arrest. It was just bizarre how the LAPD went on about it."

As of Monday, the LAPD had not received a copy of the lawsuit, according to LAPD Sgt. Albert Gonzalez.

Sheahen described Goodman as "the dean of the tennis officials."

"She's a really respected lady in her field, at home and in temple and that why the charges were even more outrageous," he added.
