"Each child has to be recognized as an individual girl," Cameron said. "To make it concurrent would diminish what happened to those young girls."

Schaffhausen and his wife Jessica had recently divorced when he came to spend the day with his daughters last year.

"Aaron Schaffhausen, the man who helped genetically make those girls and shape them ... Aaron became the darkness, the boogeyman, and the monster under the bed," Stotz said. "He was so evil that he took their unconditional love for him and used their love to lure them close enough so he could kill them. Their last memory is what an evil killer their dad was."

Schaffhausen sat through the proceedings with no visible emotion, avoiding eye contact and almost inaudibly saying "no" when the judge asked him if he had anything to say.

His attorney, John Kucinski, emphasized that his client suffered from a "rare mental illness" who committed a "rare catathymic homicide."

"Nobody wins in this case," Kucinski said. "Both families suffer, Jessica suffers, uncles, aunts.

A large photograph of the sisters stood by the judge, who finished his sentencing by saying, "People in general, there is sometimes an evil, and there is goodness," Cameron said.

The girls' aunt remembered them as "amazing people."
