(CNN) -- She's the sea turtle that didn't want to get away.

A rehabilitated Georgia sea turtle who never seemed to want to return to the ocean is finally getting a permanent home -- serving as her species' newest ambassador at Sea World.

The loggerhead sea turtle named Caton has spent the past three years at the Georgia Sea Turtle Center on Jekyll Island after being found stranded in 2009 and diagnosed as severely debilitated.

Staff brought her back to the center and tried to release her again months later, but Caton just swam back and forth in shallow water, then got stuck on a sandbar.

Their hopes for Caton's new life were dashed a week later, however, when she was found stranded on a Jekyll Island beach. She had swum back and didn't want to leave.

A lucky loggerhead turtle survives the odds

"For these reasons, we consider her unreleasable," said the center's director, Terry Norton. "The center receives injured and ill sea turtles for rehabilitation purposes, but some of these turtles have permanent issues and are deemed unreleasable back to the wild. If an unreleasable sea turtle can survive comfortably in a captive setting, the center will make every attempt to place the turtle in a suitable facility."

Human activity also poses problems for the reptiles' recovery. Besides pollution, boat strikes and coastal development, the turtles can get caught in fishing nets or crushed by fishing dredges that are dragged along the ocean floor.
