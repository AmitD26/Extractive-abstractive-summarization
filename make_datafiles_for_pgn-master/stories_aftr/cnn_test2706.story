(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel has already won the 2013 Formula One world championship -- at least that's the view of his Ferrari rivals, despite there being six races left this season.

Despite an encouraging race which saw Alonso finish in second place after starting seventh on the grid, team principal Stefano Domenicali declared that Ferrari will be prioritizing 2014 between now and the end of the current season.

"Now it's clear that 99% of our energies will be concentrated on the 2014 project," Domenicali told Ferrari's official website.

"We still have some new parts for the car that we will bring to the coming races but, above all, we will now try to make the most out of what we already have."

Next season Alonso will be partnered by Kimi Raikkonen, the current Lotus driver who was the last man to win the drivers' championship for Ferrari in 2007.

Alonso hopes a raft of new technical regulations which will be introduced to the sport next season will benefit Ferrari.

"We started (the season) in a good way," the 32-year-old, who is without a grand prix win since May, told the BBC.

"We won in China, we won in Spain and then we seemed to lose a little bit of performance, especially when the 2012 tires came back.

"For next year, we start from zero. Really we will put all our effort and hopes into 2014, because starting from zero is our best opportunity to close the gap with all the top teams."
