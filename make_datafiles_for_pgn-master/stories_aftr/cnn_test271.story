(CNN) -- Serena Williams is through to her ninth Miami Masters final after beating Maria Sharapova at Crandon Park on Thursday.

Defending champion Williams trailed early on in the match before powering her way past her Russian opponent in straight sets 6-4 6-3.

Sharapova had worked an early lead, breaking in the fourth game of the opening set and led 4-1 at one stage.

But her advantage was short-lived as Williams reeled off five games in a row to close out the set.

The fourth seed broke Williams again in the second game of the second set to steal an early advantage, but any momentum gained was immediately lost as the world No. 1 broke back in the very next game.

Further breaks in the seventh and finally the ninth game sealed Sharapova's fate, dashing hopes that she could break her duck in a tournament where she has finished runner-up on five occasions.

"It wasn't easy," Williams said afterwards. "Obviously Maria plays really well, and she's done really well here, so I just decided I had to do a little better, stay focused and make more shots."

The 32-year-old is seeking to end a run of nine consecutive defeats against Williams, the last of which was in the final of last season's WTA Championships.

The Spaniard needed to come from behind against big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic, winning 4-6 6-2 6-4 in two hours and 35 minutes.

Nadal has a 16-match winning streak against Berdych, who will return to the top five in the rankings after earlier battling past Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-4 7-6 (7/3) in the third quarterfinal.

It was the Czech's 450th ATP Tour victory, making him just the ninth active player to achieve that milestone.

"He was a very tricky opponent," said Berdych. "Even the conditions were not the perfect way that I really like. It was quite windy, so it was a little bit more difficult. But I handled it quite well."
