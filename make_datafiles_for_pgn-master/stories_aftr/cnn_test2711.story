Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate on Wednesday passed a Democratic plan to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for middle income Americans while rejecting a Republican alternative to continue all of the cuts -- twin votes that help to crystallize the position of the two parties on a critical issue heading into the fall campaign.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, pledged in a written statement after the votes to "stop the tax hike," and insisted Republicans are the only ones addressing the "threat to our economy."

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus blasted Democrats for backing a "disastrous plan to raise taxes on small businesses and job creators" while putting "their tax-and-spend agenda ahead of creating jobs."

The U.S. economy "isn't built from the top down, it's built from a strong and growing middle class, and that's who we should be fighting for," he declared.

Wednesday's votes were primarily about political positioning in the heat of the 2012 election season, as well each party's opening bid in what is sure to be a frenzied legislative negotiating session this autumn. The economy is approaching a so-called "fiscal cliff" brought on by the looming expiration of several tax cuts as well as the approach of a series of mandatory spending cuts.

"At the end of the day this (legislative maneuvering) isn't going to solve the problem. It's going to be political posturing all the way up to the November election," said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida.

Republicans argue that any tax hikes could derail what is already considered a weak recovery.

Opinion: Taxmageddon is headed our way

After Senate leaders jockeyed for days over procedural issues tied to consideration of the bills, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, unexpectedly announced Wednesday morning that Republicans would agree to Democratic demands and hold back-to-back votes requiring neither side to garner a filibuster-proof 60-vote margin.

McConnell's decision gave the Democrats bragging rights, allowing them to tout the fact that their bill is capable of passing the Senate. But it also gave Republicans the ability to put several centrist Democratic senators on the spot, forcing those Democrats to vote for a politically contentious plan that raises taxes on certain Americans.

For their part, Democrats point to polling that shows a majority of Americans support their approach.
