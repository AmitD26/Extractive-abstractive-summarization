That's one big question on the minds of the legions of fans of "The Walking Dead" going into the fourth season premiere on Sunday.

Last season, the show ranked as the No. 1 scripted show on television, a first for cable, and certainly something no one would have predicted for a series about a zombie apocalypse.

The show returns with new showrunner Scott Gimple and without the latest victims of the walkers: Andrea, Merle and Milton. (There's also the promise of a spinoff set in a different location during the apocalypse, due to arrive in 2015.)

Hurd: As we like to say, Rick spent a little time in "Crazytown" last season. But he's always someone who will step up if necessary. This season, he's in a very different place. He realizes that perhaps the most important role in the zombie apocalypse is that of a good father. He needs to raise Carl not to be a trigger-happy child soldier, and his baby, Judith, he's taking that responsibility very seriously.

Hurd: We definitely get a sense that he is out there. No one has forgotten and forgiven what he's done. Some people have moved on. As to what he's up to, as the season develops, we'll certainly get some insights into that. I can't say when we'll find out, but we'll find out. The Governor is pretty formidable. We know he's out there, and he's not one to give up a grudge.

CNN: With a good number of the original main characters deceased, we're seeing the possibilities of new characters emerging, like the Woodbury survivors now living in the prison.

Hurd: Some of the people are already significant characters in the comic book, people like Tyreese. We didn't have enough bandwidth last season to spend much time getting to know him. Now we have the time to do that. We will also explore those who used to live in Woodbury.

Hurd: What hasn't changed is they haven't developed into super-fast walkers. We have very much the same rules for them, but some of them are more desiccated than ever. They're more ravenous than ever, and there are a lot more of them. We'll get to see how that plays out very quickly.

CNN: What is showrunner Scott Gimple bringing to the new season?

Hurd: Scott Gimple has been in the writers' room since season two. So he's someone who is very deep into the show. He was a fan of the comic book from the time it came out, and it's celebrating its 10th anniversary. What he focuses on incredibly well is the juxtaposition between the epic scope of a zombie apocalypse -- which people will see very quickly in the first episode of the new season -- and making sure that with our characters this season, we'll see how they handle escalating threats, as well as what decisions they make, both for themselves, the people they love and their allegiance to the group.

CNN: Of course, there are a few characters in particular that hold a lot of interest for the fans. What's the status of Glenn and Maggie's relationship?

CNN: And of course, Daryl Dixon's following has taken on a life of its own. Will Daryl fans be satisfied this season?
