South Africans are happy to have the World Cup, but worried about crime during the event.

Official statistics from the country show violent crime is a major issue, with more than 17,000 murders and almost 137,000 serious and violent assaults recorded in 2007.

Overall, 88% of people said they were "proud" that South Africa was hosting the 2010 event.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter said security at the event would be very tight.

"Through the competition, there will be extremely tight security, just as there is at the Olympic Games and other huge sporting events. We hope that this security will be maintained after the World Cup in order to ensure that we have left a legacy," Blatter said.

One thousand people were questioned for the FIFA survey.
