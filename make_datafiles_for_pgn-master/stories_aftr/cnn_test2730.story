(CNN) -- How do you dispose of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles? Call in private industry.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced Friday it has invited chemical disposal firms to let the group know if they're interested, but added that it's working on a tight schedule.

The request for "expressions of interest" comes a week after the organization's executive council asked its director-general to explore "options for destruction in chemical disposal facilities" of chemicals that Syria has declared.

The companies will also destroy the effluent resulting from the "effective destruction" of higher-priority chemicals.

A joint OPCW-United Nations team charged with overseeing the destruction of the weapons began inspecting sites in October. The U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized the mission set a deadline of mid-2014 for Syria to destroy its chemical weapons or face consequences.

The U.N. resolution on Syria's chemical weapons was based on a deal struck between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb. U.S. officials said at least 1,400 people died in the attack. Syria denied responsibility, blaming rebel forces.

In an update last Friday, the OPCW said it had verified that more than 60% of Syria's declared unfilled munitions had been destroyed. Syria has committed to destroy all unfilled warheads and bombs by January 31.

Opposition factions unite

"This will change and it will increase our numbers and unify our ideology," said Capt. Islam Alloush, a spokesman for the Islamic Army, an alliance member, in an interview with CNN. "We are optimistic that this will make us stronger."

The moves come after the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant succeeded as the predominant military force in northern Syria, marginalizing and even fighting Syria's more moderate factions.

ISIS's largely foreign fighting force poses a threat to cash-strapped rebel groups competing for funding, resources and influence in Syria's more than two-year civil war.

The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement and is now a full-blown civil war. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict.
