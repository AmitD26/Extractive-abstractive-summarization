"Right now, my mom can only see things that I post. She can't see anything I'm tagged in or anything that my friends say to me on my profile," said Carly, a high school senior who asked to be identified only by her first name. "She doesn't know that, though. I'm like, 80% sure that every other teenager has done that too."

With teen-agers and their parents (grandparents, even) increasingly active on social networks, both generations are joined in a delicate dance over privacy, safety and freedom of expression online.

Parents, meanwhile, are grappling with how to monitor their kids' online activity and keep them safe without being stifling or intrusive. And both are seeking ways to coexist peacefully on the few social networks they do share.

Reputation is everything

Pew found that teens have developed a variety of ways to control their privacy. They are comfortable navigating Facebook's notoriously complicated privacy settings, and only 14% have public-facing Facebook profiles. They also edit what appears on their profile, deleting posts, comments and unwanted tags.

For teens looking to hide social-media activity from adults, elaborate privacy settings can sometimes be unnecessary. Fifty-eight percent of teens said they posted updates that were inside jokes or coded messages that only certain friends would understand.

Seeking out new online homes

Many teens are learning how to compartmentalize the different parts of their lives online. Facebook is the most popular site for both teens and parents, according to Pew, but teens reported "waning enthusiasm" in the site in Pew focus groups. They cited the colonization of the site by adults and excessive amounts of "drama."

Many teens are also on Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Vine and Pinterest -- sites where they report feeling less social pressure and more freedom to express themselves. Twitter has seen rapid growth among young users, while Vine, with its looping six-second videos, is a creative form of messaging for a visually oriented generation.

Even straight-laced LinkedIn is courting teenagers. Earlier this month the social media site for professionals lowered its minimum age to 14 from 18 and announced special new pages for universities, hoping to edge into the college-selection process.

Some kids and parents say they have worked out ways to share social networks harmoniously.

According to the recent Pew study, only 5% of teens reported setting up filters for their parents, and the majority (70%) are friends with their parents on Facebook.

"Her ground rule for me is to not comment on her friends' comments unless they are directed to me, and not to tag her in photos without her consent," said LaRue, who lives in Baldwinsville, New York.

Along the same lines, Carly's mom will tag her daughter in photos and like her posts, but she doesn't comment much because she knows it's embarrassing to her daughter.

Carly, for her part, tries to keep it clean.

"I really try to not have any pictures of me from any parties or any captions/comments with swear words ... but it's hard to be 100% clean when your entire life is online," she said.
