Washington (CNN) -- As the country goes into the weekend with the government shut down and neither side talking, there seems to be little hope for breaking the impasse any time soon.

And with the days ticking down toward the moment the country runs out of options to meet its debt obligations, the head-butting over funding the government might force Congress to try to work out a deal to get it running again and raise the debt ceiling at the same time.

Q: CNN and others reported that House Speaker John Boehner said to Republicans in private meetings that he will get something passed to avoid defaulting on the U.S. financial obligations, even if it takes putting something together that would attract Democrats. Did he blink?

What is he doing? He's sending an early signal that, ladies and gentlemen of the Republican caucus, 'we are not going to be part of defaulting.'

There's still a huge question of how you get there, though, because the speaker will continue to insist no raising the debt ceiling without getting something from the administration -- on spending cuts, on spending levels, on reforms in the most expensive government programs. And the president, of course, is on the record saying 'I won't negotiate.' You can reconcile those two positions by doing it in a couple of sequenced steps.

It's an optimistic statement from the speaker that we won't default, but getting from "A" to the finish line is still complicated.

King: Sometimes at the bleakest moment is when something can be pulled -- a rabbit you pull out of a hat, if you will. However, when you talk to people in both parties and top aides close to all of the people involved, from the White House to the Republicans and the Democrats on Capitol Hill, most just don't see an environment because of the distrust, because of the looming political calendar of 2014 for a big grand bargain that does Medicare, Social Security, tax reform, other entitlements, other spending cuts in the government.

The question is can you get the government re-opened, raise the debt ceiling and then do those things? Will the Republicans trust the Democrats to do that? Or because of the suspicions, will you have the revolt?

Q: Mitch McConnell's and Rand Paul's hot mic moment was instructive in showing the disconnect between what they are supposed to be doing and what they want to be doing. What does it mean to you to overhear this?

Crowley: It certainly is a signal to the House. We had heard Rand Paul say publicly 'we're not going to be able to get rid of Obamacare.' But it's a great starting position. We have had, in particular in the Senate, a lot of Republican senators saying shutting down the government is a bad idea, it won't work for Republicans politically.

Q: Why is Boehner not bringing up this vote for a resolution? What do you believe is behind it? Is he not doing this because he's worried about losing face or his job? Why is there no vote?

There are Republicans that are always going to vote against it because it doesn't do anything about Obamacare, should a clean CR come up. There may not be the votes at the moment.

Q: On the debt ceiling, what are you hearing -- on the one hand, Rep. Steve King says it's not that big a deal, that it's false demagoguery. On the other, Boehner says he won't let the country default on its obligations.

Do they get that this is a big deal?

What we're hearing from Boehner I think certainly substantiates all of that. This is not something that he's going to allow to happen, even if it means he has to rely on Democratic votes. That's something for the Republican speaker of the House to say: "Even if I have to get Democrats to do it, we're not going to allow the debt ceiling not to go up."

Boehner "leak" was a signal to his caucus that he's not going to be the one to put country into default

@highlight

Atmosphere in Washington is too toxic to hope for a "grand bargain"

It's possible that Boehner might not get enough Democratic votes even if he drops GOP demands
