Washington (CNN) -- Your little post office might be on a proposed list of closings coming out Tuesday as the U.S. Postal Service tries to find ways to cut red ink. Some would be replaced by a "Village Post Office" located within a commercial retail store.

Postmaster General Patrick Donohoe planned a news conference Tuesday to release a long-awaited "post office study list" of potential closings nationwide, typically targeting rural post offices where only a few hundred customers are served. The facilities targeted, potentially numbering in the thousands, will be subject to a review and appeals process before any final decision is made.

GROUP 1: Less than $27,500 in annual revenue; less than 2 hours of workload daily (3,061)

GROUP 2: Less than $600,000 in annual revenue; 5 or more access points within 2 miles (385)

GROUP 3: Less than $1 million in annual revenue; 5 or more access points within 0.5 miles (188)

GROUP 4: Offices currently suspended (19)

Post office closings have upset some community leaders who say it could hurt their town's identity and make it difficult for the elderly to collect their mail and send letters. Some post offices, such as Laneview, Virginia, have already been notified they were under review and have held meetings to prepare to challenge any decision to close.
