(CNN) -- On one hand, Cristiano Ronaldo is still scoring goals for fun and Gareth Bale is starting to justify his mammoth transfer fee.

"A disaster," Ancelotti called Saturday's second-half display against city rival Rayo Vallecano, a team which had conceded 27 goals and scored just eight in 11 previous Spanish league matches.

"Against Sevilla we were 3-0 up and let them back into the game. Today the same thing happened and that is not a coincidence," the Italian told reporters.

"We need to change and remove the superficiality we have on the pitch, the second half was a disaster. You cannot let a team back into the game like that when you have the quality of Real Madrid.

"It is something that we have to talk about in the dressing room. It has happened twice that being in front has changed the attitude out on the field, and that is not good."

Real had started so well, with Ronaldo waltzing down the left and firing in a low shot for a third-minute opener.

It was downhill from there for Real.

The result left third-placed Real six points behind Barcelona -- which won 1-0 against Espanyol on Friday -- and two behind Atletico, which hosts Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.

Celta Vigo moved away from the bottom three with a 1-0 win at Sevilla -- which had conceded seven against Real in midweek.

In Italy, Napoli and Juventus moved to within two points of Serie A leader Roma with respective victories on Saturday.

Second-placed Napoli, which hosts Marseille in the Champions League on Wednesday, beat Catania 2-1 with first-half goals from former Real Madrid forward Jose Callejon and Slovakian Marek Hamsik -- putting both on six in the league this season.

Juve, which needs to beat Real to have any chance of a place in the knockout stage, triumphed 1-0 at Parma thanks to a 77th-minute strike from midfielder Paul Pogba.

Struggling AC Milan lost 2-0 at home to fourth-placed Fiorentina ahead of Wednesday's trip to Barcelona in Europe's top club competition, further progress in which may be the key to the future of under-pressure coach Massimiliano Allegri.
