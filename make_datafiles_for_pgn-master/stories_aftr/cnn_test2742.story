(CNN) -- Three women who were rescued this month after being held captive in a Cleveland house for close to a decade "are happy and safe," and overwhelmed by the public's support, their attorneys said in a statement released Wednesday.

'Please don't let me go,' Cleveland kidnap victim told officers

Castro was charged with kidnapping and rape after Berry escaped from the home with the aid of neighbors, authorities said.

The attorneys said that the outpouring of public support -- including donations to the Cleveland Courage Fund, which the lawyers say will be used to establish trusts to aid the three women and Berry's daughter -- "has been nothing short of remarkable."

"To have complete strangers offer loving support in the form of money, goods and services, reaching out to help like a family member, is appreciated in ways that are impossible to put into words," the lawyers said. "Amanda, Gina and Michelle, who have asked for nothing, are frankly overwhelmed by it all.

The fund has collected a total of $650,000 from more than 6,800 donors, according to Hennes Paynter Communications, which is representing the women.
