Matthew Flugence admitted to detectives Wednesday morning that he stabbed Ahlittia North, a girl he previously babysat, over the weekend, Col. John Fortunato said.

Flugence, 20, was arrested in the case on Tuesday, the day authorities found Ahlittia's body in a trash can down the street from her mother and stepfather's apartment in the New Orleans suburb of Harvey.

Flugence's brother Russell, 21, was arrested on suspicion of obstructing justice in Ahlittia's death, Normand said earlier this week. Russell Flugence had information about the crime that he didn't come forward with, and he also had information implicating his brother, the sheriff asserted.

The investigation began after Ahlittia's mother awoke Saturday to find her gone from the apartment, authorities said. The girl was living with her mother for the summer, but normally lived with someone else in Donaldsonville, about 60 miles to the west, Normand said.

That's when they found the girl's body in a garbage can, wrapped in a blanket from her house and covered in a garbage bag, Normand said.

Investigators looked at the garbage can during their first search of the neighborhood, so they know the body was put inside sometime after Saturday, he said.

Flugence told detectives Wednesday that he killed Ahlittia on Saturday with a knife that investigators found on him when he was arrested, Normand said.

Flugence was arrested Tuesday after people told authorities that he was walking along a road in nearby Westwego, asking for money and telling them he was on the run from police, officials said.

Cvitanovich said were no obvious signs during an autopsy of sexual assault.

When asked Wednesday whether it was hard to believe that Flugence's relatives didn't know about the sexual assault warrant, Normand said: "No."
