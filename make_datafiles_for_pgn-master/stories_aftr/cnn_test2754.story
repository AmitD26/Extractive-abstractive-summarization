"The success of 'The Bible' has catapulted History into one of the most powerful brands across media landscape and we could not be more thrilled and more proud," Nancy Dubuc, president of A&E Networks. "Clearly there is a nationwide groundswell that was waiting for this moment ... An enormous debt of gratitude goes out to everyone and the amazing effort put forth to drive us to this amazing win. Clearly the passion for this project has resonated with our viewers and across the nation. We are thrilled, and the story is only just beginning."

Burnett predicted that "The Bible," once you include home video and international sales, will eventually be seen by more viewers "than any of our other series combined over the next three decades." It's off to a good start â€” among the broadcast shows that The Bible out-performed among total audience last night was Burnett's own "All-Star Celebrity Apprentice" premiere on NBC which returned to a disappointing 5.1 million viewers.

"We could not be more thrilled with this out of the gate success," said Downey and Burnett in a statement. "The world is watching right now and we are incredibly humbled by the reaction to the series. This No. 1 series is a tribute to all those who have helped us to spread the Word. Ultimately 'The Bible' will be seen and felt by billions around the globe ...Today, more people are discussing God's chosen people â€” Moses and Abraham â€” in one day than ever before."
