(CNN) -- South Sudanese government forces have recaptured the key town of Bor from rebels after fierce fighting, the town's mayor said Saturday.

Bor, the strategically important capital city of Jonglei state, north of South Sudan's capital, Juba, has changed hands several times in a month of fighting.

The mayor of Bor, Nhial Majak Nhial, told CNN on Saturday that the rebels were fleeing and that government forces were on the ground.

The conflict has also taken a heavy toll on civilians in the town. Local agencies estimate that between 1,200 and 1,400 civilians were killed when rebels held Bor between December 17 and 24, the mayor said.

"There will definitely be more than 1,200 civilians killed," he said. "Absolutely more than that. The local population is more than 225,000, and they cannot all run. Anybody who couldn't leave the town or the area is killed by the rebel forces. They've even killed my own aunt."

The area around Juba, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) away, is now safe, he added.

Ethnic violence

The conflict has taken on an increasingly ethnic dimension, with widespread atrocities reported.

Representatives of the government and rebels have been holding talks in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but violence continues to wrack the world's newest country.

"Mass atrocities have been committed by both sides. During my visit, I have received reports of mass killings, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, sexual violence, the widespread destruction of property and the use of children in the conflict," Simonovic said.

"Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands are now displaced, with about 70,000 people seeking protection in U.N. camps and 30,000 in the two U.N. compounds in Juba alone," he added.

Medecins Sans Frontieres said Wednesday that heavy fighting over the preceding few days had wounded hundreds of people and displaced thousands.

Museveni: Ugandan forces involved

The conflict has forced many South Sudanese to flee their homes.

Speaking Wednesday at a summit of the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region in Angola, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said some of his country's troops were fighting alongside South Sudanese government forces, the Sudan People's Liberation Army.

On January 13, he said, "the SPLA and elements of our army (the Uganda People's Defence Forces) had a big battle with these rebel troops at a point about 90 kilometers from Juba where we inflicted a big defeat on them."

"To turn a political problem into a military one, having mismanaged the political problem itself in the first place is not acceptable," he said.

South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war.
