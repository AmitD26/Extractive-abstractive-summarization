(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday they are assisting in the investigation of a newborn baby who died of a rare bacterial infection that could be linked to powder-based infant formula.

The retailer said it removed the product "out of an abundance of caution" during the investigation, because it has still not been determined whether the formula caused the baby's death.

The formula involved is Enfamil Newborn Formula in 12.5-oz. cans, with the lot number ZP1K7G. Consumers who have purchased formula with that lot number should discard the product or return it to the store, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which is in charge of the investigation.

The infant died of an invasive Cronobacter sakazakii infection, Missouri health officials said. The bacteria is ubiquitous in the environment, but the source of infection is still unclear.

The FDA has collected samples of powdered formula, both opened and unopened, from the home of the deceased infant and the Walmart store, located in Lebanon, Missouri, FDA spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey said.

The FDA has also collected samples of the water used to reconstitute the formula, which in this case was bottled water, not from the tap. Test results are expected sometime next week, DeLancey said.

CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said the agency is conducting separate tests of similar samples.

"There hasn't been a connection found with infant formula at this time," she said. "We are investigating and the samples are still pending. We don't have lots and lots of cases, we have one case, and we're investigating this one very tragic case."

-- Prepare only a small amount of reconstituted formula for each feeding so as to reduce the amount of time the formula is held at room temperature.

-- Minimize the time reconstituted formula is held in the refrigerator before it is fed.

The World Health Organization has guidelines for the safe preparation and handling of powdered infant formula, which include washing hands with soap and water, thoroughly sterilizing all feeding equipment in hot, soapy water, and preparing enough formula for only one feeding at a time.
