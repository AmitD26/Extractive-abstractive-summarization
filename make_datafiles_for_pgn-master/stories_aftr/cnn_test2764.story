He told an audience that even though the threat of terror in New York City is as substantial as ever, mayoral candidates have yet to meet with him about their plans for fighting terrorism in America's largest city.

"The threat of terrorism is as great, if not greater, today than it was before the World Trade Center was destroyed," Kelly said Monday, speaking in front of the Association for a Better New York and Council on Foreign Relations.

The city's primary election for mayor is taking place Tuesday.

A spokesman for Bill de Blasio, the mayoral front-runner garnering 39% of Democratic primary voters, according to a Quinnipiac poll released Monday, told CNN that de Blasio requested a counterterrorism briefing on August 29.

Bill Thompson, who is receiving 25% of the Democratic vote, according to the poll, did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

On his campaign website, Thompson says he plans to enhance and establish security measures to protect roads, bridges and tunnels from terror. Specifically, the plans include strategies from "keeping token-booth operators in the stations" to "speeding up the installation of cameras and motion detectors on platforms."

Christine Quinn addresses counterterrorism in her platform for mayor. According to the Quinnipiac poll, Quinn has 18% of the vote among Democrats.

"Christine Quinn is the speaker of the City Council, and as part of her day-to-day job helping run this city, she has conversations and briefings regularly with the NYPD on everything from crime to counterterrorism," Mike Morey, a spokesman for Quinn, said Monday. "In the course of this campaign, she has been advised by and consulted with numerous officials in the NYPD and with anti-terrorism experts because she knows the single most important responsibility for the mayor of New York is keeping the public safe."

In his speech, Kelly emphasized the public's responsibility to inquire about the future of New York City's safety and push beyond complacency.

"The public should demand detailed answers from the candidates about their plans to protect New York. We've come too far and we've sacrificed too much to leave ourselves vulnerable."
