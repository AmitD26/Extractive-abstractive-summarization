Rather than competition, Expo 2012 in the city of Yeosu, South Korea, is the latest incarnation of an event that officially is meant to foster international understanding; unofficially it is used for national promotion, boosting trade and providing networking opportunities.

Denmark's pavilion is funded by a mix of public and private money, including some Danish companies at the forefront of the renewable energy industry. Lego bricks are on hand to attract the visitors and keep them entertained, but a backroom for more grown-up meetings is regularly used.

The basic principle of Expos is non-commercial and educational, according to the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), the organizing body that was founded in 1928.

"Expos don't provide concrete benefits for companies," says Lee Joon-hee, Commissioner for Expo 2012. "But is it still relevant... the evidence of why they are still relevant is that a lot of companies and countries want to host Expos."

Earlier this year a 20-year deal for Qatar to supply South Korea with natural gas was signed between the two countries, but pavilion manager Mona Sulaiti was keen to stress that the reason for their participation at event "is about people, not business relationships."

Andrew Snowhite, CEO of the U.S. Pavilion, believes the event is unique in its scope and potential. "It's the only place where you can create something that has a critical mass around it; it's a very large event. It's a big tourism opportunity for some, for others it's about trade," he said.

"We don't see it as being old fashioned," said Claudia Santana of Angola's pavilion. "We are building our country since 2002... if you search for an official tourism website in Angola you can't find it, so we have to find other ways to show our country. There's a lot of work ahead for our country and this is part of it."

The city is little known by people within South Korea let alone internationally, but around $2billion spent on operations and facilities from the government, BIE and private investors has completely transformed it.

"This area is relatively backwards and needs a boost," said Lee Joon-hee, saying it is part of a larger project to develop South Korea's southern "Sun Belt". "It will put Yeosu on the map. We have big ambitions to be a famous marine resort area."

Yeosu's infrastructure has been upgraded, with new, marble-smooth roads cutting through the lush hillsides and along the coast, while the train to the capital Seoul now takes half the time it used to.

While it is still undecided what will happen to most of the Expo site when it closes -- conference centers and shopping malls have been mooted -- and tourism to the region develops, there will be an immediate beneficiary of the improved infrastructure: the petrochemical industry. Just a few miles from the Expo is one of South Korea's biggest industrial complexes that dwarfs the Expo site and is the area's largest industry.

"For the moment we just want domestic development," says Lee, "Secondary is marine resort development."
