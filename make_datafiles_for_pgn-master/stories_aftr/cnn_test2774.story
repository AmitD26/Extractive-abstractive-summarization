(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela ached to come home, his family says, and he did so Sunday -- his burial the last part of a long journey that had lasted nearly a century.

The funeral was a final chance for those who knew him best to say goodbye.

Mandela's daughter Maki told me her father had always been a country boy at heart, and wanted to return to his remote farm in the Eastern Cape, one of South Africa's most rural areas.

Mandela's casket lay in his bedroom overlooking those hills overnight ahead of his funeral. Tribal elders held a vigil and a family prayer service took place Sunday morning.

The state funeral service was held in a huge domed tent, surrounded by cows grazing in the neighboring fields. Inside, 95 candles burned, each representing one year of his life.

Inside that tent -- filled with the sweet scent of white roses and lilies -- the Mandela family shared their grief with some 4,000 guests and television cameras broadcasting the service to the world.

Friends and family mourned alongside heads of state, royalty and celebrities who had made their way along South Africa's back roads to Mandela's burial place.

As well as being about family and loss, the state funeral was a mixture of power and politics, of belonging and belief.

The television coverage turned skyward to catch a flypast of planes and helicopters as Mandela was finally laid to rest, in a grave surrounded by local plants designed to evoke the journey of his life.

Finally, after a life journey that was long, proud and honored, Nelson Mandela is home.

Hamba Kahle Tata. Lala Kahle Tata. Goodbye father. Sleep well.
