London (CNN) -- Prince Harry is ending his time with Britain's Army Air Corps and is taking a staff officer role in London, Kensington Palace announced Friday.

His deployments included a four-month stint in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province, known as a Taliban stronghold.

The move to a new role comes at a time of increasing British media speculation about his relationship with Cressida Bonas.

His responsibilities "will include helping to co-ordinate significant projects and commemorative events involving the Army in London," a Kensington Palace news release said.

Prince Harry spent 3Â½ years in training and operational service with the Apache Force during his time with the Army Air Corps.

He qualified as an Apache aircraft commander in July of last year.

Harry has embraced an increasingly public role in the past couple of years.

The prince hit the headlines for the wrong reasons in 2012, after he was photographed naked while in his swanky Las Vegas hotel suite with friends and a group of women they had met. The images were widely published on the Internet and by Britain's best-selling tabloid newspaper The Sun.

But in the months preceding that, Harry had won praise from the UK media for embracing a more central public role in support of the Queen in her diamond jubilee year.
