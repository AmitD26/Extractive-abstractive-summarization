New York (CNN) -- A man arrested in police probes following the apparent drug overdose death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to drug charges, and two co-defendants in the case had not-guilty pleas entered for them at their arraignment.

Robert Vineberg, 57, who remains in jail after his bail was set Friday at nearly a quarter of a million dollars total, was arraigned on three counts of criminal possession of heroin. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, according to his attorney Edward Kratt.

They expect a decision regarding the motion on March 10.

The judge entered a not-guilty plea for Juliana Luchkiw and Max Rosenblum, both 22, who appeared in court Monday charged with one count of criminal possession of cocaine, according to Rosenblum's attorney, Daniel Hochheiser.

The three were arrested earlier this month as police investigated drugs found in Philip Seymour Hoffman's apartment. The Academy Award-winning actor was found dead February 2 of an apparent drug overdose. Investigators found close to 50 packets of what they believe to be heroin in the actor's apartment.

Vineberg had Hoffman's phone number stored in his phone, according to law enforcement.

Vineberg hopes to make bail this week, which is set at $40,000 cash and $200,000 bond, according to his attorney.
