(CNN) -- Thousands of Africans have expressed their hopes that the next pope will be the first from their continent -- with a majority believing it would mean the Catholic Church becoming more conservative.

The survey of 20,000 people, conducted on mobile phones across 11 nations, also exposed big divisions among Africans about the future direction of the church, including faith, homosexuality and race.

More than 80% of those surveyed believe their continent is ready for an African pope, but only 61% thought the rest of the world was too.

CNN also asked respondents what an African pope would mean for them and for Africa. The comments revealed a wide range of views on the church's role.

"He may be like the rest of them and just stay in the church; anyway they don't make any difference in Africa."

A Zimbabwean man surveyed also said he feared that an African pope would not be treated equally to other popes.

"I think at first people might not accept him and it would take a long time for him to blend in, so his impact will not be that great."

Jana conducted the poll between 7-11 March 2013 with mobile phone users from Lesotho, Rwanda, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria.
