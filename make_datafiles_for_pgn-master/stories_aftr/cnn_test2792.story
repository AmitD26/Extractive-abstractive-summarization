(CNN) -- Several years ago, Martha and Dennis Disberger and their three kids found themselves running desperately through a busy airport. "Mom, are we late?" asks one of the children. "I have no idea, just keep running," says Martha. "But don't lose Dad, because I have no idea what our connecting flight is!"

That family story pretty much sums up the Disbergers of Morton, Illinois, who arguably rank among America's most traveling families.

Over the past two decades, the Disbergers have turned the airline getaway into an art form. The three children have virtually grown up as international travelers. Joel was 5 when the family started its flying lifestyle; Kara was a year old and Monica wasn't even born yet. Seriously, how many toddlers have their own frequent flier accounts?

--Their destinations have been as far-flung as Moscow, Dubai, Sydney and Bangkok.

This is a family who "has grown up and together on our flights," says United Airlines' Joe Micucci. "Some people have a cottage or lake house as a second home, the Disbergers have the world."

30 hours in Australia

"It all started with a simple ad that showed some promotional deals," he explained. A $238 ticket offered triple miles on a particular route. "Boom! We were on the plane -- and we had such a priceless experience we said, 'wow let's do that again.'"

So they did. Again. And again and again -- using their miles for passenger upgrades and to book free trips for extended family members.

In Ireland, at a stoplight between Dublin and the Ring of Kerry, "this guy comes to my side of the car banging on the window," Martha remembers. "In a way, he reminded us of a little leprechaun, saying, 'are ya goin' to Killarney? Oh follow me I'll show you how to get there.' "

Hopping into a car ahead, "he was so excited and funny. As we followed him we were trying to figure out his angle."

Faith and begorrah! It turns out the leprechaun's sister owns a bed and breakfast! "Guess where we stayed that night?"

The Disbergers have even popped across the Pacific to enjoy a weekend in Australia.

That's right, 30 hours on the ground in Sydney sandwiched between 50 hours of total flight time.

The secret to fun family travel, say the Disbergers, is making the best of time at airports and in the air. Monica says, "We've played Hearts all around the world."

'You just budget'

By now, you may be wondering how a middle-class family affords this jet-setter lifestyle.

This frugal family watches its spending. They avoid pricey things like new cars. When possible, they keep their travel plans flexible. When their flight is overbooked, they sometimes volunteer to give up their seats in exchange for freebies.

Martha offers this bit of advice: "Excedrin and deep breathing work. Wine helps. No -- I'm teasing."

--Always keep your keys and cell phone and charger with you. Don't pack them in your luggage. You might lose them.

-- Give toddlers something to look forward to. The Disbergers gave their toddlers gifts when their flights reached the ocean. These "over-the-water" gifts have become a beloved Disberger tradition that extended from the kids' childhood into adulthood.

Traveling with teens:

--Let them be in charge of some of the decisions, including where to go next, what to do or where to eat, says Dennis. Give them time to enjoy themselves with their iPods or a book. Dennis says he would pay his traveling teens from $2-$5 per each 500 miles to ride in coach. It allowed mom and dad the luxury of first class. It also offered their teens some time alone, while giving them a chance to earn a little money.

Saving on hotel rooms:

--In some markets, a second set of rooms for the kids can be inexpensive. "When the kids were younger, we used the Hyatt 'family plan' set of connecting rooms," says Disberger. "Then when we check in we offer to let the hotel take back both rooms for a suite upgrade."

Families change and the Disbergers are no exception.

As the children move into their 20s, Dennis says they're still as interested as ever in traveling as a family, although college schedules have made travel planning more complicated.

But hey, thanks to their airborne childhoods, the younger Disbergers already are million-milers getting double miles with lifetime gold airline status.
