Motorola launched the new device in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in a presentation beamed around the globe.

CEO Dennis Woodside said Moto G has set its sights on the whole world.

"It's really designed to serve the half a billion in the world who next year will buy a smart phone for under $200," he told CNN ahead of the launch.

The Moto G won't be offered in the U.S. until January and it will eventually go on sale in about 30 countries.

"Brazil is an incredibly vibrant market," Woodside said. "People are coming on to the mobile internet for the first time."

Industry observers at the launch said it should be a hot ticket heading into Christmas, with its price and features making it competitive.

"Most people in the world can't afford $500, $600 for a smartphone," said Woodside during the launch. "We think the industry should provide more for the consumer dollar."

In the U.S., Moto G is being targeted at the pre-paid market, especially students and children.

As for China, it is the world's biggest market for low-end mobile phones, but the government blocks many of the Google services -- like Gmail and Google Search -- that Motorola says will make Moto G the new smart phone of choice.
