United Nations (CNN) -- Four countries, including Pakistan, were elected Friday to join the UN Security Council in January as nonpermanent members for two-year terms. Also elected, via secret ballot, were Guatemala, Morocco and Togo.

In a race for the fifth Security Council seat, Azerbaijan and Slovenia went 10 rounds of voting with no decision Friday night. Azerbaijan built some momentum but was 14 votes short of qualifying for the seat. The battle will resume Monday

"We hope to play our usual role of taking on matters which affect the underdog, so as to speak," Pakistani Ambassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon said.

Manjeev Singh Puri, India's deputy ambassador to the UN, embraced Haroon after the vote and said that he warmly welcomed the election of Pakistan.

"Pakistan and India share common perception on so many global issues, and we look forward to working with them," Singh Puri said.

Starting in January, the council will have as members seven of the nine nations known to have nuclear weapons: China, France, India, Pakistan, Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom. Absent will be Israel and North Korea.

Guatemala will serve on the council for the first time after a failed 2006 bid. That race, against Venezuela, lasted three weeks and 48 rounds of voting, the third-longest in UN history. Guatemala and Venezuela ultimately agreed to drop out of the race, and Panama was elected in their place.
