(CNN) -- A deputy stopped to help a motorist in Utah on Thursday, and the motorist allegedly shot him dead. Then he wounded two more deputies while running from the law.

The slain officer was Sgt. Cory Wride, a deputy who had been on the force for 19 years. Tracy knew him well and thought highly of him, he told journalists at a news conference. Wride worked directly under him for three years.

"He was a very helpful person, and that's what he was doing," Tracy said, visibly moved. "He was helping people when he stopped."

The wounded deputies were hospitalized and underwent operations. One is expected to recover; the other is in critical condition in an intensive care unit.

The suspect, whom Tracy declined to name, is also expected to recover. He has a "significant" criminal history, Tracy said.

Ambush?

The suspect shot Wride, while he was still in his squad car, with what "appears to be a high-powered rifle," Tracy said.

Then he fled the scene.

Tracy fears the suspect may have set up the situation on purpose as a roadside ambush.

After the suspect fled, a deputy called in to say that he was pursuing him. Seconds later, the officer was shot in his vehicle, wounded in the head, Tracy said.

He looked for a vehicle to carjack, approaching multiple people and cars, before finding one. He later crashed it, too, Tracy said.

Along the way, he continued shooting.

Tracy personally the broke news of Sgt. Wride's killing to his family.

"He was a good man," the sheriff said.

Wride leaves behind a wife and five children.
