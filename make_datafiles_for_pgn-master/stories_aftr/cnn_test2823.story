(CNN) -- Mexican authorities say they've detained the father-in-law of one of the country's most wanted drug lords.

Police Tuesday morning detained Ines Coronel Barreras, 45, on drug-related charges, officials told reporters.

Authorities said Coronel is the father of Guzman's third wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, whom he married in 2007.

Guzman's nickname, which means "shorty," matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame, though he has climbed to great heights in the drug business.

The Sinaloa cartel is one of Mexico's most powerful drug-trafficking operations, and Forbes has estimated Guzman's net worth at $1 billion.

U.S. authorities arrested a woman believed to be Guzman's daughter in October. She was deported in December after she pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of a false visa.

Coronel's arrest is one of the most significant blows to organized crime in Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December.
