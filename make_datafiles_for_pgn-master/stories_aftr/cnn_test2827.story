(CNN) -- Ravaging floods killed dozens in Nigeria and displaced tens of thousands of residents as crocodiles, hippos and other water animals washed into homes.

The floods have left 148 people dead and affected 21 of the nation's three dozens states, according to the local Red Cross.

The floods have affected a series of states, including Bayelsa and Benue.

In Bayelsa state, an official said the area's terrain has intensified the effects of the downpour.

"A lot of people have been displaced. Snakes, crocodiles and hippos have been displaced and are ending up in people's homes. Everyone has been displaced."

Alazigha said more rain is forecast and authorities are evacuating residents to shelters that have been set up in schools located on higher ground.

"The bad part is ... there is no relief yet," he said.

"Our main goals are to help settle the displaced people and improve on the drainage," he said. "Our hope is that when the drainage gets better and the waters subside, we can deploy more resources to see how much we can save."

Alazigha said the amount of rain was unexpected.

Nigeria's rainy season occurs between May and October. Torrential rains are especially hard on communities in rural areas, where drainage is inadequate or nonexistent.
