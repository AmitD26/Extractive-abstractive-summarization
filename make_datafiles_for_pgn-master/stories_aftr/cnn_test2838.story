(CNN) -- It's the question Edin Dzeko is constantly asked.

"You ask me again about war..." sighs the 28-year-old, rolling his eyes and smiling as he enjoys a rare moment of peace outside Bosnia-Herzegovina's team hotel in the picturesque suburb of Ilidza.

Perhaps the line of questioning is understandable given that just a short drive away is Dzeko's home city of Sarajevo, where the national hero lived throughout the Bosnian War which raged between 1992 and 1995.

The war in Bosnia left tens of thousands dead, and hundreds of thousands displaced.

But just as the bullet holes which still riddle this land represent a gruesome past, Dzeko and his teammates have become symbols of a different more optimistic future.

"I started to play football when I was about 10, my father brought me to one school because there were more pitches where we could play. Everything was destroyed after the war."

His mother once inadvertently saved his life, calling him inside seconds before the land he was playing on was hit by bombs.

The siege of Sarajevo followed the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, with conflict erupting between the ethnic groups which make up Bosnia -- chiefly Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs.

Modern-day Bosnia is an independent state, although still under international administration.

After signing his first professional contract in Bosnia, the young striker earned a move to Teplice in the Czech Republic before getting his big break with VFL Wolfsburg in the German Bundesliga.

While Dzeko carries echoes of the fighting wherever he goes, other members of the Bosnia squad had a different experience.

Asmir Begovic and his family left Trebinje, 80 miles south of Sarajevo, and headed to Germany before immigrating to Canada.

"As I've gotten older I've educated myself a little on the situation and what happened, drawn on experiences from my family members and friends, who lived through it and it was just a very unpleasant experience as people can imagine.

"For our quality of life as a family, just being able to be safe in a different country meant a lot to us."

"I've always been very close to the country," he says. "When the opportunity came it was a fantastic thing for myself and my family to do, I couldn't wait to put on a Bosnia shirt and I haven't really looked back since."

Neither has Bosnia's national football team.

Bids to qualify for the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 European Championships fell agonizingly short, with Portugal ending the team's hopes at the playoff stage of both qualification competitions.

But, on October 15, 2013 in the Lithuanian capital city of Vilnius, a goal from striker Vedad Ibisevic sealed a 1-0 win for Safet Susic's Bosnia and passage to Brazil 2014.

Cue wild celebrations on the streets of Sarajevo, with the team flying home to be greeted by 50,000 ecstatic Bosnian football fans.

"When you see 50,000 there waiting for you, then you know you did something good."

"We've learned from our past, we've learned from our failures and I think we've definitely grown as a team and we've been able to overcome that final hurdle now," added Begovic.

"It's something we have all accomplished together."

Now Rio de Janeiro's iconic Maracana Stadium awaits.

At the arena first built for the 1950 World Cup and lavishly redeveloped for Brazil's second hosting of the tournament, Bosnia will take its bow against a Lionel Messi-led Argentina.

African Cup of Nations winners Nigeria and Iran are the other two teams which make up a tough Group F.

"I'm very much looking forward to it," says Begovic, who will be trying to keep out four-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Messi.

"That's what football is all about, being able to work your whole life to get to a World Cup and then playing against one of the biggest football countries in the world in the opening game.

"Obviously we're massive underdogs, so we've got nothing to lose in that game, we can go there with an open mind and see how we can beat them.

"It's going to be a huge challenge, but I believe in the quality of our team and we can cause Argentina problems."

With players like Begovic and Dzeko, not to mention Roma playmaker Miralem Pjanic, Bosnia have players capable of upsetting the odds.
