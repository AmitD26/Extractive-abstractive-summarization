(CNN) -- The guilty pleas of students in a Massachusetts school harassment case this week thrust the spotlight back on bullying in the United States, but the issue is also drawing more attention beyond America's borders.

France's education minister made national headlines this week when he announced plans to combat bullying by shutting down Facebook accounts of students who harass their classmates.

But bullying is also a global issue, according to the United Nations Children's Fund.

About a third of students surveyed in countries from Argentina to Zimbabwe said they had been bullied recently, UNICEF said in a 2006 report, citing two global studies on the issue.

France focused on the issue in a two-day conference this week, culminating with Education Minister Luc Chatel's announcement of the government's new partnership with Facebook.

In a statement, Facebook described bullying prevention as an "important issue," pledging to help promote online safety.

Government officials in Mexico have taken a different approach: changing education laws to require federal, state and city authorities to implement policies to identify, prevent, control and stop bullying.

"It is a phenomenon that, if not addressed in time, becomes a problem of health, security and education," Mexican lawmaker Jaime Arturo Vazquez Aguilar said.

In addition to physical and psychological harm, Vazquez said another long-term effect of bullying is the "most regrettable."

"Our girls, boys and youth are getting mixed up, in some cases, in criminal activity," he said.

"We must avoid, at all costs, that one day a student prefers to die rather to be in a school where he is harassed, without our schools doing anything about it," he said.

CNN's Brian Vitagliano and Chris Boyette and journalist Imelda Garcia Velazquez from CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.
