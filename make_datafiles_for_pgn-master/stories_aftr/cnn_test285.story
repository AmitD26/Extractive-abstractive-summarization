The army already has more of the weapons than it requires, Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia Nikolai Makarov told Russian media.

The inventor of the weapon, Mikhail Kalashnikov, 91, has reportedly been deliberately kept uninformed about the decision.

The legendary weapon, known for its simplicity of operation and maintenance and reliability in extreme conditions -- be they hot, cold, wet or sandy -- has been the weapon of choice for national armies and paramilitary guerrillas alike.

The weapon was so instrumental in Mozambique's successful rebel movement that its image was incorporated into the national flag. It is also depicted as part of Zimbabwe's coat of arms.

In 2009, Kalashnikov told a CNN crew on an excursion to the Izhmash arms assembly plant in the Russian city of Izhevsk that two main qualities describe his machine gun: simplicity and reliability.

"It is a thousand times harder to make simple things than complicated ones," he said.

When Kalashnikov turned 90 in 2009, the day was celebrated in Russia on a scale akin to a national holiday. He was decorated by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev with the country's highest order, the Hero of Russia.

CNN's Maxim Tkachenko and Mike Sefanov contributed to this story.
