The principality on the French Riviera covers less than a square mile -- just half the size of New York's Central Park -- but its legendary grand prix weekend packs a sensual punch despite its diminutive size.

"It's special," two-time Monaco Grand Prix winner Mark Webber tells CNN. "You've got the ocean, the background of the cliffs ... If they can't build a nice bit of road in Monaco, where can they do it?"

Sight

From the open cockpit of an F1 car, hitting top speeds of 176 mph, the 22 drivers who line up for Sunday's race have a unique perspective on Monaco.

"Starting the lap you see the apartments, the five and six-storey buildings around the outside of the track," explains Webber, who finished his F1 career with world champions Red Bull Racing last season.

"The drivers do see things from a very different perspective -- if you went around the track sitting on a little skateboard then that is the same height we're at in the F1 cars. You know all these sights are there but you don't see much of them."

The squeezed crowd on the sidelines gets closer to the racing action than at any other F1 circuit in the world, and the Monaco GP is almost as famous for people-spotting as it is for the racing spectacle.

Smell

Stirling Moss, a three-time race winner in Monaco between 1956 and 1961, remembered cheekily waving at female fans as he drove around the principality.

"There's been quite a few scenarios when you actually spot someone you know! On other tracks you don't see that."

Hearing

"I actually always thought it was cooler through the harbor section of the lap because you got a bit of a sea breeze -- but maybe that was a driver clutching at straws on a hot race day!

Touch

"When you're driving you feel it in your butt, hips and back," reveals the 37-year-old Webber, who put his body through 217 grands prix before moving to endurance racing in Porsche sports cars in 2014.

"You also pick up sensations through your hands on the steering wheel.

"You're constantly putting information in the library in terms of sensation, grip level and how close you can go to the barriers.

"You know what's at stake, any small error and you're going to pay a big, big price."

Over the last six decades of the F1 world championship, there have been layout changes to Monaco's street circuit but the precipitous, narrow racing roads remain largely unchanged.

If a driver loses concentration, he can find himself in the wall or following Albert Ascari's fabled 1955 dip into the Mediterranean.

Even the fearless Ayrton Senna -- who won the Monaco GP a record six times -- admitted to reeling in his racing instincts around Monte Carlo.

The Brazilian, who was killed in a crash at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, famously spoke of entering a trance-like state as he attacked the Monaco track.

"I think every racing driver can try to relate to what he was talking about," Webber says. "He did some laps round there which were two seconds clear of the field, which is unheard of.

"Physically Monaco is not that draining but mentally it is massive."

Taste

"You have the victory champagne on the race track, which is brilliant. We spray the champagne over the mechanics, whoever's in sight. Generally we try to spray the police but they're a bit serious so we give them a nudge.

"Then we spray the car and the track. It's how it should be, in my opinion. A lot of traditional things have been lost but Monaco still has those in abundance.

The Monaco Grand Prix remains one of the most challenging races for any driver but, odd as it may seem, the F1 cockpit offers a form of escapism.

With charity football matches and fashion shows to attend, not to mention catching a skiff from one side of the harbor to the other, the drivers are in danger of sensory overload.

"The first thing that hits you at Monaco compared to other tracks is how claustrophobic it is," adds Webber, who chose not to join peers such as Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in making Monaco his home.

"There are some quiet areas. On a Friday I always went for a ride on my bike and got away from Monaco altogether.

"It's difficult to explain to people who haven't been there, but you've got to have tried pretty hard to get away from the chaos."

It may be the slowest, shortest, smallest grand prix of the year, but when it comes to epicurean delights and distraction Monaco remains F1's crown jewel.
