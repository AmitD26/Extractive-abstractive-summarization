(CNN) -- The federal government may require automakers to road test cars to ensure the accuracy of gas mileage claims, the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Tuesday.

Currently, the EPA road tests 10 to 15 percent of new vehicles every year, but the other 85% are tested by the car companies themselves, typically through use of computer modeling, wind tunnels and treadmill-like tests.

But those methods have come under scrutiny.

Korea's Hyundai and Kia lowered fuel economy estimates for some 2012 and 2013 models after the EPA found discrepancies between agency results and data submitted by the company.

"Some automakers already do this, but we are establishing a regulatory requirement for all auto makers," Chris Grundler, director of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality, told the Wall Street Journal.

"At this early stage, it is premature for us to speculate on what form a proposal may take," the agency said in a statement Tuesday. "EPA will engage interested stakeholders proactively before making any proposal."

The EPA said the wind tunnel and other tests are important to get repeatable, reliable data. But it said it is considering requiring road tests.

Cars that go further on a gallon of gas are also a big selling point with consumers looking to save money at the pump.
