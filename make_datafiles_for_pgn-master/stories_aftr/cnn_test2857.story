Jin Shaohong, a Chinese health official, says he doubts China is to blame for the heparin problem.

She said contaminated shipments of the blood thinner have been traced from China to 10 countries, including the United States.

Heparin containing oversulfated chondroitin sulfate -- a compound made from animal cartilage -- has been associated with hundreds of serious adverse symptoms, including allergic reactions that cause nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath and a severe drop in blood pressure.

Contaminated heparin has been discovered in China, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Germany and the United States.

Still, agency officials stressed Monday that they cannot be sure the deaths are linked to the drug, which is made from pig intestines and is given to prevent clot formation.

"We are not able to rule out the fact that there could be other problems leading to these adverse events," Woodcock said.

Earlier Monday, Chinese officials said they were doubtful a contaminant in heparin was responsible for the bad reactions, according to The Associated Press. They said the contamination might have occurred in the United States during the manufacturing process or patients may have had conditions that caused the symptoms.

The FDA posted on its Web site a warning letter to Changzhou SPL. The letter said the company has not instituted proper safeguards to ensure the raw materials are free of impurities.

"You fail to have adequate systems for evaluating the suppliers of heparin crude materials, and the crude materials themselves to ensure that these materials are acceptable for use," the letter said.

It also cited equipment used in the manufacture of heparin as "unsuitable for intended use."

For example, it said, tanks used to make heparin "were identified as clean," but "unidentified material was observed adhering to the inside surfaces."

"We regret FDA's decision to send a warning letter to Changzhou SPL, and we do not believe that the warning letter reflects Changzhou SPL's actual state of compliance with current good manufacturing practices," SPL said in a written statement.

It added that it is "committed to cooperating with FDA and will promptly provide a detailed response."

In a written statement, Baxter said its tests confirmed that the contaminant can cause drops in blood pressure, the most commonly reported adverse event.

It remains unclear where the contamination occurred, but the contaminated products' active pharmaceutical ingredient came from 12 Chinese makers of crude heparin "across a broad area of China," she said.

The most persuasive evidence implicating the Chinese product, she said, is the fact that the increased number of deaths reported after heparin administration returned to baseline in March, after the FDA recall.

Though Chinese officials have raised the possibility that clean and safe heparin may have also been linked to adverse events, Woodcock discounted that.

"We tested this lot and found contamination," she said. "In their testing, they did not find contamination, but we are fairly certain because of multiple labs doing the testing that this lot contains contaminants." E-mail to a friend
