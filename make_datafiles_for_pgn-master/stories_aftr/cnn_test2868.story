Brasilia, Brazil (CNN) -- With just a little more than a week until the first kickoff of the 2014 World Cup, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff hosted a dinner for international journalists and countered criticism that too much money was spent on stadiums while infrastructure projects languished.

Rousseff told her guests that many of the country's ambitious infrastructure plans were never intended to be finished for the World Cup, but the mega sporting event was simply used as an excuse to get projects off the ground.

Of the 143 billion reais ($63 billion) earmarked for infrastructure projects, only 8 to 9 billion reais were meant to be used specifically during the Cup. "The rest isn't for the Cup, it's for Brazil," she said.

"That's how we watch the games. Not in the stadium. We get everyone together in front of the biggest TV," she said. "If Brazil wins, we go to the street."

The President fielded questions and told stories over a buffet dinner that featured Brazilian beef, French wine, a traditional seafood stew known as muqueca and tapioca ice cream -- although she skipped dessert herself.

FIFA has always said Brazil insisted on the 12 cities to ensure the whole country was involved in the World Cup.

Rousseff is the favorite, but her margin has steadily declined, making it highly likely that there will be a runoff vote.

A survey released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found 72% of Brazilians were "dissatisfied with the way things are going in their country" and 61% said they thought hosting the World Cup "was a bad thing" because it took money away from schools, health care and other public services.

At the Tuesday night dinner, Rousseff said she didn't think the World Cup should be politicized and even went on to talk about her time as a political prisoner during the Brazilian dictatorship, something she rarely discusses.

The President appeared relaxed and smiling throughout the evening, even telling the table of journalists about the time she "escaped" on the back of a red Harley-Davidson with a friend and drove around Brasilia unbeknownst to her security detail.

And if Brazil's football archenemy Argentina were to win?

"You would hear the biggest silence in the country," she said. "But I don't think it will happen."
