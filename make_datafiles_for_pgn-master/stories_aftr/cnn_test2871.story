Justin Odom was interviewed Wednesday by homicide detectives with his attorney present, New Orleans Police spokeswoman Officer Hilal Williams said.

Police said they are still investigating the shooting and declined to release more information.

A 21-year-old woman has died of her wounds from the early Sunday morning shooting, NOPD Officer Garry Flot said Wednesday.

"Our deepest thoughts and sympathies are with the family of Brittany Thomas," New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. "This type of tragedy strikes at the heart of who we are as a people and as a city."

Three people remain hospitalized, all in stable condition, NOPD public information officer Frank Robertson III said Wednesday.

New Orleans Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas has said the shooting may have happened because of a heated exchange between two young men.

Landrieu has called for additional resources from the federal government and the state of Louisiana to combat violence in the city.

He asked President Barack Obama to send a "targeted surge team" of federal law enforcement officers to help stem crime. He asked Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to assign 100 state police officers to the city and rededicate a penny from the hotel/motel tax from the convention center to the city for public safety.

"These kinds of incidents will not go unanswered," Landrieu said. "These perpetrators will be brought to justice."
