(CNN) -- Teenagers looking to buy cigarettes in New York may have to look elsewhere if a city council proposal is approved and signed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The proposal would raise the legal age to buy any form of tobacco from 18 to 21. But will it be effective in limiting smoking among young people?

But Steinberg argues teens need help to avoid picking up the habit.

"I think a 21-year-old is much more likely, based on their maturity and life experiences, to be able to make an informed rational decision about a behavior that might affect the rest of their life than, say, an 18-year-old," Steinberg said.

"Cigarettes and tobacco contain some of the most addictive chemicals in our society," said Steinberg. "Smoking a cigarette delivers more nicotine more efficiently to your brain than if you were to inject nicotine intravenously."

The New York proposal was introduced in April by Dr. Thomas A. Farley, the city's health commissioner, and Christine C. Quinn, City Council speaker and a mayoral candidate. A vote on the proposal is expected to take place this fall, according to a spokesperson from the City Council's office.

Officials in New York estimate that raising the purchasing age to 21 will cut tobacco use by 55% among 18- to 20-year-olds and lead to a 67% drop among teens aged 14 to 17 years.

Steinberg knows that limiting access to tobacco is not the only strategy for reducing youth smoking, but it's a start.

"It's not going to fix the problem in and of itself," said Steinberg. "You also need educational programs."

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a panel of health care experts, now recommends that primary care physicians offer patients interventions, education and counseling to prevent tobacco use among children and adolescents.

Their reasoning? If teens never light up, they may never get hooked.
