As a practicing Muslim, Sbihi, who has Moroccan family, should be starting his month-long Ramadan fast on July 21, abstaining from food and water during daylight hours.

A compromise was needed.

"I spoke to my family here, spoke to my family back home in Morocco, and at the end of the day I'm making the right decision for me, and that's to postpone my fast."

"I like to listen to quite violent hip-hop rap kinda of stuff before I get on the water," he said. "I do listen to one song: Eminem feat. Lil Wayne -- No Love."

Sbihi -- nicknamed "Moe" by his friends -- spent as much time as possible on the football pitch, but the visit of British rowing's talent identification scouts to his school in Surbiton persuaded him to try a different pursuit.

Hitting the heights

"If I wasn't a rower, I'd love to be a basketball player. I love basketball, I love watching it," he said.

"And basketball you kind of fit in. It's the same thing with rowing, you just sit here and everyone is tall. And you're like, 'Is this the land of the giants?' "

Size matters

Being the biggest member of a crew is not necessarily an advantage, Sbihi says, so keeping his weight down is crucial.

"When it comes to summer racing I'm the biggest guy -- I can also easily be the heaviest guy. By me being lighter, and keeping the same power, it would be beneficial to the crew."

Sbihi moved up to the eight crew in 2010, having raced in the pair and the four at youth level, and Britain looks set to renew its rivalry with Germany at the Games.

However, Sbihi isn't interested in collecting another silver medal.

"I'm in this to win," he said. "I only want one thing and that is an Olympic medal. I went four years not winning anything and if I just win that gold medal ... I'll be happy. My legacy would be that gold medal."

Britain's rowing legends

Steve Redgrave won titles at five successive Olympics, while Matthew Pinsent won four in a row and James Cracknell won gold in the coxless four in 2000 and 2004.

"Pincent, Cracknell and Redgrave they were able to do that for 20 years, 16 years and 12 years," Sbihi says.

"That's pretty impressive. It's unimaginable for me to be able to try to better Redgrave."
