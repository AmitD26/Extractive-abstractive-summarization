WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- On April 20, President Obama challenged his Cabinet to cut $100 million in spending over the next 90 days.

The deadline came -- and went -- without a report from the White House on whether or not that promise was fulfilled.

Asked about the spending cuts, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Monday that information still was being compiled.

"Those are being reviewed now, and we'll release something in the coming days," Gibbs told the daily White House briefing.

At time the challenge was announced, critics said $100 million in savings was a small amount on the context of the federal budget.

"Any amount of savings is obviously welcome," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in April. "But [$100 million is] about the average amount we'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year."

The issue is a sensitive one for Obama at a time of fierce Republican criticism about increased government spending for the economic stimulus plan.
