But, the country best-known as the homeland of Madonna's adopted children now has another claim to fame: It has succeeding in halting -- at least for now -- its crippling brain drain of nurses.

Countries don't come much poorer than Malawi, but its healthcare system worked well back in the 1970s and early 1980s.

When the former British colony gained independence in 1964, president Hastings Banda, himself a physician, maintained a high level of training for nurses that included teaching all classes in English.

By the late 1990s, however, Malawi was reeling from the AIDS epidemic. As if that weren't bad enough, the government also had to cut spending on health care and education as a condition for getting help from the U.S. and other countries to liberalize its trade and economy.

The publicly funded health system, on which more than 95 percent of Malawians still depend for treatment, quickly started to fall apart.

Registered nurses began leaving in droves.

Phoya worked with others in Malawi's Ministry of Health (MOH) to come up with an emergency plan that focused on nurses as they provided most of the primary care.

The money was to be used to pay higher salaries to nurses -- quite a radical move in global development as donors worry it is unsustainable in the long haul.

However, the situation in Malawi was getting desperate.

Success in one area has revealed a different problem -- that of an internal brain drain.

As more international aid groups and universities set up health programs in Malawi, they are hiring nurses, all trained at Malawi taxpayer expense, away from publicly funded hospitals and clinics.

Embangweni Mission Hospital in northern Malawi has a good reputation but is located at the end of a long, dusty road, far from major towns, let alone cities.

"Young nurses with families do not really want to work here," said Catherine Mzembe, head of nursing at Embangweni.

And that is perhaps the most important lesson to draw from Malawi's efforts: it pays to look at how much has been accomplished with so little.
