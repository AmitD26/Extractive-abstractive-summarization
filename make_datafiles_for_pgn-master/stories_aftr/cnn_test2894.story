New York (CNN) -- The New York City Council voted on Wednesday night to approve an anti-tobacco law that will raise the tobacco-purchasing age from 18 to 21.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg has 30 days to sign the bills into law. Given his previous support, that is likely to happen soon.

New York City has now become the largest city to have an age limit as high as 21. Needham, Massachusetts, raised the sale age to 21 in 2005, according to the New York City Department of Health.

Neighboring states and counties have raised the tobacco sale age to 19, including New Jersey in 2005, the Department of Health said.

Raising the sales age "will protect teens and may prevent many people from ever starting to smoke," Health Commissioner Thomas A. Farley, said in a statement after the vote.

While many lawmakers appeared to be applauding the bills, some younger New Yorkers were not so pleased.

"I think it's ridiculous," another New Yorker said, "Let us be, let us live."

The ban was later repealed by a New York State Supreme Court judge.
