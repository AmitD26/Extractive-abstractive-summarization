(CNN) -- Bagpipes aren't a sound one readily associates with Greece.

Experiencing the 'new' Greece

This year, the property launched a series of unique offerings under the heading "Experience Greece."

Mariza Sviriadis, the hotel's managing director, says the idea came to her during the six-year economic crisis that brought much of the country to its knees.

"The whole of Greece, it was like a small war," she tells CNN.

While many properties on the island reacted by pushing out all-inclusive packages -- essentially keeping tourists indoors and away from local businesses in dire need of cash -- Sviriadis decided to take the opposite approach.

"I wanted to show that there was more to Greece than that, and more to Greece than feta cheese," she says.

"The crisis forced us to change the way we were thinking, and to get creative. Before, we could be a bit arrogant. Now, we have to be the best."

"The crisis is the best thing that happened to me," says Tina Kyriakis, founder of Alternative Athens (+30 6948 405 242; tours from $60 per person).

Kyriakis worked in marketing for a multinational corporation before she was laid off in 2010.

Two years later, she launched her own tourism company.

Like Sviriadis, she noticed that tour offerings in Athens had been stuck in a rut.

"I looked around at what existed in Athens in terms of tourism and it was all very standard, very stereotypical, all 'ancient Athens'," she says.

"It's a very complicated city and you have to get under its skin to understand it and appreciate it. So that was the concept."

In addition to its quirky walking tours (among the most popular are a graffiti tour and a guided walk through the "enchanted forests" outside the city), the company pairs visitors with Athenian gourmets, who host four-course supper clubs in their apartments.

She now hosts two tours a day, attracting up to 25 visitors at a time.

If it weren't for Greece's economic slump, she says she might never have found the courage to start the venture.

"It was the kick in the butt I needed. I could either go back to the corporate world, which doesn't have a future in Greece any more, or I could do this.

The island of Milos is a case in point.

It also possesses a history of mineral extraction that would set any geologist's heart aflutter and is where the Venus de Milo was uncovered.

Yet it has been largely overlooked by tour operators, low-cost airlines and visitors alike.

"We don't have hotels where you can go in and sell, sell, sell.

Mallis recognized that Milos had a lot to offer travelers: ancient thermal baths, underwater caves, an old pirate lair, third-century catacombs decorated with Christian murals.

He also recognized that no one was talking up the island's assets, or making them accessible.

His specialty is archeology and geological tours, which highlight some of the island's incredible scenery.

He recently introduced cooking lessons that showcase the island's local cheese and produce.

"As a young boy, I'd remember seeing the odd, small German group walking around the island, but that was it. Now, we have something more organized, we're reaching more markets, and we're seeing progress," he says.

Other tours

Other examples of off-the-beaten path experiences abound, many introduced by local companies launched in the last few years.

Eumelia

Biolea

Producing one of the few single-estate olive oils in Greece, this organic farm uses a traditional stone mill, and runs free tours of the grounds by appointment. Visitors get a rare glimpse into the Cretan olive oil tradition.

Kinsterna Hotel

Housed in a 13th-century manor and surrounded by 18 acres of olive groves, vineyards and citrus trees, the Kinsterna Hotel seems a slice of paradise.

It opened its doors in 2010, and has since introduced a range of exotic activities.

Guests can harvest the estate's olives and grapes (with their feet), try their hand at soap making, basket weaving or fishing, or can simply tour some of the nearby scenery, including the Jurassic era Kastania Cave.
