"These days concert halls also have remarkable architecture, offering audiences a great show even before they have taken their seats," the report said.

"More and more concert halls are being built that stand out by virtue of their eye-catching shapes, colors and materials."

It highlights the Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan, as an example of an "extraordinary" concert structure: "The white building's curved, wave-like shape makes it seem as if it has been 'poured' into the landscape."

The United States and Spain both get two entries -- Los Angeles' Walt Disney Concert Hall "has the appearance of curved metal plates piled into one other and which ... make the design look like an outlandish fantasy," the report said.

The Sydney Opera House took 14 years to complete, and one concert hall in construction, Hamburg's Elbphilharmonie building, will be completed in 2016, nine years after having started.
