Despite more impending snow and ice potentially impacting attendees' footwear flair, New York Fashion Week will take place February 6-13.

The season's street sense will be inspired by the audacious avenues of Nashville and Austin, Texas, says Aimette. (Chanel's MÃ©tiers d'Art collection for 2013/2014 even took place at Fair Park in Dallas).

"Crop tops are moving towards more boxy tops," says Aimette, citing higher waisted pants paired with short but not midriff-baring blouses.

"The seasons are becoming less about weather-related clothing and more about key items a woman needs for her lifestyle," said Joyann King, Harper's BAZAAR Digital Director.

King says this includes "a wardrobe of coats to lust after."

The sportswear trend will continue but not dominate the ensemble; instead, athletic styling will be used to accent distinctively feminine pieces. Michael Kors paired sneakers with skinny brocade pants in his pre-fall collection.

As for the palette, Aimette says there will be an onslaught of teal and berry tones that are anchored by traditional colors of caramel, gunmetal and navy.
