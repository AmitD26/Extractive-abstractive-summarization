(CNN) -- Did you have a Franz Ferdinand moment when you first heard about Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 crashing in eastern Ukraine?

The reaction from some politicians and hacks suggested they were having such a moment, after the MH17 crash -- hinting that the world would never be the same.

Even before any details of the crash were confirmed, Russia found itself in the dock, accused of being responsible for the deaths of 298 people on board that plane, including citizens of the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia and the Philippines.

According to Kremlin and White House statements on the call, Obama and Putin discussed the crisis on the ground in Ukraine, sanctions and ways to find a diplomatic solution before Putin noted reports that a Malaysian plane had crashed.

Obama probably pretended to believe him but kept an open mind about it, especially as his stern-faced national security advisers -- of whom there are plenty these days -- were likely telling him that everything pointed to Russia playing some part in this tragedy.

Handily, a recording of a supposed phone conversation between two "Russian officers," one in eastern Ukraine and the other in Russia, was produced, intended to prove that they were discussing the downing of the plane.

Some talking heads on the box have been saying that as the separatists have already brought down a number of Ukrainian aircraft they could have shot down flight MH17.

There's only one problem though: all the previous aircraft were flying at much lower altitudes, some actually as low as a few hundred yards from the ground, while flight MH17 was way out of reach of all the shoulder-held antiaircraft missiles that the anti-government forces have in their possession.

Nevertheless, Putin will have a very tough time convincing the world that Russia had nothing to do with the downing of flight MH17. Because on the face of it the circumstantial evidence is against him.

You know, Crimea becoming part of Russia and "pro-Russian separatists" waging a war with government troops in the east with Moscow's backing.

Mind you, the Kremlin has already come up with one brilliant move, saying last night it would refuse to accept the two black boxes from flight MH17 that have been recovered by the anti-government fighters at the place of the crash. In theory that denies Kiev the opportunity to claim that Russia is "tampering" with the evidence ... although Ukraine claimed Friday that Russia held the recording devices nonetheless.

And maybe, just maybe, all the key players will now make a serious effort to try to stop the bloodshed there. And the Franz Ferdinand moment will just be a moment and nothing else.

But he says it would be tough for Kiev to argue how a "rag tag army" could bring down a plane

The tragedy will hopefully focus international attention on ending the Ukraine bloodshed, he says
