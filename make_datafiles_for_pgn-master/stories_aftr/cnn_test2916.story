(CNN) -- Don't ask Justin Bieber about Selena Gomez. It's a touchy subject.

In fact, Bieber appeared reluctant to answer any questions from an attorney for a photographer who accuses Bieber of ordering a bodyguard to attack him last summer.

Several video clips of the deposition, which a Miami judge ordered in the photographer's lawsuit against Bieber, were posted Monday on the celebrity news website TMZ. The release comes just days after another Miami judge released video of Bieber giving a urine sample in jail after an arrest on a driving under the influence charge in January.

In video from the deposition, Bieber primped and winked to the camera at times, but he was a hostile witness for most of the four hours of questioning by Miami lawyer Mark DiCowden, who represents photographer Jeffrey Binion.

"Sounds like you're trying to harass him," his lawyer said.

DiCowden followed up by asking Bieber, 20, if he had "ever discussed his feelings about paparazzi with Gomez?"

"Don't ask me about her again," Bieber answered. He wagged a finger at the lawyer, repeating at least six times, "Don't ask me about her again."

He compared the lawyer to journalist Katie Couric. "It seems like a '60 Minutes' interview," Bieber said.

Evidence of Bieber's reluctance also came when he was asked if he knew "an entertainer by the name of Usher."

"Isn't it true that Usher was instrumental in starting your career?" DiCowden asked.

"I was found on YouTube," Bieber replied. "I think that I was detrimental to my own career."

"Give me a chance to object, ok," his lawyer then whispered to Bieber.

A toxicology report released by Miami Beach police said Xanax was present in Bieber's system when he was arrested on a DUI charge in January.

He faces the DUI charge that could go to a trial in Miami as well as an assault charge in Toronto. A Los Angeles prosecutor also is close to a decision in a possible vandalism case over an alleged egg attack on the mansion of a Bieber neighbor in Calabasas, California.
