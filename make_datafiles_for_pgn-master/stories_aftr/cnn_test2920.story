She became just the fourth women's player in the Open Era to claim the same tournament at least seven times, joining retired legends Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf and Chris Evert.

And no one had ever won seven Miami titles, too.

"It was a really important victory, especially playing Li Na, who has been playing so well," Williams told the crowd. "She started out so well.

"I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I just need to hang in here.' Then I heard some fans trying to pull me through. If it hadn't been for you guys I wouldn't be standing here right now."

But Williams recovered and won 11 of the next 12 games to capture her second title of 2014. She's now 11-1 against Li.

On Sunday, the top two in the men's rankings will also play. World No. 1 Rafael Nadal meets Novak Djokovic -- a day after both received walkovers into the finale.

Kei Nishikori couldn't take on Djokovic because of a groin injury while Tomas Berdych was suffering from a stomach illness and withdrew against Nadal.
