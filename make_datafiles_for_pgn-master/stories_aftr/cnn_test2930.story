(CNN) -- Fox News host Bill O'Reilly says his review of famed Harlem restaurant Sylvia's is being taken out of context and was not racist.

"I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship," he told listeners. "It was the same, and that's really what this society's all about now here in the U.S.A. There's no difference."

And later, speaking with National Public Radio correspondent and Fox analyst Juan Williams, O'Reilly said there "wasn't any kind of craziness at all" during his dinner with Sharpton: "There wasn't one person in Sylvia's who was screaming, 'M.F.-er, I want more iced tea.' "

The comments, part of a broader discussion on the persistence of prejudice in American society, were circulated by Media Matters for America, a left-leaning media watchdog group that has been highly critical of O'Reilly. Other media organizations then picked up the comments.

But on his Fox News television program Tuesday night, O'Reilly said the remarks were being distorted.

"Anybody who listened to it ... would, I think, have appreciated the discussion for being an exposition of why people are afraid not only of blacks but of everybody they don't know," he said.

Elsewhere in the September 19 program, O'Reilly said he was trying to reassure whites -- such as his grandmother, whom he said had an "irrational fear" of blacks -- that rap-star stereotypes of African-Americans "are not true."

"It's outrageous, because the discussion we had was about how too often the images on TV are these rappers glorifying drugs, glorifying violence, degrading women," Williams said.

But Suzan Johnson Cook, a former Clinton administration official, said O'Reilly sounded surprised that a black crowd was so civil.

"Was he expecting people to be jumping all over the place?" she said on CNN's "Out in the Open" on Tuesday. "It's very sad that, in 2007, a man who influences so many people, number one, has that kind of ignorance, who has not been exposed to our culture."

Sharpton said he was already scheduled to appear on O'Reilly's program to discuss the "Jena 6," the black Louisiana teens charged with beating a white classmate amid racial tensions in a small town.

In a written statement, Bill Shine, Fox's vice president for programming, added, "This is nothing more than left-wing outlets stirring up false racism accusations for ratings. It's sad." E-mail to a friend
