Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama told Hispanic leaders and immigration reform activists Thursday that despite frustrations with the delays in fixing the country's immigration system, he's going to need them to have his back.

Obama was interrupted by one heckler that The Hill newspaper identified as Blanca Hernandez, an undocumented immigrant activist, who shouted "we need relief now" and was escorted out by security.

Obama emphasized Thursday that he can't accomplish real, long-term change without what he called the "powerful" Latino vote.

"Si se puede, si votamos. Yes we can, if we vote," Obama told the crowd to applause.

Obama rattled off a list of campaign promises that he said he has kept: from confronting "the crisis of overcrowded classrooms and underfunded schools" to fixing the "broken health care system that left one out of three Hispanics uninsured."

And fixing immigration reform falls under that category of "more."

"Fixing our broken immigration system is one more big thing that we have to do and that we will do," Obama said.
