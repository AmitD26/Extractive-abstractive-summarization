Coach fliers may complain about airline seats, but U.S. airlines are filling those seats pretty successfully. A commenter called withReason7 suggests that consumers are getting what they ask for.

"I will continue to blame the passengers that will sit in any crappy seat as long as it's a little bit cheaper. THAT IS WHY THE AIRLINES ARE DOING THIS. Not because they are mean, because that is what MOST travelers want..."

In the report, a top body measurement expert says Americans are getting bigger, and seat-makers have been basing their designs on the wrong body parts. A seat maker says the industry simply builds what the airlines want. An airline spokesman says passengers are more interested in cost rather than comfort.

Have you seen the new numbers for airline passenger traffic?

Cha-CHING!

Commenter Rick1948 says airlines have some work to do. 

 "The domestic airlines need to get back into the customer service business.  Spread the seats out, get rid of the flight attendants with an attitude or have behinds wider than the drink cart, trash the toy airliners and get the real ones back, and start serving real food again.  Then, charge whatever you need to so you can make a REASONABLE profit.  Those who can afford to fly - will - and those who can't - won't.  Then, at least flying won't approximate the pain of a root canal any more."

Are there any new ideas out there that can spread some sunshine among grumpy fliers? Johnkc suggests bringing in Uncle Sam.

Speaking of the government, Washington is predicting a slight dip in domestic passenger traffic this year, before it starts to rise again in a steep slope that will ultimately see air travel nearly double during the next 20 years.

The flight is full and there is a waitlist. They actually bring a guy on the plane to ask if I was willing to give my 2nd seat up for him. I politely said no, nodded at him and resumed reading my book.

I was terrified of flying because of the bigotry, I sure as hell wasn't going to give up the extra seat I paid for so some guy to take it and then likely complain later."

It's hard to know whether commenter GBGentleman was being serious or facetious when he suggested this:
