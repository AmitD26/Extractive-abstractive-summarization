Rome (CNN) -- Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi began a year of community service for his conviction on tax fraud charges on Friday when he showed up at a senior center near his hometown, Milan.

Upon Berlusconi's arrival at the center, a member of a health care workers' trade union, Pippo Fiorito, staged a small protest against his presence.

Berlusconi gave no comment as he entered the building. His security guards were left outside.

Berlusconi, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, has dominated the lively Italian political scene for the past two decades.

He was handed a four-year sentence last August -- commuted to a year -- for tax fraud at Mediaset, the large commercial broadcaster that Berlusconi founded. He has also been barred from holding public office for two years and was expelled from the Italian Senate in the fall.

Berlusconi continues to protest his innocence and says he has been persecuted by leftist magistrates.
