Hong Kong (CNN) -- Baby formula, pigs, soybeans, oil and iron ore -- a seemingly disparate grouping -- have one thing in common. These commodities are all in high demand from an insatiable and growing China.

Personal choice drives some of this demand. Chinese national interest fuels demand for others.

Regardless, whether by choice or by force, China and its citizens are looking to new markets and buying what they need. It is a sign of things to come, say analysts.

Soybeans: Stuff of oil, tofu and animal feed

China is the world's largest importer of soybeans. The grain is one of the key starting links in the country's food chain, used to make cooking oil, tofu products and in feed for the burgeoning pig industry. In 2012, the world's most populous country imported 59% of the world's soybean supply, according to FAO data, up from about 25% in 2000.

"If they had to produce their own soybeans, they would need to use 28 million hectares," says Cluff. That would mean nearly one-quarter -- about 23% -- of China's total arable land would be used for soybeans, based on China's latest data from 2008. Just 12% of China's total area was arable in 2011, according to the World Bank, compared to 17.5% in the U.S. and 34% in Germany.

"They decided they could not do that (use so much arable land for soybeans) -- so they import," added Cluff.

Pork: '470 million pigs in China'

Besides soybeans, China is the world's biggest consumer of pork products eating "more pig products than the rest of the world combined," says Cluff. "Existing estimates have China at 48% of global consumption."

Oil acquisitions and agreements

But one China economics watcher says the world "shouldn't be too worried" and that demand for food -- and for natural resources from oil to iron ore -- may eventually see decreased demand.

Production costs for foreign multinationals will rise in China, adds Tao, "so a few years down the road we may ask the same questions about Vietnam and India."
