(CNN) -- The two boys abducted by their parents and taken to Cuba were "well cared for" on their trip, their grandmother told reporters.

The children, Chase and Cole, don't know they were abducted, Patricia Hauser said. All they know is they were on an "adventure," she said Thursday.

The boys -- 2 and 4 -- appeared in front of reporters after Hauser spoke, smiling and showing off toys.

Police say their father, Josh Hakken, broke into the home where the boys were living with their grandparents a day later, tying up their grandmother before whisking the two children away. Authorities say they traveled to Cuba on a sailboat.

Authorities reunited the boys with Hauser and her husband on Wednesday after Cuban authorities turned the parents and the children over to U.S. officials.

"They called us from Cuba and let us talk to the boys before their plane even left," she said. "Many tears were shed in that room from us."

She said the family would not have any more news conferences or interviews, and asked that the media and public respect their privacy.

Thursday night, an attorney for the Hakkens agreed to the prosecution's request that the Hakkens remain jailed without bond until trial. The next hearing is May 30.

The judge also appointed a public defender to represent the couple after they said they wouldn't be able to pay for a lawyer on their own.

Later, the state attorney's office filed formal charges against the Hakkens, including two counts of felony kidnapping.

Given Florida sentencing guidelines, a conviction on the kidnapping charges could mean the Hakkens will spend the rest of their lives behind bars.

Police: Parents talked of 'journey to the Armageddon'

The circumstances leading up to the ordeal began in June when the family was staying at a hotel in Slidell, Louisiana.

Responding to a call, police officers found the parents "acting in a bizarre manner," Slidell police said in a statement.

Inside the room where the boys were, authorities found narcotics and weapons.

Louisiana authorities took the children from their parents after that incident.

About two weeks later, the father showed up at a foster family home with a gun and demanded the return of the boys, Slidell police said. He fled after the foster parents called 911.

Over subsequent months, the parents "did not participate in the system," said Sheriff David Gee of Hillsborough County. He did not offer details.

That transfer became official on April 2, when a Louisiana judge terminated the suspects' parental rights.

It was at the Hemingway Marina just west of Havana, on Tuesday, that CNN found the family -- hunkered inside the boat, under the watch of Cuban security forces.

The Cuban Foreign Ministry said the boat pulled into the marina in bad weather Sunday.
