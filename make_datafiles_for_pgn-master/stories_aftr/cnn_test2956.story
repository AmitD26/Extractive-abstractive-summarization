The media focus on 2016 is like a "Rocky Horror Picture Show," without Rocky. It's really an obsession that is not only misguided but also does a disservice both to voters and candidates.

The two-year out speculation track record is pretty bad.

Yes, Clinton is dynamic. Even her most rabid detractors must admit that. But her dynamism is not a guarantee victory. Her nomination is not inevitable.

She knows upfront the toll campaigning demands and what being president exacts. As George Harrison said about being a Beatle, you have to give your nervous system.

Clinton's understudy waits in the wings

Does Clinton want to make a time commitment that could amount to the rest of her life?

Potential candidates may also weigh on her mind. Who else might run if she doesn't? If the rest of the field looks weak, she might feel a sense of duty to her party and her country. If there are strong "next generation" candidates, she may be content, perhaps glad, to work for their success.

Speculation about Republican candidates is even sketchier. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who only a few weeks ago seemed the prime-time contender, now appears on the ropes. Other prominent Republicans have also taken their hits recently -- understandable, given the current fighting among the factions. So, who knows?

I can make one prediction safely: Going through the list of who's up and who's down until the nomination(s) is (are) secured will make any roller coaster ride seem like a walk in the park.

Instead of acting like junior high gossips though, the media might try focusing on real issues that are current and important. There are lots of them out there. I'll focus on one example.

Parsing Biden's words: If Hillary runs, he won't

Trust me, if those two women win their seats, the ripple effect will become a tidal wave. And there are other races where women have raised the stakes. Wendy Davis' bid to be governor of Texas has drawn national attention and already reframed several of the issues in that state.

My point is that we're more than 1,000 days away from the inauguration of the next president, and there's a lot going on now that needs more attention from the media. This year could become a breakthrough for women in American politics. Let's give that the coverage it deserves.

The 2016 election can wait.
