(CNN) -- L'Wren Scott, a notable fashion designer and longtime girlfriend of Mick Jagger, killed herself by "hanging," New York City's chief medical examiner's office announced Wednesday.

Wednesday's announcement makes official what was suspected after news came out about the 49-year-old woman's death.

Business woes may have triggered suicide

A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation earlier said Scott's assistant -- after responding to a text to "come by" -- found the designer hanging from a door knob with a scarf around her neck on Monday morning.

Madonna, Allison Williams and Christina Hendricks were among her celebrity clients.

"I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way," read a statement on the singer's website, MickJagger.com. "We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me."

CNN's Shimon Prokupecz and Elizabeth Landers contributed to this report.
