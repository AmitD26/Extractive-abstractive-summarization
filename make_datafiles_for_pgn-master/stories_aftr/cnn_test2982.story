A five-hour drive from the nearest major airport, the North Rim attracts the sort of visitors inclined to linger. They pause a little longer at the lookouts. They store up on provisions for a hike, and along the route, they'll see ecosystems change as if they'd walked from Canada to Mexico, and the rocks on view age more than a billion years. It's a trip through space and time.

Where to start: North Rim Visitor Center. Get tips from a park ranger, visit the bookstore and take in interpretive programs. nps.gov/grca.

What to do: Mule Trips. Guided rides from an hour-long trip along the rim to a half-day excursion descending 2,300 feet down into the Supai Tunnel. nps.gov/grca, one-hour trip $40, half-day $75, ages 7 and older.

Don't miss: The North Kaibab Trail stretches 14 miles and is the only maintained trail that leads to the Colorado River.

Refuel at Roaring Springs, a half-mile below the rim, and up camp at the Cottonwood Campground, Bright Angel Campground or Phantom Ranch.

After a few days of a week-long trip, something happens. A moment comes when the canyon ceases to be an icon and finally becomes real. In a world where the instantaneous isn't fast enough, the Grand Canyon measures time not in billionths of seconds but in billions of years. You can't tweet the Grand Canyon. The panoramas keep changing, and with every mile, the canyon becomes a living place, not an extra-wide postcard.

Where to stay/eat: El Tovar. The dining room is built of pine and native stone, the veranda views are spectacular, and Teddy Roosevelt himself slept here. grandcanyonlodges.com, rooms from $178 (kids under 16 stay free), wild salmon $24.

Where to go: All-Star Grand Canyon Tours. Guided excursions, from a short, no-sweat option in an SUV to longer backpacking hikes. allstargrandcanyontours.com, adults from $120, kids 4-15 $90, toddlers 3 and under $55.

Don't miss: The most compelling reason for a week in the canyon is to visit both rims. At nearly 9,000 feet, the North Rim sits more than 1,000 feet higher than the South. The extra elevation reverses the familiar perspective and puts you closer to the epic temples and plateaus. Suddenly, amazingly, the Grand Canyon feels new again.
