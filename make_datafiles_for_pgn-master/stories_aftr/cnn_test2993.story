Now, Brown is battling for the Senate again. This time, his arms are wide open for Romney.

"This is the guy who ought to be the next United States senator, and you're going to make him the next United States senator," Romney told the audience Wednesday.

So, why is more Brown more comfortable pairing up with Romney this time around? What changed?

When he was asked about Romney, he would sometimes give a short answer, then change the subject.

"Bringing in a Republican like Romney to talk about you is not what you want to do when you're running as a perceived independent in Massachusetts," said Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.

Now Brown is mounting his own challenge, trying to take down incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in neighboring New Hampshire, a more politically mixed state.

Romney, who's perhaps more popular than ever at the moment, is practically an adopted son of New Hampshire. He has a vacation home here and won the 2012 GOP primary by a wide margin.

And campaigning in a state where he's not "carrying the baggage" as a former governor -- as is the case in Massachusetts -- can help make things less complicated, Smith said.

So, strategically, it's common sense that Brown would welcome Romney in this state, in this year. Jim Merrill, a GOP strategist who led Romney's New Hampshire campaign, said "it's natural" for the two men to want to "link arms" this cycle.

With no clear potential frontrunner in the 2016 GOP presidential race, calls have surged for Romney to make a third White House bid. He insists he's not running, but he hasn't entirely ruled it out. His wife, Ann Romney, told the Washington Post Tuesday that it's a "no" for her husband "at this moment."

On stage Wednesday, Brown echoed sentiments that are fueling renewed interest in Romney.

But is it awkward for them to pair up now after keeping their distance two years ago?

"They know how this all works," he continued. "They're going to do what they can to get as many votes as possible."

And with the Senate race being neck and neck in the final sprint to Election Day, turnout will be a big factor.

"Romney is popular now, and he's going to help Brown get on that front page tomorrow," Levesque said.

At the end of the day, it's the candidates themselves who become the closers of their own race, not their visitors. But having top-of-the-list supporters in town certainly doesn't hurt.
