The FBI charged Howard, a resident of Naperville, Illinois, with one count of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities, a felony. Howard was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries.

The fire started at about 5:40 a.m. Friday and caused the evacuation of the air traffic control center in Aurora, Illinois, which controls flights in several Midwest states.

Airlines at O'Hare canceled 1,550 flights and 470 at Midway, the Chicago Department of Aviation said at 8:45 p.m. Friday. Southwest Airlines suspended all fights for the day at Midway and Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport.

The ripple effect caused the cancellation of flights at airports across the nation. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport had 70 cancellations on Friday, compared to seven on Thursday, according to Flightaware, a flight-tracking website. LaGuardia Airport in New York City had 56 on Friday and 10 on Thursday.

By Friday afternoon, flights to the Chicago airports had resumed at a "reduced rate," authorities said. The effect of the fire on Saturday's flight activity has not been determined and it was not clear when the center would reopen.

Faced transfer to Hawaii

Howard had worked eight years in the center but faced a transfer to Hawaii, the FBI says in an affidavit. The documents don't specify his job title but said he worked in "telecommunications matters."

Police obtained search warrants for Howard's home and found "legal documents that had been laid out in a staged manner, in an attempt to make them easier to find," the affidavit said. The affidavit didn't describe the documents.

CNN affiliate WLS reported that Howard was a machinist mate in the Navy from 1996 to 2000 with nothing unusual about his military record. He had a few traffic citations in 2007, but nothing serious, WLS said.

When the two Chicago airports shut down, controllers at other airports helped manage traffic to and from Chicago.

O'Hare last year handled 883,000 takeoffs and landings, ranking it as the second-busiest airport on the planet, according to Airports Council International.

Travelers stood in long lines inside the O'Hare terminal trying to rearrange flight plans. They described a frustrating scene to CNN reporters.

"There's chaos mixed with outrage," said Bernard Thompson of Washington, D.C., who needs to be home by Sunday for a speaking engagement.

"I'll get there but it's a question of whether I'll have my luggage with me," he said.

The fire ruined travel plans at other airports.

Des Moines International Airport reported 19 cancellations on Friday, according to Flightaware, including the flight that would have carried Chelsea and Bill Wright to New York City.

Other control centers pitch in to help

Doug Church, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association union, said air traffic controllers braced for a tough day. "Indianapolis Center is one of the major facilities bearing the brunt of the extra workload today due to the Chicago Center situation," Church said.

O'Hare is a main hub for United Airlines and other major carriers, with flights headed to international destinations. When controllers stop flights scheduled to fly to O'Hare, it has the potential to trigger a line of falling air traffic dominoes that will ruin travel plans for countless would-be passengers.

Smoke at FAA facility stopped flights in May

Friday's flight stoppages come four months after smoke at an FAA radar facility in Elgin, Illinois, prompted flight cancellations and delays at O'Hare and Midway.

The smoke in that May incident was caused by a faulty motor in an air conditioning system, the FAA said at the time.
