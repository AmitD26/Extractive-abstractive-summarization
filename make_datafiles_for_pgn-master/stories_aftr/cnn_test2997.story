(CNN) -- Caroline Gold calls out to her three children as she takes pizza bagels out of the oven. Shai, 18 months old, runs to her high chair chanting, "Pizza, pizza!" Natanel, 7, comes in from another room in their Atlanta home.

They join their sister, Eden, who is already at the table.

Randy Gold sits down next to his son while Caroline puts food on everyone's plates. They seem like the quintessential family, in what could be any household in America.

Eden has a progressive neurological disorder called Mucolipidosis Type IV, also known as ML4. It's a rare genetic disease that is more common among Ashkenazi Jews, or people of Eastern and Central European Jewish descent. There is no treatment or cure. Eden's mental development was halted at 18 months old. She is expected to go blind by age 12.

Doctors say she will not live beyond early adulthood.

Eden's diagnosis was confirmed just before the Jewish New Year in September 2009. Instead of focusing on the wonderful things the next year would bring, Caroline says their family's dreams were shattered.

ML4 is preventable. So how did this happen?

Screening assesses a couple's reproductive risk, says Karen Arnovitz Grinzaid, a genetic counselor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. Couples who are both carriers for the same disease have a 25% chance of passing that disease onto their children.

Many of these disorders are fatal, says Dr. Stephen Warren, the chair of the department of human genetics at Emory, and they can severely impact patients' quality of life.

When Randy and Caroline met, their love blossomed quickly. They dated for eight months before getting engaged and were married three months later. They didn't waste time starting a family either. Fifteen months after their walk down the aisle, they welcomed Natanel into their lives. The Golds, now a family, were living the dream.

But when Eden was just 3 months old, Caroline started wondering whether something was wrong with her precious little girl. She couldn't quite put her finger on it. At first Eden didn't seem to be meeting her milestones on time. Then they noticed she had low muscle tone. At 9 months, Eden started physical therapy and had surgery to correct her crossed eyes. Doctors hoped she'd have a better view of the world and everything else would fall into place.

The pediatrician continued to reassure Caroline that every child develops at her own rate. At one point, Caroline was even told she should stop comparing her second child to her first and just enjoy her daughter.

Against their pediatrician's advice, they took Eden to a neurologist who did an MRI on her brain. Caroline and Randy hold back tears as they remember the phone call from the neurologist at 9:30 p.m. He didn't know what was wrong with their daughter, he said, but it wasn't good.

The neurologist ran more tests before referring Eden to a geneticist. The geneticist thought it might be a Jewish genetic disease, but the Golds told him they had been screened.

As difficult as it was to hear the news about Eden, the Golds never ask, "Why us?"

They started by creating a comprehensive education program to teach doctors, rabbis and young couples in their community about the risks. Then they lobbied insurance companies and medical labs to standardize genetic screening, make it more accessible and lower the cost.

There's no trip to the doctor or needle needed to draw blood. People who are interested in being screened can visit JScreen.org, read about the screening test and request a kit.

Unlike direct-to-consumer genetic testing, offered by companies such as 23andMe, JScreen is a nonprofit program with an educational component. Every request for screening is reviewed by a genetic counselor at Emory University before a kit is sent out to make sure that the patient fully understands what the results can (and cannot) tell them.

But genetics is a rapidly changing field; the human body has hundreds of thousands of genes and mutations, and new ones are being discovered.

New screening tests are also being developed quickly. When the Golds were married in 2004, screening tests were available for 16 Jewish genetic diseases. Now scientists can screen for up to 19.

The ability to make informed decisions

Warren says parents of children affected by these types of diseases overwhelmingly say they would have wanted to know before they became pregnant. Armed with the right knowledge, a couple may chose to avoid the risk by using alternative pregnancy paths, such as adoption or in vitro fertilization.

If there's a risk, a couple could also choose to have amniocentesis or CVS testing done during pregnancy to check the fetus. The results could give the parents time to plan for the birth of a baby that will need special care. Or they may choose to end the pregnancy, says Grinzaid.

The Golds celebrated the Jewish New Year again last week with their three beautiful children. This year, they are hoping to encourage 7,000 people to get screened for preventable genetic diseases.

"Eden is here to save lives, and if that's what she's here to do, there is no life more noble than that," Randy says.
