(CNN) -- U.S. and Australian officials are warning of an online threat against international teachers in the Middle East.

"The Mission is unaware of any specific, credible threat against any Americans or other school or individual in the United Arab Emirates," the embassy said Wednesday. "Nonetheless, the Mission is working with local schools identified with the United States to review their security posture."

Australian officials issued a similar security alert, citing a recent posting on a jihadist website encouraging attacks against teachers, including Australian teachers, at international schools around the world.

The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, issued a similar warning on October 27, citing schools in the areas of Jeddah and the Cairo suburb of Maadi as examples of potential targets.

But the mission in Riyadh also said it was unaware of any specific, credible threat against any American school or person in Saudi Arabia.

â€¢ Having a plan of what to do if demonstrations or violence starts.

â€¢ Keeping a low profile while in public.
