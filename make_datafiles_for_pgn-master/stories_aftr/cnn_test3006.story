As you can imagine, Connor flashes a great smile and a lot of flesh.

He does not, however, ever flash a condom.

And here, ladies and gentlemen, is where the conversation gets a bit uncomfortable. For as much as the network show is somewhat revolutionary for its willingness to showcase same-sex lovemaking, there is a question of how responsible that portrayal is.

This week, we observed World AIDS Day, and we are reminded that in 2014 the virus may be manageable, but it isn't cured. It still kills. There are 35 million living with HIV the world over, and 19 million don't know it. And in the United States, men who have sex with men make up 63% of all new infections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It isn't realistic to expect a character on TV to double as a public service announcement. But since only 32 of the 813 prime-time scripted series regulars are LGBT -- and not many of those 32 are seen having sex (especially like Connor) -- it seems reasonable to have high expectations for their behavior.

"The interesting thing is when Connor is engaging in sex there actually has been condoms in the scene, they just have never made the final shot. When Connor was with Oliver, there were condoms on the table by the bed; when he had sex with Pax, there was a condom on the set then."

If a gay character is having safer sex and no one sees it, is he really having it?

"You never see James Bond pull out a condom," Falahee said. "Maybe society has progressed to the point where we can treat heterosexual scenes and homosexual scenes the same. Or maybe there is something socially that makes us all uncomfortable about seeing a couple on TV pause to use protection no matter who that couple is."

Falahee's character has become a bit of a lightning rod for a litany of sex and society stories in the media, from The Washington Post to BuzzFeed.

"I'm aware of the conversations that are happening today about drugs that can prevent you from contracting HIV," Falahee said. "It's a really important one to have, and not a lot of people know about them."

He is referring to pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP for short. Essentially it is treatment as prevention. And while there are some, such as AIDS activist Larry Kramer, who question the logic of taking medicine before you are sick, that is in fact something we already do.

Last summer I attended the first White House symposium on HIV/AIDS specifically targeting the LGBT community and was shocked to learn that black gay and bisexual youth -- men having sex with men, or MSM -- between the ages of 13 and 24 account for 55% of new MSM infections in that age group.

Neil Giuliano, CEO of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, told me that while it is true young men of color are more likely to contract the virus than other groups, it is important that activists and media alike push the information out to everyone to end AIDS.

It's a sentiment echoed by Darrel Cummings, chief of staff at the Los Angeles LGBT Center. "We have not been parental in this," he said. "We tell people this is one of the tools that's helpful in stopping the transmission of HIV and let them make up their own minds. There are naysayers out there. There are people who say PrEP encourages people to be promiscuous, but that hasn't been our experience."

People still smoke.

People still drink and drive.

People still eat poorly.

Having a TV character talk about safe sex is not the silver bullet that will kill AIDS. But it is another mode of disseminating critical information in the fight, much in the way Vice President Joe Biden cited "Will & Grace" as a show that helped change the country's attitude toward same-sex marriage.
