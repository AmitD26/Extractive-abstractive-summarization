Syria's government-run Syria TV channel and news agency SANA said Sunday afternoon that 611 people were convoyed out of the city of Homs.

Vehicles from the Red Crescent and United Nations had a difficult time entering the city over the weekend as they were targeted by gunfire and explosives.

A photo on the Twitter feed of the Syrian Red Crescent showed dozens of people standing in the rubble of a street as aid workers passed out supplies and food.

"Although the team was shelled and fired upon we managed to deliver 250 food parcels,190 hygiene kits and chronic diseases medicines," the organization said in a tweet on Saturday.

The convoy left, but two of the four trucks were damaged and had to be left behind, the organization said.

A Wall Street Journal reporter in Syria told CNN that workers in the convoy had no doubt the fire came from government forces. But Sam Dagher said al-Barazi told him it was two rival rebel factions -- one that wants to keep civilians as human shields and another that wants to exchange them for aid.

Valerie Amos, the U.N. humanitarian chief, lamented Saturday that the "three-day humanitarian pause agreed (upon) was broken today and aid workers (were) deliberately targeted."

"Today's events serve as a stark reminder of the dangers that civilians and aid workers face every day across Syria," said Amos, who applauded "the courage and tenacity" of U.N. and Red Crescent aid workers.

Video from the scene posted by activists showed bullet holes in the aid vehicles and damage to buildings from explosions.

The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency had reported that four Syrian Arab Red Crescent workers were wounded Saturday by gunfire from "terrorist groups" while trying to deliver aid.

First civilians evacuated

The killing flared anew Saturday across the nation, with more than 80 people killed, 10 of them children and six women, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported. Five of the deaths occurred in Homs, it said.

"Each and every barrel bomb filled with metal shrapnel and fuel launched against innocent Syrians underscores the barbarity of a regime that has turned its country into a super magnet for terror," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said last week in a statement after another reported barrel-bomb attack on the northern city, which has become a flashpoint in the war.
