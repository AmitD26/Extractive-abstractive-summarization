A survivor told Indonesian immigration officials that his boat was part of a group of boats carrying about 1,200 people who were set adrift by Thai military forces who had found them.

A Thai foreign ministry spokesman told CNN Tuesday that his government was aware of the report coming out of Indonesia. "

"We have to listen to that but we need to verify, and there shall be no judgment made yet," Tharit Charungwat said.

Meanwhile, delegates from five countries -- Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar -- went to Thailand's Ranong province Tuesday, prompted by such allegations.  Watch a report on more refugees washed ashore in Indonesia Â»

Allegations arose a month ago that a group of Myanmar's Rohingya minority -- who have been fleeing their homeland for years, saying they are persecuted by its military government -- had been dumped at sea by Thai military authorities.

A recent CNN investigation found evidence of such activity. Photos obtained by CNN include one that shows the Thai army towing a boatload of about 190 refugees. CNN also interviewed a refugee who said he was one of the few who had survived after a group of six rickety boats was towed back to sea and abandoned by Thai authorities earlier this month.

The Thai government has launched an inquiry. The Thai army has denied the allegations.

The source defended it, saying that each boatload of refugees was given sufficient supplies of food and water.

The Thai government has said that "there is no reasonable ground to believe" that the Rohingya were fleeing Myanmar because of persecution.

"Their profile and their seasonal travel further support the picture that they are illegal migrants, and not those requiring international protection," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued in late January.

One of the refugees who came ashore in late January said they would be killed if returned to Myanmar because of their minority status. He said the Rohingya are stateless because they lack bribe money to obtain identification cards in Myanmar.
