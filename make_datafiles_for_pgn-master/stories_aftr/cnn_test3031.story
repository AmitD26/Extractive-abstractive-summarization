Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, may be frustrated with the President's anticipated executive action on immigration, but he's not looking to shutdown the government again to stop him.

"There is no Republican -- not one -- who wants a government shutdown," Cruz said on Fox Wednesday. "The only person on this planet who wants a shutdown is President Obama."

"I'm sorry to say, the President is behaving in an unprecedented way," Cruz said. "There is not in recent times any parallel for a President repudiated by the voters standing up and essentially telling the voters, 'Go jump in a lake'. He's going to force his powers."

Once seen as an obstructionist -- for his 2013 government shutdown crusade -- the potential 2016 contender is changing his strategy this time around for defying the President.

In the plan, Cruz told Fox News that incoming Senate Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, should threaten to block any nominations by the President, with the exception of those for vital national security positions.

He also said Congress should use the power of the purse to pass appropriation legislation that limits the power of both the Congress and the President to spend money on the President's executive action, once all other necessary government agencies and functions are funded.

While Cruz says legislative action is the best way to move forward to combat the President's initiative, a few of his GOP colleagues -- and potential 2016 rivals -- said they felt a lawsuit would be more appropriate.
