Ray Duggan will be the first to tell you just how tough he was. Raised to never run from a fight, Duggan started running with a gang at 14.

With his father in prison and absent from his life, the gang was everything to Duggan.

"I had to make myself meaner and tougher," he said.

Duggan thought he might one day get shot and killed. He never expected to get shot and paralyzed.

What happens when you don't die?

"It was right there. That's where I ended up getting shot ... I fell into the street right here," he said.

For Joel Irizarry, a former gang member from Chicago's northwest side, the memory of the moment he was shot is just as clear. On May 6, 1998, from the driver's window of his car, Irizarry watched a rival step out of an alley, raise his pistol and fire a single shot.

The bullet went through the seat and hit Irizarry in the spine, he said. He was instantly paralyzed. One bullet was all it took.

A double life

Irizarry says he joined a gang for protection. He was a skinny, scared 15-year-old in a neighborhood where there were shootings nearly every day. He couldn't get to school without being harassed, chased, or beaten up, he said.

He maintained a good GPA at school, and at home he was a caring son and a good brother for his younger siblings, Irizarry said. But out on the streets, he said, "I made less than favorable decisions."

Whether it's drug dealing or gang activities, the outcomes you hear about are always the same, Irizarry said.

"You only hear about death or jail. You never hear about this disability," he said.

According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, acts of violence, primarily gunshot wounds, are the third leading cause of spinal cord injury among American adults.  Experts say young, uninsured men are affected disproportionately.

The cost to society is huge. Health care can cost up to a $1 million per patient in the first year alone, and up to $181,000 for each year after that.

Everyday tasks are beyond challenging. For Duggan, just going to the bathroom is difficult. "It really humbles you," he said.

And being intimate with another person?

Duggan lives on his own in a small house that is barely wheelchair accessible. Still, he insists on doing most things himself.

"Just because I'm in a wheelchair," he said, "if I don't do something and have to ask someone else, it's like giving up." His biggest health threat, he says, is the bedsores he gets from being in his chair.  When we visited Duggan, he had just come home from the hospital after one of his bedsores became infected.

A high price to pay

Duggan no longer looks at the medical bills that come. He knows he cannot afford the cost of his care. In the first year of his recovery, Duggan estimates, he had more $1 million in health care bills that were passed on to taxpayers. The ongoing cost of hospital stays for bedsores, he says, is about $40,000 a year.

Because victims are "disproportionately young and uninsured," she said, "the cost is borne by the rest of us."

Irizarry was 17 and uninsured when he got shot. He feels those paralyzed by gun violence are forgotten victims.

"Every once in a while you'll see or hear something in the news about the aftermath, but not enough," he said.

Irizarry believes if people were more aware of the cost to society, more might be done to find solutions to the violence.

The bystander

Michael Brown, 56, was an innocent bystander when a bullet struck him while he was driving in a Chicago suburb on May 3 of this year.

"You know, I don't hold any bitterness or anger. I just want the violence to stop," he said, as a tear rolled down his cheek.

From gang war to peace

Duggan works at the Institute for the Study & Practice of Nonviolence in Providence. That job -- and the people he meets through it -- give him reason, he says, to go on.

"I can give up, just sit on disability and just not do nothing with my life and stay home and just freakin' fade away," said Duggan. "I'd much rather do something, and this is why I do the work I do now."

Irizarry mentored young men who were making mistakes similar to those he made and helped those with spinal cord injuries.  He just graduated with a master's degree in social work, and he's working full-time as an admission coordinator at Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital in Chicago until he gets his license to practice social work.

"They say everything happens for a reason. This might be my reason. Just so I can prevent somebody from following my same road,"  he said.
