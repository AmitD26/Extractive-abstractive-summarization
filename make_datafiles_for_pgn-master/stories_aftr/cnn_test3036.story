Whitney Houston's only child opened up Sunday about her late mother in her first interview since the singer's death last month.

Bobbi Kristina Brown, 19, told Oprah Winfrey she can still hear her mother's voice sometimes and feel her spirit, urging her to "keep moving."

Whitney Houston, 48, died February 11 in her room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, the day before the music industry gathered for the Grammys in Los Angeles.

When asked whether she feared drugs would one day take her friend, Patricia Houston told Winfrey she "would be kidding" to say otherwise. "The handwriting was kind of on the wall."

The grief comes in waves still, Brown said, and sometimes it doesn't seem real that her mother is gone.

"I'm getting through it. I'm doing as good as I possibly can," she said. "Just trying to keep going."

She was interviewed briefly by Beverly Hills police the day her mother died, but she was too distraught to offer helpful information, the sources said. She was taken twice to a Los Angeles hospital briefly after her mother's death, a source close to the family said last month.

Authorities are reviewing additional medical information that will be used in the final ruling on cause of death, and Houston's toxicology report should be complete "on or around" March 23, the sources said.

More official details on the investigation haven't been released because the Beverly Hills Police Department was granted a "security hold" on the case, the coroner's office said. Common in high-profile cases, the hold restricts the release of information.

Authorities have said that police and fire officials were called to Houston's hotel room after her unconscious body was found in the bathtub, just hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy party.

A coroner official last month downplayed the suspicion that drugs had played a major role in Houston's death.

Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said that "not many prescription bottles" were found in the singer's hotel room.
