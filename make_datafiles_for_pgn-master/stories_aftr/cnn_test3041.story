The wail of sirens and the firing of tear gas canisters echoed through the streets of the Tunisian capital, Tunis, for a second day Thursday, as the political turmoil triggered by the assassination of an opposition leader continued to spur unrest.

The unrest calmed overnight but broke out anew Thursday, as young protesters threw rocks at security forces on a central Tunis boulevard. Police responded with tear gas, and officers riding double on motorcycles chased demonstrators.

Other plainclothes police officers went door to door, looking for people who had been on the streets.

As soon as the protestors would head back to the street, they would be met by more tear gas.

This cat-and-mouse lasted all day, but the protesters refused to leave.

Late Wednesday, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali, head of the moderate religious party Ennahda, sacked his Cabinet and called for new elections, leaving himself at the head of a caretaker government.

Jebali's move came soon after violent clashes broke out in front of the Interior Ministry in Tunis, where police used tear gas to disperse protesters angered by the assassination of Belaid.

One police officer died after he tackled looters amid the disturbances Wednesday, Tunisia's state-run news agency TAP quoted an interior ministry official as saying.

The French Embassy in Tunisia said all French-run schools in the North African country would be closed on Friday and Saturday.

Belaid had criticized the government, saying it was not doing enough to take on hardline Salafists.

Support for Belaid went beyond his own party, the secular-leftist Democratic Patriots. He was the voice of a large coalition of secular opposition parties known as the Popular Front and had a reputation for decrying violence.

Amna Guellali, of the rights group Human Rights Watch, said the government bears some responsibility for his death because of its "laxity" in failing to respond to a climate of rising political violence.

"We warned the government that these incidents of violence should be investigated thoroughly and that people who have perpetrated these acts should be punished ... but we haven't heard anything back," she told CNN in Tunis.

The climate of intimidation included calls by preachers in some mosques in July for the killing of certain Tunisian political figures and personalities, including Chokri Belaid, she said.

"We didn't see the government reacting to these calls of clear incitement to murder," she said. "A government has to protect its citizens ... especially if there are clear threats against this person."

Belaid's brother, Abdelmajid Belaid, blamed Jebali's party for the killing, and angry protesters stormed Ennahda offices Wednesday.

Interior Minister Ali al-Areed, who denied any involvement by his party, vowed to track down the killers and joined the chorus of moral indignation, calling Belaid's assassination "an attack on all Tunisians."

At the same time, he asked that protests remain peaceful. "We do not want the country to fall into chaos," he said on Tunisian state TV.

Although it remains unclear who might have been behind his murder, it is highly unlikely that Ennahda played a role, as some have alleged, she said. The party is moderately Islamist and is made up of seasoned politicians who have waited a long time to be able to govern, she said.

Women's Minister Sihem Badi told CNN that it was important that Tunisians remain united at this difficult time.

People are worried that the upheaval may lead to a return to the situation as it was before the Arab Spring revolution, said Badi, a member of the Congress for the Republic party.

To prevent that from happening, it is vital that Tunisia remains committed to the process begun two years ago, she said, with the country's political parties, media and civil society coming together to safeguard the freedoms and democratic progress won by the people.

"We must protect our revolution," she said. "We need time, we need patience, we need the agreement of many partners -- we can't work alone."

Badi said the violent protests that broke out Wednesday were a natural response to the shocking death of Belaid. But, she said, such clashes are unusual in Tunisia and she does not expect them to continue.

The attack was "a clear message to Tunisians ... shut up, or we kill you," Abdelmajid Belaid said. He said his brother had been "receiving threats of murder for a long time," including a text message Tuesday.
