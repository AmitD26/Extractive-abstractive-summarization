In the age of personalization, a Finnish company is bringing 3D technology to the world of bespoke men's footwear.

Inside the London store of the Left Shoe Company -- just one of seven locations around the world -- a space-age platform sits among scaling shelves decked with beautifully made, traditional men's shoes.

After selecting the model and style from the store's catalogue, the shoes are made by traditional craftsmen in Portugal and delivered to the customer anywhere in the world in up to 6 weeks.

The simplicity for the customer is also an added bonus, explains Hauggard: "It allows you to shop online and know exactly what you're going to get, whereas if you go to other e-commerce sites you may have to buy two or three sizes and return two of them. It doesn't make a lot of economic sense."

In turn, the savings is passed on to the customer. The Left Shoe Company's footwear costs around $640, about half of what a traditional shoemaker might charge.

Luxury embraces digital

"It's a sector that doesn't really embrace change and that includes technology and e-commerce," says Allegra Perry, a senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. But, she says, across the board, technology is becoming an increasingly big feature in the luxury goods sector.

The benefit of made-to-measure footwear, he says, is that it involves minimum waste. "We make the shoes one by one when an individual customer orders them. If we don't sell many of a certain style, it doesn't matter."

He's convinced that tradition with a tech twist will catch on: "We have adopted this technology early, but I have no doubt that other companies will catch up quickly."

There is still an important place for bespoke in this world of ready-to-wear, says Haugaard. "We had a gentleman in the other day and he ordered one shoe in a size 9 and one in a size 7. Where else would you go? The only alternative is to buy two pairs of shoes."

A majority of the population, he points out, have different sized feet and, by bringing together high-technology and traditional craftsmanship, the Left Shoe Company is making high-end, made-to-measure shoes a more attainable dream.
