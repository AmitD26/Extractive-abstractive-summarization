"Without even shining my light on it, it was clear that it has weight to it, and it was metal or gold," Tovin said.

Inscribed on the large, gold ring were the initials RLP and the date 1974. The ring also displayed the name of a nearby school: the College of Charleston. With those clues, Tovin's journey to return the jewelry began.

Tovin first called the college's alumni association. The college determined that only two people who graduated in 1974 had those initials, and one was female.

Tovin soon learned that like so many other things in life, this very simple college ring -- lost for so many years -- had more meaning to it than many will ever understand.

Another man's treasure

"My dad was a storyteller, kind of a used-car salesman at times," Eric Phillips said.

Robert Phillips was boating on the Cooper River with his future wife, Nancy, when he lost the ring in 1974 -- just two weeks after he got it.

"He was very upset and hated to tell his mom that he lost it," Nancy Phillips said.

A symbol of success

Growing up without his father in his life, Robert Phillips was determined to succeed on his own. He graduated from the College of Charleston with a degree in business administration.

Tovin hoped he could return the cherished ring to Phillips at his home, but Phillips -- now fighting cancer -- was not there. He was rushed into surgery at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston last weekend for brain surgery.

"I was down there fighting strong currents and alligators trying to get you your ring back," said Tovin, as Phillips smiled.

"And I've got it here, and I know this is going to look like I'm proposing to you, so please don't tell my wife, OK," he said, as the room erupted in laughter.

"Wow. That is awesome," Phillips said.

How was a class ring found after 13 years?

Coming full circle

Then, Phillips began to tell Tovin and everyone the story that his family has heard endlessly -- the story of the lost ring.

"I was on the back of the boat. And I decided I needed a beer," he said softly.

"I pulled the pop top and when I did, my finger got caught in the pop top, and it went with it," he told Tovin.

"I guess I have to go have it sized now, don't I," he added with a grin.

With his wife and two children watching this reunion of sorts, they all felt this ring would give their patriarch the comfort he needs right now.

"No matter how much time he has with us, we'll always have that ring. And it will always signify a good season of our life and a good memory of our father, and the fact that he got to share in it before he left us," Eric Phillips said.

In some ways, this decades-long loop of life has been closed, and a new story -- one that the Phillips family will be telling for generations -- has been written.

"Thank you Lord that I got it back," Robert Phillips said.
