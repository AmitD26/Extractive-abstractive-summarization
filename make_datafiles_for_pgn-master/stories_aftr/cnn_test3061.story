(CNN) -- Well, that's one way to crowdsource.

"Parks and Recreation" star Aziz Ansari tweeted Sunday that he was bored on a flight, and what followed had all of the makings of a Hollywood movie.

"Dude. For real. Is any studios into GHOST PLANE? I can make it cheap. It's all one location. Just the plane," Ansari tweeted.

The idea goes like this, according to Ansari's tweets: "Open on Indian guy RAJ (Aziz Ansari) saying bye to his parents. He gets on the plane. But this plane is actually a GHOST PLANE. #GhostPlane."

Because of course it's Liam freaking Neeson.

Fans were really into it. On person tweeted, "Now I can't sleep because @azizansari is telling the most magnificent story #GhostPlane" while another said, "A studio needs to pick up @azizansari's #GhostPlane IMMEDIATELY. If not we'll just make a kickstarter. It'll be cheap."

What a cliffhanger.
