Although the show is over 40 years old, this year's event, held from January 6 - 9, saw some of the most futuristic products ever, from driverless vehicles to a revolutionary battery which, according to its makers, could let you fully charge a cell phone in minutes.

"Quality time in private space will be the true luxury goods in the future," said Dieter Zetsche, head of Mercedes-Benz cars in his CES keynote speech.

2. People controlled objects with a wave of the hand.

The $269.99 device was named as a 2015 CES Innovation Awards Honoree in November 2014.

4. People scooted around on intelligent skateboards.

The IO Hawk is a "Intelligent mobility device" which can travel at 6.2 mph. It is powered by batteries and moves in response to pressure from your feet.

The $1,799.99 device is 4.3 inches high and created a real buzz among the CES crowd.

ChihiraAico is probably the most realistic robot you've ever seen, and according to Toshiba will be used in the healthcare industry.

6. A smart belt adjusted itself based on how much people ate.

The Emiota Smart Belt keeps track of your overall health using your waist size and will also auto adjust after a big meal to keep you comfortable.

The belt, which has not yet hit the market, can also nudge you when you've been stationary for too long.

7. Phones were charged in minutes.

StoreDot, an Israeli start-up, showed off its super-fast charger, which it claims works up to 100 times faster than others and can be used for phones, tablets, laptops and wearable tech.

The technology hasn't been proven and is not yet available to consumers, but according to the BBC the product already has backing from Samsung and Russian businessman Roman Abramovich and StoredDot says it has begun working on a product to charge electric vehicles.
