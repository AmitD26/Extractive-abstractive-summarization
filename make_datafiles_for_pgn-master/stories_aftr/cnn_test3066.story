The Israel Security Agency released the identities of two suspects in the kidnapping of three teenage boys from Jewish settlements in the West Bank two weeks ago.

"The Israel Security Agency established less than a day after the kidnapping ... that Hamas was believed to be behind the June 12 abduction, the ISA said in a statement Thursday

"Hamas activists from Hebron,"  Marwan Kawasmeh, 29, and Amar Abu-Isa, 32,  were behind the abductions, the intelligence agency said.

Both men have been arrested by Israeli security forces before, according to an ISA news release.  Kawasmeh served a 10-month prison sentence.

"In his most recent investigation, in 2010, (Kawasmeh) admitted to having been recruited to the Hamas military wing in the Hebron area in 2009," ISA said. Abu-Isa was detained several times between 2005 and 2007.

Lt. Col. Peter Lerner of the Israel Defense Forces said Thursday  that both men have "a history of terrorist activity" and both were "suspects immediately after the kidnapping."

The three teenagers, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frenkel, both 16, and Eyal Yifrach, 19, were last seen around Gush Etzion, on the Israeli side of the West Bank barrier late on June 12 or early on June 13, according to the IDF.
