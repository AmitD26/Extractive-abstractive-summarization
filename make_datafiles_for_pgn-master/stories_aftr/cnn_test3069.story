London (CNN)Amid massive global interest in the trial, appeal and retrial of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, it has been easy to overlook their alleged victim, Meredith Kercher, who was found brutally murdered in the flat she shared with Knox in Italy in 2007.

Knox and Sollecito were convicted of Kercher's murder in 2009 but were acquitted and released from prison on appeal in 2011. In March 2013, Italy's Supreme Court overturned the pair's acquittals, saying that the jury did not consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered.

Lyle Kercher, Meredith's brother, said: "Nothing is going to bring Meredith back, nothing will take away the horror of what happened for her."

"No one remembers Meredith, while the two defendants write books, speak to the media and earn money," Maresca said.

When Knox made the media rounds to promote her memoir in May 2013, Kercher's sister said the family was not interested in reading the book.

Despite the focus on Knox's endless travails, Kercher's family and friends remain determined to keep her memory alive.

Kercher was just 21 when she was killed in the villa she rented with Knox in the central Italian university town of Perugia. Her body was found semi-naked and her throat had been slashed.

Kercher was a third-year student at the University of Leeds focusing on European Studies when she got the chance to live in Perugia for a year to study European Politics and Italian.

Her father John told the Daily Telegraph: "She fought so hard to get out there. There were quite a few setbacks but she was determined to go and kept persisting and eventually got what she wanted."

Her family later described how she was "excited at the prospect of spending the year studying there to improve her language skills, make new friends and immerse herself in the culture. She was pursuing her dream."

Hayward told the Sunday Telegraph in 2011 that Kercher, known to her friends as "Mez," became "frustrated" by Knox's refusal to do cleaning and was unhappy that her flatmate kept a sex toy on open display in a bathroom cabinet.

Her India-born mother Arline gave an interview to Italian television show Porta a Porta in September 2011 in which she described Meredith's love of life.

Her father, a freelance journalist who wrote a book about his daughter -- "Meredith" -- described her as a "beautiful, intelligent and caring girl whom everyone loved" in a story for the Daily Mail newspaper, before the book's release.

"I hope our telling the world about the enchanting, generous, kind person that Meredith was can help those whose lives she touched," he wrote. "I also hope this book might help to keep Meredith's case in the spotlight, and, in some small way, to keep alive the hope that we might yet know the truth about her death."

John Kercher wrote about the moment he learned the British student killed in Perugia was his daughter. He'd spoken to her the day before.

"I drop the phone," he wrote in Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper. "I don't believe it and think there must be a mistake. But I know it's probably true. I can't cry. I'm numb with shock."

He also told about hearing that some of Meredith's friends planned to lay flowers at her old school after her death.

Expecting just a few, he and Arline arrived to find more than 70 people, some having come from around the country. "It's unbelievably touching," John Kercher recalled. A trust fund had been set up to support the Kercher family's fight for justice.

"Meredith is not only a terrible loss to her family and friends, she is also a huge loss to the world," he said.

Richard Ottaway, the member of parliament for Coulsden, was taken aback by Meredith's funeral at Croydon Minster. "It was packed and overflowing," he told CNN. "It was quite clear Meredith was a popular girl ... so many friends there. It was the perhaps moving service I have ever been to."

The priest who took the service described how Meredith's parents dealt with that emotionally charged day. "They were very, very courageous," said Canon Colin Boswell, vicar of Croydon. "They had great dignity and calm sort of dignity which they maintained right up until now."
