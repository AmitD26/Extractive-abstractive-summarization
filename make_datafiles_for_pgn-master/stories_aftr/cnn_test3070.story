Listen to how loud tea party forces are this week and it will remind you of a valuable lesson: for some conservatives, the 2014 wins are likely to translate into more disappointment -- not more power.

Transcript: President Obama's immigration address

In Monday's conservative Red State morning briefing, Item No. 1 is a complaint against the GOP leadership:

"They preemptively surrendered and now want to both nibble at Obamacare instead of end it and they want to fund the President's immigration plan. House Republicans, this week, are set to fund Barack Obama's amnesty plan with the help of House Democrats. If you want to stop amnesty, you must flood the offices of members of congress with phone calls. There's no other way. They need to hear from you and that you demand they keep their promises."

It's the kind of talk that in the past has put Speaker Boehner on thin ice -- and remember we did have a brief government shutdown not all that long ago because he could not corral -- and control -- the tea party forces.

So why are tea party forces so frantic about the votes this week? Remember, the GOP establishment candidates won most of the contested Republican primaries this year, part of what McConnell openly called his bid to "crush" the tea party.

That's why more Republicans in Washington, D.C. next year will not translate into more tea party votes in the big internal GOP battles. To the contrary.

So while it would be wrong to consider this week the tea party's last stand -- its forces promise to regroup and recover -- the last big act of the old Congress is going to be very important in setting the tone for the new Congress.
