Earth Day is focusing efforts on creating "A Billion Acts of Green" in 2012.

Billed as "the world's largest environmental service campaign," organizers hope the effort will demonstrate widespread support for coordinated action to tackle environmental issues.

The environment has been "put on the backburner by world leaders," according to Kathleen Rogers, president of Earth Day Network.

"That's why we're coming together on the Mall and standing in solidarity with millions of people at thousands of Earth Day events around the world," Rogers said in a statement on the Earth Day web site.

Earth Day was conceived by U.S. senator Gaylord Nelson in 1970 after he witnessed a massive oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara, California the previous year.

In 1990, Earth Day saw 200 million people participate in 141 countries, according to organizers and by the turn of the century over 5,000 environmental groups worldwide were involved.
