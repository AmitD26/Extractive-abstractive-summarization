(CNN) -- This World Cup is no protector of reputations.

Argentina certainly counts as one of a pool of nations capable of capturing glory, but its performances so far have shown a worrying brittleness.

Still, it just keeps on winning and can now look forward to a last eight clash with either the United States or Belgium.

The latest side to come close to toppling La Albiceleste was Switzerland, but just like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran and Nigeria before them, one moment of magic was all that separated the two in Tuesday's penultimate last-16 clash.

With the contest a matter of seconds away from penalties, the decisive blow was conjured between two men who operate at opposite ends of Spain's fiercest rivalry.

Lionel Messi, of Barcelona, drove deep into Swiss territory and swept the ball wide for Real Madrid's Angel Di Maria, who stroked confidently into the corner.

Yet there was still more agony for Switzerland to endure.

"I was nervous towards the end because we couldn't score and any mistake could have knocked us out," Argentina captain Messi told a press conference.

With Switzerland keen to limit any slice of space for Argentina's array of attacking talent to operate in, the opening stages of the game in Sao Paulo were predictably tight.

The game's first gilt-edged opening arrived on 28 minutes, and it was one carved out by two players who operate in Germany's Bundesliga.

Paris Saint-Germain star Ezequiel Lavezzi tested Benaglio from striker Gonzalo Higuain's knockdown as Argentina looked to reassert its dominance.

Shaqiri was again the provider when a sharp counter attack released Josip Drmic in on goal.

With Romero caught in two minds whether to hunt down the through ball, the Bayer Leverkusen striker looked to take advantage with a chip but got the execution horribly wrong.

Argentina's stopper continued to look uncertain after the interval as he spilled a Shaqiri free kick from range and had to scramble to prevent the ball from escaping his penalty area.

As red-shirted legs became heavy La Albiceleste pressed for the breakthrough and Benaglio was prompted into action when Marcos Rojo's attempted cross crept towards the net.

Higuain then rose highest to power a header towards goal but Benaglio was alert to acrobatically divert the Napoli striker's effort over the bar.

But just as the thousands of Argentina fans inside the stadium prepared to hail their saviour once more, Benaglio flung out his right hand to make a superb save and ensure the game remained goalless.

And despite a few nervous moments, when the right weight of pass or split second decision could have fashioned a late winner, the Swiss saw it through to the end of 90 minutes.

Benaglio was called upon to save from a glancing header from Rodrigo Palacio while Messi was lucky to escape a booking after a tangle with Valon Behrami.

Di Maria, who enjoyed such a stellar end of season with European Champions League winners Real Madrid, cut a profligate figure through the game, but tested Benaglio with a stinging drive from range.

And his big moment would arrive, as so many of Argentina's have, via the boots of Messi.

But his header cannoned off the post with Romero stranded and struck him once more, only for the ball to trickle wide of the upright.

Shaqiri then won a free kick right on the edge of the penalty area as nerves at both ends shredded yet further, but once the wall had repelled his effort the final whistle sounded.

Coach Alejandro Sabella stuck to the classic football adage of taking one game at a time. "Our dream is only to work for the next match and try to move onto the semifinals," he said.

"We do not look beyond that. To do so would be a mistake as we have already seen good teams like Spain, Uruguay, Italy and England have gone out."
