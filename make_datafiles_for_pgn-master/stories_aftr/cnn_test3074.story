Nude photographs of Lawrence, who won an Academy Award last year for her role in "Silver Linings Playbook," were splashed on various sites Sunday. They appeared on 4chan, Reddit, Twitter and Tumblr, among others.

Kate Upton's lawyer confirmed photos of the model-actress were among those leaked, calling it "an outrageous violation" of her privacy. "We intend to pursue anyone disseminating or duplicating these illegally obtained images to the fullest extent possible," attorney Lawrence Shire said.

Lawrence's publicist said "authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence."

Some of the alleged victims in the celebrity hacking case "have engaged with the FBI," a U.S. official told CNN's Pamela Brown Monday.
