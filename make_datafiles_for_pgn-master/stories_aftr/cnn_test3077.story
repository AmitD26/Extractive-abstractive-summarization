(CNN)When Thomas Cristofoletti walked into the Hyperstar supermarket in Shiraz, Iran, he was stopped at the door. He had his camera over his shoulder, and the international-style grocery store was built inside a large mall with a strict policy against photography.

He was able to bring his camera inside, however, and when he saw a woman shopping in a colorful, patterned headscarf he made a surreptitious click of the shutter.

A former advertising director in Italy and Spain, Cristofoletti left the profession behind four years ago and moved to Cambodia to pursue photography. He founded RUOM, a collective of journalists who specialize in social reportage in Southeast Asia.

"I've always been interested in closed countries," he said. "I got this great opportunity to be there with locals. You are able to see things in a very different way."

"The perception we have (about Iran) is not real," he said. "My idea was to try to see with my eyes what is the reality of Iran."

"Even if traditional grand bazaars continue to be the favorite places to shop for regular Iranians, they now face competition from huge shopping malls, which were erected in the outskirts of major cities across the country," Cristofoletti said. The malls feature supermarkets, international brands and vibrant video game arcades as a kind of alternative entertainment.

"I was really surprised to see these kind of modern stores and malls," he said. "Shopping has become a near-obsessive ritual for young people."

Cristofoletti notes that for women especially, some aspects of Western culture are particularly alluring. He found that because Iranian women are prohibited from showing any part of their body except for the face, they have taken to buying high-end beauty products and undergoing plastic surgery to make their features look more European or American. It is through these measures, Cristofoletti said, that women are able to "rebel" against government-imposed restrictions.
