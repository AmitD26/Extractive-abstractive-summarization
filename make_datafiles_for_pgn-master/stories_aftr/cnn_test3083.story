RALEIGH, North Carolina (CNN) -- Men arrested last week on suspicion of plotting a "violent jihad" overseas had weapons, thousands of rounds of ammunition and $13,000 cash in their home, an FBI agent testified in court Tuesday.

An FBI agent testified he considers Daniel Patrick Boyd and six others "a risk of flight" who should be denied bail.

The seven men arrested last week should not be released on bail, he said.

Officials identified three of the men as U.S. native Daniel Patrick Boyd, 39 -- who had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan -- and Boyd's sons, Dylan Boyd, 22, also known as "Mohammed," and Zakariya Boyd, 20.

"I know that my husband and my sons are free of guilt," she told CNN on July 28, when they were arrested. "I'm hopeful that the truth will come to light."  Watch Sabrina Boyd state her family's innocence »

Sutton testified Tuesday that Daniel and Dylan Boyd were arrested in Durham, North Carolina. Both were carrying weapons, and had permits to do so.

The arresting agent told Sutton that Daniel Boyd attempted "to acquire his sidearm," and that Dylan Boyd "failed to comply with their instruction and had to be subdued." In a later interview, the younger Boyd told Sutton he had not gone for his gun.

On a tape made in May 2009, the elder Boyd talks about getting the money needed to wage jihad and hitting Wells Fargo trucks and banks. He makes reference to how he had robbed a bank in Pakistan.

In the search of the Boyd home the FBI says agents found:

• Several weapons;

• $13,000 in cash. In addition, Dylan Boyd had a deposit slip for $16,000;

• A book called "Emergency Response to Terrorism," which Sutton said would be useful to someone trying to counter law enforcement;

• A document described as a fatwa (Muslim religious edict) of jihad (holy war) against America. It includes the assertion that the killing of Americans and their allies "is an individual duty for every Muslim."

The indictment against the men makes no reference to a direct threat to individuals or property in the United States, but said the men had practiced military tactics in a North Carolina county that borders Virginia.
