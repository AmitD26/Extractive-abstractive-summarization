WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill immediately blamed each other for the failure of a $700 billion bailout package in the House on Monday.

It was unclear in what form the congressional leadership would bring the bill back to the House floor.

Nearly 60 percent of Democrats voted for the bill, and about a third of Republicans supported it.

House Republican leaders blamed Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House, for the bill's failure, saying she had scuttled a bipartisan compromise with a "partisan speech" shortly before the vote. Pelosi started her speech by citing "the Bush administration's failed economic policies -- policies built on budgetary recklessness, on an anything-goes mentality with no regulation, no supervision and no discipline in the system."

Rep. Barney Frank, the House Democrats' main negotiator on the package, called the Republicans' finger pointing an excuse.

"Because somebody hurt their feelings, they decided to punish the country?" Frank said. "I don't believe they had the votes. They are covering up the fact that they don't have the votes."

"Clearly it is important to get it done quickly, but it is more important to get it done correctly," said Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas.

After the vote, President Bush was "disappointed" that the House failed to pass the bailout, saying, "We put forward a plan that was big because we got a big problem.  Watch a White House spokesman describe the president's reaction »

Bush is scheduled to speak on the bailout plan Tuesday at 8:45 a.m. at the White House.

The Senate had planned to take up the bill after the House had passed it, but now it is unclear how the senators will proceed.

"Democrats are doing our part to improve the administration's flawed plan, but we will need the support of more Republicans to get this done," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in a statement.

"With the stock market recording its largest point drop ever in the aftermath of this vote, it has never been more clear how important it is to put politics aside and come together to stabilize our economy for all Americans," Reid said. "I hope House Republicans will reconsider their vote and decide to put country first."

After the House vote, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said lawmakers were "going to stay here until we get this job done," but he admitted he could not say how to push a package through.

The House will not be in session Tuesday and Wednesday, but behind-the-scenes work will continue until it reconvenes Thursday.

While thanking Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for negotiating on the bill, Pelosi said on the House floor that the Democrats had insisted that the bill "protect the American people and Main Street from the meltdown on Wall Street."

But Democrats dismissed the Republican complaints, saying the Republican leadership failed to persuade their members to support the bill.

Pelosi said the Democrats lived up their side of the bargain.

"We've entered into those conversations in a spirit of bipartisanship, with the understanding that each side would have half of our votes to pass the bill," she said.  Watch a Wall Street trader say they need the bill »

Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who was a key negotiator of the bill, said Republican leaders were blaming Pelosi because they were embarrassed that they failed to get a majority of the Republicans to vote for the bill.  Watch Frank say the GOP 'punished' the country »

"There's a terrible crisis affecting the American economy. We have come together on a bill to alleviate the crisis," Frank said. "And because somebody hurt their feelings, they decide to punish the country? I mean, I would not have imputed that degree of pettiness and hypersensitivity."

Before the vote, many House Republicans expressed opposition to the bill, saying it departed from free-market principles. Republican congressional aides also said calls from constituents were running 10 to 1 against the legislation.

"Ask yourselves why you came here and vote with courage and integrity to those principles. If, like me, you came here because you believe in limited government and the freedom of the American marketplace, I urge you vote in accordance with your convictions," Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana, said.
