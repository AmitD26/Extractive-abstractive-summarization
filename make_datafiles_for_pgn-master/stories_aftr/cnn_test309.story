(CNN) -- President Barack Obama intervened Saturday in Philadelphia's rail strike, signing an executive order that puts union workers back on the job while they continuing negotiating with a regional transportation authority.

Under the order, the board has 30 days to make recommendations to end the dispute. Obama issued the order at the request of Gov. Tom Corbett.

"It is imperative that parties continue to work toward an agreement for the benefit of the tens of thousands of people who use SEPTA rail every day," Corbett said in a written statement.

The dispute between the engineers and electrician unions and SEPTA revolves around pay raises and pensions.

The strike affected 13 lines that serve the suburbs and the Philadelphia International Airport, officials said.
