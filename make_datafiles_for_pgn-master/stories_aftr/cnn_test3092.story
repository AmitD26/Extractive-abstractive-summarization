Ovell Smith Krell has spent the better part of her 84 years wondering how her brother died at a Florida reform school in 1940, and where he may be buried. Today, she appears to be one step closer to finding out.

"The deaths that occurred at Dozier School for Boys in Marianna are cloaked in mystery, and the surviving family members deserve a thorough examination of the site," stated Attorney General Pam Bondi, who filed the petition on behalf of Jackson County's medical examiner.

Krell -- who believes her brother, Owen, was buried on the school's property -- says she's overjoyed at the news.

It's unclear when the state court will rule on Bondi's petition, although a decision could come in the next couple of weeks. If the exhumations are approved, the bodies would be examined at the University of South Florida at the direction of Jackson County's medical examiner, Michael Hunter. Forensic investigators hope to start the process before the summer rainy season.

Researchers plan to use DNA from surviving family members to help identify the remains and return them to their relatives.

For years, stories and allegations of beatings, torture and murder have surrounded the century-old school. State authorities have said in the past that there were 31 burial sites at the school, and a 2009 state investigation found no wrongdoing in connection with those deaths.

Investigators now say there's evidence that 98 boys died at the school, and some of them may be buried in the 50 graves that forensic investigators have recently found on school grounds.

In the wake of those findings, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, asked the Department of Justice to investigate. Nelson called Bondi's petition for exhumations "a critical step forward to bring closure to the families."

Robert Straley, who spent about 10 months at the school in the 1960s for allegedly stealing a car, said he was taken to the "white house" on his very first day.

Former school administrator Troy Tidwell, a one-armed man who some former students accused of beating them, has said in a deposition that "spankings" took place at the school but denied anyone was ever beaten or killed.

At the time, the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys -- who it said died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents -- were buried, blaming poorly kept school records. FDLE closed the case due to the lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct, and no charges were filed.

Florida's Department of Juvenile Justice closed the school in 2011, blaming budget cuts.

Ovell Krell said her family was told that her brother Owen ran away from the reform school, got pneumonia, and died underneath a house in town.

But Owen's classmate told the family a different story, Krell said.

According to Krell, the boy said as he and Owen tried to escape, "my brother was running out across a field, an open field, and there was three men shooting at him, with rifles."

Today, she simply wants to bring him home. She's 84 now, and says she's running out of time.
