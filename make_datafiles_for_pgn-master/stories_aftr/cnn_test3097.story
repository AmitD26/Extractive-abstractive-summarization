In what his campaign billed as a "major foreign policy speech" Monday, lasting about 20 minutes, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney took on President Obama's handling of protests in Iran after disputed elections three years ago.

Demonstrators were met with deadly violence by the government.

"When millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009, when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world, when they cried out, 'Are you with us, or are you with them?' -- the American president was silent," Romney said.

On June 13, 2009, Iran announced that incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a landslide victory.  His main opponent, Mir Hossein Moussavi, had already alleged blatant violations.  After the announcement, angry crowds of Moussavi supporters took to the streets.

Scores, or even hundreds, of riot police were deployed, and there were "running battles between some of the street protesters and some of the riot police," Amanpour reported.  "And we've seen people who have been hit with batons and taken refuge in people's homes along the march route to try to get out of the way of that."

By the next day, June 15, Moussavi supporters were holding the country's largest protests since the 1979 revolution.

That day, June 15, Obama gave remarks on the situation.  He said he was watching the news from Iran.  It is "up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran's leaders will be," he said, adding that "we respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran."

He said it was his understanding that "that the Iranian government says that they are going to look into irregularities that have taken place," and emphasized that he would continue to seek diplomacy with the country.

Just over a week later, on June 23, after more and more images of violence came to light and amid some calls for the president to take a tougher stance, he did just that.

The undecided: What will sway them?

Asked why he would not spell out potential consequences for Iran over its behavior, the president replied, "Because I think that we don't know yet how this thing is going to play out. I know everybody here is on a 24-hour news cycle. I'm not."

"His silence validated the mullahs, despite the blood on their hands and the nuclear centrifuges in their tunnels," presidential hopeful Tim Pawlenty alleged last year in the race for the Republican nomination.

Conclusion:

During the first couple of days of the protests and violence, Obama did not weigh in publicly, but by a few days in, he was not "silent" -- and a week later, took a tougher stance.
