His Christmas Day tweet commemorating the birthday of Isaac Newton was retweeted more than 69,000 times as of this writing, making it the most popular of his Twitter career so far -- and, arguably, his most controversial.

"On this day long ago, a child was born who, by age 30, would transform the world. Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec 25, 1642," the StarTalk host tweeted.

His comments drew criticism and name-calling from various corners of the internet. "Overly reductive, deliberately cynical and unnecessarily provocative," one person said on Twitter.

According to his calculations, his average retweet rate falls between 2,500 and 3,500. "Fun" tweets can reach 10,000 while "boring tweets barely break 1,000." The Newton Christmas Day tweet had surpassed 62,000 retweets by the time he posted his Facebook note on Friday. By Saturday evening, it had reached more than 69,000.

"I wonder if you are as astonished by this fact as I am," he wrote.

For example, he directly referenced Jesus in previous tweets that did not spread nearly as far. By way of example, he offered the following, which earned more than 13,000 retweets: "Some claim the USA is a Christian nation, compelling me to wonder which assault rifle Jesus would choose: the AR-15 or AK-47."

He also addressed criticism that according to the calendar in use during Newton's time, his birthday would fall on January 4, 1643.

Tyson closed his note with holiday wishes and a warning that he'll be tweeting about Earth's perihelion in the New Year.

"Just a head's up in case people want to avert their eyes over that one."
