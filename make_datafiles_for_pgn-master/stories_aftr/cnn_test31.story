(CNN) -- Spain remain on course to retain their European Championship crown after seeing off a lackluster France 2-0 in the third Euro 2012 quarterfinal at the Donbass Arena, Donetsk on Saturday.

"There's a lot of personal satisfaction in getting to 100 caps and of course getting on the scoresheet," Alonso said.

With coach Vicente Del Bosque once again opting to pack the midfield and leave striker Fernando Torres on the bench, Spain quickly assumed control of the game.

It fell to Andres Iniesta to unlock the opposition defense in the 19th minute.

Barcelona's midfield maestro threaded a pass through to Jordi Alba who jinked past a flailing Mathieu Debuchy before squaring a cross which Alonso headed home with power and accuracy.

Debuchy went close with a header in the 60th minute, but France couldn't capitalize on the few openings they created in the second period.

Coach Laurent Blanc sent on substitute's Samir Nasri, Jeremy Menez and Olivier Giroud but it failed to turn the tide in favor of the three-time European champions.

Anthony Reveillere's foul on substitute Pedro in the 90th minute handed Spain a late penalty and a chance to put the result beyond doubt.
