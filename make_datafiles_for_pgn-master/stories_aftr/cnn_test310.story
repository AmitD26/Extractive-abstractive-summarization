(CNN) -- Seventeen Pakistani soldiers who were kidnapped last week are shown beheaded in a video released by the Taliban.

A senior Pakistani military official confirmed to CNN that the bodies shown in the video, their identifications flashed before the camera as evidence, indeed belonged to members of the Pakistani army and a Pakistani paramilitary force.

The names of the dead are recited in the video.

"We are not the enemies of Pakistan and its people. In fact, we are enemies of the infidels and the democratic system that has been imposed upon us," the video says.

Fifteen militants were killed in the fight, but the 17 soldiers were captured, he said.

Militants based in Afghanistan have killed more than 100 Pakistani soldiers in cross-border attacks since 2010, the official said.

CNN's Nasir Habib contributed to this report.
