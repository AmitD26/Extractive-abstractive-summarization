Bishop Robert W. Finn, 59, is the highest-ranking Catholic official to be convicted during the church's long sexual abuse scandal.

Finn won't serve any jail time or pay a fine, the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney's office said. The misdemeanor charge had a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a fine of as much as $1,000.

One other misdemeanor against the bishop and two against Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph were dropped.

"I truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused," Finn said, according to CNN affiliate KCTV.

Terms of Finn's probation include starting a $10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse.

The case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims' anonymity.
