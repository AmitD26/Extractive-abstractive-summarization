(CNN) -- A strong storm system Wednesday brought rain and winds that shut down the Statue of Liberty and delayed flights for more than four hours at airports in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.

Flight times were almost back to normal by late Wednesday.

Heavy rain triggered flooding in some Eastern states a day after the system raked the Southeast.

The storm system brought flooding and snow to areas around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, slowing commuters and prompting some schools to open late, according to CNN affiliate WPXI.

CNN has confirmed that there is a state of emergency in Butler County, Pennsylvania, until at least Thursday morning because of the flooding due to storms from late Tuesday and Wednesday.

Flight delays of more than four hours had been reported at the Newark, New Jersey, airport, and delays of more than an hour were reported at airports in Teterboro, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

One person was killed and a second injured Wednesday when high winds caused a tree to fall on a car with two people in it in West Milford, New Jersey, according to the National Weather Service in Upton, New York.

On Wednesday, the storm system set its sights on much of the Eastern Seaboard. Severe thunderstorms were possible from the Florida Panhandle north to Maryland, and flash flooding was possible from northern Georgia into Vermont and New Hampshire, according to the National Weather Service.

The structures were damaged in Buford, Georgia, in Gwinnett County, by an EF-2 tornado, said Steve Nelson, science and operations officer for the National Weather Service's forecast office in Peachtree City, Georgia.

"It was terrifying at the time," Edwin Pellicia, resident of a hard-hit Buford subdivision, told CNN affiliate WXIA. "Now you're just thankful to be alive. ... Today, you really appreciate the time that you have with family and having your life."

At least 56 homes and one business in the area were damaged by the tornado. Twelve of those homes suffered major damage. There were no reported injuries.

In Atlanta on Tuesday, the system downed trees and power lines and snarled the afternoon commute, with roads in several areas closed because of flooding.

Rescue crews conducted door-to-door searches to make sure everyone in the area was accounted for. Several families had to find a place to stay overnight, according to WGCL.

Pellicia said the upcoming holiday season will be more meaningful to him because of the experience. "It's going to look different, but it's going to mean a whole lot more," he told WXIA. In addition, several residents expressed gratitude that no one lost their life, adding that homes can be repaired.

Tornadoes during this time of year can be particularly dangerous because they are fast-moving and obscured by rain and darkness, according to Morris.

Four tornadoes classified as EF-2 hit the state, the National Weather Service forecast office in Jackson said Tuesday evening.

In Attala County, storms destroyed nine mobile homes, injured six people and left parts of the area without power, the service said.

A tornado touched down in Yazoo County on Monday night, causing damage to a courthouse in downtown Yazoo City and tossing debris in a wide area, according to an emergency management spokesman.

CNN's Sean Morris contributed to this report.
