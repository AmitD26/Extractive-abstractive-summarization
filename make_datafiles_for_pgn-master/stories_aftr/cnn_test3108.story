William Hilton Paul was arrested Saturday after a flight from Kentucky to North Carolina, according to the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office in Charlotte.

The senator's office released a statement calling the issue a private family matter.

"Sen. Paul is a national public figure and subject to scrutiny in the public arena, however, as many parents with teenagers would understand, his family should be afforded the privacy and respect they deserve in a situation such as this," according to the statement released late Sunday by Moira Bagley, Paul's communications director.

The younger Paul was charged with three misdemeanor offenses: disorderly conduct at an airport, being intoxicated and disruptive and consuming beer and wine underage. He is due in court on February 25, the Mecklenburg County court clerk's office said.

He has maintained a fairly low profile, appearing at a handful of campaign events alongside his father.

The first-term senator was elected in 2010 with strong tea party support, and in recent months he has publicly said he is interested in running for president in 2016.
