TV's Judge Joe Brown was jailed on a contempt of court charge issued by a Tennessee juvenile judge Monday, according to a court spokesman.

Brown, a former Shelby County criminal judge, was in court to represent a client in a child-support case. He apparently became upset when he was told the case was not on the afternoon docket, Chief Magistrate Dan Michael said.

Horne held Brown was in contempt five times "before they were able to get him out of the courtroom, Michael said.

Brown was booked into the Shelby County jail in Memphis Monday afternoon, sheriff's spokesman Chip Washington said.

Brown presided over a syndicated reality TV show based on court case arbitration for 15 years until it was canceled last year.

CNN was first alerted to Brown's arrest by a Twitter posting.
