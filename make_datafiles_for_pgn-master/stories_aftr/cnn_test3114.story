(CNN) -- Lifetime's biopic of the late singer Aaliyah is now without a star.

The network confirmed via Twitter on Sunday that Zendaya, the 17-year-old Disney actress and singer tapped to portray Aaliyah in the TV movie, has exited the project.

The young star, known for her role on Disney's "Shake It Up!" and Season 16 of "Dancing With the Stars," didn't release an official comment on her departure but did acknowledge the casting shakeup on Twitter by quoting a source's statement to E! News.

With news that she's now out of the project, some are curious if the casting criticism played a role in her departure.

"I just felt the project wasn't 100% there," she told MTV, saying that the production felt "a little rushed." Because "she's someone I admire and I love so much, it can't be done halfway, or not to the standards I think it should be done at, so I just decided not to do it.

"By all means, when the right project comes along and it's done the right way, I'll be the first person ready to play Aaliyah, but this wasn't the right one for me. I've been into Aaliyah since I was little, so there wasn't too much getting into character. I always pretend I'm her anyway."
