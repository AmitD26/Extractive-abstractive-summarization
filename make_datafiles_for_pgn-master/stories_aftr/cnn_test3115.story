It's been a glittering 12 months for the Spanish giants, who had already won the European Champions League, European Super Cup and the Copa del Rey before arriving in Morocco for the intercontinental club competition.

Real were pitted against South American champions San Lorenzo in the Club World Cup final.

The Argentine side are relative minnows compared to Madrid's galaxy of superstars, which includes Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo.

There was, however, to be no divine intervention for the club from Buenos Aires on a sultry winter night under Moroccan skies.

Gareth Bale added a second goal, slotting Isco's pass beyond San Lorenzo keeper Sebastian Torrico, after the break.

Earlier, Auckland City claimed third place at the Club World Cup after defeating Mexico's Cruz Azul 4-2 in a penalty shootout.

The New Zealand club became the first Oceania team to win a medal at the tournament.
