Spanish fashion retailer Zara has apologized for selling a striped T-shirt bearing a yellow star that drew criticism for its resemblance to uniforms worn by Jewish concentration camp inmates.

"We honestly apologize," Zara said on Twitter in response to numerous outraged tweets.

The offending item was removed from Zara stores and its website, according to a press release from Zara's parent company, Inditex. It was on sale for just a few hours before the company pulled it "due to the potential similarity with the Star of David," the company said.

Sales were "marginal" and the remaining products will be "destroyed."

"The bag had been produced in Asia, however, where the symbol also carries ancient cultural significance," the World Jewish Congress said in a statement.

The Anti-Defamation League said it welcomed the removal of what it called the "deeply offensive" shirt.

"This is not the first time we have seen a retail clothing company making this same offensive mistake. The fact that this keeps happening shows that there is a serious need for education about the Holocaust and the history of anti-Semitism."
