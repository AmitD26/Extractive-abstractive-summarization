Hamas and Israel blamed one another for the lack of a cease-fire in a conflict that has left more than 1,200 people dead, raising questions about just what it will take to end the fighting in Gaza.

The violence continued Wednesday morning, when Israeli forces shelled the Abu Hussein School in northern Gaza and killed at least 20 people, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.

The Israeli military said they are looking into the incident.

International efforts to broker a deal to end the violence failed again Tuesday, with Hamas rejecting a cease-fire proposal put forward by the Palestinian Authority that called for a 24-hour truce that could be extended to 72 hours. Hamas maintains that any deal must include an end to Israel's blockade of Gaza.

"Hamas is responsible for all deaths on their side and on our side because they are the ones who kept this conflict going," Mark Regev, a spokesman for Netanyahu, told CNN.

"People are fighting and people are dying because Hamas said no to a cease-fire."

Israel is "ready for a period of sustained peace and security" Regev said earlier in the day on CNN. But he asserted that Hamas has consistently rejected truces and an Egyptian initiative for a cease-fire put forth this month.

Deaths mount as fighting rages

Palestinian officials blamed an Israeli airstrike. But Israel said the power plant was not a target.

At least 40% of Gaza's fuel had been burned by early Tuesday, according to Fathi al-Sheikh Khalil, deputy chairman of the Palestinian Energy Natural Resources Authority in Gaza. The plant will have to be reconstructed and will not operate as it did for at least a year, he said.

The number of militants killed is unclear, but the United Nations estimates that 70% to 80% of the dead are civilians.

Fifty-three Israeli soldiers have died since Operation Protective Edge began July 8, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Three civilians have been killed in Israel as well.

He also said Netanyahu "consistently said he would embrace a cease-fire that permits Israel to protect itself against the tunnels" used by Palestinian militants in Gaza.

"We are working very carefully, and I think thoughtfully, with our Israeli friends in order to be able to find a way to reduce the civilian loss of life, to prevent this from spiraling downwards into a place from which, you know, both sides have difficulty finding a way forward in order to address the underlying kinds of issues," Kerry said.

But Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said the WAFA report was not true and "not related to the resistance," which "speaks for itself."

When Hamas gets a guarantee from Israel for "international mediation regarding a humanitarian pause, then we can consider it," he said on Hamas TV.

Israel repeatedly has condemned Hamas for rejecting an Egyptian proposal for a cease-fire that Israel agreed to earlier this month. Some temporary cease-fires have taken place throughout the conflict, with each side quickly accusing the other of violating the pauses in shooting.

"Witnesses have told paramedics that entire families are still buried under the rubble," said al-Qidra, the spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry.

Israel has uncovered 32 tunnels used by Hamas to smuggle weapons and launch attacks, Israel Defense Forces said.

Hamas has an estimated 10,000 rockets, more than a quarter of which have been fired into Israel in the past few weeks, the IDF said.
