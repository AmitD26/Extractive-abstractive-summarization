Her requests for parole and a prison transfer recently denied, a member of the punk rock collective Pussy Riot was hospitalized amid a hunger strike Friday, according to Russian state-run media.

Doctors ordered that Nadezhda Tolokonnikova be placed in the medical ward of a penal colony in Mordovia, southeast of Moscow, where she is serving a two-year sentence, reported RIA Novosti, citing the Russian penitentiary service.

In a lengthy letter to the news site Lenta (a translated version was published in London's The Guardian), Tolokonnikova described "slave labor" and unsanitary conditions in which women work through sickness and injury up to 17 hours a day and are beaten -- or worse -- for failing to complete their duties.

Tolokonnikova wrote that her life was once threatened and other prisoners tell her she is not beaten only because of the celebrity her case has brought her.

"It's true: Others are beaten up. For not being able to keep up. They hit them in the kidneys, in the face. Prisoners themselves deliver these beatings, and not a single one of them is done without the approval and full knowledge of the administration," she wrote. "Mordovian prisoners are afraid of their own shadows. They are completely terrified."

Prison authorities told RIA Novosti that Tolokonnikova was blackmailing them for denying her request for special treatment, but her husband told Russian media this week that a guard had refused to give her water and grabbed her by the arms, refusing to let go.

Those claims, too, were denied, as a penitentiary spokesman told RIA Novosoti that doctors recommended only that she be given warm water and no physical force had been used against her.

While Tolokonnikova and bandmate Maria Alyokhina remain in prison, a third Pussy Riot member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released in October 2012 after her defense presented new evidence in her case.
