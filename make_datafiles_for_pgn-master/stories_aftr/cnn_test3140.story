(CNN)Beyonce had quite the play-date set for her daughter Blue Ivy -- a baby tiger, during their trip to Thailand.

The photo shows Beyonce petting the baby tiger while it's being bottle fed at the Phuket FantaSea theme park, with hubby Jay Z and Blue Ivy looking on.

Beyonce and Jay Z aren't the first to be blasted for posing with a tiger. A recent New York State bill bans people from posing for photos while hugging, patting or touching tigers.

The bill was introduced after men posing with wild cats became a trend on dating apps like Tinder and OKCupid, which even produced a Tumblr that collected photos of men posing with Tigers.

The PETA Foundation would like to see all tourists avoid visiting parks where animals are held in captivity.

"And the issues facing exotic animals don't stop in Thailand, of course. Roadside zoos and captive-wildlife breeders in the U.S. subject animals to the same abuses. PETA encourages all caring people to enjoy nature with their families in ways that leave captive animals out of the picture."
