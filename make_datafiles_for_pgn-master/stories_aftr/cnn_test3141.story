In the study, released Thursday, the rights group alleges systemic use of torture by the police, based on hundreds of witness testimonies and other evidence gathered over the course of 10 years.

The report, titled " 'Welcome to hell fire': Torture and other ill-treatment in Nigeria" alleges that abuse is so widespread that many police stations have an informal "officer in charge of torture" and that some police sections have special rooms, or "torture chambers" where it is carried out.

Methods commonly used include nail or tooth extractions, choking, electric shocks, rape and other sexual violence, it claims.

A spokesman for the Nigeria Police Force refuted the allegations, however, saying the report contained "some blatant falsehoods and innuendos."

"Torture or ill-treatment is not, repeat, not an official policy of the Nigeria Police," said Emmanuel Ojukwu, force public relations officer and acting commissioner of police, in a statement.

The number of reported abuses has increased in northern Nigeria as Nigeria's security forces have stepped up their fight against Boko Haram, the report said.

Since 2009, between 5,000 and 10,000 people have been detained as suspects in the crackdown on the militant Islamist group, which is designated as a terror organization by the United States.

One man, identified only as Ahmed, said he was among a group of men who were stopped by soldiers outside a mosque after prayers in Yobe state in February 2013.

He said the soldiers "told all of us to lie down on the ground in the street."

"The soldiers shot and killed some of them on the spot, some were shot on the legs, and the soldiers began to beat some of us on the head with iron rods, others were beaten with wood."

The men were taken by vehicles to prison, Ahmed said, and some of the wounded men died on the way. Once there, they were "kept tied for three days," fed only "handfuls" of food per day, and forced to share a half-liter of water per two men per day.

The report goes on to quote Ahmed:

The beating, the torture was just too much for us. They do all types of things to you, the soldiers. They will tie your hands behind your back, with the elbows touching and then one of them will walk on your tied hands with their boots. Your hands will remain tied and then they'll pour salt water on your wounds. You can't rub it, even if it goes into your eyes. My eyes got swollen as a result of that. I thought I was going to be blind. I have never experienced such brutality in my life."

'I was bleeding'

"This goes far beyond the appalling torture and killing of suspected Boko Haram members," said Netsanet Belay, Amnesty International's research and advocacy director for Africa.

"Across the country, the scope and severity of torture inflicted on Nigeria's women, men and children by the authorities supposed to protect them is shocking to even the most hardened human rights observer."

The report also cited examples of abuse against women and children.

Mahmood was freed in April 2013, according to the report.

One 24-year-old woman named Abosede told Amnesty International she was abused using tear gas and still suffers as a result.

"A policewoman took me to a small room, told me to remove everything I was wearing," she is quoted as saying. "She spread my legs wide and fired tear gas into my vagina... I was asked to confess that I was an armed robber... I was bleeding... up till now I still feel pain in my womb."

"The police decision to deny the findings before careful reading of the report or examining the accusations made in it echoes their attitude to criminal investigations -- apportioning blame before ascertaining the facts.
