That was obvious Thursday, as leaders of the trans-Atlantic alliance's member countries met in Wales. They discussed everything from Afghanistan to the Middle East to Ukraine, each of which has its own special significance and presents its own unique military and diplomatic challenges.

"We meet at a crucial time in the history of our alliance," British Prime Minister David Cameron said at the outset of the two-day summit. "The world faces many dangerous and evolving threats, and it is absolutely clear that NATO is as vital to our future as it has been in our past."

Still, the alliance is looking at a range of options to combat a range of diverse threats.

Iraq and Syria

NATO has only invoked Article 5 -- which mandates all countries come to the aid of another member of the alliance -- one time, in response to the al Qaeda threat following 9/11.

Now, its member states are intensely focused on ISIS, a relatively new terrorist group that has rampaged through the Middle East, executing American journalists and threatening more Westerners' lives.

No one is saying that NATO is about to repeat what it did over 12 years ago, including sending legions of ground troops into a country as it did Afghanistan. But its leaders are certainly talking tough about ISIS and the prospect of NATO playing a role in attacking it.

Any request by Iraq to NATO for aid in fighting ISIS would be "considered seriously," according to NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who noted the Iraqi government hasn't reached out yet to the alliance.

The United States, however, has coordinated with the Baghdad government to launch airstrikes on ISIS fighters in Iraq and opened the door for similar attacks in Syria. Cameron told CNN that his country supports these American strikes and could take part in further military action.

"We don't rule anything out," said Cameron, adding that he wants ISIS "squeezed out of existence."

Ukraine

Ukraine, though, is a different story.

Western leaders have made a point of supporting the Kiev-based government as it combats a rebel movement that, its officials say, has been supported in most every which way by the Kremlin. And even as Moscow denies any direct involvement, Western officials have demanded the Russia withdraw thousands of troops they say have crossed the border and shelled Ukrainian forces, not to mention pull its troops back from the border.

"It is definitely a landmark event," President Petro Poroshenko said of the "strong, enormous support" that NATO government leaders have afforded Ukraine at the Wales summit. "(Cooperation is) at the highest level during the 20-year history of the partnership between Ukraine and NATO."

Afghanistan

Exactly how is up in the air, in part to a crisis related to Afghanistan's recent presidential election.

Despite efforts by the Taliban to disrupt the election, about 8 million votes were cast on June 14, with provisional results showing Ashraf Ghani ahead with roughly 56% support to 43% for Abdullah Abdullah, according to the country's Independent Elections Commission.

Yet both candidates have alleged large-scale voter fraud and manipulation, and Abdullah hasn't conceded. That's left the nation in limbo -- to this point, the inauguration of the new president was pushed back indefinitely from the first week of August, as an audit of the vote is conducted -- and NATO's International Security Assistance Force in limbo as well.

That's because current Afghan President Hamid Karzai had refused to sign what's known as a Status of Forces Agreement that would set the terms of keeping international forces in Afghanistan beyond the end of this year.

But "without a signature" on the Status of Forces Agreement, "there can be no mission," he added.
