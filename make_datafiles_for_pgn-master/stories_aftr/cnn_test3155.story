Not Michael Landsberry.

The 45-year-old math teacher calmly walked toward the gunman as he crossed the basketball court. Landsberry raised his hands to show he was no threat.

He tried to reason with the boy.

His students and fellow guardsmen were stunned by his devastating death, but no one was surprised by how, directly in the face of danger, he tried to solve the crisis.

"He was trying to save the children. He was trying to save that child," Burkett said.

Landsberry couldn't save the shooter or himself, but he did delay the gunman from going immediately after more victims.

As news of the shooting was reported on Twitter, students and former students tweeted about Mr. Landsberry, who taught eighth-grade math.

He can't be dead, they wrote to each other. He's strong, he'll make it, one said.

Soon the ugly realization came that he was gone.

"He was My Everything, My World!! He has touched so many lives and was an incredible Man!!," she wrote Monday night.

Landsberry, who joined the Marines after he graduated from high school in Reno in 1986, had an associate's degree in law enforcement and a bachelor's degree in education, according to a statement from the Guard. He began teaching in 2001, the same year he enlisted in the Guard, the statement said.

He worked at two other schools before moving to Sparks Middle School in 2006.

Reggie Landsberry said caring for others was something he and his brother learned from their father, who served in the Marines for 22 years. Michael Landsberry, also a veteran of the Corps, was "just a good all-around individual," his brother said.

The colonel said Landsberry "was close to a lot of people out here on the base."

A Facebook memorial page posted in Landsberry's honor had more than 16,100 likes on Tuesday afternoon.

"Once a hero, always a hero! RIP."

"God bless you for the greatest act of courage and love."

On a website for his students, "Mr. Landsberry's Math Class," the slain teacher had posted pictures of himself hiking in the wilderness and standing with a weapon beside an armored vehicle.

Sparks Mayor Geno Martini called the loss of Landsberry "devastating."

"It's very unfortunate that (the life of) someone like that, who protected our country over there and came back alive ... had to be taken at his work, at a school," Martini said.

"A lot of lives saved by this Marine. May he guard the gates of heaven. Semper Fi, Sir," one commenter wrote on Facebook, referencing the "Always Faithful" motto of the Marines.
