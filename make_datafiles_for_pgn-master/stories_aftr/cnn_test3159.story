Matt Damon said it's hard not to see his three daughters in the eyes of the girls he helps on his visits to the poverty stricken villages in India.

On premises access to clean water is something only one in four people have in India, according to UNICEF.

"I did what I think a lot of people do, which is they kind of get right into the direct impact, like well-digging and how many people can I help if I dig x number of wells," Damon said. But he said as his understanding of the issue grew, he realized that charity wasn't going to solve the problem.

Together, we can solve the water crisis

"Had I stayed with just drilling wells, I'd have reached thousands of people at this point, but by the end of next year we'll hit 3 million people that we've reached this way," Damon said.

Water.org is a nonprofit focused on giving access to clean water and sanitation to more of the developing world. What makes the organization different is its WaterCredit Initiative, which provides new financing options for poor people so they can pay for a toilet in their home or connect to an existing water supply.

Now, he said, these women can get a loan at a much lower rate and still get access to these services. "So, basically we helped microfinance institutions really discover a new market among some of their existing clients and now we've had over 1.6 million people get access to water and sanitation not through charity but through a microloan. And they're being repaid at 99%," White said.

In a lot of urban areas the infrastructure already exists. Water pumps right under the feet of people who just can't connect to it.

Damon's passion about water is spilling into every aspect of his life. He's using his celebrity and sense of humor to help spread the word. When he took part in the ice bucket challenge, he did it with toilet water.  Before that he proclaimed a strike on toilets, saying "Until everybody has access to clean water and sanitation, I will not go to the bathroom."

His goal to empower people is serious. He said by gaining access to water and toilets, women and girls gain their time and life back. For many, collecting and scavenging for water is a large part of their day. Freed from those duties they can find a job and earn money to help repay the loan.

The long-term health effects of not having access to water include malnutrition and diarrhea.

According to UNICEF, diarrhea is the second largest cause of death in children under 5 globally and responsible for 600,000 children's deaths each year. It's also associated with a higher risk of stunting (low weight for age and developmental delay).

Many other diseases, such as malaria and other parasitic diseases, could be prevented with an adequate water supply, sanitation facilities and proper hygiene, according to the World Health Organization.

That's also why education is a key component of water.org's mission. It teaches people about proper hand washing with soap, and is helping people make the connection between hygiene and sickness. It teaches how to store water, avoid contaminating it with utensils and how to practice good hygiene by washing hands before preparing food and after changing a diaper.

"The practice of hand washing with soap in India is not widespread. A study showed that only 53% of the population wash hands with soap after defecation, 38% before eating, and 30% before preparing food," according to UNICEF.
