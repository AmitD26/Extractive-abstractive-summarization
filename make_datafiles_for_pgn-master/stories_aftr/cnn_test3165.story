Michael Douglas never had throat cancer, as he told the press in 2010.

The actor now says he had tongue cancer. Douglas said he hid the diagnosis at the urging of his doctor to protect his career.

"The surgeon said, 'Let's just say it's throat cancer,' " Douglas told fellow actor Samuel L. Jackson for a segment that ran on British television as a part of Male Cancer Awareness Week.

When Douglas first talked about his cancer diagnosis in the summer of 2010, he was on a worldwide publicity tour for the movie "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps."

The lesson from Michael Douglas

"There really is no such thing as throat cancer per se," explained Brian Hill, an oral cancer survivor and the founder of the Oral Cancer Foundation. Douglas has taped a public service announcement to raise awareness about oral cancer for Hill's foundation.

"Throat" cancer and tongue cancer are both colloquial terms that fall under the oral cancer umbrella. Throat cancer usually refers to cancerous tumors that develop in your pharynx, voice box or tonsils. Tongue cancer refers to cancerous cells that develop on your tongue.

Yes, oral sex can lead to cancer

Later, Douglas' publicist told CNN that Douglas did not blame HPV solely for his cancer; Douglas said he was also a smoker and a drinker.  Smoking and drinking, particularly when combined, are considered the most significant contributing factors to oral cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So is Douglas' gender. Men are twice as likely to develop oral cancer as women.

Oral cancers account for 2% to 4% of all cancer diagnoses in the United States. An oral cancer diagnosis is particularly serious; only half of the people diagnosed with oral cancer are still alive after five years, according to the CDC.  In large part, that's because of the late diagnoses of this disease.  Most signs of this cancer are difficult to detect and are often painless.

Douglas told Jackson that initially his doctors treated him with antibiotics.  Douglas had been complaining of a soreness at the back of his teeth.  Three months later when it still hurt, the doctor gave him another round of antibiotics.  Nine months later, after talking to a friend who was a cancer survivor, he went to the oncology department where a doctor did an initial exam and then a biopsy.  He was diagnosed with stage four oral cancer in 2010.

Douglas is not the first celebrity to misidentify the kind of cancer they have.

"There is a 95% chance it's not coming back," he told Jackson.
