Michael Jackson performs with Usher in September 2001 at Madison Square Gardens in New York City.

He was, for many, the ultimate performer.

That single appeared on Jackson's 2001 "Invincible" album.

"He will always be the King of Pop, and no one will ever be able to fill those shoes with those shiny socks and that glove," Ambrosius said.

For many of the younger generation, he was the first to not just cross over but  explode onto the pop charts from the R & B scene.

His phenomenal talent and worldwide appeal made his throne one to be aspired to even as they stood in awe of him.

Sonia Murray, a longtime Atlanta-based music columnist, said Jackson was for the younger set what James Brown had been for Jackson: an inspiration.

His music videos were must-see TV, and aspiring artists learned that it took more than just holding a microphone if they really wanted to make it big.

"He was the total package," said Gail Mitchell, senior editor for R & B and Hip-hop for Billboard. "I was talking to somebody the other day about what trends they were seeing, and they said that a lot of the acts these days seem to going back to the whole entertainer thing."

"It's not just good enough anymore to lip-synch or program your computer, but some of these newer artists are more concerned about putting on a great show for their fans."

Steve Greenberg, founder and CEO of S-Curve Records, was a disc jokey in Tel Aviv, Israel, when "Thriller" first dropped and witnessed first-hand how Jackson became an international icon.

Greenberg said Jackson "influenced everyone who has come after him."

"He's been around so long that everyone on the contemporary scene has come after him," Greenberg said. "His was the first very contemporary, very exciting dance music to emerge after the death of disco."

His music also crossed genres.

Even for the most hardcore in hip-hop, there was no shame in admitting love for the King of Pop.

"Michael Jackson has always been an inspiration to me as far as his music is concerned," Rapper Snoop Dogg told MTV in 2001. "You can't take nothing from him."

Wyclef Jean released a statement saying "Michael Jackson was my Musical God."

Floetry member Marsha Ambrosius said she felt blessed to have spent two weeks working with Jackson in New York City a few years ago after he fell in love with a song she had written.

"He was one of the most amazing people you would ever want to meet ," she said. "I can say I worked with the most incredible artist on planet Earth."
