Washington (CNN)Divided on other issues, U.S. lawmakers united in support of Israel on Friday with the Senate approving another $225 million for the Iron Dome missile defense system.

Senate approval came as the chamber wrapped up work before going on its five-week summer recess.

"We could not go out for a month or five weeks and not act to help the Israelis replenish their supply of Iron Dome missiles," GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona told reporters.

With Coburn's objection gone, the measure passed swiftly by unanimous consent on Friday morning just as the latest attempt at a cease-fire in the Gaza conflict was disintegrating.

McCain called for the House and President Barack Obama to now also approve the Iron Dome money in order to show the people of Israel that "we will stand with them and that we will provide them with what they need in order to defend themselves."

Could the Iron Dome be hacked?
