A doctor who examined him before the scheduled flogging determined that his wounds had not yet healed and that the flogging should be delayed, human rights group Amnesty International said.

"The doctor concluded that the wounds had not yet healed properly and that he would not be able to withstand another round of lashes at this time," Amnesty International said in a statement.

One of his friends, Ali Rizvi, said from Toronto that the delay is "definitely encouraging."

"None of us are completely satisfied," he told CNN's "New Day."

Rights groups and others, including the U.S. State Department, have called for Saudi Arabia to call off the floggings, the first of which appeared to be captured on unverified cell phone video uploaded to YouTube.

"Not only does this postponement on health grounds expose the utter brutality of this punishment, it underlines its outrageous inhumanity," said Said Boumedouha, Amnesty International's deputy Middle East and North Africa program director.
