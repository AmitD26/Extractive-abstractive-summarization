(CNN)A video purportedly shows three British schoolgirls preparing to cross the Turkish border last month into Syria, where the teens are believed to have traveled to join ISIS, a Turkish TV network reported Friday.

If authentic, the video would represent the first publicly released images showing the girls at the Turkey-Syria border.

The video, released by Turkish TV network A Haber and distributed by Reuters, shows three warmly dressed females who resemble the missing teens standing with luggage outside a car and talking to at least one man who is helping them with the bags.

"Put your bags. ... Hurry, don't stop here," a man says in the video.

The girls in the video wear coats, two with fur-lined hoods covering their heads. A third wears a hijab.

"He just hung up," one of them says.

It wasn't immediately clear how A Haber obtained the video. CNN couldn't immediately verify the footage's authenticity.

The video's release came a day after Turkey's foreign minister said his country arrested a "spy" who allegedly helped the British girls get into Syria. The alleged agent was working for a country that is part of an international anti-ISIS coalition, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday.

This month, a Turkish broadcaster released images that it said showed the British girls boarding a bus in Istanbul after they arrived from London.

A trip to Gaziantep would have been long: The border town is more than 525 miles to the southeast of Istanbul.

Authorities have said they have no reason to believe the girls are still in Turkey and believe they have crossed into Syria, parts of which have been taken over by Islamist terror group ISIS.
