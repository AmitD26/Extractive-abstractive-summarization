It's just the latest news in the saga concerning what critics say is Twitter's inability to play nice with its friends on the Internet. The social platform, once known for its openness, has been putting up walls around its service to make it more difficult for other sites and apps to access its data.

"I don't think people understand that Twitter is a start-up that has to make money, not a non-profit-up," New York Times writer Nick Bilton said on Twitter.

Tumblr is not happy about the most recent change.

In July, Twitter revoked friend-finding access to the photo-sharing app Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. And it restricted the professional network LinkedIn, too.

Twitter also announced changes last week to some of the rules governing the way it shares data about its users with other sites. They go into effect in six months.

The company, which acquired Tumblr's competitor, Posterous, in March, issued the following statement to CNN via e-mail: "Some folks covering this have pointed to our comment from the Instagram situation. ('We understand that there's great value associated with Twitter's follow graph data, and we can confirm that it is no longer available within Instagram.') We don't have anything to share beyond that."

Twitter's recent moves have been met with considerable criticism.

"This reeks of grade-school drama," Jennifer Van Grove of VentureBeat wrote in reference to the Tumblr friend-finder change. "It's the second instance of Twitter acting like a bully and refusing to share its friends on the social networking playground."

The Next Web said, "This is part of Twitter turning the screws on sharing information about the users of its network."
