Rome (CNN)Italy's highest court Friday will consider whether to uphold the 2009 murder conviction of American Amanda Knox, according to Judge Gennaro Marasca.

The high court judge will either uphold the murder convictions of Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, or send the case back for another appeal, or potentially on to a different section of the court.

Knox, a 27-year-old Seattle native, and Raffaele Sollecito were convicted of the 2007 killing of Knox's British roommate, Meredith Kercher. Knox and Kercher lived together in Italy at the time of Kercher's death.

Sollecito and Knox were acquitted in 2011 on appeal, and then Knox returned to the United States. However, Italy's Supreme Court overturned the acquittals in 2013, and they were convicted last year after a retrial.

If a new trial is ordered, Knox and Sollecito will buy a little time before a final decision is reached. But if the court upholds the conviction, the case will be closed for good -- and what happens to Knox next is uncertain.

Sollecito, on the other hand, still lives in Italy, and has a lot more to lose than Knox does, at least in the short term. He would be scooped up immediately and hauled off to prison to start a 25-year sentence. All of his options will have been exhausted and he will have no choice but to go to directly to jail.

Rudy Guede, from the Ivory Coast, was convicted separately in a fast-track trial and is midway through a 16-year sentence for Kercher's murder. His case was confirmed by Italy's high court in 2010.

Many commentators in the U.S. have reasoned that Italy may not ask the United States for Knox's extradition because it would cause a diplomatic rift between the two nations. But there could be a greater rift if it appears that Knox gets away with murder and her Italian ex-boyfriend pays for the crime.

"It will be seen as an injustice," Capponi told CNN. "You may not see people out on the streets, but if you ask 10 people what they think, those 10 people will tell you they see it as a complete injustice that only the Italian and the African are in prison. The Italians will say that the American gets away with murder and it won't be the first time."

This is not the first time Italy and the United States have butted heads on matters involving American suspects accused of crimes in Italy.

In 2012, Italy's highest court upheld the convictions of 23 Americans (22 CIA agents and an Air Force pilot) for the kidnapping of Egyptian cleric Abu Omar, a suspeced terrorist, from a street in Milan. They were sentenced to between five and eight years in prison, but Italy has not yet asked for extradition.

"Our relationship with the United States is full of these diplomatic tensions," said Capponi. "This will just be added to the list."

Knox's case has been divisive from the start, and her supporters have come down hard on the Italian judicial system. Sollecito has never had the luxury of that attitude, knowing full well that he is in the hands of the system whether he likes it or not, so vocally criticizing it wouldn't be in his best interest.

By almost any Italian precedent, Sollecito should not have had to be in prison during his initial trial -- but because Knox was deemed a flight risk, she had to stay in jail. Because Sollecito was her co-defendant, he did too, even though he had no ties to anyone abroad.

Last summer, he held a press conference when his lawyers filed their appeal to the high court, in which his lawyer Giulia Bongiorno pointed out "certain anomalies" in Knox's testimony that have nothing to do with Sollecito.

Now it is up to the judge to determine whether that makes any difference.
