(CNN)Robert Boardwine's path to fatherhood was unconventional, but Virginia's appeals court said Tuesday he is legally entitled to be a part of his son's life.

The Court of Appeals of Virginia decided differently in weighing the commonwealth's assisted conception statute and denying Bruce's appeal to deny Boardwine visitation.

"The plain meaning of the term 'medical technology' does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster," the appeals court wrote in its decision.

Bruce's attorney, Monica T. Monday, said she would need to talk to her client before she can comment about whether they will file an appeal.

Boardwine initially was hesitant when Bruce approached him in 2010 with the turkey baster idea, the court document says.

They tried the turkey baster method a few times. He'd come over to her house, go to a room alone, bring his sperm in a plastic cup, they'd chat, and he'd leave. Then she'd use the kitchen utensil and wait.

After she didn't get pregnant, she twice tried a fertility doctor. No luck.

She and Boardwine tried a few more times, and in July, she learned she was going to have a baby.

Boardwine came by the house with a stuffed bear and clothes for the baby.

Then they argued. Over what to name the baby.

Joyce Bruce said the visits were "strained."

The appeals court affirmed the lower court's ruling, saying the turkey baster doesn't constitute reproductive technology.

Boardwine was awarded joint legal custody and visitation.

CNN also reached out to his attorney Tuesday but didn't get a reply.
