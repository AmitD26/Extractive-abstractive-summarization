(CNN)Thousands of Palestinians are trapped in the devastated Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria, which has mostly been seized by groups including ISIS, activists report.

Calling the lives of Yarmouk refugees "profoundly threatened" on Sunday, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency issued a statement urging humanitarian aid access.  "Never has the hour been more desperate in the Palestine refugee camp of Yarmouk," the statement said.

The UNRWA estimates 18,000 civilians remain trapped in the camp that has been engulfed in fighting between the government and rebel forces since December 2012.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency reports up to 2,000 people have fled in the past two days as food, water and medical supplies remain scarce.

"All people are trying to leave the camp," says Syrian activist Abu Mohammed in Damascus who used to live in Yarmouk.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports barrel bombs were dropped on the camp Sunday as clashes continued.
