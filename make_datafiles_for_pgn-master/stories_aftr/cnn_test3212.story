(LifeWire) -- After his father was diagnosed with dementia in 1996, Anthony Lazzara Jr. faced a difficult decision: He and his wife, Gail, either could place his father, Anthony Lazzara Sr., in a facility, or they could care for him themselves.

So began eight long years of caring for the World War II veteran and onetime truck driver as he slowly declined -- a burden borne largely by Gail, 56.

"I couldn't take my frustration out on my father-in-law," she says. Instead, she took it out on her husband.

"We almost ended up divorcing over the whole deal," says Anthony Jr., 56.

Two years ago, the Lazzaras finally threw in the towel. A bed became available at a local Veterans Affairs facility, and the elder Lazzara was admitted. He remained there until April 2008, when he died at age 95.

A difficult labor of love

In 2004, the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP reported that over 44 million Americans care for an adult family member or friend. Almost 80 percent of these are caring for someone older than 50.

Although caring for a parent in their twilight years can be rewarding, it can also be a trial, says Beth Witrogen, the Pulitzer Prize-nominated author of "Caregiving: The Spiritual Journey of Love, Loss and Renewal."

For a while, the Levis cared for Al's father at home, but eventually it got to be more than they could handle. Levi placed his father in a nursing home this past summer. But he says the ordeal has continued to strain his marriage.

"It's complicated," he says.

It's also crucial that couples communicate clearly and effectively, Witrogen says. Too often, one partner will fixate on solving the problem while neglecting to listen to the other's needs. In the Lazzaras' case, Anthony Jr. says he would search for care facilities for his father from time to time, but Gail was still left to shoulder most of the daily duties of care -- something her husband still feels guilty about.

It wasn't until the Lazzaras finally found room for Anthony Sr. at the VA facility that they finally found some relief.

"We knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel," Anthony Jr. says.

Balancing your needs

"When the psychological needs of the care recipient are addressed, this can no doubt have a positive effect on the marital relationship of the caregivers," she says.

It's also important that couples care for one another.

"We nearly crashed and burned," Anthony Jr. says.

How to cope

Author Witrogen offers the following tips for coping when a couple's "for better or worse" turns to the latter in caring for an elderly parent:

• Talk it out. Bring in a third party such as an attorney to provide objective perspective. Those short on money can invite clergy or a neighbor.

• Don't neglect your health. Sleeping enough, eating right and exercising displaces stress from your partner.
