(CNN) -- Venezuela expelled Israel's ambassador to the country Tuesday and accused Israel of attempting to carry out "genocide" against the Palestinian people.

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called the Israeli army "cowards."

The statement added that the government "condemns strongly the flagrant violations of international law" by Israel and "denounces their planned utilization of state terrorism."

In a news conference broadcast by state-run Venezuelan television, President Hugo Chavez blasted the Israeli military.

It said that Chavez "makes a fraternal call to the Jewish people throughout the world to oppose these criminal policies of the state of Israel that recall the worst pages of the history of the 20th century.

Mark Regev, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, was unswayed.

He predicted that other countries would not follow suit, even in the Middle East.
