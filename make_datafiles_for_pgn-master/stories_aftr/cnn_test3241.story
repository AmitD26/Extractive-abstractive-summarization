They are shocked and scared by the news headlines: some food produced in China is tainted with melamine.

Chinese premier Wen Jiabao says China will take steps to win back consumers.

"Three minister-level officials have resigned and a government investigation is going on. Whoever is responsible must be brought to justice. We need to protect the Made in China brand," said Chinese analyst Victor Gao.

But the problem could be more pervasive. The state-run Nanfang Daily published an investigative story saying that adding melamine into animal feed has become an "open secret."

The report said adding melamine into feed started in the aquatic farming industry five years ago, as a way of faking higher protein levels.  Learn more about chemical melamine Â»

It then spread into other agro-industries such as poultry. Even more shocking is the allegation that the melamine added is from industrial waste material.

Two years ago, reports revealed pet food exported from China to the United States was spiked with melamine and had sickened and killed dogs.

Tests in Hong Kong last week showed eggs exported by a Chinese company are contaminated with excessive levels of melamine.

In recent days three other brands of eggs have also been found to contain the chemical.

Small wonder egg sales at the Xinfadi, a wholesale market in Beijing, dropped by 10 percent this week, according to the state-run China Daily.

Chinese officials say the source of the problem is melamine, an industrial chemical used to produce plastics and fertilizer. Melamine is high in nitrogen.

Agriculture experts speculate that eggs tainted with melamine may be the result of tainted feed given to hens. That begs the question: if melamine was in the animal feed, will it make into the meat, and into consumers' bodies?

But taking in a small amount of melamine poses no such danger. "If it's taken over a long period of time, maybe, but if it's ingested only for short period of time it does not pose harm on animals," says He Jiguo, a professor of food science and nutrition at the China Agriculture University.

Until the situation is resolved, worried grocery shoppers in Beijing say they'll just have to eat fewer eggs and more bean-products, like soybeans.
