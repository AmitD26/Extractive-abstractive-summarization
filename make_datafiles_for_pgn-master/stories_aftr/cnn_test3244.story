NEW YORK (CNN) -- It was a typical November day in 1971 when an eighth-grader left her house in a sleepy New Hampshire town with her pet dog, Tasha, in tow.

Kathy Gloddy was found murdered a mile from where she was last seen.

The German shepherd returned home that day without its 13-year-old master, Kathy Gloddy.

To her family's horror, the little girl's body was found the next day, three miles from her home.

Her body was found clothed only in her kneesocks.

Kathy's family asked private investigator Tom Shamshak to aid in the investigation and he agreed to volunteer his services.

So far, investigators have only been able to piece together a timeline of the day Kathy went missing.  Watch an update on the case Â»

It is believed that she left her family's home at 5 p.m. to go to a convenience store, where she bought ice cream and potato sticks.

"This kind of brutality and rage-driven crime can only come from someone that knew her or her family," he said.

"One of the things my team is working on is trying to get the post-mortem DNA evidence collected by the forensic pathologist who examined her," Shamshak said.

While there is not a lot of evidence left, it is the one piece of evidence the family hopes could link potential suspects to Kathy's murder.

"We have waited so long for justice and closure," said Karen Beaudin, another of Kathy's sisters.

Gilbert said there are at least two persons of interest authorities have focused on and both were acquainted with Kathy Gloddy and her family.

Gilbert said police thought they'd caught a break in 2004 when convicted sex offender Edward Dukette, who served time in a Florida prison for raping and nearly killing a young girl, unexpectedly came forward to police claiming he had key information about Kathy Gloddy's murder.

The Gloddy family and Tom Shamshak have said they believe there is more than one person responsible for Kathy Gloddy's murder. The family is organizing a reward fund in conjunction with the Carole Sund Foundation.

Anyone who has information that could lead to the arrest of the individuals responsible for Kathy Lynn Gloddy's murder is asked to call the New Hampshire State Police Crime Unit tip line at 603-271-3636.
