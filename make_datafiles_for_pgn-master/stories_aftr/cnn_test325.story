Emilio Hoffman was shot in a locker room at Reynolds High School in Troutdale.

Almost as soon as the news spread that Hoffman was the victim, a candlelight vigil was quickly organized. Hundreds of students and parents showed up Tuesday night to remember the teen, who was a standout soccer player.

"To the parents out there -- Love your kids. Hug your kids every day. And live with no regrets. I don't have any regrets with Emilio. None. And he knew that," she said.

Hoffman had one sister and three brothers, plus a number of foster brothers and sisters. He enjoyed science and history, but loved sports -- especially soccer.

"He was a sweet boy," friend Savannah Rowe told CNN. "He acted all cool around his friends, but when you got to know him he was just sweet and always there for you if you needed someone to talk to."

They got to know each other in middle school, and they were in choir together, Rowe said.

As soon as the lockdown was lifted, Hoffman was the first person she tried to reach by phone, she said.

"I wish I could have said goodbye, or told him how much he meant to me, but I know he knows," Ensign said.

Student Cody Gleason was close to where the shooting happened, and he heard and watched it unfold. He heard the shots, which he initially mistook for firecrackers, and then saw people running.

That morning, he was supposed to see Hoffman in a class where he was his teacher's assistant.

"He was a great kid, I loved him," Gleason said. "He was always respectful to his teachers. He was a great student."
