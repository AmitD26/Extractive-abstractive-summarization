ASUNCION, Paraguay (CNN)  -- Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo acknowledged Monday that he is the father of a 2-year-old child who was conceived when he was a Roman Catholic bishop.

Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo speaks at a news conference in Asuncion on Monday.

The announcement came in the week after Carrillo had filed suit in a city in southern Paraguay seeking a paternity test.

Judge Evelyn Peralta, who is overseeing the case, said she was treating it routinely. "It is a case like any other, which involves the president and nothing more," she said. "It will be processed as it should be."

Some Cabinet members interpreted Lugo's acknowledgment of paternity as an indication of the change he has promised to bring about to achieve greater transparency in the public sector.

Sen. Julio Cesar Velasquez of the opposition Colorado Party called on the Vatican to excommunicate Lugo.

Journalist Sanie Lopez Garelli contributed to this report from Asuncion.
