However, Roddick was clearly still in some discomfort as he served in the next game and decided to take the safety-first option with Wimbledon starting in just nine days.

"I'm going to do everything I can to play at Wimbledon," Roddick told Press Association Sport. "We're scheduled to get it looked at again on Monday and do some scans on it, then we'll see where we're at.

"Initial tests have shown the stability and strength is OK. We're looking at days, not weeks. My trainer and doctors don't think anything is torn."

Meanwhile, Murray swept into his first-ever Queen's final with a ruthless 6-2 6-4 win over unseeded Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero.

Murray is bidding to become the first Briton to win the pre-Wimbledon warm-up event since Bunny Austin in 1938.

The world number three has not dropped a set in four matches and, in reaching his fifth ATP Tour final this year, he also becomes the first British finalist here since Tim Henman in 2002.

"I felt it was a good match. I started well but the second set was very close," Murray said in a courtside interview after the match. "I'm obviously happy to win in two sets. I was very happy with the way I played all round.

"I didn't have the easiest draw so it's been a good week all around and hopefully I can finish it off on Sunday," added the Scot.

In the other men's grass-court tournament being played, second seed Novak Djokovic is through to the final in Halle after a 7-6 6-4 victory over Belgian Olivier Rochus.

The Serb will now face unseeded German Tommy Haas, who defeated compatriot Philipp Kohlschreiber 2-6 7-6 7-6 in an epic encounter.
