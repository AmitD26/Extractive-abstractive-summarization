BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Smoke blanketed the Argentine capital Friday as brush fires apparently set deliberately consumed thousands of acres in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Entre RÃ­os.

Randazzo called the situation a "disaster."

As of Friday morning, little progress had been made extinguishing the blazes.

On Friday morning, the National Roads Administration closed sections of the heavily traveled Panamericana Highway, which leads in and out of Buenos Aires. Spokesman Ernesto Arriaga said "visibility is 5 meters" (about 16 feet) in some sections of the highway.

"Covering highways with smoke just to clear a field of weeds is unforgivable," Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez told Radio Diez. "It's incredibly irresponsible."

Hospitals have reported an increase in visitors complaining of breathing problems, sore throats and burning eyes in the past three days.

Citing a high level of carbon monoxide in the air, officials have encouraged people not to exercise outside.

Schools in Pilar, a city in the province of Buenos Aires, were closed Friday because of the gray, thick air.

The smoke has obscured views of some of the capital's landmarks, such the Obelisco monument and the government house, Casa Rosada, and people were seen walking on the city streets covering their faces with clothes.

The bitter lockout left grocery shelves empty and caused major friction between President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's government and Argentina's large agricultural sector. E-mail to a friend
