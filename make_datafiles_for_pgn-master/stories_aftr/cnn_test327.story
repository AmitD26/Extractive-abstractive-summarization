Dunleavy said the plane, which was traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, adjusted its altitude on its way across Europe under the direction of air traffic control.

Now, he said the airline is reassessing the route it uses for that flight. And since Thursday's crash, commercial airlines that usually cross eastern Ukraine on their flights to Europe, Asia and elsewhere have been detouring away from the volatile region.

"The rules in aviation are written in blood, or a tombstone mentality if you like," CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. "What happens is, people die, and things get safer."

David Soucie, a CNN safety analyst and former FAA safety inspector, said the situation highlights the need for change in an antiquated system that has what he calls a "flaw in the evaluation of the risk."

Eight unanswered questions

"There's a lot of questions to be asked in a lot of different places," O'Brien said. "Malaysia, for example, what about the airline policy? What did they inform crews and flight dispatchers about flying through that particular part of the world? And why didn't government officials close off that airspace completely? 32,000 feet, that's a completely arbitrary number."

The U.N.'s International Civil Aviation Organization can't close airspace, Emirates President Tim Clark told Reuters, "but they can issue advisories and they may be a little more active."

The airline chief's comments are a good sign that changes soon could be in the works, O'Brien said.

"None of us, I think, would have conceived that kind of devastation from a surface-to-air missile," he said. "Evading missiles (is) not part of our training. That's just something that's not in our vocabulary at this point and time."

But now, he said, guidelines for pilots will likely change.

"Now we've got a new threat that we've got to deal with," he said. "Now we've lost lives."
