London, England (CNN) -- Police in London have reached a settlement with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, whom officers shot dead in 2005, mistaking him for a suicide bomber.

"All litigation between them arising out of the tragic death of Jean Charles de Menezes has been resolved," the statement added.

The controversial shooting of the unarmed Brazilian man sparked a number of investigations, including one that found police acted illegally.

A jury found in 2007 that London's Metropolitan Police Service broke health and safety laws in the shooting. It did not examine the cause of death.

Jurors at a 2008 inquest found that the police who shot de Menezes did not shout a warning before firing at him. They also found that de Menezes did not advance toward armed officers on the subway train, which would have given them a reason to shoot.

But the coroner at the inquest, who acted as the judge, had told the jury members they could not return a verdict of unlawful killing.

They returned an open verdict in the case, meaning the jury was unable to establish a cause of death. De Menezes' family called the proceedings a "whitewash" because jurors were not allowed to consider a verdict of unlawful killing.

The city was on edge as police sought the four failed bombers.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded in 2007 that de Menezes was innocent of anything that might have justified police action.
