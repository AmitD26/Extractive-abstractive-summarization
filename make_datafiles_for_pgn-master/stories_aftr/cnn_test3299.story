Under the bill, which President Obama is expected to sign Tuesday at the earliest, most Americans will now be required to have health insurance or pay a fine. Larger employers will be required to provide coverage or risk financial penalties. Total individual out-of-pocket expenses will be capped, and insurers will be barred from denying coverage based on gender or pre-existing conditions.

"Doctors, nurses and financial officers see a part of our health care system that many Americans don't, if they're lucky," she said.

Another reader used sarcasm to suggest that people will find a way around paying premiums. "This is cool. I'm just going to drop my insurance now, pay the $700 yearly fine, and then pickup insurance when I get sick since insurance companies can't deny me," he wrote on the Sound Off section of a CNN.com news story published after the bill passed. "I'll save a bundle of money every year."

"I suspect this is what most 'smart' Americans will do," he continued. "And then guess what? Insurance companies will collapse because they'll have no pool of money to pay for the claims that start coming in, and we'll be in a world of hurt again."

What will health care reform mean to you?

Many people who responded to CNN's coverage said they were happy the bill passed simply because the current system was not working. Government-backed health care is "the best compromise possible," Egberto Willies said. He's relieved that his wife, who has lupus, and his daughter, a pre-med student, won't have to worry about health care as much under the new bill, he said. "America has joined the civilized world," he said in his iReport video.

Cliff Olney's daughter was born premature, and he's had to spend more than two decades caring for her with Medicaid, the U.S. health program funded by state and federal governments available to low-income people or people with disabilities.

"Forcing me to take a health care package that I may not need is dictatorial and not in keeping with the spirit or a free nation," Ingram wrote in his iReport. He said he's written to his representatives about the bill and said both parties are a "sham." He plans to refuse to buy a health care plan.

"The hardest thing for me, is that I know he has medical issues that go unattended because we simply can't afford it," she wrote. "We truly are a family that is one major illness away from financial disaster. So I hope this bill will help our situation, and the situations of people much less fortunate than ourselves."
