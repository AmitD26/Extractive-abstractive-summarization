(EW.com) -- It has been over three years since we last saw Will Smith on the silver screen in 2008â€²s "Seven Pounds."

Regardless of the profession, three years is a long break. But in the movie industry, it can be an eternity. So it was only natural for many to wonder whether Smith's previous box-office dominance would waver at all when "Men in Black 3" hit theaters last weekend. Could the movie star pick up where he left off in 2008 and continue selling a gazillion tickets as though his sabbatical simply never occurred? Well, sort of.

The legacy of 'men' in black

Furthermore, the first two "MIB" movies debuted on Wednesdays and would have scored even larger figures had they been held until Friday, like "Men in Black 3" was. And "Men in Black 3" was the series' only entry to benefit from 3-D surcharges.

Take a look at Smith's five last features: "Seven Pounds," "Hancock," "I Am Legend," "The Pursuit of Happyness," and "Hitch." Yes, "Men in Black 3" failed to compete with the likes of "Hancock" ($62.6 million debut) and "I Am Legend" ($77.2 million). But if you averaged the openings of all five films, it'd come out to $45 million -- or $52 million when adjusted for ticket-price inflation. In that light, "Men in Black 3's" $54.6 million debut isn't so disheartening. Disappointing for such a pricey sci-fi action franchise? Sure. But a stain on Smith's box-office report card? Not really.

But while we wait, it's nice to see a movie star of Will Smith's caliber back on the big screen -- even if his star is shining a tiny bit less brightly than it used to.
