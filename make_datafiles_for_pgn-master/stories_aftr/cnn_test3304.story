Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish fishing boat repelled an attack by suspected pirates Sunday morning in the Indian Ocean off the African coast, Spain's ministry of defense said.

A private security company aboard the fishing vessel returned fire and thwarted the attack, the statement said.

Following the attack, the Ortube Berria was sailing southward away from the area, the defense ministry said.

Pirates have captured more than 50 ships this year off Somalia and are currently holding 11, according to information from Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon.

The Alakrana was hijacked off the coast of Somalia.

On Sunday, the commander of a European Union anti-piracy operation, deployed a Portuguese frigate based in the area toward the site of the attack, Spanish authorities said.
