(CNN) -- Conflicting reports emerged Sunday about whether Adam Gadahn, a U.S.-born spokesman for al Qaeda, has been arrested in Pakistan.

Reports of the arrest came hours after Islamist Web sites posted video of Gadahn praising the November massacre at Fort Hood, Texas. On the video, Gadahn said the U.S. Army major charged with gunning down 13 people "lit a path" for other Muslim service members to follow.

Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, has  routinely posted lengthy videos on Islamist online forums.

One of the figures, top Taliban leader Agha Jan Motasim, was arrested on Friday. Motasim's capture came on the heels of the arrest of the Taliban's No. 2 figure and overall military commander, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.

Last month, Taliban and government sources confirmed that Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud had died. A government official told CNN Mehsud died as a result of a January 14 unmanned drone attack in North Waziristan; other sources said Mehsud died near the city of Multan in central Pakistan while on his way to a treatment center in Karachi.

A city of 13 million -- with some estimates of 100,000 new arrivals a month -- Karachi as seen an influx of Pashtuns from the tribal border region with Afghanistan. Many fled there during fighting and offensives in the Northwest Frontier Province and Waziristan, making it a comfortable place for the Taliban to blend in and count on a network of supporters.

"I think its become apparent ... that al Qaeda doesn't really have a base of sanctuary inside Afghanistan, at least not one where its leaders feel safe," CNN's Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson said. "They've taken to hiding inside Pakistan."

Gadahn, 31, grew up on a California farm and was home-schooled until 17. A year later he moved in with his paternal grandparents, who were secular Jews. He converted to Islam at the Islamic Society of Orange County, California, but was banned from the mosque two years later after hitting its chairman, Haitham Bundjaki.

In 2008, he renounced his U.S. citizenship and destroyed his passport in another al Qaeda video.

"I believe that defiant Brother Nidal is the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes," Adam Gadahn says in English in the video.

"The Mujahid brother Nidal Hasan is a pioneer, a trailblazer and a role model who has opened a door, lit a path and shown the way forward for every Muslim who finds himself among the unbelievers and yearns to discharge his duty to Allah and play a part in the defense of Islam and Muslims," Gadahn says in the video.

Gadahn also cites in Sunday's video the U.S. and allied buildup in Afghanistan, where the United States is in the process of adding about 30,000 troops.

"It is rapidly becoming clear that this already-hot global battle is about to get even hotter," he says. "This is a war which knows no international borders and no single battleground, and that's why I am calling on every honest and vigilant Muslim in the countries of the Zionist-Crusader alliance in general and America, Britain and Israel in particular to prepare to play his due role in responding to and repelling the aggression of the enemies of Islam."
