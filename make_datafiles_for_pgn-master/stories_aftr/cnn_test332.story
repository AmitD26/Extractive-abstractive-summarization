Houston Astros pitcher Brandon Backe was among the wedding guests arrested in the brawl.

The fracas led to the arrest of 13 people, including Houston Astros pitcher Brandon Backe.

The disciplinary actions stem from the violation of Galveston police administrative procedures, which stymied investigators trying to determine whether rules about the use of force had been violated.

In the end, police said, the officers heeded the department's rules on the use of force but not on recording details of what happened.

The incident centered around the drunk and disorderly behavior of Daniel Cole O'Balle, 19, who had been attending his sister's wedding at a convention center, police said.

Police said O'Balle became "belligerent" when an officer confronted him and that he became "aggressive toward and noncompliant with" the officer. More officers showed up and others with the wedding party interfered to keep officers from arresting O'Balle, who threw punches at the officers, police said.

KHOU said Backe was charged with interfering with a police officer. A mug shot of the Astros pitcher shows bruises on his face.

Police gave the following account of what happened, based on an internal investigation:

"When Lt. Joel Caldwell arrived, he determined that the crowd was so out of control that it was necessary to clear the bar to re-establish order. Accordingly, Lt. Caldwell ordered a tactical crowd control line was formed to clear the bar.

"As officers instructed people to leave the bar, more individuals, some of whom were intoxicated, became belligerent and refused to leave when asked to do so," the account continued. "Those individuals who refused to leave peaceably or were otherwise disorderly, and those who appeared to officers to be intoxicated, were taken into custody for their violations."

Police said arrests were "based on probable cause" and that any force they used was a proper reaction to confront "resistance or interference."

The disciplinary actions are the result of an internal investigation in which 70 witnesses, suspects and officers were interviewed, documentation was examined and video was produced. Police investigators said "insufficient and inadequate reporting" by officers complicated their review of the case.

There were failures by some officers and supervisors "to properly file affidavits, supplemental reports, booking reports, use of force reports and arrest warrants."

The 13 disciplined officers also will be getting remedial training in documentation and reporting.
