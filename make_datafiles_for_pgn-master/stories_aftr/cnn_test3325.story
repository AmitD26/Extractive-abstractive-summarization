"This team, it's the masterpiece of Joachim Low. He has placed his mark on its make-up and created a perfect team," the 64-year-old told the German Football Federation's official website.

Saturday's win over Argentina was the third time in South Africa that Germany had scored four goals or more in a match and followed hard on the heels of the 4-1 rout of arch-rivals England.

"In the past, we would say that you had to leave the beautiful game in the dressing room, but this team shows that it is not a contradiction and that you can play well and win."

Beckenbauer has no doubt who will win when Germany faces European champions Spain in the semifinals in Durban.

"Germany have an advantage over Spain, who haven't yet shown the form that they did when winning the Euro 2008 title," he said.

"They haven't yet looked very convincing and struggled to snatch victory in the quarterfinals against Paraguay."

It is not the first time at these World Cup finals that Beckenbauer has spoken his mind.
