(CNN) -- World No. 1 Roger Federer got his European clay season up and running at the second attempt with a routine win in his opening match at the Estoril Open in Portugal on Wednesday.

"This win was not always beautiful but it doesn't matter. I'm sure my best tennis is not far away. I have a bit of a breather now and I'm looking forward to Friday."

But he has been surpassed by Rafael Nadal on the list of all-time Masters Series titles after the Spaniard won in Rome to match record-holder Andre Agassi on 17.

Nadal is poised to be Federer's biggest obstacle in his bid to retain his French Open title later this month, having ended an injury-wrecked past 12 months by winning his first two events of this season on clay.

Federer's route to a second success in Estoril has been made easier by the withdrawal of Croatian second seed Ivan Ljubicic, who has pulled out due to the stomach strain that ended the world No. 14's campaign in Rome.

Defending champion Albert Montanes moved into the last eight with a 6-1 6-2 victory against fellow Spaniard Daniel Gimeno-Traver.

The fourth seed will next play Uruguayan eight seed Pablo Cuevas, who overcame Spanish qualifier Marcel Granollers 7-6 (10-8) 7-6 (7-2).

Meanwhile, top seed Marin Cilic won his opening match at the BMW Open in Munich, moving into the second round as he completed a rain-delayed 6-4 6-2 victory over Michael Berrer on Wednesday.

The Croatian will next play another German, Simon Greul, whose fourth-seeded compatriot Philipp Kohlschreiber also progressed into round two by beating Daniel Brands 6-4 6-4.
