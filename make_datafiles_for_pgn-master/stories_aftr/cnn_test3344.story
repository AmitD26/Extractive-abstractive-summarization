He will destroy the goodwill generations of Americans have worked to create in almost every nation.  He will -- in just a few seconds of self-proclaimed glory and protest -- paint a target on the backs of U.S. troops, diplomats, foreign service employees, humanitarian relief workers and American tourists.

Worse, still, Jones and his followers will provide our enemies with a propaganda tool that will outlast our lives and those of our children and their children.

Burning a Quran will instantly undo everything good that America has done in the world. America's top general in Afghanistan, David H. Petraeus, recognizes the consequences of such an act.

No one will remember when a half-dozen Muslim nations joined a multinational coalition that included the U.S. to free Kuwait back in 1991.

No one will remember countless other projects to build schools and roadways and efforts to bring clean drinking water to people.

No one outside the United States will recognize or even care that burning a Quran was the act of a single or small group of individuals.

The First Amendment may protect the pastor's right to protest, but nothing is to be gained and everything is to lose from this self-serving act.

Our nation was founded on religious freedom and tolerance, yet a man of the cloth wants to invoke memories of a not-so-proud history when a developing America didn't want Catholics or Jews but did want slaves.

For the better part of this decade, Phelps and his followers have been protesting around the country at the funerals of fallen military members, carrying signs that say "Thank God for Dead Soldiers." He is now the subject of a First Amendment case scheduled before the U.S. Supreme Court next month.  [Snyder v. Phelps]

"America is not at war with Islam" is a statement that has been repeated publicly and repeated often by presidents and members of Congress from all political persuasions, not because it is politically correct but because it is true.

America is at war, however, against a small number of religious extremists who hide behind women and children and kill indiscriminately without remorse. We must not allow an equally small number of religious extremists in America to widen the war by burning the Quran ... or Torah or Bible.

America is far better than that.

It will undo all goodwill America has built up, Eubank argues, for generations to come

Dangerous extremists will exploit the act planned by U.S. religious extremists, he says

"America is not at war with Islam" is not politically correct, Eubank says; it is true
