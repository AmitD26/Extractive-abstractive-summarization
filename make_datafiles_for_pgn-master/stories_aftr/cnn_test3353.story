(CNN) -- When I was a child, I always wondered how an ocean liner could fit on my street.

Never mind that a ship needed water. I lived on a small street in a small town in northern New Jersey and my father would constantly make reference to a time when his ship would come in.

I later learned that this was a figure of speech that described a future time when our family's financial resources would increase. And until that time arrived, we would live within our means and limit our purchases to those items that we could afford. My father was committed to debt-free living.

Now that I am an adult, I understand this commitment more than ever. My congregation embarked upon a debt-free mission five years ago that has reaped tremendous rewards for many of our families. The mission is called "dfree" and the "d" stands for debt, delinquencies and deficits. We are attempting to break the culture of debt that has become a plague in our society and start a family-based economic empowerment movement.

The three focal points of debt, delinquency and deficit represent the cornerstones of family financial strength.

First, debt: Americans owe a lot of money. The levels of family debt are threatening our ability to develop any meaningful wealth or to pass that wealth on to future generations.

Second, the commitment to eliminating delinquencies means that we, as a congregation, are pledging to pay our bills on time. Late payments lower our credit scores and this causes us to pay higher interest rates even on good debt such as mortgages.

These three objectives are the foundation of our dfree campaign.

Therefore, dfree is a strategy rather than just a curriculum. Dfree does involve classes, seminars and other events. But the driving principle is to popularize debt-free living and to teach people how to achieve it.

When church members testify on Sundays during the worship experience that they have paid off multiple credit cards or finished paying for a car, the entire congregation affirms them by celebrating their victory with handclaps and shouts. Such affirmation and celebration has begun to change the culture of our entire membership.

The dfree approach is not only good for churches. Community organizations, credit unions and student groups can also adapt the strategy for their members. Every organization that cares about its members has the potential to help them break the cycle of debt in their lives.

Each unit lasts three months and includes training designed to help students become teachers.

Merchandise and tools are available for churches that decide to become a part of the dfree movement. Dfree has also formed a partnership with a national bank that provides a low-cost, custom prepaid debit card that eliminates bank overdraft fees that can be so expensive. This debit card is a key tool for those attempting to take control of their finances.

• Keep my expenses below my income

• Invest in assets that grow in value

There are many definitions of freedom. Given the avalanche of bankruptcies, foreclosures and high-interest credit card debt that many people are experiencing, there may be no greater need than to understand the value and joy of debt-free living. There may be no greater legacy we can leave our children.
