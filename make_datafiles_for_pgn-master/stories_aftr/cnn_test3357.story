(CNN) -- Meet Phonchan Kraiwatnutsorn (Newey) and you quickly get the feeling, she is a no-nonsense young lady with a driving personality.

But you don't need Thai lessons to pronounce her name, because she goes by the nickname "Newey". Most Thais forsake their formal names for a single nickname.

At 30, Newey is a Thai citizen and director of the Youth Venture program in Thailand, an initiative that is empowering young "changemakers," as the parent organization Ashoka calls them, to improve the quality of life in their communities.

Newey has quite a track record of working in this field, having co-founded YIY, a youth group that creates opportunities for young people to grow into engaged citizens and social entrepreneurs.

"Reading and writing is a way to peace and a channel to express myself," Newey says of her true love.

Over the course of the next year, Newey will show you her work in the teeming city of Bangkok, but also take you to the rural countryside, where conditions can be even more challenging. E-mail to a friend
