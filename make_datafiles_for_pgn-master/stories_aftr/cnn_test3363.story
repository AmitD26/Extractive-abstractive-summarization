(CNN) -- Lie-detector tests could be used in a bid to stamp out corruption in cricket, an advisory committee of the sport's rule-making body announced on Wednesday.

Cricket was shrouded in controversy earlier this year when three members of the Pakistan team became the subject of match-fixing allegations during a tour of England.

"The committee feels more resources -- and increased powers -- are required to attempt to eradicate this issue from the game. The education of players should not be a meaningless formality; the message should be pressed home with regularity by figures known and respected by the players."

The committee, comprised of past and present cricketers and officials, also said that captains should take more responsibility for their players.

However, the proposal to use lie-detectors to determine whether or not players are competing for the right reasons has already been questioned.

"But what I do know, and is probably more important, is that we don't want the whiff of anything suspicious going on in the game."

The ongoing scandal took a further turn when Pakistani wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider fled to Britain during a series with South Africa in Abu Dhabi, claiming he had refused to fix a match.

"We've seen how disruptive and detrimental to the game of cricket it is. If we have to take extreme measures in order to be 100% confident the game is being played in the right spirit, then I'd certainly be happy to do that," Strauss said.

"I'd have to think about the arguments (for lie-detector tests) first. But the principle, of having 22 guys on the pitch that the supporters are absolutely 100% certain are playing the game for the right reasons, is a good thing."
