The announcement clears the way for the return of Hassan Mushaimaa, leader of Bahrain's largest opposition party, the Haq Movement. Mushaimaa said he planned to arrive in Manama Tuesday evening -- amid early speculation that he would be arrested.

The mass protests planned for Tuesday in support of calls for political reforms and other concessions and coincided with Mushaimaa's return..

Mushaimaa, who has been living abroad, had previously been detained by the government for campaigning for more democratic rights in the island monarchy.

But the king's decision closed the books on the case against Mushaimaa, giving him the freedom to return without fear of arrest.

Meanwhile, fallout from last week's violent protests continues.

Prior to Mohammed's death, about 10 protesters were thought to have died in five days of protests, but opposition activists say dozens more are unaccounted for.

In announcing the decision, Crown Prince Salman said, "We felt it was important for the country to focus on immediate issues of national interest and leave the hosting of Bahrain's Formula 1 race to a later date."

The country hopes to host the race "in the very near future, according to Zayed R. Alzayani, chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit.

State television on Monday broadcast images of pro-government demonstrators who gathered near a mosque in the capital city, holding flags and chanting slogans including "Long live the king."

Also on Monday, Standard & Poor's downgraded Bahrain's credit rating by one step and advised investors that it believes continued protests could result in a further degradation of the country's ability to meet its financial obligations.

"We expect the demonstrations that have taken place over the past month will persist," the agency wrote.

Protesters initially took to the streets of Manama last week to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy.

But some are now calling for the removal of the royal family, which has led the Persian Gulf state since the 18th century.

The Bahrain Center for Human Rights says authorities launched a clampdown on dissent in late 2010. It accused the government of torturing some human rights activists.
