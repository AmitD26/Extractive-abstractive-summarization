(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney's second-half hat-trick helped Manchester United move seven points clear in the English Premier League on Saturday as title rivals Arsenal and Chelsea were both held to draws.

The home fans were furious when the Serbian defender remained on the pitch despite illegally denying striker Demba Ba what appeared to be a goalscoring opportunity, and United hit back in the second half after bringing on strikers Hernandez and Dimitar Berbatov to replace Evra and midfielder Park Ji-Sung.

Rooney curled in a superb free-kick in the 65th minute, then leveled eight minutes later with the 100th Premier League goal of his career.

Mexico forward Hernandez sealed the victory from Ryan Giggs' cross with six minutes to play to give United a morale-boosting win ahead of Wednesday's first leg of the Champions League quarterfinal at Chelsea.

Striker Jon Walters gave 10th-placed Stoke the lead in the eighth minute after surging forward from the halfway line, but Ivory Coast star Didier Drogba leveled with his first goal since January 24 with a header from Nicolas Anelka's cross in the 33rd minute.

Drogba twice hit the woodwork, while Stoke's Marc Wilson and Robert Huth were both denied by the crossbar.

Ancelotti brought on Fernando Torres for Anelka after an hour, but the Spain striker is still yet to score following his $80 million move from Liverpool in January.

Second-placed Arsenal no longer have the distraction of playing in Europe, but Arsene Wenger's team's poor run continued with a 0-0 draw at home to 10-man Blackburn.

The result was a big blow in the London team's hopes of qualifying for next season's premier European competition, with fourth-placed Manchester City three points ahead of Harry Redknapp's side ahead of Sunday's home match against Sunderland.

Liverpool's bid to catch Tottenham and secure a Europa League place faltered after a 2-1 defeat at former manager Roy Hodgson's new team West Brom.

The result lifted West Brom into 12th place, four points above the relegation zone.

Seventh-placed Everton moved to within four points of local rivals Liverpool after snatching a 2-2 draw at home to Aston Villa, who came from behind to lead with a double from England striker Darren Bent.

Leighton Baines leveled with a penalty seven minutes from fulltime after Cameroonian midfielder Jean Makoun fouled Phil Jagielka.
