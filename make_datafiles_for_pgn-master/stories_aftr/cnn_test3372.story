Most details about the mission, including their names, were a closely held secret by the military. But earlier this month, with little notice, their identities and details of their rescue came out during a welcome-home ceremony at their air base. For the first time, the men spoke publicly to a small group of friends, family and Air Force personnel.

U.S. still not ready to recognize Libyan opposition

"We soon find ourselves in a situation where we are forced to eject over potentially hostile territory, and over the country of Libya. Something that neither one of us would ever have thought that we'd have to do," Harney, the pilot of the Strike Eagle said.

The Air Force is still trying to figure out why the plane crashed and a post-incident investigation is ongoing, but four days after the crash, Vice Adm. Bill Gortney, director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, told reporters that the military was "confident that it is not a result of hostile fire."

After the ejection, Harney -- "Meso" to his fellow fliers -- and "Mask" Stark became separated. "When you find yourself alone, and you're isolated, in a country where there's hostiles, you are scared," said Harney, a veteran of both the Afghan and Iraq wars.

Stark was found by Libyan civilians who protected him from possible retaliation by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, and eventually he was taken safely back to Europe. Details of how he was taken out of Libya have yet to be disclosed.

Harney's rescue came more quickly. He stayed in communications with another F-15 pilot still in the air over Libya. Eventually an MV-22 Osprey carrying Marines who were part of a Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel, or TRAP, team landed near his position.
