(CNN) -- Defending champion Serena Williams will face former winner Maria Sharapova in the fourth round at Wimbledon after both players progressed comfortably on Saturday.

World No. 1 Williams thrashed unseeded Slovakian Dominika Cibulkova 6-0 7-5 as she did not lose a game in the opening set for the third successive match.

Williams is seeking her fourth title at the grass-court grand slam in England, but said she has yet to find the form of last year despite an ominous start to the two-week tournament.

"It's really intense when I play Maria. It's a great match-up and it's good for the tour that she has come back and is playing well. I'll have to play better if I'm to continue to do well.

She beat Williams to claim the title as a 17-year-old, but has fallen down the rankings after a difficult past year.

"It'll be a really tough match. She's a defending champion and playing really well," the 23-year-old Russian told reporters.

Radwanska won 6-3 6-1 against Italian 32nd seed Sara Errani on Saturday, while Na beat Australia-based Russian Anastasia Rodionova 6-1 6-3.

The 19-year-old Dane will next face unseeded Czech Petra Kvitova after the 20-year-old knocked out 14th seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus with a 7-5 6-0 victory.

Italian 10th seed Flavia Pennetta also exited, losing 6-2 6-3 to Klara Zakopalova.
