Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's new authorities found chemical weapons about a month ago and asked for international aid in securing them, a top military spokesman for the National Transitional Council told CNN Monday.

"We found mustard gas missiles in Jufra and we asked our friends to come and help us," Col. Ahmed Bani said.

Jibril, speaking to reporters in Tripoli, said the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Hague and the United States were notified.

Jibril did not provide any details about the sites, their location or when they were discovered.

But U.S. officials told CNN in August that they and NATO had been discussing Libya's chemical weapons store with the transitional council in case the Gadhafi regime fell.

"The opposition forces are being asked to keep track of what's going on" with both weapons of mass destruction and the regime's inventory of surface-to-air missiles, a NATO official said.

"We have had direct eyes on the storage facilities" of the weapons for some time, the official said, including the use of satellites, drones and other surveillance aircraft.

The official also confirmed that intelligence personnel from the United States and other countries had been in Libya over the summer to help maintain security at various sites. "Individual nations have folks on the ground," he said in August.

Jibril said Sunday the OPCW is in direct contact with Libyan authorities and is taking the necessary measures to help Libya deal with the sites.

He declined to give details about the sites or weapons, but said the OPCW will make an announcement soon.

"By making this announcement, we reaffirm that the new Libya is a peaceful Libya, a Libya that abides by international law, a Libya that aims for development before anything else for the good of its people," Jibril said.

The destruction facility was sealed before the inspectors left but the OPCW does not know what happened to it since then. The inspectors' first job when they return will be to determine whether any of the material has been removed.

Before the outbreak of the crisis the Gadhafi regime had destroyed 55% of its declared amounts of mustard gas and 40% of its precursor chemicals for making weapons, according to the OPCW.

CNN reported earlier this year that Libya still had approximately 10 tons of the deadly blister agent left in its arsenal, according to an assessment from the Arms Control Association. Much of the material was located at the Rabta chemical weapons facility south of Tripoli.

CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr and CNN's Tim Lister and Pam Benson contributed to this report.
