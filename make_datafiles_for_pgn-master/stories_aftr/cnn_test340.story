Atlanta (CNN) -- The leader of one of the labs linked to an accidental anthrax exposure at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been reassigned, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner says.

Skinner would not confirm the name of the person who was reassigned.

"Based on most of the potential exposure scenarios, the risk of infection is very low," the agency said in a statement last week.

What to know about anthrax

Sometime between then and June 6, procedures in two of the three labs may have aerosolized the spores, the CDC said. Hallway and lab areas were decontaminated.

There are three types of anthrax infection: cutaneous (through the skin), inhalation (through the lungs) and gastrointestinal (through digestion).

Early symptoms can suggest the flu.

"And then after a day or two, in the worst case, if you don't get treatment, it could be lethal for you, and beyond treatment," he said.

The CDC said disciplinary action, as necessary, will be taken. The agency will also review safety protocol with employees.

CNN's Jake Tapper and Miriam Falco contributed to this report.
