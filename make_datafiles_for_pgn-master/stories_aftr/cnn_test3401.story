New York (CNN) -- As snow fell across New York harbor, Isabel Belarsky said she clutched her mother, Clara, aboard a passenger ship that puttered toward Ellis Island, and wondered what their new lives would bring.

The year was 1930. About a week earlier, the 10 year-old girl from what is now called Saint Petersburg, Russia, had embarked on a transatlantic journey with her Ukrainian parents from the French port city of Cherbourg, escaping what she described as Jewish persecution at the start of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union.

On an island near Manhattan stood the copper colossus that would etch her first memories of the new world.

"It was a wonderful sight," she said of the Statue of Liberty, which marks its 125th anniversary Friday.

And while the French gift is also widely believed to have at least in part catered to domestic politics, for many it quickly became a symbol of hope and promise in America's post- Civil War period.

"The arrival on Ellis Island is the fulfillment that you know something good is going to happen to you," said Belarksy, now a 91-year-old widow living in a Russian enclave of Brooklyn, New York.

Her family became part of the more than 12 million immigrants processed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954, according to the U.S. National Park Service.

"He put (the statue) where he did because its right at the narrows of New York harbor, so he knew that every boat that came into New York would have to come really close to it.

People felt like they could reach out and touch it," he said.

Only years later, Berenson argues, did the monument come to symbolize immigration to the broader public, despite the structure's engraved plaque bearing the now famous poem by Emma Lazarus, who asks for the "huddled masses yearning to breathe free."

"It was quite frightening," she recalled. "The three of us, my father, my mother and I, wanted for someone to come with money or to tell us whats next."

"He had such a beautiful voice," she said.

So the young family left Russia without plans to return, Belarsky added.

And though many immigrants entered the United States through Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, New Orleans and Miami; historians say steamship companies most often cruised into New York harbor, commonly making the Statue of Liberty the first land sighting for new arrivals.

"Everybody spoke of the golden land," said Belarksy. "Come to America where there's gold on the streets, until they came here and they had to live in walk-up tenement houses," she said, referencing hardships often endured in overcrowded city buildings.

Immigrants also commonly faced unsanitary and unsafe work conditions on docks and in factories as America's need for industrial labor grew.

"If you think immigration is unpopular now," said Berenson. "If anything it was even more unpopular in the 1890s and the first part of the 20th century."

Successive immigrant waves, however, still rushed to America's shores through Ellis Island and past the Statue of Liberty, often buoyed by the prospect of economic opportunity, he added.

"I think it took a while for people to think of themselves as Americans," said Berenson. "For an awful lot of people, what they wanted was to think of themselves as whatever they were originally, and as Americans too."
