(PEOPLE.com) -- Getting engaged made "Biggest Loser" contestant Vinny Hickerson feel like he had "a million pounds of weight off my shoulders."

Figurative weight, that is.

"There was no one there but us and a camera crew," says Diaz. "We sat down in the front row and he gives me a spiel about how he loves me more than anything."

Hickerson popped the question with a ring from Nashville's King Jewelers. "I thought it looked like the Eiffel Tower, which makes people think of beauty and romance," he says. "Just like the first time I saw Lori, out dancing in a zebra dress, I had that same feeling like, 'Oh my gosh, this is the one.' "

"I couldn't believe they were there just for us, in this huge, amazing place," says Diaz.

Before, "I wasn't out playing ball with Brennon and even watching him skateboard. I'd just sit in the car and watch," says Hickerson, who is down to 314 pounds after starting the show at 426 pounds "Now, there isn't anything I can't do!"
