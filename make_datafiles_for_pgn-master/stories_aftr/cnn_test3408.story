(CNN) -- Japanese protesters took to the streets Saturday to demand safer energy as the nation marked the three-month anniversary of an earthquake and tsunami that sparked the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years.

"We need electricity, but we cannot put lives at risk," said Kentaro Morisawa, a railway worker who took part in the Tokyo protest.

Crowds sang, chanted and beat drums in protests held nationwide.

"Because we are letting radioactive material leak into the environment, we are getting a bad reputation from overseas," protester Mamoru Matsuda said.

Some of the protesters gathered near the headquarters the Tokyo Electric Power Co., which operates the nuclear plant.

In addition, restrictions on various agricultural and fisheries products have devastated Japanese farmers and fishermen since the disaster started, though some of those bans have been lifted in recent weeks.

The protests are the latest show of discontent for embattled Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who survived a no-confidence vote in this month.
