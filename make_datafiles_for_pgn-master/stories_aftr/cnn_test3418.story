(CNN) -- In a speech to a wounded nation, presidential hopeful Mitt Romney returned to his roots of faith in the face of a national tragedy.

It was a rare public expression of faith for the candidate who has kept much of his faith private.

Romney, who was the head of a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints congregation in Boston, quoted heavily from the Bible and the Book of Mormon as he stood before a small crowd in New Hampshire.

"We can offer comfort to someone near us who is suffering or heavy laden," he said, a reference to the Gospel of Matthew where Jesus tells a crowd, "Come to me all ye who are heavy laden and I will give you rest, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

Romney continued, "And we can mourn with those who mourn in Colorado." That phrase "mourn with those who mourn" is found in the New Testament and is also found in the Book of Mormon.

"Our prayer is that the comforter might bring the peace to their souls that surpasses understanding," he said, evoking the Apostle Paul in his letter to the Philippians.

Romney also said grieving families could know they were being lifted in prayer by "people in every part of our great nation."

In Aurora, the agonized seek answers through faith

Perkins said that on Monday he had a wide-ranging face-to-face meeting with Romney in Baton Rogue. He said he told the candidate to be more open about his faith and the shared values he has with evangelical voters.

"I encouraged him to do it a little more," Perkins said.

"I think it was more a reflection of who Mitt Romney is, rather than who he has been," Perkins said.

"Most of the evangelicals think Mormons are going to hell and they aren't Christians," said Clyde Wilcox, a political science professor at Georgetown University who co-wrote "Onward Christian Soldiers?: The Religious Right in American Politics." "What he's saying is there is a commonality of faith and shared values."

Some evangelical students balked when Romney was chosen to give a commencement speech at Liberty University in Virginia in May. The school was founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell.

In response, Romney gave an address in which he addressed his faith head on.

"...People of different faiths, like yours and mine, sometimes wonder where we can meet in common purpose, when there are so many differences in creed and theology," Romney told those gathered for the commencement. "Surely the answer is that we can meet in service, in shared moral convictions about our nation stemming from a common worldview," he continued. "The best case for this is always the example of Christian men and women working and witnessing to carry God's love into every life."

Earlier this month, Romney, dressed in a suit jacket despite the sunny morning warmth, clasped hands with his wife, Ann, as they entered the Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints with their two sons and grandchildren.

"He offered a theology of comfort, compassionate conservatism if you will, consistent both with the biblical witness and with the needs of the country on tragic days like today," Prothero said.

To Prothero, Obama's speech sounded more pastoral and Romney sounded more presidential.

He said Romney was trying to "bind the nation together" and the Romney speech was more "self evidently a theological speech."

Haglund noted that "mourn for those who mourn," which is found in the Book of Mormon in Mosiah 18:9, "is in the top 10 passages for Mormons."

The speech also struck Haglund as more optimistic than President Obama's speech. "Mormons are pretty relentlessly cheerful. [Romney] doesn't mention any Mormon ideas of the afterlife, but certainly those ideas make such optimism possible in the face of such tragedy."

"The communities of family we build here are created in similar fashion in heaven. It's not unusual for Mormons to seem especially optimistic in the face of death or certain of the life to come. The views of afterlife are quite defined," she said. "Mormons really do expect families and communities to continue in heaven."
