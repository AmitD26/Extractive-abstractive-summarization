London (CNN) -- With 50 meters to go, it looked like Oscar Pistorius was cruising to gold in the men's 200 meters.

But then, to his outside, a flash of green went by, a 20-year-old Brazilian who rocketed past him to upset the most famous Paralympian of all time.

Pistorius, who uses carbon fiber prosthetic blades, made it to the semifinals of the individual 400-meter and the 400-meter relay final at the Olympics last month, running against athletes with no disablities.

Besides the 200-meter run, he will also compete in the Paralympics in the men's 100-meter-T44 (set for Wednesday and Thursday) and the 400-meter-T44 (happening Friday and Saturday), both of which he won in Beijing four years ago.

Long, a 20-year-old from Baltimore, is entered in nine events in the meet. She won three gold medals in Athens at age 12 and four more in Beijing. She also has a silver and bronze from 2008, giving her 12 career Paralympic Games medals.

Australian Jacqueline Freney won her third gold medal with a world record in the women's 200-individual medley (SM7).

At the weightlifting venue, Fatma Omar of Egypt set a world record in women's powerlifting. The 38-year-old won her 56-kilogram (123-pound) division with a lift of 140 kilograms (309 pounds).

New Zealand's Phillipa Gray and Laura Thompson also set a world record Sunday in the qualification round of the women's individual B pursuit, an event on a tandem bicycle for the visually impaired. They won the final, beating the Irish team of Catherine Walsh and Francine Meehan.

China has a huge lead in medals, topping the table with 87. The Chinese added to their total on Sunday with golds in table tennis from Feng Panfeng in men's singles (Class 3) and Liu Jing in women's singles (Class 1-2). China also took golds in rowing's mixed doubles sculls and men's single sculls from Huang Cheng, the world record holder.
