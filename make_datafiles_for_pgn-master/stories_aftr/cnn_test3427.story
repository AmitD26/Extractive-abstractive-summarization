(EW.com) -- "Snow White and the Huntsman" was awoken to the tune of $56.3 million this weekend, according to studio estimates.

"Snow White" also marked the best debut for star Kristen Stewart outside the "Twilight" franchise, and the second-best start for Charlize Theron after "Hancock." The film skewed female, but just barely, as 53 percent of its crowd consisted of women. The PG-13 revisionist fairy tale was also pretty evenly split between younger and older moviegoers, with 52 percent being at least 30 years old.

Over the weekend, "The Avengers" passed "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2" to become the third biggest movie ever globally. The movie has so far smashed $1.36 billion worldwide. Though again, third place is likely where it'll stay, as "Avatar" and "Titanic" are way out in front with $2.78 billion and $2.19 billion, respectively.

1. "Snow White and the Huntsman" -- $56.3 mil

2. "Men in Black 3" -- $29.3 mil

4. "Battleship" -- $4.8 mil

5. "The Dictator" -- $4.7 mil
