(CNN) -- American Airlines has come up with a new explanation for The Mystery of The Falling Down Seats in some of its Boeing 757 airliners.

11 witty and sage airline 'gunk' retorts

Apparently, worn locking pins can get stuck when food and beverages spill onto them, allowing seat rows to come unhinged, she said.

While the clamps may have played a role, the soda and snack gunk now seems to be among the culprits, Fagan said.

And while that explains what happened to the three American flights that experienced loose seats, it doesn't explain why the problem has affected only American flights in recent days, or why it's happened so many times in such a short period.

"My question is, why haven't we seen this before?" said Bill Waldock, professor and crash lab director at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's Prescott, Arizona, campus. "Did the gunk start building up and decide to falter in the planes at the same time? I kind of doubt that honestly."

Waldock called the airline's explanation "curious," adding that it "seemed to be unique to the 757, and to the ones that they reconfigured."

Besides presumably cleaning out the gunk, Fagan says American mechanics are "taking extra steps to ensure that the seats do not dislodge from the track."

That includes installing industrial-strength metal ties as a backup, airline spokeswoman Courtney Wallace said.

Later Friday afternoon, airline spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said that the company plans to have "all 48 of our Boeing 757s back in service" by Saturday, noting that 42 of its airplanes had already been repaired and that there were will be no disruptions to service.

"We have identified the issue, and our maintenance teams are securing an FAA-approved locking mechanism to ensure no seat can be dislodged," she said.

On Saturday, three seats came loose shortly after takeoff on a flight from Boston to Miami that was carrying 175 passengers. That plane diverted to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.

After incidents with airline seats, readers let loose

Another incident occurred Monday on a flight from New York to Miami with 154 passengers. It returned to JFK without further incident.

The National Transportation Safety Board -- which investigates U.S. civilian aircraft accidents -- does not track loose-seat incidents, spokesman Peter Knudson said.

When asked about gunked seat-track fittings, a Delta spokesman said, "We are not seeing what our competitor has described on the same scale by any means."

"Must have been 'Alien' blood to dissolve metal," posted one user, referring to the film with the space monster with acid blood. Suggestions on the site are rampant that American's maintenance contractors bore responsibility for the problems.

American, however, has said maintenance work was not to blame for the problems. Vice President David Campbell also dismissed the possibility that the problems could be linked to an ongoing labor dispute.

Last month, a judge threw out American's contract with its pilots union. Since then, pilots have staged what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket.

Airline management has blamed the situation on pilots filing what it says are frivolous reports about aircraft problems. The pilots union has denied management's assertion.

"I really have a difficult time believing that it's actually sabotage," Campbell said.
