"This is a very special place and so much is already being achieved," she said of the hospice, one of nearly two dozen palliative care community providers in the country.

"Providing children and their families with a place of support, care and enhancement at a time of great need is simply life changing," she said.

In March, she delivered her first official speech while opening a children's hospice center in Ipswich, England.

To cap the couple's first day in the country, they attended a dinner hosted by Malaysia's king, with the queen and Sultan of Kedah, at the royal residence, the Istana Negara, with about 400 guests, according to St. James's Palace in the UK.

On Friday morning, they were scheduled to meet the public at a free event at KLCC Park in the city center.
