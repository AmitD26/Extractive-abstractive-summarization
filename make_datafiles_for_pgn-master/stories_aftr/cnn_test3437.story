Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Clashes broke out in Bahrain on Friday as authorities tried to prevent thousands of opposition supporters converging on a mosque to hear a sermon from the kingdom's most prominent Shia cleric, Sheikh Isa Qassim.

The unrest followed a series of bombings in the capital, Manama, earlier this week, and the government's decision to strip some 31 opposition activists of their citizenship.

Sixteen-year-old Ali Abbas Radhi had been detained by police, according to witnesses and his family, and then escaped. They said he was hit by the car as he was pursued.

The Ministry of Interior said Radhi was killed as he tried to cross the road, but made no reference to his being arrested.

A large number of police had sealed off access to the mosque in the village of Diraz. Witnesses say many worshippers abandoned their cars and tried to reach the mosque on foot. Police fired tear gas to prevent people from reaching Diraz, according to witnesses.

The Ministry of Interior in a statement said the roads had been closed to prevent "vandals from outside the area" from gathering, after receiving information that protests were planned.

Attempts at political dialogue between the government and opposition parties have made little progress, and there's been an uptick in violence in recent weeks.

Condemning the bombings, the U.S. State Department said this week that violence had "claimed the lives of protesters, of security forces, of innocent bystanders."

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the violence "undercuts the process of national reconciliation that we have strongly been urging on Bahrainis of all stripes." On Friday Nuland welcomed a declaration of non-violence by six opposition parties.

But Ayham Kamel, an analyst with the Eurasia Group, said that "Shia hardliners that condone the use of violence, such as Haq and the 14 February movement, are likely to use the wave of attacks to reinforce their rising popularity."
