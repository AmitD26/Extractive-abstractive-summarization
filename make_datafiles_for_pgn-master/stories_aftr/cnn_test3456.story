The attacks at the height of the evening rush hour killed 18 people and injured 131, Minister P. Chidambaram said. Earlier, authorities had placed the death toll at 21. Chidambaram did not explain the reason for the discrepancy.

"All groups hostile to India are under radar," he said. "We are not ruling out anything. We're not ruling in anything. We're looking at everyone and we will find out who is behind these attacks."

"Whoever perpetrated these attacks has worked in a very, very clandestine manner," Chidambaram said. "It's not a failure of intelligence."

Some security experts, however, disagreed.

"I believe behind every successful attack, there's always intelligence failure and failure of physical security," said B. Raman, who formerly worked for India's external secret service.

Unlike other countries in the West that suffered terror raids, India has not strengthened its systems to prevent recurrence of such incidents, Raman said.

Mumbai residents were quick to blame New Delhi.

"The government has failed," said Vinay Dhadda, a Mumabi diamond merchant.

The three blasts Wednesday evening occurred within minutes of each other in the areas of Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar and Dadar, all busy commercial hubs teeming with people. Forensic evidence collected from the scenes suggested that the attackers used ammonium nitrate with a timing device for the detonations, Chidambaram said.

"We're neighbors," he said. "Living in the most troubled neighborhood, every part of India is vulnerable."

Chidambaram said the attack was aimed squarely at India.

"When an incident like this happens, let me assure you it is not targeted to any foreigners. The target is India's unity, integrity and prosperity," he said. "There are elements hostile to India and do not wish India to grow and prosper."

The area in Dadar is near a train station used by millions of commuters. On July 11, 2006, a series of seven explosions killed at least 174 people on crowded Mumbai commuter trains and stations.

"The sound was absolutely deafening," said Hemant Mehta who was in the Opera House area, near a diamond market that serves as a small epicenter of the city's economy. "People ran and panicked. Words are insufficient to describe (the scene)."

Thursday morning, as authorities tried to piece together the latest tragedy, daily life in Mumbai's unaffected areas resumed as usual -- millions of people rushing to schools, jobs, train stations. The city remained under a high security alert.
