(CNN) -- Pete (Paul Rudd), the floppy-haired hero of Judd Apatow's winningly nimble and close-to-the-bone family-mishegoss comedy "This Is 40," is a married father of two in L.A. who escapes the frazzled swirl of his existence by engaging in deep, dark secret activities.

He eats chocolate cupcakes — many, many more of them than his wife, Debbie (Leslie Mann), a major nutritional scold, would suspect. And when he's feeling beyond overwhelmed, he heads for the bathroom with his tablet to access ... his favorite porn site? No, to play Internet Scrabble. It's a sign of what his life has become that this is his notion of a grand escape, an oasis of me-time.

That said, a lot of the best gags in "This Is 40" are the ones that percolate between the lines. The comedy is there in how Pete leaps like a puppy to do his wife's bidding, without realizing that he's already in the doghouse for not having taken the initiative himself; or in the way that Apatow never once stages a marital-therapy session — but has Pete and Debbie lapse into the euphemisms of therapy-speak, even as it still sounds like they want to kill each other.
