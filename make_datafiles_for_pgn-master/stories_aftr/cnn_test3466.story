(CNN) -- An elderly man and his granddaughter died after a bolt of lightning started a fire in a house in Louisville, Kentucky, on Thursday evening, officials said.

The 911 call from the people inside the house came in around 6:45 p.m., said Vince Luney, communications supervisor for EMA Metrosafe, a public safety agency. Amid a flurry of other emergency calls, firefighters were dispatched to the scene and arrived within minutes.

It took "about 10 or 15 minutes to actually locate them because of the severity of the fire," he said. "We had to knock some of the fire down to get firefighters in there to effect the rescue. The fire had a pretty good head start on us."

"Those boys were brave -- the flames were going, they were running straight to it, back up a bit, and run again," Billy Ray Garrett, a resident of the neighborhood told CNN affiliate WAVE. "If anybody died in that house, it ain't because of anything they could do, they were trying, they were fighting."

The elderly man died of his injuries at the scene, according to Frederick, and the woman was declared dead at a Louisville hospital. Several family members were present at the time and were notified, he said.

"Lightning struck an 80-foot-tall tree, hit about 40 feet up, and it entered a phone wire that came in through the rear of the house," Frederick said. Melted wire suggested the phone line had carried the lightning's charge into the basement of the house, he added.

"It was like having a blow torch coming out the side of the house," Garrett said. "It was running all the way up the side of the other house, it was all coming through the bottom window, like a massive torch."

The house is still standing, according to Frederick.

"It's got pretty severe damage to the basement and the first floor," he said. "It's an older, probably 1940s-era house, so the fire traveled (through) sealed spaces and moved into other areas of the house."

"We probably made somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 other runs" to deal with problems caused by the storm, Frederick said. A multitude of those requests came within 20 to 30 minutes, he added.

In nearby Oldham County, a man on a boat on the Ohio River was struck by lightning, said Don Dahl, the North Oldham deputy assistant fire chief.

The man appeared to have taken a direct hit from lightning and was "hurting pretty bad," according to Dahl.
