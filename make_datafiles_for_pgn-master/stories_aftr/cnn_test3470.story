It didn't work. So the company had to yank the app.

On Wednesday the Mountain View, California, company said it had "fixed the bug and notifications are now working, and the app is back in the App Store."

The company added:

"In the short time the app was public we received a lot of helpful feedback and feature requests."

"The iOS app we launched today contained a bug with notifications," the company wrote on Twitter. "We have pulled the app to fix the problem. Sorry we messed up."

The whole ordeal led at least one tech writer to lose his faith in the company's innovative potential.

"They release something, and I no longer have any faith that it's going to be any good," MG Siegler wrote on his personal Tumblr blog. "It's hard to get excited about a company like that. It's the same reason why it's hard to get excited when Microsoft and Yahoo release new things. The track record just isn't there any more. The faith is gone."

"I really like it, the UI is great - don't know what all these people are complaining about," one person wrote on the app's page in iTunes Preview.

Overall, the app had a three-of-five-star rating on that page.
