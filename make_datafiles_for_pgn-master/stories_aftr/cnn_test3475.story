Houses are left in ruins earlier this week after truck bombings in the northern Iraqi village of al-Khazna.

Later Thursday, two people were killed and 13 were wounded in a motorcycle bombing in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood of southern Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said.

The Yazidi sect is a mainly Kurdish minority, an ancient group that worships seven angels, in the form of peacocks, who its followers believe are subordinate to the supreme god who created the universe.

Thursday's attack is at least the second this week apparently targeting ethnic minorities in northern Iraq.

The bombs targeted al-Khazna village, which is inhabited by a Shiite Shabak ethnic group. The village is an area disputed between Kurds and Arabs.

CNN's Yousif Bassil in Baghdad contributed to this report.
