Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes "amicably settled" their divorce just two weeks after Holmes filed for it, an attorney told CNN Monday.

While no details of their agreement are public, the former couple said they are "working together" in the "best interests" of their young daughter.

"We are thrilled for Katie and her family and are excited to watch as she embarks on the next chapter of her life," said Holmes' attorney Jonathan Wolfe.

Wolfe thanked Cruise's lawyers "for their professionalism and diligence that helped bring about this speedy resolution."

That statement, prepared jointly by Cruise, 50, and Holmes, 33, was sent to CNN by Cruise publicist Amanda Lundberg.

"We are committed to working together as parents to accomplishing what is in our daughter Suri's best interests," the statement said. "We want to keep matters affecting our family private and express our respect for each other's commitment to each of our respective beliefs and support each other's roles as parents."

Her lawyers and publicist sent a second statement later Monday responding to what they called "various reports regarding the purported terms of the settlement agreement."

"There are numerous inaccuracies in the reports regarding the purported contents of the agreement reached between the parties," the Holmes statement said. "The agreement is confidential and its terms will not be disclosed."
