(CNN) -- Double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius will compete at the Olympic Games after he was named in both the individual 400m and the South Africa 4x400m relay squad for London 2012.

But the South African selectors relaxed their qualification rules Wednesday and named him in both events, much to his delight.

"Today is truly one of the proudest days of my life. To have been selected to represent Team South Africa at the London 2012 Olympic Games in the individual 400m and the 4x400m relay is a real honor and I am so pleased that years of hard work, determination and sacrifice have all come together," he told his official website.

"I have a phenomenal team behind me who have helped get me here and will now put everything we can into the final few weeks of preparations before the Olympic Games where I am aiming to race well, post good times and maybe even a personal best time on the biggest stage of them all."

The Johannesburg-born athlete is joined in the South Africa track and field team by Caster Semanya.

In other selection news, Team Great Britain have announced cyclist David Millar will be part of its road race team.

But earlier this year, the British Olympic Association was forced by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to overturn its policy of not selecting athletes who have been found guilty of doping.

CAS's verdict opened the door for 100m sprinter Dwain Chambers to compete at his home Games.
