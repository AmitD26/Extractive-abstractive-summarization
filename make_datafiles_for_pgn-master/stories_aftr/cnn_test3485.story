San Diego, California (CNN) -- For me, the issue of skyrocketing gasoline prices came into focus about four years ago, when the national average that Americans paid at the pump reached an all-time high of $4.11 a gallon. Today, the average -- up 30 cents in the last four weeks, and 13 cents in the last week alone -- is about $3.70.

With the average price here expected to reach as much as $5 a gallon by Memorial Day, it's not surprising to see more commuters jammed onto trains and hear that more of your friends are trying to work from home a few days a week.

Although my friends on the East Coast like to think they have it easier with more options for public transportation, it's a mistake for people to assume that higher gas prices don't affect them. It's not about geography. We're all in this together. Have you noticed the price of groceries lately, as those companies that operate delivery trucks have to spend more to stack food on supermarket shelves? So you don't own a car. Maybe you take the subway to work. Swell. But if you have a mouth, and occasionally like to fill it with food, high gas prices should be hard to swallow.

Newt Gingrich is promising lower prices. He also pledges that, if elected president, he won't bow before a Saudi king.

It also wouldn't hurt to pay more attention to oil reserves in this hemisphere. Mexico is a major producer, and a friend and ally. The relationship between the United States and Mexico isn't perfect; tensions recur over immigration, drugs and trade. Each country has an annoying habit of blaming the other for its problems. 

But it's a strong marriage that will endure. Instead of chanting "Drill, baby, drill," more of our leaders should be saying: "Hola amigo." The U.S. government should increase oil imports from Mexico. Not only is it better to deal with friends than adversaries, it's also a good way to help the Mexican government fund its war against the drug cartels -- a battle that is, let's not forget, fueled by another one of our addictions.

Mexico's national oil company has allowed some private contracts and says its mature fields, which produce just 12,000 barrels of oil per day, could produce up to 220 million barrels of oil. We can have that conversation. And let's face it, the United States would rather work through that issue than work with countries that are hostile to Americans.

Look at the polls, and you'll see that one of the major reasons everyday Americans think we need to become more energy self-sufficient and develop a better strategy for importing oil is that they're leery of becoming too dependent on countries in the Middle East that are often unwelcoming, undemocratic and unstable. After all, no matter how much we love our cars and need our gasoline, few things are scarier than breaking down in a bad neighborhood.

Even if you take the bus, he says, high gas prices affect the cost of food, other goods

He thinks a good move would be negotiating to buy more oil from Mexico, a friend and ally
