LaBeouf, a former child actor, had his first mug shot taken in 2007 when he was 21 and refused to leave a drugstore after a security guard said he was intoxicated. The next year LaBeouf was arrested at the scene of a car accident on suspicion of DUI.

Earlier this year he appeared at the Berlin Film Festival with a paper bag over his head that proclaimed in black marker, "I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE," a phrase he also tweeted daily for weeks.

LaBeouf's court appearance on the latest charges is scheduled for July 24.

He co-stars with Brad Pitt in the upcoming movie "Fury," according to LaBeouf's profile on the Internet Movie Database.

Last year, LaBeouf, who has also written screenplays, was accused of plagiarizing another writer's work.
