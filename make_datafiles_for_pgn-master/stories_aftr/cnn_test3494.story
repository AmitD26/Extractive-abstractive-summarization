Rome (CNN) -- The parents of Amanda Knox, an American convicted of murdering her British roommate in 2007, were indicted Tuesday for allegedly libeling police in Perugia, Italy, Knox's mother and the family's Italian attorney said.

In a 2009 interview in the Sunday Times of London, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas said that their daughter "had not been given an interpreter, had not received food and water and had been physically and verbally abused" by police after her arrest for the murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher, according to Italy's ANSA news agency.

"We are very upset by this decision," said Luciano Ghirga, Amanda Knox's attorney who represents her family in this case. "We worked towards a dismissal because there was no intent" on the part of Knox's parents to libel the police, he said.

The indictment says their claims were "contrary to the truth," according to ANSA.

A hearing in the case is set for July 4, Ghirga said.

Knox's parents' focus is not on their case, he said, but on her appeal of her conviction, which is under way. There is a break in the proceedings for experts to retest forensic evidence, he said.

"This is, I guess you'd call it, a bit of a minor distraction," Marriott said.

Sollecito is serving a 25-year sentence. A third person, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, was tried separately and is serving a 16-year prison sentence.

The forensic experts retesting evidence as part of Knox's appeal must conclude their analysis by May 9 and their results are to be presented on May 21 to a jury composed of two judges and six citizens.

The sample, however, was so small that forensic scientists investigating Kercher's murder were not able to double test it in accordance with international forensic science norms, which Knox's legal team says raises doubts about its validity.

The court is not expected to make a final ruling on the appeal until next summer.

CNN's Hada Messia, Ashley Hayes, Todd Schwarzschild and journalist Barbie Nadeau contributed to this report.
