(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made a previously unannounced visit to Afghanistan on Monday to repair strained relations with President Hamid Karzai as the American-led international force continues to prepare to end its combat mission next year.

Kerry's stop came on the same day that U.S. forces turned over control of a prison that has caused tension between the two nations, with Americans retaining a say on the handling of certain Taliban inmates.

The talks on Monday followed controversial comments by Karzai in recent weeks that seemed to accuse U.S. forces of working with the Taliban to kill Afghan civilians, a charge denied by U.S. officials.

At a joint news conference after meeting Kerry, Karzai said he had been misinterpreted when quoted as alleging collusion between the Americans and the Taliban.

But he made clear that violence against villagers must stop for there to be any chance for successful peace talks.

"If they want the international community to leave Afghanistan, then the best way is for them to stop killing people," Karzai said of the Taliban. "That does not mean a collusion between the Untied States and Taliban. That's a conclusion the press came up with."

He made sure to emphasize his appreciation for U.S. support, twice declaring the thanks of the Afghan people for American assistance that he said would "enable Afghanistan to manage itself through 2014 and beyond."

For his part, Kerry emphasized the commitment of President Barack Obama to Afghanistan and its people would continue past the halt in combat operations by the NATO forces before the end of next year.

The United States and Afghanistan are negotiating an agreement that would allow some U.S. forces to remain in Afghanistan beyond the end of the NATO mission, but unresolved issues include how many and there specific role.

Kerry said Obama "was committed to not allow America's investment and the sacrifice here to be reversed," adding that "the United States will still be playing a role and will be here through the course of this future period."

He added that Afghanistan would "join a long and distinguished list of countries that will be struggling in a post-conflict environment where it will have an insurgency in some parts of that country for an extended period of time."

Kerry landed in Kabul on Monday afternoon and met with Karzai at the presidential palace before the news conference that lasted almost an hour. The two were to talk further over dinner and perhaps again on Tuesday morning, Kerry said.

Karzai called the development a major boost for the transition, while Kerry emphasized several times that the agreement respected Afghanistan's sovereignty to operate the prison that holds Taliban figures.

In a sign of the sensitivity of the issue, Karzai twice described the final step of the process as consultations, then changed his wording to "an exchange of views." He said that "I must use my words carefully."

The matter touches on a politically charged situation for Karzai, who is criticized by the Taliban and other foes for the continuing presence of the NATO forces in the country.

The handover deal was reached Saturday, but came a full year after the initial plan was announced by U.S and Afghan authorities.

During the news conference, Kerry repeatedly referred to Afghanistan's sovereignty in the transition process as the NATO military force turns over leadership of combat operations to Afghanistan's military, which it has trained in recent years.

The trip was Kerry's first visit to Afghanistan as secretary of state, but the former senator's sixth during Obama's presidency.
