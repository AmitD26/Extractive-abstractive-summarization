(EW.com) -- The eternal wait for a return journey to Pandora continues. But "Avatar" fans, just know that James Cameron is hard at work on the script that will follow up his 2009 sci-fi mega-blockbuster.

Cameron, the writer-director-producer of reigning box office champion "Avatar," recently talked with the website Play Goes Strong, revealing that he's currently in New Zealand working on writing "Avatar 2" and "Avatar 3." "I'm writing on a little farm. When you live in a special world like Pandora, you have to live in that world," he said.

Cameron also recalled a recent conversation with "The Hobbit" and "Lord of the Rings" director Peter Jackson. "You had it easy dude," Cameron told him. "You had the books when you did the second and third Lord of the Rings. I have to create my own books in my head and extract a script from it."

"Pressure? No. It's a little daunting because sequels are always tricky. You have to be surprising and stay ahead of audience anticipation. At the same time, you have to massage their feet with things that they know and love about the first film. I've walked that line in the past, so I'm not too worried about it. At the same time, I definitely have to deliver the goods."

But how long is all this isolation on this ranch going to take? No update on that or how long Cameron expects production on the sequels to take.
