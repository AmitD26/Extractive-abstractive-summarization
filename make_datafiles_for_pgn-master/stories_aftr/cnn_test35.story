Las Vegas (CNN) -- To break out beyond the personal computer market in the U.S., Lenovo Group will need a little help from its friends.

Lenovo has operated as a lone wolf in China, where the company is based, by building hardware that runs its uniquely designed software. At the International Consumer Electronics show this week, Lenovo launched a cloud service in China, similar to Apple's iCloud, that will keep all of its devices in sync.

The company will take a different approach, however, when it expands in the U.S., Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing said in an interview here.

"We cannot do everything by ourselves," Yuanqing said. The U.S. market is "more challenging than in China because we have to rely on somebody else's ecosystem. So we have to find the right partner here."

Lenovo expects to continue using Microsoft's Windows on its computers, and Google's Android on its tablets and smartphones, Yuanqing said. Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft may try to court the Chinese electronics giant to help with its U.S. mobile efforts, however.

In the U.S., Lenovo is barely a top-five PC manufacturer, but it's a solid No. 2 globally. Its trio of tablets, which are all based on Android, haven't sold particularly well in the United States.

Lenovo Group has grown significantly in the U.S. in the last few years thanks to its aggressive pricing and the 2005 acquisition of International Business Machines' PC division, which has catapulted Lenovo's sales to corporations.

U.S. retailers have suggested that Lenovo should price its computers $50 below competitors' comparable systems, advice the company has heeded because it hasn't achieved a strong brand in America, Yuanqing said. Pinching pennies delays the U.S. expansion because Lenovo can't accumulate enough profit to fund development in other areas like smartphones or TVs, he said.
