After a 12-hour interview Thursday, police officials claimed Kundra has admitted to betting and said they have confiscated his passport while the investigation continues.

However, Kumar said Kundra cannot be arrested as police don't yet have "prosecutable evidence against him."

Police have also learned about the possible involvement of Shetty, but have yet to decide if she will be questioned. The couple has an 11.7% stake in the Royals worth a reported $15 million.

"Mr. Raj Kundra is a minority shareholder, and he has no involvement in the running of the franchise," they said.

"We believe that Mr. Raj Kundra is a law-abiding citizen and would not act contrary to law. If however, he is proven guilty, or has breached any regulations, he will be suspended, and he will also forfeit his shares."

Kundra also released a statement, insisting: "I have done no wrong for which I need to have any regrets."

"However as the case develops, in due process, it may become necessary for the police to question me further.

"I have not committed any wrong and am myself extremely anxious to know the whole truth. If an iota of wrongdoing is finally established against me I would unhesitatingly forfeit my share in the franchise."

Meanwhile, a Mumbai court Friday adjourned the bail plea of Indian cricketer Shanthakumaran Sreesanth until Monday.

He had approached the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) Court after a Delhi court rejected his bail plea and extended his judicial custody until June 18.

Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila were the first cricketers to be arrested in the IPL spot-fixing case. All three have played for Rajasthan Royals.

Another controversy has clouded Indian cricket, with national team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni being accused of having a conflict of interest for having stakes in the sports management company, Rhiti Sports.

It also handles accounts for his fellow India internationals Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja and Pragyan Ojha. The firm has denied that Dhoni has stakes in the company.

When quizzed about the BCCI's take on Dhoni's alleged conflict of interest issues, Dalmiya said: "We will not cover up Dhoni's links with Rhiti Sports, if any. But at this point when the team is busy with Champions Trophy (in England). We will not achieve anything by disturbing the atmosphere."
