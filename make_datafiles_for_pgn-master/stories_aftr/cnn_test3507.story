(CNN) -- To the rest of the world, Sweden seems to represent all that is enviably European. Scandinavia's largest country has a reputation for being stylish, progressive and glacially cool -- in short, everything the Eurovision Song Contest is not.

Unlike in many other western European countries, the privilege of representing Sweden at the annual contest is hotly contested, through a grueling series of televised heats which have grown to become more popular than Eurovision itself.

Melodifestivalen, a six-week, "American Idol"-style TV series in which established acts compete against unknowns for the honor of representing Sweden, has broken every local ratings record. Nearly half of the country's 9.4 million people tuned in to this year's final.

"No other TV show gets the Swedes so rallied up. People put on dinner parties just so they can watch it together. They even get dressed up for the occasion."

Forgettable song, memorable outfit: The crazy clothes of Eurovision

The show has proven an invigorating force for the Swedish music industry, reviving old pop careers, launching new ones and selling thousands of records and concert tickets in the process.

"Not only are all the most popular TV shows in Sweden music-related, but choral singing is the second most popular pastime after sports. It's only natural for us to get worked up about a music competition."

The Swedish entry this year, "Euphoria" by Loreen, was the bookies' favorite to follow in their footsteps and duly delivered success at the 57th Eurovision, in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Even as an adult, Eurovision remains a big occasion. "I watch it with my friends and there's always someone who will organize a house party where we'll cook strange dishes from all the different countries and bet money on what song will win. People usually take the betting really seriously but we add silly categories like the worst outfit or the worst song."

"Melodifestivalen"'s timing -- screening on Saturday nights for six weeks in the middle of the country's famously gloomy winters -- is seen as another reason for its enduring appeal.

"It's almost as if 'Melodifestivalen' is the vessel that carries Sweden from the dark of winter to the light of summer, and soundtracks that journey with some awfully catchy music too."

"Melodifestivalen" is nearly as old as Eurovision itself, having run almost every year since 1959. But it wasn't always such a polished affair.

"In the 1990s the competition was struggling. There weren't enough good artists wanting to take part so it was decided that something radical needed to happen," said Christer Bjorkman, a former hairdresser who won "Melodifestivalen" in 1992.

So in 2002, he oversaw the transformation of the contest from one-off contest between ten songs into a six-week pop marathon featuring 32. The ultimate winner is decided by a combination of public vote and a jury that consists of Swedish industry experts, and Eurovision judges from 11 other countries.

The new format, featuring knock-out semi-finals held in cities across Sweden, was a smash hit, and Bjorkman has been involved in the production of every contest since. Today he is known as "Mr Melodifestivalen."

"Taking the show on the road was incredibly important to its success as it galvanized local support," he said. "Equally as important was the fact that the audience now have weeks to familiarize themselves with all the songs. They form emotional attachments to the songs and, ultimately, also the winner -- which is one of the reasons why so many Swedes still care about how we do in Eurovision."

The resulting surge of interest in "Melodifestivalen" sees thousands of songs submitted to the contest each year, and has been a boon to the Swedish music industry. "It's a goldmine for artists and songwriters that do well in the competition, as they go on to sell thousands of records and sell out tours across Scandinavia," said Blankens.

Bjorkman agrees. "The competition is enormously important for the Swedish music industry because not only does it launch new careers and revives old ones, it sells a lot of albums too," he said. "From winter until spring, our songs occupy the charts. The final was in March, but four of our songs are still in the top ten."

'Why not try?'

"Big countries who take themselves quite seriously -- like Britain and France -- don't really want to compete against all these tiny nations on the European periphery in some silly music competition," said Blankens. "They think it's beneath them, so they keep sending bad songs that never win."

"Ultimately you get what you give," said Bjorkman. "In countries like the UK they don't give much -- in fact they keep changing the format of the national try-outs each year. It's no wonder the public has lost interest in ... Eurovision."
