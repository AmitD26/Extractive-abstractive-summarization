A businessman from Hong Kong commissioned craftsman Stuart Hughes of Liverpool to help him show off his family treasure.

According to Hughes' website, this iPhone includes 600 flawless white diamonds, a full solid gold dressing and 53 diamonds on the rear that make up the iconic Apple logo.

However, the reason this particular iPhone is so valuable is on the face of the phone.

"It's not often that people get to deal with a very, very rare diamond," Hughes said.

Hughes said he was contacted 18 months ago by Joe, who expressed interest in his gold chassis iPhone handsets.

Hughes told CNN that one of the solid gold handsets with the diamonds that he crafts is worth approximately $153,000.

"We had a tech guy in Macau who was able to set the stone, which to this day has never left China," Hughes said.

Hughes set a record in 2011 for crafting an iPhone 4S with 500 individual diamonds, totaling more than 100 carats. That phone was estimated to be valued at $9 million.

Throughout the years and his many projects, Hughes said this particular handset is right up near the top of the most lavish projects he's completed.
