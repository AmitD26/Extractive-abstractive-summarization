"A lot of people think that I am a crazy guy," says the Somali chef, his wiry figure looming over roasting pans full of vegetables and meat inside his downtown Mogadishu eatery.

"When I opened this restaurant they could not believe it," he remembers. "When I came here and bought the land some people told me, 'you are not coming back, come back when you're ready' -- I said, 'I am going to build it soon.'"

And he did. A risk taker, in 2008 Jama chose to open his first Somalia-based restaurant in Kilometer Four, a dangerous area in Mogadishu where battles would often rage between various factions fighting for control of the city.

"That is the only reason I opened it," says Jama, who grew up in Mogadishu before heading to the UK to study culinary arts. "If I do, people are going to see; they are going to say, 'he has done it, why are we not doing it?'"

"The only reason why I came here is to change the lives of the people who don't have somewhere to work and people who have been locked indoors and they don't have anywhere to go and socialize," says Jama. "Basically, what I am looking for is to show them, 'yes, you can laugh when you finish work, university, office work, wherever you are, you have somewhere to go.'"

Part of this rising business activity is Jama's chain of restaurants, all called "The Village," that dot the city. The chef and restaurant owner is just one of a growing number of Somalis who, after years abroad, are now returning to be part of their country's economic renaissance.

"To show them this is time for peace and for living."

From his eatery in the heart of Mogadishu to his seafront restaurant in Jazeera beach, Jama's establishments are known as the go-to places in a city that was mostly off limits until recently. Now people gather here to meet friends, eat freshly made Somali food, sip cappuccino and even smoke a pipe of flavored tobacco, albeit discreetly.

"Here it is a beautiful place to come over the weekends," says local client Ali Ahmed. "It's beautiful to come out and sit and eat food at the restaurant."

"People get into my restaurant feeling like they are going out; they have somewhere to sit and have a nice ice cream, have a nice coffee, lobsters too -- there is all of that that makes people come to my restaurant. But politicians and Al-Shabaab they don't like each other -- that's what makes them target my restaurant," says Jama.

"I know why I have done it and I want the people to feel that this is what we need to (make things) change," says Jama.

"My dream is to have tourism and travel holidays, a mixture of people -- white, black, everyone -- coming on holiday (to Mogadishu). That's my dream."
