Since a ban on the method of extracting natural gas was lifted in May, a company has begun exploratory drilling in the southern town of Balcombe to see what reserves may lie locked up in rock strata far beneath its rolling hills and green meadows.

The energy company Cuadrilla Resources has not applied for permission to frack, but that has not stopped hundreds of furious protesters from trying to block its work.

They fear that if gas reserves are found, fracking will come in short order.

Activists Jo and Karen strummed out a folksy tune on their guitars, singing: "Frack attack. They'll frack you 'til you die."

"We are fighting fracking in the United States," Karen said. She has brought her ecological concerns with her, bemoaning that the United Kingdom may be going down the same path.

"It ruins the ground water regardless of what they say," Karen said.

"We've got people who can light their water in fire with the tap," Jo said. "They fracked Pennsylvania to death."

And as in the United States, proponents of fracking argue that the boost in energy supply is enormous and the methods are safe.

Cuadrilla believes there is about 200 trillion cubic feet of gas under the ground just within one of its local license areas. To put that figure into context, the United Kingdom uses about 3 trillion cubic feet of gas a year, chief executive officer Francis Egan said.

"We are able absolutely to protect the environment and protect the way in which fracking is done," said Britain's energy minister Michael Fallon. "If there is any risk it will be stopped immediately."

Conservatives at risk

Much of the gas exploration is taking place in rural regions that usually support the conservative party, which is in favor of drilling.
