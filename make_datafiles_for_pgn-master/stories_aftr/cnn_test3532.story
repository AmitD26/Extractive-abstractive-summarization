1. THE ROLE: James Bond in "Dr. No"

WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Cary Grant

Of course, many studio executives objected to the decision, and even Bond creator Ian Fleming said Connery "wasn't exactly what I had in mind."

REGRETTABILITY METER: Low

By the 1960s, Cary Grant already had a spectacular film career. If he'd accepted the role (as Broccoli later revealed), it would've been just a one-movie deal. Mental Floss: Name that 007 tune

2. THE ROLE: Neo in "The Matrix"

WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Will Smith turned it down to star in the forgettable action flick "Wild Wild West," and the part went to Reeves.

REGRETTABILITY METER: Low

In an interview with Wired, Smith said, "I would have absolutely messed up 'The Matrix.' At that point I wasn't smart enough as an actor to let the movie be -- whereas Keanu was."

WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Michael Madsen, who was stuck in lengthy rehearsals for "Wyatt Earp." John Travolta got the role instead and, almost overnight, transformed from a Hollywood has-been into one of the most bankable stars in the business.

REGRETTABILITY METER: High

Madsen called "Wyatt Earp" a "big waste of time."

REGRETTABILITY METER: High

In return for playing the role, New Line Cinema offered the Scottish actor up to 15 percent of worldwide box office receipts, which would have earned Connery more than any actor had ever been paid for a single role -- as much as $400 million.

5. THE ROLES: Sundance in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle in "The French Connection," and Captain Benjamin Willard in "Apocalypse Now"

REGRETTABILITY METER: Tragically high

McQueen turned down the role of Sundance simply because costar Paul Newman refused to give him top billing.

Later, McQueen declined the lead in "The French Connection" because he felt the part was too similar to the tough cop he'd played in 1968's "Bullitt." Gene Hackman took the part and won an Oscar for it.

And finally, in 1978, McQueen told "Apocalypse Now" director Francis Ford Coppola to shove off when he was offered the lead. McQueen's non-negotiable asking price was $3 million; plus, he didn't feel like spending four months shooting in the Philippine jungle.
