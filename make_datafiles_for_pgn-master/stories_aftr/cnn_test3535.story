The show's main character, Ted Mosby, played by Josh Radnor and voiced in narration by Bob Saget, has spent eight seasons telling his kids the story of how he met their mom, endlessly dragging out the eventual interaction. Finally, creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas revealed the mother's identity; she is played by Cristin Milioti.

During a panel on the show, the creators unveiled a clip that explains why Ted's children have been sitting on a couch listening to him tell this never-ending saga.

"We thought we'd be done after eight seasons," Bays told CNN.com after the panel, "so season nine is a bonus year and it's the Wild West. Anything could happen. We're changing a lot of the rules about how we thought we'd tell the story."

Thomas added, "I don't think the story has changed, but how we tell it has changed now that we have 24 extra episodes to see more of it. Knowing what we have left to tell, this little story we've been meaning to tell for eight years now, it would have felt really abrupt to end it after eight seasons."

"How I Met Your Mother" has traditionally used multi-episode narrative arcs and flashbacks to keep the story moving, often jumping in time or extending a season over the course of a year. The final season, however, will take place entirely over one weekend in the fictional town of Farhampton.

Last season left the door open for the resolution of several storylines. Robin, preparing for her wedding to Barney, enlisted Ted's help finding a locket she'd buried in Central Park and found herself in a romantic moment with him. Lily and Marshall (and their infant son) were about to move to Italy for Lily's job when Marshall was offered a judgeship in New York but didn't know how to tell Lily.

The real draw for the last season is getting to watch the beginning of Ted's relationship with the mother unfold. Fryman confirmed fans will see Ted meet the character very quickly into the ninth season and said viewers are "going to get to know her." As the characters gather for the wedding, the on-again, off-again nature of Ted and Robin's relationship will also be addressed, something at which the season premiere's title, "The Locket," may hint.

As for the revelation of Milioti in the role of the mother last season, the creators said keeping that secret was the hardest thing they've done on the show.

"I compartmentalize things, and I'm not a fan of goodbyes so I haven't really contemplated it," Harris said. "I don't want to spend the time we have on the show lamenting its demise because we're not there yet. We're still in the beginning of the show. So even though it's run eight seasons, we still have 20-some odd weeks to do it, and I want to make sure we're enjoying it as opposed to being wistful about it."

Smulders, who also appears in the season premiere of the new ABC show "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D," said, "It hasn't started to sink in yet. But we have six more episodes after the holidays, and I feel like that's going to be a really intense time for everyone."

Smulders also shared a piece of trivia about the series that surprised even her co-stars.

"Robin was not a Canadian when I signed on for the show," Smulders said. "She became one because, according to Carter and Craig, we're exotic. Literally the words they used to me in season one: 'Well, I just feel like it's really exotic.' I never in my life have been called exotic."

"We introduced some stuff that is now commonplace in some ways," Radnor said. "I was actually talking with Carter and Craig last night about how there's this new fashion of dumping 12 episodes out. Like Netflix is now giving all these episodes, and they can do really serialized arcs. That's what Carter and Craig excel at. That's what they always wanted to do. Follow the locket or follow these different threads.

"I feel like in some ways we just did what we did really well, and the public mood caught up to us. When you're at the top of the mountain and you look back, you say, 'Wow, we got to do some incredibly strange, amazing moments of television.' "
