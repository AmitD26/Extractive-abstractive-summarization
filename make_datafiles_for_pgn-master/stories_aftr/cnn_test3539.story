Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's military-backed government signaled Wednesday that it plans to disperse supporters of deposed President Mohamed Morsy camped out at sit-ins in Cairo, raising fears it will trigger violent confrontations.

The statement is being widely interpreted by local media outlets as a green light for security forces to disperse the thousands of protesters at the sit-ins at squares in Rabaa al-Adawiya and Nahda Masr.

The announcement comes just days after more than 150 people died in clashes in Cairo and Alexandria, killings that were widely condemned by world leaders and the United Nations. Protesters accused police of opening fire and killing 72 people during a pro-Morsy demonstration in Nasr City, an area of Cairo where the Muslim Brotherhood has made its base.

Amnesty International called the announcement "a recipe for further bloodshed."

A doctor at the Muslim Brotherhood field hospital in Rabaa al-Adawiya said his entire family is at the sit-in and they're prepared for the worst. "We will never leave. All the families are coming here, and we will stay," said Hesham Ibrahim.

Several Egyptian human rights groups demanded in a statement released Tuesday the the interior minister resign over Saturday's killings and demanded that government forces refrain from further violence.

Muslim Brotherhood officials said on the group's website that they will continue protesting until Morsy is put back in office.

Also, prosecutors have extended the detention of top Muslim Brotherhood leaders for 15 days over charges of inciting to kill protesters in front of the Muslim Brotherhood office in the days before the July 3 military coup, state-run Nile TV said. They include Khairat el-Shater and Mohammed Rashad Bayoumi.

AU delegation visit

A high-level African Union delegation working to ease tensions in Egypt met with Morsy and the leaders who replaced his Muslim Brotherhood-backed administration after coup, the AU said Wednesday.

This comes amid international efforts to forge stability in a country seething with political tension and reeling from spurts of sporadic and deadly violence after Morsy was toppled on the heels of mass protests against his rule.

Opinion: Morsy holds key to Egypt's future

The three-person AU group is sitting down in Cairo with a range of people in the same week that Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, met with current leaders, Muslim Brotherhood members and Morsy -- now held at an undisclosed location on a variety of criminal charges.

"The establishment of the Panel and its current visit to Cairo are part of the AU's efforts to assist Egypt in addressing the challenges confronting the country and ensuring that the legitimate aspirations of its people are fulfilled," the AU said in a statement.

Opinion: How to rescue the Arab Spring

"In so doing, the AU is acting on the basis of its relevant instruments and in the spirit of African solidarity, as Egypt's challenges are also Africa's challenges. A stable, democratic and prosperous Egypt constitutes a tremendous asset for the AU, as it strives to achieve its stated objectives."

It also sat down with Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy, Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby and representatives of several political movements. It plans to meet with the pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church, a women's group and diplomats.

U.S. Senate acts

But the measure, which would have shut off $1.5 billion in aid to Cairo, got the backing of only 13 senators.

CNN's Schams Elwazer reported from Cairo. CNN's Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Lisa Desjardins, Yousuf Basil, Arwa Damon and journalist Sarah Sirgany contributed to this report.
