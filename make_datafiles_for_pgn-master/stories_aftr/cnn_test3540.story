(CNN) -- Nothing drives home the luxury lifestyles of the rich and famous quite like images of them lounging on a sun-drenched superyacht.

But even wealthy yacht owners -- who often use their magnificent boats for just a few weeks a year --are not averse to making some extra cash by renting them out.

And if you're willing to splash out, you could be cruising the waves in the very same vessels used by A-list pop stars, royalty, and world leaders.

From Beyonce to Grace Kelly, CNN takes a look at the most beautiful celebrity yachts available for hire.

When Beyonce performed at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009, the soulful songstress was left high and dry without a luxury vessel -- until she chartered 30-meter superyacht Asfar.

At $109,000 per week, the sleek boat features three elegant suites, with room for 11 guests. Four crew members -- including a chef, a captain and deck hands -- were also on board to cater to their elite guest's every whim.

The charming wooden yacht was given to Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco as a wedding present from shipping mogul Aristotle Onassis in the 1950s, with the royal couple spending their honeymoon sailing it along the stunning Italian coast.

When rapper tycoon P. Diddy goes on holiday, he doesn't do things by halves. The Grammy Award-winning musician relaxes on one of the most luxurious and high-tech superyachts in the world -- Solemates -- which even boasts an iPad-controller.

From the luxury of their top deck jacuzzi, guests can control practically everything but the captain's steering wheel -- all with a leisurely brush of their ipad.

The 60-meter yacht also features an aromatherapy shower, James Bond-style underwater hovercraft, and a gym which converts into a disco. The price is similarly spectacular -- around $685,000 per week during the height of summer.

The recently renovated 70-passenger yacht is now completing a charity fundraising tour around the U.S., but is still available for private hire, costing around $5,000 for four hours.
