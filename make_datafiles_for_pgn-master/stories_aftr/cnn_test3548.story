The folders contained information on what the actors could and couldn't say about the new episodes, which premieres October 13 on AMC. Although none of the actors could reveal the contents of the folders, it was clear that there are lots of secrets to be kept about where "The Walking Dead" will be headed when it returns.

Season 4 will air its 16 episodes in two parts, with the first eight kicking off October 13 and the subsequent episodes premiering in February. For the most part, the new season will bring fans right back into the action of last season.

"There is a little bit of a time jump, but we certainly pick up where we left off," Executive Producer and Special Effects Make-up Supervisor Greg Nicotero said. "The prison has changed a bit, and Rick has changed his position in the group. We don't really want to give it away just yet."

Nicotero said he and showrunner Scott Gimple made the decision that they wanted the threat to be "ever-constant and ever-present" in the new season.

Gimple, who has written for the series for three seasons and replaced Glen Mazzara as showrunner for Season 4, said he sees this season as a "greatest hits" of the show.

"The Walking Dead" is based on a comic book series by Robert Kirkman, and although it has stayed largely true to its source material in past seasons, Gimple confirmed that Season 4 will exist in its own frame.

"It's remixing different elements from the book in different contexts," Gimple said. "Taking the emotional thrusts of those elements and giving them a different rhythm. People will see stuff from the book, and they'll know exactly where it came from, but it will be in a very different context. It has to be.

The characters find themselves part of a new, larger community this season in the prison, and their roles have changed. Lincoln, whose character Rick Grimes has largely been the central point of the show, said there will be a shift in leadership as the story unfolds. This is particularly significant as Rick's wife, Lori, was one of last season's casualties, leaving Rick as the sole parent of their two children.

"He's a man that is wrestling with a modus operandi that didn't work last season," Lincoln said. "The brutality that's always going to be in him, he's trying to suppress for the sake of both of his children. He's trying to parent in an apocalypse, (and) he's trying to return to the man he once was for the sake of his children."

For Cohan and Yeun, this season gives their characters an opportunity to explore having a relationship in a (sort of) normal situation -- at least initially. Cohan said there will be "some semblance of a community and a life."

"There's some kids; I think we can say that. And there's some stability," she said. "There's hope beyond just them being in love now. As important as that was there's hope of 'Could this be OK? Are we starting again?' What happens next is anybody's business."

A key question is whether Michonne will succeed in her desire to exact revenge on the Governor for Andrea's death.

"Michonne as a character is very invested in what happened with Andrea and I think more than any other character is driven to find the Governor, figure out what's going on with him, figure out where he is, what he may be plotting and trying to do," Executive Producer Robert Kirkman said. "And bringing him to justice. That's something her character is dealing with very early on. I can't say anything more than that."

What the writers and actors could say is that creating "The Walking Dead" is a highly collaborative and enjoyable process. Although there is always the lingering fear that a beloved character will be killed off (the producers have said that no one is safe), the cast is deeply invested in making this the best show possible.

"We all respect the fact that we're only as good as each other," Morrissey said. "We've got to look after each other."
