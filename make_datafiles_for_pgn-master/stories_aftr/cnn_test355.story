In books, she is portrayed as battling with White House insiders. In magazines, she has been satirized as a militant activist. On TV, she responds to those who see her as an "angry black woman."

But still, she stays centered, focusing on her issues -- health and young children, military families and raising her family inside the White House bubble.

"The administration is doing everything they can to keep her out in the public eye and remind everyone why they liked this family in the first place," said Garrett Graff, editor of The Washingtonian magazine.

But that warm embrace isn't universal, and the first lady made note of it in a recent interview with CBS.

For Michelle Obama the first punch came shortly after then-Sen. Barack Obama decided to run for president. Beaming with pride, she told an audience that "for the first time in my adult lifetime I'm really proud of my country."

That comment drew fire from conservatives who questioned her patriotism. She was forced to clarify her remarks.

Then there was the portrayal of her on the cover of The New Yorker. A sketch showed her with a machine gun slung across her back, sporting an Afro and wearing combat boots like 1960s activist Angela Davis.

Opinion: Working together for the health of America's children

The first lady has carved out a public role for herself as a strong advocate for military families and promoter of a healthy lifestyle, especially for children.

The Washingtonian's Graff said the first lady plays a unique role in American society. "We don't expect them to have the gravitas of the president, and so you can have a little more fun, be in photo opportunities and do things the president can't do because of his office," he said.

As the president campaigns for a second term, the first lady is also able to do something else.

Her trips often take her to key battleground states, where her message re-enforces the president's policies and her presence at fundraisers raises campaign cash.

At another event, she pumped up the audience with a call and answer riff: "Do you have his back? Are you fired up? Are you ready to go?"

But Begala warned she shouldn't be overused or become "too political" because that could "diminish her value."

In her supporting role, she is trying to strike a balance as wife, mother and first lady while challenging a lingering negative image that she insists is off the mark.

"I just hope that over time, that people get to know me," she told CBS.
