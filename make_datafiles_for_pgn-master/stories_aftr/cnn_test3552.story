(CNN) -- Dozens of people have died in Pakistan and India's northern Rajasthan state amid flash floods and landslides caused by heavy monsoon rains, officials said Thursday.

Hundreds of homes have been damaged in the flooding, which has hit parts of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, he said.

Rescue workers are seeking to deal with a major landslide in the Kashmiri city of Muzaffarabad, according to the disaster agency.

Roads are blocked, some 390 houses have been damaged and an unknown number of people are dead and injured, the agency said. Some families trapped by the landslide have been given emergency food and water supplies.

Elsewhere in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, seven people were killed in Bagh by a flash flood and a landslide, while more than 100 houses were damaged in Koti, the disaster agency said.

Relief work is under way to help the hundreds of people made homeless by the flooding, which followed three or four days of heavy rain, the state department said.

He released a statement directing government agencies to monitor river levels and take action to prevent any from bursting their banks.

The prime minister also instructed authorities to check that the early warning system for people living near rivers is kept up to date, and urged disaster management agencies to ensure they are fully prepared to respond.
