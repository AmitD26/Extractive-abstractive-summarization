(CNN) -- I've been in Thomas Hurley III's shoes.

But what we forget is that a young man's honest mistake was broadcast to millions of people across the United States and Canada. No matter the age, realizing that your "blooper" will be seen by many can be very embarrassing.

Twelve years ago, it was me standing below the "hot lamps" of a TV studio, appearing on the Regis Philbin version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." It took dozens of phone tests over a two-year period to make my dream of being on a TV game show a reality, and it came crashing down in a matter of minutes.

Social media howls over 12-year-old's errant 't' on 'Jeopardy!'

I was defeated on a $500 question on collar stays -- those tiny strips used to keep a shirt collar flat. I always wore dress shirts with the collar buttoned down, so "collar stays" were foreign to me. Not wanting to burn my third and final lifeline, I guessed and came up short.

The episode finally aired, and I didn't bother watching it. The show broadcast around the time I headed to work, so I spent that period walking to the subway, knowing that when I got to the office, my co-workers would have watched the show.

But then something happened.

Thomas Hurley III will bounce back, just like I did, but it will take some time. This young man got to do something that so many Americans would love to do, myself included: be a contestant on "Jeopardy!"

And I know that Thomas' family, friends and social media supporters have to be thrilled that he got a chance to compete on national television. As a father, I think it's important for parents to keep telling a kid like Thomas that, win or lose, you're proud of his performance and excited that he took such a big chance. Don't play the blame game -- saying that Alex Trebek was "smug" and that "spelling rules are silly" won't solve anything. And most of all, tell him to take on the world with his head held high.

Thomas Hurley III may have finished second on that show, but he is a winner just by stepping up to the "Jeopardy!" podium and playing the game. It takes a lot of courage to do what he did, and for that I salute him.
