Far from her denials in interviews at the beginning of the year, when she told CNN that she had "absolutely no plans to run," Clinton now appears to be wrestling with a decision, saying in the New York Magazine interview that "I will just continue to weigh what the factors are that would influence me making a decision."

Thanks to her name recognition, the former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state is the overwhelming frontrunner in early 2016 surveys. In the most recent survey, conducted earlier this month by CNN/ORC International, nearly two-thirds of Democrats and independents who lean toward that party said they were likely to back Clinton as their presidential nominee. Vice President Joe Biden came in a distant second, at 10%, with freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 7%, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 6%, and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at 2%.

The CNN survey was in line with previous polls from other organizations conducted earlier this year that indicated Clinton was far ahead of all the other possible Democratic contenders.

Begala, who was a senior political adviser to President Bill Clinton, said Hillary Clinton's "time horizon and the whole rest of the party's time horizon are very, very different," adding that "anybody else has got to start to lay the groundwork" much earlier than Clinton."

"Hillary has more time than anyone else. And that's why her friends, and I'm one of them, are saying she can take her time. She doesn't need to build name identification. She doesn't even need to build a roster of donors."

Translation: Don't expect to see Clinton make a stop in Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina anytime soon, as some of the other potential 2016ers, such as O'Malley and even Biden, have already made.

Asked if there is a concern that if Clinton waits too long, some big name donors and influential Democratic politicians could stray to other 2016 candidates, Begala said such a scenario is "not a concern at all."

"She is the prohibitive favorite, but the dynamics of the race change the longer someone waits. So the question is how long can she wait," said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and a veteran of the Wesley Clark 2004 and John Edwards 2008 presidential campaigns.

"If she gets in early, she sucks up the oxygen, the money, and the grassroots. She could basically kill the field."

When it comes to polling, Clinton's standing now compares to her situation the first time she ran for president, when she was the Democratic favorite in the early years of the 2008 presidential cycle. She was the front-runner in CNN polling from mid-2005 through 2006, prior to her January 2007 announcement that she was forming an exploratory committee, which formally kicked off her presidential fundraising and campaigning.

By then, Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Biden, former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico had all jumped in.

"Secretary Clinton faces a paradoxical choice: If she announces that she's re-entering the political fray, scrutiny on her would be heightened exponentially. Yet even without an announcement, the press and her potential opponents are already treating her like she is running," said LaBolt, who served as a deputy press secretary for Obama's 2008 campaign and national press secretary for the 2012 re-election campaign.

"The solution might be to ensure trusted advisers are working from the outside to manage rapid response, cultivate donors and study her prospective competitors' records to lay the groundwork for a run for as long as possible without jumping two feet in."

"It's like when you meet somebody at a party and they look over your shoulder to see who else is there," Clinton said. "And you want to talk to them about something that's really important; in fact, maybe you came to the party to talk to that particular person, and they just want to know what's next. I feel like that's our political process right now. I just don't think it is good."
