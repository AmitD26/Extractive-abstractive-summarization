(CNN) -- Joe Saenz rubbed his hands together and smiled as he walked up to a Los Angeles County, California, home.

Once in the front yard of the home, police said, he drew a gun and shot the victim several times, then in the head, execution-style. The slaying, caught on tape in October 2008, was over drug money, police said.

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Detective Traci Gonzales knew there were drug and gang ties to the slaying, so she showed the videotape to Los Angeles Police Department Detective Ron Chavarria, a veteran on the gang beat.

At the time, Gonzales had no idea that videotape would break open a case that has frustrated local and federal authorities for a decade.

Saenz is the newest person on the FBI's Most Wanted List, after three fugitives on the list were recently caught.

"Just gruesome, gruesome, cold-blooded," Chavarria said. "Just walks right up to these guys, shoots them and then just walks over and stands over them and shoots them each in the head and casually walks away."

"We had pictures of him constantly on our dashboard so that there was no question if we saw this guy we knew who he was," Chavarria said.

Within days, Saenz -- also known as Jose Saenz, Louie Louie and more than two dozen other aliases -- was wanted for a third murder.

"He leaves a note indicating that his grandmother has nothing to do with the murder and that he left the scene. And from that point on he became a fugitive for the next 10 years," Gonzales said.

He's eluded police for years, and has reportedly made statements that he plans to kill a police officer if they ever find him and arrest him, according to the FBI's Most Wanted Web site.

Now, authorities are hoping the video from October 2008 will help them get one step closer to the man who they say terrifies those who know him just as much as his victims.

"We heard rumors that not only citizens were afraid of him, but also his own gang members were afraid of him," Chavarria said.

The chilling video, Chavarria said, shows why Saenz is so dangerous.
