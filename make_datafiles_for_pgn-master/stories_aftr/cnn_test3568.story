The rout got underway in the 35th minute when Marcus Reus tapped in after Robert Lewandowski's shot had been palmed away by goalkeeper Oliver Baumann.

The lead was doubled ten minutes later after defender Fallou Diagne was shown a straight red card for pulling down Lewandowski inside the penalty area. Reus stepped up to convert the resulting spot kick.

Bayern, who put four goals past Schalke last weekend, had to settle for a 1-0 win over Wolfsburg at the Allianz Arena on Saturday.

Pep Guardiola's men created chances galore but only one was converted -- Thomas Muller directing Franck Ribery's low cross goalwards in the 62nd minute.

Bayer Leverkusen kept pace with the leaders with a 2-0 win over fourth-place Hannover. First-half goals from Simon Rolfes and Sidney Sam earned the home side a sixth win in seven matches to consolidate third place, one point behind both Dortmund and Bayern.

Elsewhere, Hertha Berlin move up to fifth with a 3-1 over mid-table Mainz, while the game between Hoffenheim and Schalke ended in a 3-3 draw.
