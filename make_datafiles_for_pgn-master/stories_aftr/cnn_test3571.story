(CNN) -- Secretary of State John Kerry landed in Kabul, Afghanistan, Friday for talks with President Hamid Karzai.

The United States hopes to make progress on a long-stalled security deal with Afghanistan that would leave some U.S. forces in the country beyond NATO's scheduled departure at the end of 2014.

U.S. officials say they hope to conclude a deal on the Bilateral Security Agreement, or BSA, in the "coming weeks" and before Karzai meets with a council of tribal elders next month.

Senior U.S. officials tell CNN the text of an agreement is about 95% complete, but two main issues remain unresolved.

The sticking points involve Afghanistan's refusal to let U.S. forces conduct counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda operatives.

Such a pact might compel the United States to send troops into Pakistan if Afghanistan was attacked.

A state department official who briefed reporters on the way to Kabul said they hope Kerry and Karzai will make progress in the negotiations, but they don't expect to close a deal.

"They will of course be discussing where we are and seek to continue to make progress," the official said. "Now negotiations were ongoing before we arrived and they will be ongoing after we depart from Kabul, so that was not the expectation in terms of a conclusion."

The Afghan leader, known for emotional rants against the United States and NATO forces, cast doubt this week on whether a deal could be reached.

At a press conference, he issued a sharp rebuke to American and NATO forces in his country over a recent NATO airstrike in Nangarhar province that the Afghan government claimed killed five civilians.

"The United States and NATO have not respected our sovereignty," Karzai said. "Whenever they find it suitable to them, they have acted against it. This has been a serious point of contention between us and that is why we are taking issue of the BSA strenuously in the negotiations right now."

Referring to U.S. insistence on handling counterterrorism operations, Karzai said, "The United States and its allies, NATO, continue to demand even after signing the BSA they will have the freedom to attack our people, our villages. The Afghan people will never allow it."

In an interview with Associated Press last week, President Barack Obama warned he would keep troops in Afghanistan only if the United States got want it wanted in any agreement.

Daniel Markey, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of the forthcoming book "No Exit from Pakistan," says that while the remaining issues are few in number, their importance could hinder chances for a deal.

Karzai has suggested his successor should be the one to conclude negotiations with the United States. U.S. officials and analysts have voiced concern that Afghans would take to the polls amid uncertainty about the future relationship with the United States.

"As a practical matter it will be difficult for us and our NATO partners to deliver on pledges we have made regarding both security and economic programs," one senior administration official said.
