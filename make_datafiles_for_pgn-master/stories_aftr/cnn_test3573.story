One evening last week I was in the kitchen fixing myself a cup of tea when my son put his head around the door. I have hardly seen him since he left school last summer as he spends his days working in a sandwich shop and nights taking orders in a fast-food takeaway.

These jobs of yours, I said. Have they taught you anything interesting yet about or work, or life -- or anything?

Yeah, he said. They've taught me I like getting paid.

Already I was seeing the sense in his general argument. My son's first key takeaway from the takeaway restaurant was spot on:

● Getting paid really is nice. It is a pity most of us get so used to it that we forget to be pleased when payday comes around.

This led to the second revelation:

● If you are earning £7 an hour you need to work longer than an investment banker to make any money at all.

● Earning the minimum wage makes you grateful to live at home where there is a warm bed and full(ish) fridge. For everyone else, it is a game of survival and he doesn't understand how they manage.

Isn't he also learning how to be professional, I asked -- leading the witness outrageously.

● A fast-food restaurant is an excellent finishing school. It has succeeded in areas where 18 years of liberal parenting and seven years of hugely expensive private education have made little impression.

Yet even though he has learnt how to be civil to customers, he has not learnt to like it. In fact what he has discovered is that:

● Dealing with customers can suck. Some of them are friendly, but there are lots who don't even look at you. That gets to you after a while.

Before I left him, I told him that his lessons bore no resemblance to the ones drawn by the HBR blogger, whose stint doing humble jobs taught him great truths about humanity: that most people want to take pride in their work, and that everyone has big dreams. What did he think of that? He pointed out it was hard to take pride in your work when the restaurant is doing badly and the manager doesn't care.

But even with good management, some people are still useless moaners, which led him to lesson nine.

● Working with whingers is rubbish.

So what should be done about them, I asked. He looked at me as if I were an idiot.

"F-ing fire them," he said, momentarily forgetting lesson #5.

And what about dreams? "Yeah," he said. "Everyone here has dreams."

Slightly dreading the answer, I asked what were his. To my relief he replied: "To get into university and to get a skilled job."
