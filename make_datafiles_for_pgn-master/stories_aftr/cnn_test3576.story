(CNN) -- A one-way ticket to Mars.

Presuming you get there, who wouldn't want to come back? As it turns out, plenty of people.

Clearly, the end of the U.S. space shuttle program in 2011 did nothing to diminish the appeal of extraterrestrial adventures. "Exploration and a sense of discovery are innate in humans, more in some and less in others," says Aashima Dogra, editorial manager at Mars One.

The Hayden Planetarium, New York City

While some humans are packing for Mars, others believe the residents of distant planets have been visiting us for years. In 1947, ranchers near Roswell, New Mexico, came upon unusual debris that would form the basis of perhaps the most famous UFO story of all time. The town has memorialized the incident with the International UFO Museum and Research Center, opened in 1996. Memorabilia includes original broadcasts pertaining to the event and models of debris based on eyewitness accounts. There are also photos of possible UFOs from around the world and an extensive library relating to UFOs and crop circles. "We're not here to convince people one way or the other," says executive director Mark Briscoe. "It's for all individuals to make up their own minds." Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission is $5 adults, $2 children 15 and under. 800-822-3545.

The Kennedy Space Center, Florida

In the world of pop culture, nothing has inspired more would-be astronauts than "Star Trek." The little town of Vulcan in Alberta, Canada, has made the most of its Trekkish name, with a Star-Trek themed tourism office, a replica of the Enterprise, and other memorabilia. This summer it added the Trekcetera Museum, sure to put Vulcan more firmly on the mental map of any thorough Trekkie. Billed as "Canada's only 'Star Trek' museum," its displays feature original costumes and props from both the movies and TV shows. Fall opening hours are 10 a.m. to 5p.m., closed Tuesdays. Tickets cost $12 for adults, $8 for seniors and children.
