(CNN) -- Jason Collins is a big, end-of-bench bruiser who can harangue opposing centers. And he's gay.

"I've had players tell me, 'When he comes to set a screen, you're going to get open,' " Lee said.

Opinion: Here's to Collins -- and the NBA

What it does not include is the ability to fill up a stat sheet. Over 12 seasons, he has a career average of 3.6 points per game, and he hasn't averaged more than 2 points a games since his 2006-07 season as a New Jersey Net.

There's been much talk about what it means for basketball and the LGBT community if he's not signed after coming out, but Lee said he feels that teams will be more concerned with his 35th birthday coming in December and that he appeared in only six games, averaging 10 minutes per outing, for the Wizards.

He'll also command almost $1.4 million, the NBA minimum salary for a player with 10 or more years in the league.

"That will go against him more than sexual orientation," Lee said.

Von DuBose, an Atlanta-based attorney and NFL contract negotiator who has represented NBA players in off-the-court matters, likens Collins to Marcus Camby or Juwan Howard, a fraternity of "bigger post guys who don't rely on their quicks or perimeter play to survive."

Sure, Camby and Howard had more impressive career stats, but as they've grown older -- Camby is 39, Howard 40 -- they've settled into more utilitarian roles, coming off the bench for a few minutes a game.

"That GM, without divulging publicly that he had considered it, may go in a different direction," DuBose said.

Collins needs to go to a team with solid structure and an assertive coach and GM, Lee said. A cast of veterans will also help, as older players are more likely to be focused on winning than on whining about a teammate being gay.

While it's unclear, despite the myriad messages of support, what will happen if and when Collins next steps into a locker room, Lee said Collins has garnered a lot of good will, credibility and respect during his dozen years in the league. He's a leader, and his teammates have always liked him, he said.

"He's in the process of taking ownership over the here and now, which is actually coming out," Carolyn Moos, a Stanford grad and former WNBA player who dated Collins for eight years, told CNN's Piers Morgan on Tuesday night. "And that can be very, I assume, overwhelming."

"I hope (it) is a natural progression for him," Moos said, as he becomes more comfortable with himself. I think time will allow more perspective on it as well."

But he didn't see how that would translate into additional revenue. Wizards spokesman Scott Hall said that while every jersey the club sold Monday had Collins' name on it, "it was not a large amount."

"I think it would be a terrible move to try to sign him for financial gain or rating," Lee said. "He has too much respect for himself to be used for something other than what he is, which is a basketball player."

"I think whatever percentage chance Jason had of being on an NBA roster when he woke up yesterday is probably identical this morning," he said. "Actually, I'll take that back. ... If he was 7 feet tall yesterday morning, my guess is with the weight that was lifted off his shoulders yesterday, he is probably 7'2", so that might improve his chances."
