(CNN) -- There's some work to be done to get United States airports on par with their global competitors. This is according to President Obama, who highlighted poor U.S. airport rankings during a press conference Tuesday.

"Just one interesting statistic when it comes to airports. There was a recent survey of the top airports in the country -- in the world -- and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25. Not one -- not one U.S. airport was considered by the experts and consumers who use these airports to be in the top 25 in the world. I think Cincinnati airport came in around 30th," Obama said as he addressed questions about the contentious debate over forced government budget cuts and the recent Federal Aviation Administration furloughs.

And the world's best airport is ...
