"While our previous activity in China had been putting on concerts occasionally, we will now be setting up an office in China and aggressively pursue the China market," a representative for YG Entertainment told CNN in Seoul.

And China has not been immune to K-pop's allure.

China's airwaves have been dominated by Chinese-language "Mandopop," but tastes are evolving as the internet gives young people access to different types of music, says Nathaniel Davis, operations director of China-based music industry consultancy Splatter.

Reflecting these challenges, Choi says the company's initial focus in China will be on making money from concerts.

Despite being the world's second largest economy, China ranks 20th globally in terms of recorded music revenue, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).

China is aware of the problems facing the industry and is concerned that it has not produced a act of global or even regional standing.

"Psy's success seems to be haphazard but it isn't," Zang Yanbin, president of the China Record Working Committee told the China Daily in March.

"Behind Gangnam Style are great efforts by the Korean government and music companies to develop and promote Korean pop music. The Chinese government should also try to create better environments for Chinese pop music."

YG's ambitions are not limited to China. The company recently incorporated in the United States and speaks of a "digital silk road" spreading K-pop to the world.

Last year, the music video to Psy's Gangnam Style went viral to become the most-watched video on YouTube. The song was also the third best-selling single of the year, according to the IFPI, and has helped boost the financial fortunes of YG.

YG said it was too early to say whether they planned to develop local Chinese acts or simply promote their existing artists in the country.

But one novel strategy has been adopted by rival SM Entertainment, which is trying to make inroads into the Chinese market with Exo -- a boy band that performs their songs in Mandarin as well as Korean.
