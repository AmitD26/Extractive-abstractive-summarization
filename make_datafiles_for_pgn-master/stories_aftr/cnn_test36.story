Virginia Wade was the last British winner of a grand slam at Wimbledon in 1977, the year of the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.

Maybe that will be an omen because 2012 marks the Diamond Jubilee of the British monarch, who made a rare visit to SW19 to see Wade win all those years ago.

Wishful thinking

"It's a great challenge, one where I'm probably not expected to win, but one that, if I play well, I'm capable of winning. The pressure that I would be feeling if it was against somebody else I guess it would be different.

"But there will be less on me on Sunday because of who he is."

Murray is right though. Federer is a formidable opponent and can set a string of records if he beats the number four seed and home hope.

It will be a record equaling seventh Wimbledon title in the Open Era, drawing level with Pete Sampras, who coincidentally had the same coach, Paul Annacone, as Federer.

For a 30-year-old, considered to be a waning force, it would be a remarkable performance, made possible by his four-set dismissal of the previously dominant Novak Djokovic to reach a record eighth Wimbledon final.

"There's a lot on the line for me. I'm not denying that. I have a lot of pressure, as well. I'm looking forward to that. That's what I work hard for," he said.

"I've worked extremely hard since I lost that match point against Novak last year at the U.S. Open.

"My run has been extremely good. Now I have a chance at world No. 1, and at the title again all at once.

"So it's a big match for me."

Missed chance

Federer missed that chance against Djokovic in the semifinal of the U.S. Open last year, losing a five-set thriller and it looked as if it might be his last with the likes of Rafael Nadal, who made a surprising early exit at Wimbledon, and Murray making it even more difficult to land a grand slam.

But with inspiration and valuable advice from a new coach, eight-time grand slam winner Ivan Lendl, the 25-year Murray may just be ready to bring some much needed cheer to a country in the grip of austerity and in the middle of one of its wettest summers on record.
