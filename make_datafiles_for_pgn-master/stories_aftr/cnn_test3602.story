Birmingham, Alabama (CNN) -- A preliminary investigation has found no evidence of an "uncontained engine failure" or a "pre-impact fire" in the engine of a UPS cargo plane that crashed in Birmingham, Alabama, killing the pilot and co-pilot, a National Transportation Safety Board official said Thursday.

There also was no indication of a problem with runway lights, Robert Sumwalt of the NTSB told reporters.

The news came as authorities announced the cockpit voice and flight data recorders were recovered from the wreckage near Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, and were being sent to NTSB headquarters in Washington.

Investigators had to use picks and shovels to retrieve the data recorders from the wreckage because flames in the plane's tail section kept officials from accessing them immediately.

UPS identified the pilots as Capt. Cerea Beal Jr., 58, of Matthews, North Carolina, and First Officer Shanda Fanning, 37, of Lynchburg, Tennessee.

The Airbus A300-600F broke into pieces as it crashed around 4:45 a.m. in an open field near a street that runs parallel to the airport.

The cargo plane had 12 "service difficulty" reports on file at the Federal Aviation Administration, including at least two that the reports indicated led pilots to declare emergencies.

But an aviation expert told CNN he believes none of the previous problems would have played a role in the accident.

"I don't see anything there that indicates in any way that its related to the events in Birmingham," said John Goglia, a former NTSB member and former certified aircraft mechanic.

The flap problem, reported in 2006 while the plane was flying in Germany, might raise concern had it not occurred so long ago, he said.

The crash site is about a half mile north of a runway.

"An engine that is producing power, those (blades) would have been gone," said Goglia. The lack of damage suggests that "they weren't spinning so fast and they stopped quickly."

If the data recorders contain information, investigators should be able to quickly discover the status of the engines before impact.

But if the data is not retrievable, investigators will focus on the condition of the blades, Goglia predicted.

Airbus said Wednesday the plane had approximately 11,000 flight hours in some 6,800 flights. It was powered by Pratt & Whitney engines.
