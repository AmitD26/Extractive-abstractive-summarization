Nelson left the door open on one issue involving marijuana. Defense attorneys say toxicology tests show Martin had enough THC -- the key active ingredient in marijuana -- in his system to indicate he may have smoked the drug a couple of hours before the shooting. Nelson barred any mention of this from opening statements but said she will rule later on whether it will be admissible after she hears defense experts' testimony about the marijuana use.

Marijuana use in general can come up during jury selection, the judge said.

Zimmerman, who is out on bail, did not appear at the hearing.

He's charged with second-degree murder in the February 26, 2012, shooting. He was a neighborhood watch volunteer when he called 911 reporting "a suspicious person" in the neighborhood, who turned out to be 17-year-old Martin.

The shooting put a national spotlight on Zimmerman's hometown of Sanford, Florida, and sparked fresh debates about race relations and gun laws. The decision not to bring charges against Zimmerman led to the dismissal of the town's police chief and the appointment of a special prosecutor, who accused the homeowner of unjustly profiling and killing Martin.

Nelson did agree to one key request from the defense: to hold a hearing on whether the state failed to turn over some evidence.

Nelson agreed to subpoena the state IT investigator who allegedly issued a report about the photos and text messages. But she denied a defense request for a delay in the start of the trial, setting the start of jury selection for June 10.

Nelson also granted the prosecution's motion to bar evidence about why it took so long to arrest Zimmerman.

Judge to rule on screaming heard in 911 calls

Defense attorneys also raised questions Tuesday about an analysis that suggests Martin might be heard screaming in the background of a 911 call just before the shooting.

One analyst, Alan Reich, said he believes Martin can be heard saying the word "stop."

Reich told the Washington Post that he believes the voice is Martin, but another analyst told the Post that no determination can be made.

Defense attorneys said Tuesday that in a deposition on Friday, Reich said he had not completed his report and would need another two weeks.

The defense does not want Reich's analysis admitted.

Judge Nelson ruled that in a hearing at the end of next week, the science being used for voice identification will be discussed, and she will determine whether it is admissible at trial.

No gold teeth

While defense attorneys had argued in court papers that they may want other details about Martin admitted -- including an assertion that he had removable gold tooth caps -- they agreed Tuesday that they don't expect it to become relevant at trial.

"Is the defense trying to prove Trayvon deserved to be killed by George Zimmerman because (of) the way he looked?" Crump asked in a statement. "If so, this stereotypical and closed-minded thinking is the same mindset that caused George Zimmerman to get out of his car and pursue Trayvon, an unarmed kid who he didn't know."

Zimmerman's brother: Drop murder charge

After the hearing, Robert Zimmerman, brother of George, called on the state to drop the second-degree murder charge.

Authorities initially "did their job when they refused to charge someone with a crime who had committed no crime," Robert Zimmerman said. "In this country, you don't charge someone with any crime solely to assuage the concerns of misinformed masses."

"Without question, today was a very important day in this case," he said.

None of the information that was barred, he argued, "had anything to do" with the confrontation that led to Martin being killed.

CNN's Victor Blackwell reported from Sanford, Florida; CNN's Josh Levs and Graham Winch reported from Atlanta. CNN's Jessica Thill and Rich Phillips contributed to this report.
