But abortion is illegal without exceptions in El Salvador, and on Wednesday, the country's Supreme Court denied her petition.

Atttorneys for the 22-year-old woman, known only as "Beatriz," argued that the mother's life was at risk if the pregnancy was not terminated.

The ruling found that doctors must continue to monitor the woman and make the best medical decisions that take into account the risks to her life, and to the unborn baby, too.

She argued that an abortion could save her life and allow her to care for her other child, who is a year old.

Anti-abortion groups countered that abortion-rights advocates were using Beatriz as an opening to push for changes to abortion laws.

"The constitution makes it clear that life exists from the moment of conception, and anything that tries to end a life is murder," lawmaker Rodolfo Parker said after the ruling.

"There has to be a prudent period (to make a decision) that doesn't take practically a month and a half like we waited to have a serious analysis," said Ima Guirola of the rights group CEMUJER.
