The 70-year-old is accused of sharing a "highly confidential document" with a foreign website that published the material last year. The document, issued by the Communist Party's Central Committee, was widely distributed online, according to the report.

Chinese broadcaster CCTV televised Gao's confession on Thursday morning.

Other high-profile activists and scholars have been detained in recent weeks, including human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang and four other people who attended a low-key event last week marking the 25th anniversary of the June 4th Tiananmen Square protests.

Gao was reported missing after she failed to attend the meeting.

The outspoken journalist, whose columns are published on German news outlet Deutsche Welle's Chinese-language site, began her career as a reporter for the China News Service in 1979.

25 years later, Tiananmen Square no less taboo for China's censors

CNN's Zhang Dayu and Beijing intern Andi Wang contributed to this report.
