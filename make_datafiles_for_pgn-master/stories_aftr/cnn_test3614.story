(CNN) -- Playing professional sport is many people's idea of the perfect job, but that doesn't mean sportsmen are immune to feeling the strain of working life.

"I don't feel it's right that I'm playing knowing that I'm not 100% and I cannot currently operate at the level I have done in the past," said the 32-year-old Trott.

"My priority now is to take a break from cricket so that I can focus on my recovery. I want to wish my teammates all the very best for the remainder of the tour."

England were beaten heavily in the first test -- the tourists suffered a 381-run defeat in Brisbane -- and Australian batsman David Warner labeled their batting "poor and weak."

Warner also claimed England's batsmen had "scared eyes."

Ashes series are traditionally characterized by gamesmanship and competitive verbal jousting -- known as "sledging" -- between the two sets of players.

"On the pitch it's pretty much a war, isn't it?" said England captain Alastair Cook after his side's comprehensive defeat.

"There are always going to be a few battles and a few words, but on the pitch is fine.

"There were a lot of things said that we think have been disrespectful, but you have to give the Aussies credit for how they played."

"I'm not going to go into what's been said on the field - I think that's part and parcel of the game," said the Australian captain.

"I'm sure there's plenty of things that are said on the field that you won't overhear on the stump microphone. There is certainly no single England player that we have any vendetta against."

Trott is not the first England cricketer to pull out of a tour with a stress-related illness.

"Jonathan Trott is an incredibly talented cricketer who has proven himself time and again for England," said managing director England cricket Hugh Morris.

"The cricket side of things is unimportant now, all that matters is that Jonathan is given the time, support and space he needs to recover.

"Feeling for Jonathan Trott," tweeted former Australian bowler Shane Warne. "I hope he and his family are left alone by all media & he's able to recover quickly & return to the Eng team!"
