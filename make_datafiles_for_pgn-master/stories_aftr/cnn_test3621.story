(CNN) -- Lake Louise specialist Aksel Lund Svindal secured his fifth Super-G win at the Canadian ski resort Sunday to put down an early marker in an Olympic season.

The Norwegian made the most of his experience on the lower part of the course to record a time of one minute 28.53 seconds -- 0.38 faster than second placed Matthias Mayer of Austria.

I think it's cool," he said of beating the record.

The win has also left him top of the overall World Cup standings, his cause helped when American hope Ted Ligety skied out on the top part of the course.

Svindal, a four-time World Cup champion in the Super-G, will also be defending his Olympic title in Sochi next February and on this early form will be favorite for gold again.

Only fourth in Saturday's downhill behind Italy's Dominik Paris, Svindal was behind Mayer at the mid section before powering to the finish.

Another Austrian, Georg Streitberger, occupied the final podium position.

Six of Svindal's 22 wins have come at Lake Louise with Super-G success previously in 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2012.

She held off the challenge of precocious American teenager Mikaela Shiffrin by just nine hundredths of a second over two legs at Beaver Creek in Colorado.

Earlier, Lara Gut's bid for a third win of the Beaver Creek weekend came to an end when she skied out in the first leg.
