Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Communications Commission approved new rules Wednesday to further limit automatically dialed or prerecorded calls know as "robocalls" and automated text messages.

"Too many telemarketers, aided by autodialers and prerecorded messages, have continued to call consumers who don't want to hear from them," said FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski in a statement read at the meeting. These new overlapping rules seek to close loopholes in the existing regulations.

"Any type of phone call or text to a wireless device needs written consent," the FCC official added.

"Each and every telemarketing robocall will have to include an automated, interactive opt-out mechanism, so that a consumer can revoke consent by pressing just a few keys during the call," Genachowski said. The company will have to immediately disconnect the call and add you to their do-not-call list.

The new rules "strictly" limit the number of such calls telemarketers can make "within each calling campaign," the FCC said.

A telemarketing company that has a real person dialing the phone numbers is not subject to the new rules.

"Consumers' first line of protection against any call is the do-not-call list," the FCC official said.
