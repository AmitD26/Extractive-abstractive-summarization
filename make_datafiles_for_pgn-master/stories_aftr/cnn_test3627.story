(CNN) -- The baseball players posed for a team photo of sorts -- but the signs they held had nothing to do with home runs or striking out.

The Detroit Tigers teammates snapped the photo last week in a locker room in Lakeland, Florida, their spring training base.

Weeks of massive street protests in Venezuela have left at least 13 people dead, more than 100 injured, and dozens detained after clashes between members of the opposition, backers of the government, law enforcement and armed groups.

"We are really worried about what's going on there," said Wilmer Flores, a 22-year-old infielder for the Mets. "I have all my family there. All my friends are there."

He said he's warned his family members not to go outside as protests rage.

"From here, supporting VENEZUELA," Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera -- who's from Maracay, Venezuela -- posted as he tweeted the photo with his teammates.

Baseball is also a national pastime in the South American nation. And statistics show that Venezuelans represent the second largest group of foreign players in Major League Baseball.

The Tigers photo has been re-tweeted nearly 10,000 times since Cabrera shared it, and more than 16,000 times from Vizquel's account.

Some described them as hypocrites, slammed them for seeming to take sides or criticized them for not taking a firm enough stance.

Some players' online posts have included the #SOSVenezuela tag used by members of the opposition to draw attention to Venezuela's crisis. Others have said they aren't taking a political stand -- just pushing for peace.

Vizquel didn't mince words when he fired back on Twitter.

The face of one Mets coach, Edgardo Alfonzo, normally lights up when he talks about his home country. But now, weighing the situation, he says he's overcome with sadness and feeling tense.

"We never thought we were going to get where we are today. ... You feel so impotent not being able to do anything from here, just supporting our families and the Venezuelan people. And really, for all these people who have lost family members, it is so hard," he said. "Everyone is worried. It's like a ticking time bomb. Really, you don't want it to continue. You want it to stop, once and for all."

It's not just baseball players and coaches speaking out about Venezuela.

Miami Heat basketball player Chris Bosh tweeted a photo of his shoes during a game on Sunday, with "SOS Venezuela" written in white above the Nike swoosh.

"Kind of brushing up on it in the past week," he said. "Crazy. Government kind of stopping everything. Inflation. Exports and imports have pretty much stopped. I know a couple of people that just came down from there, and work for me, and it's just bad. You go to the grocery store, and there's no groceries. No medicine."

Many Venezuelan baseball players say they hope to use their popularity and the popularity of their sport to send a message of peace that goes beyond politics.

They believe baseball is a sport that can bring people together, and they hope that their message is heard by the international community, as well as back at home.

There's only one thing Alfonzo says he wants for his country: peace.

"Just pray for Venezuela," he said. "That's all we ask."
