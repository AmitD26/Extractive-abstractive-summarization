(CNN) -- Few things are worse for the traveler than nasty surprises.

We seek neither the impractical (first-class leather seats in coach), the implausible (teleportation), nor the unrealistic (airport concourses that demand less walking than a breast cancer fund-raiser).

Even better, none of the brainstorms below are protected by patents, licenses or other legal restrictions, so Big Travel can feel free to scoop them up and begin making our lives better right away.

1. Update hotel check-in times

In 1946, the Tote'm convenience-store chain extended its hours from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., announcing its groundbreaking move by changing its name to 7-Eleven.

Yet as nonstop commerce has created a sleepless planet, hotels remain mired in conventions of the 1800s, when the steam train rolled in and out of town once each afternoon and again the following morning.

With airlines cleaving away from the hub-and-spoke system -- which once rigidly controlled arrival and departure times -- in favor of more or less continuous schedules and red-eye flights, the hotel industry needs to restructure its own arrival and departure policies to reflect modern traffic flow.

Few miseries compare to landing in a city at 6 a.m. only to while away the morning in traveler's purgatory awaiting an "early" 1 p.m. check-in that you had to grovel to get.

The major hotel chain that figures out a way to implement "anytime check-in" on a mass scale will become the new Hilton.

Unless, of course, Hilton gets to it first.

2. Invent a universal plug socket

A few years ago, tech-connected people lived in an era of many too gadgets and not enough laptop sockets, wondering why the hell devices couldn't just share the same plug-ins.

The travel industry is suffering from a similar connection problem.

There are attempts to paper over this dilemma. But what if you're not lucky enough to be in a business hotel with a full 3x2 foot panel dedicated to a dozen types of plug shapes?

Isn't it time everyone started doing the same?

Introducing the future of good service -- the coffeecheck.

Checks should be delivered with the final course, at least for businesses lunches.

4. Abolish institutionalized taxi extortion

If private enterprise can't responsibly accommodate tourists, local legislation should be employed to force them into it.

But while most consumer-facing industries like to improve customer experiences whenever possible, the airline industry seems to go out of its way to keep its passengers grumpy and miserable.

The hotel industry is a little better. Taj Hotels has a policy of upgrading to the next level of room or suite if available when you check in.

Wouldn't the word-of-mouth and social media praise be worth it from customers grateful for surprise upgrades if they occurred more often?

6. Retire the beverage cart on short flights

To shave expenses, airlines have already done away with most food. The next logical step is ending the tiresome drink service that creates more trouble than it's worth.

For flights of two hours or less, hand out bottles of water and sell beer, wine and drinks in the departure lounge. This will save the airlines money and labor and, for customers, eliminate the risk of being sideswiped every five minutes by the polyestered haunch of an exhausted flight attendant horsing a Sisyphun weight up and down the aisle taking drink requests and barking orders -- "Keep your feet in!" "Watch your knees!" -- with all the Ã©lan of the guy who sits in the booth and weighs you in at the dump.

7. Just stop talking, please

The first port of call for most vacations -- the airport -- is invariably an unending and un-ignorable procession of barely decipherable Tannoy announcements, most of which are entirely superfluous.

Noise equals stress, so airports should be minimizing it wherever possible, not adding to it.

And while you're at it, how about upgrading those 1930s-quality public address systems in airports and on planes?

8. Eliminate the paper trail

Why do we need a tissue-thin napkin every time someone on an airplane hands us four ounces of water in a urine-sample cup?

Former American Airlines chairman Robert Crandall once famously saved his company US$40,000 a year by eliminating the olive from salads the airline once served onboard.

9. Make booking more transparent

You think you've found the deal of a lifetime, till you click "checkout" and the price suddenly doubles due to the airport tax.

Or you spot an airline ad for "US$10 deals" to the other side of the world, but you have to book on exactly the right day and on the right flight to take advantage and they don't mention when that is.

10. Give us our phones back

If you can get a 300-ton hunk of iron and aluminum into the sky, surely you can figure out a way for us to use our iPads without it causing a disaster?

Listen up, Big Travel! These fixes would make travel more pleasant for us and maybe save you money.

Do we really need a napkin every time someone hands us a drink?
