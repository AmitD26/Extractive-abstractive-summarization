The famed Australian golfer, who won two majors and 20 U.S. PGA Tour titles, posted a photo late Saturday on his Instagram account showing him lying in a hospital bed.

Later he posted another photo with his left forearm in a foam device that helps keep the arm in place.

Her father had minor surgery to repair slight nerve damage, she said. The accident happened at his Florida home, she said. He went to surgery Saturday afternoon and was home that night.

Last weekend, Norman, known as the "Great White Shark," had posted a picture of himself holding a chainsaw next to a tree with several branches already severed.

"Time to trim the sea grapes today," the caption on that photo said. "Never ask someone to do something that you can do yourself. Love to work!"

Norman, 59, was one of the dominant golfers in the 1980s and 1990s, spending a total of 331 weeks at the top of the world rankings and winning two British Open Championships. He now has his own clothing brand, real estate business and golf course design company.

CNN's Jethro Mullen and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.
