No one knows exactly how he got out.

But Mundu is on the cusp of sexual maturity, Mehlow said. His hormones are raging and he is constantly testing limits.

Because the koala was not in any danger and did not pose any risk to the public, zookeepers took shifts watching Mundu in the tree.

When the zoo closed, they lured him back into his exhibit. Mundu was then checked by a veterinarian.

The exhibit has a Koala Cam, but Mundu's Houdini-like move was not caught on camera.
