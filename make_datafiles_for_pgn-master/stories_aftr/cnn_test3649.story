(CNN) -- In his first television interview, Ariel Castro's son said Monday that his dad belongs in prison for the rest of his life and he doesn't plan on ever visiting him.

Last week, Ariel Castro pleaded guilty in an Ohio court to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping, in connection with imprisoning three women in his home for nearly a decade.

Anthony Castro, in an exclusive NBC "Today" show interview, said he thinks that sentence is "the best possible."

Anthony Castro went on to say that his father "has been lying to his family for the past 10, 11 years, at every possible turn."

"I have no trust in him," the son said. "I can't see myself going to visit him and giving him the opportunity to face me and lie to me again."

Castro abducted Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Georgina "Gina" DeJesus separately in a two-year period starting in 2002, authorities say.

Snapshots: Who are the three women?

The women and Berry's 6-year-old daughter were held in Castro's 1,400-square-foot home. DNA tests have confirmed that Castro is the child's father. They were freed in May after one of the women shouted for help while Castro was away.

Finally free, Berry pleaded for a phone.

"Help me, I am Amanda Berry," she frantically told a 911 operator. "I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here, I'm free now."

Thankful for support

Lately the women have spoken out.

In early July, Berry, DeJesus and Knight released a YouTube video offering their thanks to all those who have helped them since they were freed.

"I want to thank everyone who has helped me and my family through this entire ordeal. Everyone who has been there to support us has been a blessing," Berry said in the video. "I'm getting stronger each day."

DeJesus talked to CNN affiliate WEWS on Sunday. She was excited that the last pieces of wood were being placed on a privacy fence around the DeJesus home.

"I really wanted it. It meant a lot to me," the young woman said.

Happiness gives way to disappointment

But when his father's name and photo made media reports, and he heard Berry say his father's name, he was stunned and shaken.

Ariel Castro was "incredibly strict," Anthony Castro said.

"He had a temper. He wasn't a monster 24/7, but if you crossed him, there would be consequences. And those, more often than not, would be physical consequences.

"I think that she will be there the first morning he wakes up in prison ... and the sun shines down -- that's going to be her justice."

Had Anthony Castro been inside the house where the women were held? Had he seen any signs? Anthony Castro had been in the house, and he always entered through the back door. "That's where my father would flag me in," he said.

There were locks on the doors to the attic and basement, and the windows were nailed shut, Anthony Castro said. But that wasn't unusual. There were places he just wasn't allowed to go, he said. But he and his dad would talk in the kitchen for a short while, he said.

His family has endured a "nightmare" since May, Anthony Castro said, but he was quick to add, "nothing to compare to what the girls went through."

"Because of all this, my father will never be able to hurt anyone again," he said. "I have nothing to say to him."
