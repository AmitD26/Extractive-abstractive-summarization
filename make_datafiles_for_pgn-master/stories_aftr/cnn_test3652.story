Police in Sydney were called in the early hours of Monday morning after the 31-year-old former swimming champion was spotted behaving strangely near a vehicle and was judged to be disorientated.

"Following a fall at home on Tuesday, Ian was admitted to hospital after sustaining an injury to his shoulder," Thorpe's management company told CNN.

"He underwent surgery on Wednesday and was discharged the following day. On Sunday, Ian was taken to Bankstown Hospital and then onto a rehabilitation clinic after being found disorientated and trying to get in to what he thought was a friend's car.

"The family have requested the public and media respect their privacy at this time."

While friends and family have rallied around Thorpe, the star has failed to reach an even keel.

But this latest episode signals a turn for the worse for one of swimming's most iconic figures.

Thorpe retired from competitive action in 2006 only to launch a failed comeback six years later where he attempted to qualify for the London Games.

Thorpe had spent the past 18 months living in Switzerland but returned to Sydney to spend Christmas with his parents.

His manager, James Erskine, confirmed Thorpe insisted his client had no alcohol in his system when he was met by police but was under influence of antidepressants and medication for his shoulder.

In his book, Thorpe revealed how he was often driven to alcohol to find some kind of release.

"I used alcohol as a means to rid my head of terrible thoughts, as a way of managing my moods," he wrote.

"I did it behind closed doors, where many depressed people choose to fight their demons before they realize they can't do it without help.

The swimmer, nicknamed 'Thorpedo', came to prominence at the 2000 Sydney Olympics by winning three gold and two silver medals.

His abnormally large hands and feet, which explained his incredible speed, brought him great success and won him thousands of fans.

He followed up his success four years later in Athens by clinching two more gold medals.
