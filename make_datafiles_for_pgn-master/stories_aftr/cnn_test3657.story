Washington (CNN) -- New questions were being asked Wednesday after a video surfaced showing what looks like the largest and most dangerous gathering of al Qaeda in years.

Did U.S. intelligence officials even know the meeting was taking place?

"I can't imagine that they knew about this meeting. After all, there have been seven drone attacks in Yemen this year. There was one on April 1, so it's not like the drone program is being suspended," Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst, told "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."

Analysts are looking at a flashy white truck that appears, leading a convoy. They are even analyzing the fruit juice being served as a possible clue.

They believe the highly produced video is recent. With some fighters' faces blurred, there is worry it signals a new round of plotting.

"To show we're here. We're still in operation," he said. "This group is still potentially a pretty virulent threat, unfortunately."

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, is considered the most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate. The CIA and the Pentagon have killed multiple AQAP leaders with drone strikes. But the group is now emboldened.

"Sooner or later, if they continue to get better, stronger and more organized," he said, "they will be a direct threat to the United States."

"The question isn't why didn't we know," he said. "The question is: What are we going to do about it?"

CNN's Dana Ford, Catherine E. Shoichet and Bill Weir contributed to this report.
