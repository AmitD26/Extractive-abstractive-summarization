The first season of the series ended Sunday night and was apparently so popular that it crashed the HBO to Go app during the time it was on (full disclosure: HBO is owned by CNN's parent company). For those fortunate enough to watch the episode, there was plenty of debate as to whether it was a satisfying ending to a thrilling eight episodes.

EW writer Darren Franich noted that "It was a lot to take in -- an hour that veered more towards philosophy than final-act thrills (although it had plenty of that, as well)." That publication's TV critic, Jeff Jensen, wrote, "Culminating a remarkable first season in fine, moving form, 'True Detective's' finale, titled 'Form and Void,' took us to the heart of darkness at the vortex center of its weird fiction -- as well as the final stage of its meta-commentary on the stories we tell ourselves, about ourselves, for better and worse."

Time's James Poniewozik found some flaws in the ending even as he said, "True Detective was an artfully written, remarkably acted, stunningly visualized portrait of Marty and Rust trying to find the path in an overgrown world of decay."

The Atlantic took the approach of having a "round table" of writers discuss the season finale. Spencer Kornhaber, Christopher Orr and Amy Sullivan each weighed in with their thoughts on the show's wrapup. Sullivan said she "vowed to watch the finale as a fan, not as someone trying to figure it all out."

Mario Lopez tweeted, "I can now say that True Detective had the best first season of any show I've ever seen..." And according to his Twitter account, actor Colin Hanks was scrambling to find somewhere to watch the show in Canada and finally lucked out. "Major thanks to @sarajeanhughes and @josiahhughes for opening up their home to me so I could watch the True Detective finale," he tweeted.
