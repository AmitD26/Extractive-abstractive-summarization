One U.N. officer was wounded during the meeting at Unity state, which was attended by several staff members of the world body, according to Kouider Zerrouk, a spokesman for the U.N. mission in Juba.

Seven U.N. staff members and three local officials traveled to Mayendit County to investigate a wave of violence from cattle raiding on the borders of Unity and Warrap states.

During the meeting Wednesday, the county commissioner from neighboring Lake state appeared and interrupted the meeting, yelling angry remarks at his Mayendit county counterpart, the spokesman said.

The shooting followed soon after.

The clashes killed at least 16 people from Unity and 21 from Lake, including six civilians from both states, the minister of information said.

The U.N. officer injured in the attack is in stable condition at a hospital in Juba, South Sudan's capital.

The meeting was initiated after a violent cattle raid four days earlier in Warrap state. The attackers, believed to be from Unity state, stole thousands of cattle and killed 74 people. Most were women and children.

The U.N. said the number is more likely in the hundreds, but it said 120,000 were affected and in need of immediate assistance.

The main purpose behind the raids is to steal cattle, a livelihood for the people who live in the barren regions, but the violent clashes end with killings and child abductions.

The victims are largely defenseless women and children.

In a country struggling with violence six months into its independence, and recovering from decades of civil war, weapons have flown freely into the hands of cattle raiders.
