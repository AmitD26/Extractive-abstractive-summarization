"SNL," famous for mocking politicians and newsmakers, portrayed the governor in a four-minute "Weekend Update" segment as confused and disoriented -- often looking in the wrong direction and mistakenly walking in front of the camera when it was not his turn to speak.

The "SNL" skit featured cast member Fred Armisen as the governor. It referred to cocaine use, with Armisen saying he became governor because of a "sex scandal I was miraculously not at the center of."

"Now that [Alaska Gov. Sarah] Palin's not around, they seem to have run out of material," Paterson told reporters Monday. "The idea of a person rolling around the stage in a chair, being disoriented, can't find anything, bumbling, in a sense looking like a clown is a way disabled people are portrayed all the time.

"The perception that disability equals inability to be responsible is totally wrong," he added

On Sunday, a spokeswoman for Paterson suggested the skit was offensive to all people with physical disabilities.  Watch more on the "SNL" skit Â»

"The governor engages in humor all the time, and he can certainly take a joke," said Risa Heller, Paterson's communications director. "However, this particular 'Saturday Night Live' skit unfortunately chose to ridicule people with physical disabilities and imply that disabled people are incapable of having jobs with serious responsibilities.

"The governor is sure that 'Saturday Night Live' with all of its talent can find a way to be funny without being offensive."

Paterson has said he is blind in his left eye and has limited vision in his right eye. He is the first legally blind man to be governor.

"There is only one way that people could have an unemployment rate that's six times the national average -- it's attitude," he said. "And I'm afraid that the kind of third-grade depiction of individuals and the way they look and the way they move add to that negative environment."

But speaking to reporters Monday, the governor, who is known for his self-deprecating sense of humor, said he is more concerned with how other Americans with disabilities may view the skit.

"SNL" has not responded to CNN's request for comment. But the late-night sketch comedy show has a history of skewering politicians, sometimes with such precision that the show's catch phrases have become more closely associated with politicians than the politicians' own words.

In the same episode Saturday night, a skit portrayed embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in a cursed-filled testimony before a Senate panel, offering to sell senators Abraham Lincoln's wedding ring.
