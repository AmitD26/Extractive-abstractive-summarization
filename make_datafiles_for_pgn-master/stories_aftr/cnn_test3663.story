Former Yale University lab technician Raymond Clark III has been sentenced to 44 years in prison after pleading guilty in March to the murder and attempted sexual assault of Le.

Both Yale University and the Yale School of Medicine are named as defendants in the lawsuit, filed Tuesday in New Haven Superior Court in Connecticut.

The suit also cited a Title IX complaint filed by students against the university "which highlighted Yale's failure to adequately prevent and respond to sexual harassment and sexual assaults on female students at Yale. A federal investigation of Yale's conduct in this regard is ongoing."

"Annie Le's murder shocked and deeply saddened the entire Yale community. As a community we united to support and comfort her family and loved ones, and create a lasting memorial to her life. This lawsuit serves neither justice nor Annie's memory, and the University will defend against it as appropriate."

Le had planned to marry Columbia graduate student Jonathan Widawsky on the day her body was found.

Clark was not a Yale student but had worked as a lab technician at the university since 2004, after graduating from high school. He lived with his girlfriend, who also was a Yale lab technician, according to police.

A Yale faculty member had described Clark's job as maintaining colonies for animals used in research.
