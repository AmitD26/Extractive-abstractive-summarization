(CNN) -- With each day, the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 becomes one of the most baffling mysteries of the modern era, but history offers many great quests in which mankind searched for something or someone lost.

These are epic searches, based on legend or fact, ending successfully, tragically, or sometimes not at all:

But there's nothing like the Holy Grail.

It's not clear what the Grail exactly was, but it's said to be the shallow cup from Jesus Christ's Last Supper and from his crucifixion, where the vessel took blood flowing from his side. Some believe Joseph of Arimathea brought the Grail to Britain, where it lies hidden.

Not even legendary King Arthur and his knights could find it, though their crusade inspired lore and romance.

The Titanic

RMS Titanic was a British luxury passenger ship that sank in 1912 during its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City. The ocean liner was touted as "unsinkable" -- until it met an iceberg in the North Atlantic around midnight on April 14-15, 1912.

Air France 447

A long search for a commercial airliner like Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 isn't unprecedented.

Miniature submersible vehicles retrieved the Flight 447's voice and flight data recorders. That allowed investigators to blame the crash on a series of errors by the pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems.

The disappearance of Teamsters leader James Riddle Hoffa remains a subject of relentless speculation and macabre jokes.

He vanished on July 30, 1975, after he stood outside the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Michigan and made a phone call. He was never heard from again.

His name makes news anytime FBI agents and police are seen holding shovels. Lore holds that Hoffa was killed and buried. But where?

Amelia Earhart

In the fourth century B.C., the philosopher Plato spoke of an ancient utopia that existed 9,000 years before, a place called Atlantis.

Made of concentric islands rich with gold, silver and exotic life, Atlantis descended into depravity, Plato said, until earthquakes and tsunamis ultimately destroyed it.

Over time, thinkers and writers began trying to place Atlantis in real countries and lands, even America.

At a minimum, Atlantis lives on in the imagination, thanks to one of Western civilization's greatest philosophers.

In their lust for wealth, the Spaniards traveled through modern Florida, Texas and Mexico in search of Cibola.

Tomb of Cleopatra and Mark Antony

Cleopatra, the great queen of Egypt, died in 30 B.C. and was buried with her lover, Mark Antony.

The couple's great passion has been captured in theater and film, thanks to Shakespeare on stage and Elizabeth Taylor in film. But for some adventurers, that's not enough.

In 2009, flamboyant archeologist Zahi Hawass of Egypt and his colleagues began a new search for Cleopatra's tomb -- "in hopes of removing some of the great mystery that hangs thick around this famous queen," Hawass wrote in National Geographic.

So far, he's had no luck.

Then again, no one has found the tomb of Alexander the Great, either.

Many ships, planes and people have disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle, a section of the Atlantic Ocean in a "triangle" marked by the points of Bermuda, Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Speculation runs wild on what caused the boats and aircraft to vanish.

Sound familiar? The disappearance of Flight 370 has nothing on the Bermuda Triangle.

Some even blame the triangle disasters on supernatural forces, including influences from lost Atlantis or another time-space dimension.

The U.S. government devotes a Web page to the Bermuda Triangle and rebuts fringe theories. U.S. officials cite hurricanes, sudden storms, the powerful Gulf Stream and shallow Caribbean waters as reasonable explanations for the lost vessels.

Life out there

Call them aliens. Call them extraterrestrials.

Call them what you want.

But let's face it: Don't we all wonder what's out there, especially when we launch spacecraft to another planet?

Among the organizations advancing this pursuit is the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe, named after the late American astronomer who championed exploration of the cosmos.
