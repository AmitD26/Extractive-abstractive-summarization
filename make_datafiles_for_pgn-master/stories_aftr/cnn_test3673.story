(CNN) -- It happens every four years, usually right around September.

As a partner at the Campbell Cohen firm, which specializes in immigration to Canada, Cohen says he has received these calls for decades. It sometimes makes him "feel like a therapist because they vent for a while, get this cathartic release."

Opinion: Where Obama, and America, go from here

This election cycle, he said, most of the calls "tended to be conservative or Romney supporters. There were not as many from the other side, so maybe they had kind of a premonition."

"That's always been the case: more extreme talk than actions," he said. "You can entertain any idea you want to, but there's a difference between having an idea and acting on an idea."

"But," Post added, "throw enough ugly ideas into a pot and something is going to boil over."

In August, Lubbock County, Texas, Judge Tom Head warned that the country could descend into civil war if Obama was re-elected and, as the county's emergency management coordinator, he considered whether he'd have to "call out the militia" if Obama ordered U.N. troops to quell the uprising.

He further called on them to "fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice," while proclaiming the country was now in "serious and unprecedented trouble...like never before." Trump has since deleted the revolution missive.

Post noted that Trump was at the forefront of the so-called "birther movement," which falsely claims Obama wasn't born in the United States, so he wasn't surprised to see Trump sound off, but "the intensity of that was rather shocking."

A university statement said the crowd reached 400 people at its pinnacle, and there were only two arrests for disorderly conduct. School Chancellor Dan Jones was quoted as saying Ole Miss "universally condemned" the racial epithets and uncivil language, and he regretted that a few students had tarnished the reputations of those classmates "who are more representative of our university creed."

Obama makes history again

It appeared to be an isolated incident.

"No unrest," he said. "Just a lot of disappointed people."

The staunchly conservative county voted more than seven to three for Romney, he said, so now the focus moves to strengthening the Republican Party and "carrying our message of self-reliance to the rest of the country."

"Republicans are pretty naturally a law-and-order-type people," he said. "I'm still satisfied America has this amazing, peaceful process of selecting government. No matter who wins, we still have our rights, our businesses, our schools, and life goes on. We'll get 'em next time."

And those souls who swear they're abandoning this land for fear of Obama turning tyrannical in his second term?

Yeah, not happening.

"I've had Americans tell me this: When your national anthem plays, the hair on their arms stands up, and that's not like most people in the world," he said. "Americans at the end of the day are just a very patriotic group, and it doesn't matter what side you're on."

Post said he hopes bipartisanship will take hold on Capitol Hill, but it won't be easy because each party is torn by conflicting ideals: catering to their bases and governing in the best interest of the people.

"It's hard to reach across the aisle and get slapped down, but that's what has to happen. There's a lot of wounds to heal," Post said.
