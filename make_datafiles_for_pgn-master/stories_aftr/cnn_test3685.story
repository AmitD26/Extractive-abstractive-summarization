Prosecutors filed charges last June. Messi has denied any wrongdoing, and last August he and his father paid $6.75 million in back taxes plus interest.

The complaint centers on alleged tax fraud during 2007, 2008 and 2009. Prosecutors contend Messi and his father, aiming to lower their Spanish tax bill, sought to manage the player's lucrative income from image rights through shell companies set up overseas.

Messi, 26, has a yearly salary from his club, FC Barcelona, of just over $20 million plus around $21 million in endorsements from sponsors including Adidas and PepsiCo.

"We have always fulfilled all our tax obligations, following the advice of our tax consultants, who will take care of clarifying this situation," Messi posted on his Facebook page last June.

Messi testified for about 30 minutes and his father, for about an hour, earlier and separately, said Gemma Linan, a reporter for CNN affiliate 8tv, who was outside the courthouse.

After the hearings, the lawyer for the Messis, Cristobal Martell, spoke briefly to reporters, promising total transparency and a willingness to collaborate and make sure taxes are paid, and adding that there had been no intent to defraud.

The prosecution spokesman, who by custom is not identified, said that last Wednesday, just two days before the hearing, Martell tried to reach an out-of-court settlement with prosecutors for the Messis.

Prosecutors proposed that both Messi and his father would plead guilty to tax evasion in the hearing, and would likely be fined about $10 million and receive a one-year sentence, which would not require time in prison because they have no prior convictions, the spokesman said.

But Martell said the Messis were opposed. He proposed that only the father would make such a plea, in exchange for prosecutors and the court relieving Leo Messi of any responsibility. Prosecutors would not accept that based on Spanish law, the spokesman said.

Messi, who arrived at Barcelona as a 13-year-old in 2000, has won six Spanish Primera Liga titles and three Champions League crowns and scored an unparalleled 86 goals for the club and his national team, Argentina, in 2012.
