Due to be released this fall, the new system will update lots of existing features and add some new ones. So, here's a first look at eight key features of iOS 8.

Health

Apple has been pushing fitness and health apps, such as the one associated with Nike's FuelBand. With Health, they're taking it a step further.

Basically, Health pulls together data from different health-related apps into one place, creating a comprehensive profile for the user. It also lets the users send health information to doctors at selected hospitals.

It's easy to see this being a prominent feature when (and if) the long-rumored iWatch arrives, which could include sensors that track the wearer's steps, heartbeat and other vital signs.

Even if it's not the expansive home-automation system that some rumors suggested, HomeKit is a step toward turning your smartphone into a remote control for the connected devices in your home. Apple has partnered with lots of third-party folks (but notably not Nest, founded by former Apple designer Tony Fadell and recently purchased by Google) on the app.

By pulling all of those apps' abilities together in one place, HomeKit will let users control their garage doors, locks, lights, cameras and thermostats with their phone. Obviously, some third-party hardware will be required -- at least for now.

The iPhone's famous voice assistant, Siri, only got a quick mention Monday. But she's learned a couple of new tricks.

'Do Not Disturb' in Messages

In Messages, "Do Not Disturb" will let you mute conversation threads that you're a part of without having to leave them entirely. So, if your buddies are nailing down that karaoke outing while you're at work, you can make them hush -- while leaving other threads active -- and come back to the chat later.

Google may be the tech giant most associated with predictive text, but Apple's giving it a go with QuickType.

The keyboard feature presumably will make sending messages quicker by guessing what you're writing before you finish writing it, letting you tap and move on to the next word. Phones on Android already have this. But Apple promises that QuickType will learn your language habits, including how you text in different message threads.

So for example, it may predict one word in a work-related thread ("Time for my next meeting"), another with your party-time buddy ("Time for my next beer") and a third in texts with your mom ("Time for my next visit").

Interactive Notifications

Family Sharing

The catch is you'll have to use the same credit card for all those purchases. It's Apple's way of preventing overly liberal interpretations of the word "family."

This new feature also will let relatives more easily share calendars, photos, reminders and the like.
