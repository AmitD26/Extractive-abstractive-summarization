(CNN) -- What the heck has happened to John McCain?

First he flip-flopped on immigration reform.

But faced with a primary challenge from a tea party Republican in 2010, McCain denied that he had ever supported a path to citizenship. McCain subsequently threw his support behind Arizona state legislation that ostensibly allows for racial profiling of Latinos and is considered one of the harshest anti-immigration laws in the nation.

In 2003, McCain was a key supporter of so-called "cap and trade" legislation that would create a market-based solution to limit pollution. During his 2008 presidential run, McCain boasted of his support for cap-and-trade measures. "We stand warned by serious and credible scientists across the world that time is short and the dangers are great," said McCain. "The most relevant question now is whether our own government is equal to the challenge." McCain, it appears, was not.

By 2009, McCain was calling such measures "cap and tax." By 2014, McCain was blasting Secretary of State John Kerry for even talking about climate change.

And now we have Bowe Bergdahl.

McCain claims his objection was based on the details of the five Taliban prisoners swapped for Bergdahl but as the Washington Post Fact Checker pointed out, the details around those five specific prisoners were widely known in February when McCain originally commented. In fact, the Washington Post ran a front-page story with details about the prisoners.

Moreover, these are not the only times McCain has wildly switched positions on fundamental issues. Suzy Khimm, then of Mother Jones magazine, produced a thorough list including other flip-flops as of August 2010. But it's somehow especially stunning to hear John McCain flip-flop on the issue of Bergdahl in particular.

In 1968, a year into his imprisonment and torture as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, McCain was offered early release â€” the North Vietnamese seeking to gain publicity points after McCain's admiral father was put in command of all U.S. forces in the region. The young John McCain refused. He would only agree to be released if every American taken prisoner before him was released as well. It was only then that McCain was subject to heinous and severe torture, including beatings every two hours.

It's important to remember that McCain was ultimately released by the North Vietnamese as part of winding down of the war. That's what happens when you end a war; you exchange prisoners â€” even the dangerous ones.

Certainly John McCain knows the immense suffering and brutality of being a prisoner of war. He also knows what happens when wars end.

In fact, I like to imagine that John McCain knows a lot of things including how ridiculous his repeated backtracking seems in light of his own self-proclaimed principled "maverick" identity.

But these radical shifts in position say less about McCain as a person and more about the political party to which he belongs, a party that was for immigration reform and for cap-and-trade regulations and for doing whatever it took to bring Bowe Berdahl home up until the moment that President Obama took the same side.

UPDATE: An earlier version incorrectly listed McCain as being awarded the Medal of Honor.

Sally Kohn wonders why Sen. John McCain gets away with his constant flip-flops

@highlight

He was first in favor of prisoner swap for Bergdahl, she says, then was against it

@highlight

She says McCain's flip-flops are nothing more than political opportunism, plain and simple

@highlight

But the real reasons may be an desperate and reactionary Republican party
