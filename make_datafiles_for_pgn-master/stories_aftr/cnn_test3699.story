CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Today's show is dedicated to Ms. Willard's world geography classes at Lumberport Middle School in Lumberport, West Virginia! Welcome everyone!

AZUZ: An overhaul of the rules for the country's banks. President Obama says that's what's needed to avoid another economic crisis. He made the statement during a speech on Wall Street yesterday. But some lawmakers and economic experts disagree with some of the president's proposals, like a federal agency that Mr. Obama says would be responsible for protecting consumers. Ben Bernanke, who heads up the country's central bank, says that's what his organization does, so a new agency isn't necessary.

The timing of the speech came on the one-year anniversary of the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history! President Obama says America's financial industry needs to learn from past mistakes to avoid future crises.

U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: One year ago, we saw in stark relief how markets can spin out of control, how a lack of common-sense rules can lead to excess and abuse, how close we can come to the brink. One year later, it is incumbent upon us to put in place those reforms that will prevent this kind of crisis from ever happening again, reflecting painful but important lessons that we've learned and that will help us move from a period of reckless irresponsibility, a period of crisis, to one of responsibility and prosperity.

H1N1 Vaccine

AZUZ: From regulation to inoculation, health officials say a vaccine for the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, could be ready in a few weeks. That's earlier than expected. More good news: Researchers say one shot should be enough; originally, they thought it would take two. Experts say certain groups, including students, should get the vaccine. It takes a little more than a week for it to take effect.

Ancient Discovery

AZUZ: And that's where archaeologists have made a religously significant discovery. Today, the Galilee region is known as a tourist spot with a lot of resorts. But a couple thousand years ago, it played a big role in two world religions. And now, scientists have uncovered a piece of that history. Here's Paula Hancocks...

PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: On the shores of the Sea of Galilee, a discovery that should excite both Jews and Christians. Israeli archeologists say they've found one of the world's oldest synagogues, from the time of Jesus and in the neighborhood of Jesus.

AVSHALOM-GORNI: We can see very nicely the curve of the menorah, which would presume exactly in the right temple, at the temple at this time.

HANCOCKS: Excavation is continuing, and already plans are underway to open the synagogue to the public.

HANCOCKS: Building plans for the hotel have obviously had to change, but this discovery could well attract far more visitors than a hotel ever could. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Jerusalem.

FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR, CNN NEWSROOM: Move-in day for college freshman Pressley Chakales to a place she never expected would bring so much happiness and harmony.

PRESSLEY CHAKALES, UGA FRESHMAN: I've been working all day getting my room together. But I like it, I'm excited

WHITFIELD: Also excited: her parents Peter and Ann.

WHITFIELD: Oh, we remember. We first met the Chakales last spring. College acceptance letters were coming in, along with the prospect of a full scholarship available to Georgia students with a 3.0 GPA or higher planning to attend an in-state school. But at the time, Pressley and her parents were not seeing eye to eye.

WHITFIELD: So, your heart tells you one thing, but the purse strings tell you another.

WHITFIELD: So, what are these conversations like with mom and dad when you all try to come to grips about a happy medium?

PRESSLEY CHAKALES: They can get heated.

WHITFIELD: That was last March. Now?

PRESSLEY CHAKALES: I ended up getting into UGA off the wait-list, and my decision immediately changed to back in-state, because I was going to UNC Wilmington, but I switched back to UGA to save an indescribable amount of money.

WHITFIELD: A huge relief for her parents. Even though they spent years saving for her higher education, the thought of unloading at least $25,000 a year for four years of out-of-state undergrad was stressful beyond words.

WHITFIELD: Staying in-state, able to benefit from that Georgia full academic scholarship cut their expenses by more than half. Out of pocket now: $10,000 a year for Pressley's housing, books and other fees. The benefits of their family decision: endless.

ANN CHAKALES: We will probably start prepping our son a little bit earlier.

WHITFIELD: In hopes that he, too, qualifies for the same kind of in-state help. Fredricka Whitfield, CNN, Atlanta.

KANYE WEST: I'm really happy for your, I'm gonna let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time!

AZUZ: The most talked-about moment from the MTV Video Music Awards was not part of the script: Kanye West interrupting Taylor Swift's acceptance speech to announce who he thought should have won. The backlash against West has been fast, and heated. This isn't the only recent outburst from people in the public eye. You might have heard about tennis star Serena Williams being docked a point for her outburst during the U.S. Open, and U.S. Representative Joe Wilson yelling out during President Obama's recent address to Congress on health care reform.
