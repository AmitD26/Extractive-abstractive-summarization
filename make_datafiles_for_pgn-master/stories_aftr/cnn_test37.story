HIV/AIDS rates in the district are "on par with Uganda and some parts of Kenya" where the disease has raged for years, says Shannon Hader, Washington's former HIV/AIDS administration director.

Three percent of Washingtonians live with HIV/AIDS, according to a study released by the district in 2009. The accepted threshold for a "generalized and severe epidemic," according to the study, is 1 percent.

Guy Jenkins was 17 when he was infected with the virus that causes AIDS. Now 28, the gay African-American man has become an advocate within his community, speaking to groups whenever possible. But he believes the best way to reach his peers is through faith-based organizations, to stop the stigma related to testing and having the disease.

"It's a religious thing, mainly a lot of the churches don't tend to back it [HIV/AIDS testing and education] and because they don't back it and [the church] is the backbone of the black community, we find ourselves hiding behind doors."

It's something Jenkins knows first-hand.

"For me, it took a long time to get over the stigma, get out of the closet, to stop hiding behind my status."

Goforth also believes faith-based initiatives would be helpful. His organization has worked to identify area churches where regular testing and counseling could occur.

He says the effort has yielded some positive results.

"I think in the last three or four years in this community, we slowed the freight train down and we now are looking to turn that freight train around."

Both men are hopeful that more federal dollars might help.

But more important, they agree the money must be carefully targeted to the communities hardest hit.

For Goforth, who tested HIV positive 18 years ago, the daily battle to reduce infections is more than just a job.

"I have a very personal stake in my career," he says.

"I sometimes say, I come to work to save myself every day."
