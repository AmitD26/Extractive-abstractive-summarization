Oh what a difference a few years can make.

Now Washington is the star of the hit ABC series "Scandal," and she's nominated for outstanding lead actress in a drama at Sunday's Primetime Emmy Awards. The last time an African-American woman was up for such an honor was when she was starting out. (Cicely Tyson was nominated for her work in "Sweet Justice" in 1995.)

Record accomplishments aside, it is undeniable Washington is having a moment. Not only has she seemingly been on the cover of every magazine lately, but the actress also managed to pull off a Hollywood coup by getting married without the world even knowing she was dating.

Despite positive reviews and glowing praise from her contemporaries, Washington had a career that was slow and steady at best. She finally began to break out when critics hailed her portrayal of Ray Charles' wife, Della Bea Robinson, opposite Jamie Foxx in the 2004 Oscar-nominated film "Ray." The pair teamed up again in 2012 for Quentin Tarantino's "Django Unchained."

"She knows every single person's name (on the show)," Rhimes recently told Vanity Fair. "She gave out the prizes in our little weight-loss competition that we had on set. And, more importantly -- and this is a thing I am really trying to learn from her -- I have never heard Kerry Washington complain. That sounds like a casual thing to toss off, but think about the fact that she works more hours than anybody. I literally never hear her complain. That is a very rare breed of person."

It is also rare how Washington is able to keep her personal life private while still appearing accessible to fans. "Scandal's" success -- and consequently her own -- has partly been attributed to the series' active social media presence. Cast members live tweet during every episode, and Washington is especially engaged with fans -- retweeting them and answering their questions.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the social media strategy paid off last season in the form of higher ratings and increased buzz. For Washington, it translated into the chance to compete with Claire Danes of "Homeland" and Robin Wright of "House of Cards" for television's most prestigious honor.

Washington has said she fully embraces the recognition, but for her, it has always been about the craft.

"I don't approach the work or the life of the work from the perspective of, like, what are voters gonna think," Washington told Entertainment Weekly after she was nominated. "Or, what are critics gonna think? I just can't. Once you try to please a specific perspective or audience, it gets in the way of the work. The work is telling the story, and that's what you have to do: Tell the story in the best way possible to serve the creative vision and to serve the story. You can never control how it's going to be received."
