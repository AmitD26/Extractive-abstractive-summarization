(CNN) -- Halle Berry's reason for returning to TV in CBS's "Extant" are simple: She goes "where the work is," as she told the network.

In the past, an Oscar winner trading in a movie script for something airing on a broadcast network might have signaled a dwindling career.

"Extant," created by Mickey Fisher and executive produced by Steven Spielberg, is set in the near future and stars Berry as Molly Woods, an astronaut who's returning home after a 13-month solo mission. As Molly tries to readjust to her terrestrial family -- which includes a husband (Goran Visnjic) and an android son (Pierce Gagnon) -- she's hit with the news that she's somehow pregnant. (In case you were wondering, Spielberg says he "read the script long before I knew about [2013's] 'Gravity' or had ever seen 'Gravity.' ")

Already picked up for 13 episodes, "Extant" sets itself up to ponder how Molly got pregnant if she was on a mission by herself, especially with a history of fertility issues.

After viewing the pilot episode, critics are cautiously optimistic. (Many, it seems, still have bitter feelings toward CBS for the bait-and-switch of "Under the Dome.")

"A movie star has descended to television -- network television no less -- and she is not putting on airs," says Slate's Willa Paskin. " 'Extant' ... tosses sci-fi films from '2001' to 'A.I.' to 'Sunshine' in a blender, and serves up a psychologically minded speculative smoothie, complete with impregnating aliens, emotional robots, and vast conspiracies. No one element of this show feels original, and yet I would totally watch more, even if just to peep at the sleek futuristic garbage cans again."

Variety too thought that "Extant" "feels a bit like a Steven Spielberg greatest (and not-so-greatest) hits album" but doesn't view that as "an indictment so much as a road map to this CBS summer drama. ... It's certainly an intriguing launch; but then again, so was 'Under the Dome' before that narratively ran into a brick wall."

HitFix's Alan Sepinwall found "a genuine sense of tension to the first episode," adding that "it feels like the characters live in a fully-realized science fiction world. ... Berry provides (pardon the pun) enough gravity to make 'Extant' feel like a genuine work of science fiction, rather than a soap opera dressed up in sci-fi drag, which happens too often on the broadcast networks. It's a good start, at least."

CBS's hour-long "Extant" premieres at 9 p.m. ET/PT today.
