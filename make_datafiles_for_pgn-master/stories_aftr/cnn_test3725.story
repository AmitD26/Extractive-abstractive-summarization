"You're not getting it. You just don't get it," said Dave Lorenz who was abused by a priest as a teen.

Earlier this week, legendary head football coach Joe Paterno was removed in the midst of a scandal involving sexual abuse allegations against a former defensive coordinator, Jerry Sandusky.

What started as an apparent celebration of Paterno turned into a riot in the Pennsylvania town of State College. The crowd tipped over a news van and decried the media in anger Wednesday night. They held signs in support of "JoePa" -- a nickname for Paterno.

Some said their frustration stemmed from the media's focus on Paterno, rather than the charges against Sandusky.

"The kids up there just don't understand what this does," he said.

Paterno has been under scrutiny because of his response to allegations brought to him in 2002 by a graduate assistant. The assistant allegedly said he witnessed Sandusky, now 67, having sex with a young boy in a shower at the campus football complex, according to a grand jury indictment.

Sandusky is accused of sexual offenses, child endangerment and "corruption of a minor" involving eight boys.

Many within the Penn State community condemned the crowd's actions. In the campus newspaper The Daily Collegian, an editorial read: "Wednesday night was an embarrassment for Penn State... The way students reacted set our university two steps back."

Kayla Garriott, a 22-year-old college student who was sexually abused as a child, said the open support for Paterno was disrespectful to survivors.

The rioters are "never going to be in those children's shoes. It's not about football. It's about eight children who are never going to get back their lives back. They're going to live with this the rest of their lives. They might not get over that."

The Penn State scandal prompted numerous calls from sexual abuse survivors, said Barbara Dorris, the outreach director at Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests.

"I have talked to people all over the country who have dealt with their abuse," she said. "This is bringing it all back. It's so upsetting. They were crying. They were angry."

It's a "horrible statement that a winning football team is more important than the safety of the children. It mirrors what happened in the (Catholic) church."

Jerry Needel, a Penn State alum who graduated in 1999, watched the news unfold and felt he had to do something.

He started a campaign to shift the attention to supporting victims of child abuse, by raising money for RAINN, which stands for Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.

In addition, some Penn State students are planning to dress in blue for their next football game to support the victims of child abuse worldwide.

Jennifer Marsh, the director of the National Sexual Assault Hotline said the news story is bringing awareness and facilitating a national discussion about abuse, a topic often cloaked in secrecy.

"The biggest takeaway we've seen is just the outpouring of support to victims and survivors."
