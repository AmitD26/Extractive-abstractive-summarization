Washington (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain called Monday for the United States to lead a military coalition to help the Syrian opposition rid the country of President Bashar al-Assad.

"The Syrian opposition needs to know that the United States stands with them and that we are willing to take risks to support them when they need it the most," the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. "Inaction denies us the opportunity to have influence with forces in Syria who will one day inherit the country, ceding that to foreign states that may not always share our values."

McCain took aim at what he said is the Obama administration's toothless policy of calling for al-Assad to step aside.

The Obama administration and much of the rest of the world have put their hopes of ending the 15 months of bloodshed on a peace plan put forth by U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy Kofi Annan. But that has failed to achieve results.

The Republican senator from Arizona accused the administration, "in its desperation," of now appearing to be placing its hopes on persuading the Russian government to push al-Assad from power. President Obama was meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday at the G-20 meeting in Los Cabos, Mexico.

Though some foreign military assistance appears to be reaching the opposition, it is not enough to be decisive, and may just prolong the crisis, which could prove detrimental, McCain said. "Nearly every Syrian I speak with tells me the same thing: the longer this conflict drags on, the more radicalized it becomes and the more it turns into an escalating civil war."

McCain said any military aid should not include U.S. ground forces, but should include military might from allies of the United States, such as European and Arab countries.
