(CNN) -- Alfred Matthew Yankovic has come a long way from the teen chopping up '70s disco hits for the Dr. Demento radio comedy hour.

Over the years, he's taught us everything from where to buy quilts at a discount price to what teen spirit smells like.

While he's sold more than 12 million albums, earned three Grammys and racked up four gold records, Yankovic may be at his artistic peak with the sublime new single, "Word Crimes." Yankovic has turned Robin Thicke's not so humble brag about his dangling participle into something that could follow in the grand tradition of "Schoolhouse Rock" and, he says, "ostensibly be part of a school curriculum."

"I've taken a song that people had a problem with because it was slightly misogynistic, and I made it into a song about grammar," Yankovic said in an interview with CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper" on Wednesday.

Yankovic molds Thicke's catchy, but borderline sexist, "Blurred Lines" into a linguistic piece de resistance, waxing grammatical about those who confuse irony and coincidence.

"I'm not alone. I'm not the only grammar nerd out there," Yankovic said about the song's success. "There's a lot of people who share my pain."

"Word Crimes" is the second of eight tracks Yankovic released on YouTube. The singer, rapper and musical virtuoso intends to release eight parodies in eight days to help promote his new record. But Yankovic politely deflects on whether he knows which tracks will connect with his audience.

Less concerned with the relatively rigid formula required to rhyme his way on to the bygone "Total Request Live," Yankovic said taking record and television executives out of the equation has given him more musical latitude.

"It does allow me to try things I wouldn't have tried before," he said. "Now, it's basically, 'What do I like? What do the fans like?'"
