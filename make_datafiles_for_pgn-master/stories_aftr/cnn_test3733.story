London (CNN) -- The reason for model Peaches Geldof's death is still not clear, with an autopsy turning up inconclusive results, UK police said Wednesday.

Geldof, the 25-year-old daughter of Irish musician and Live Aid organizer Bob Geldof and TV presenter Paula Yates, was found dead Monday at her home in Wrotham, Kent, southeast of London.

Geldof, who was married with two sons under the age of two, was only 11 years old when her own mother died of a drug overdose.

In a poignant column for Mother and Baby magazine, published with the blessing of her family a day after her death, Geldof had written of the huge change her "two fat little cherubs" had brought to her life.

"But it was becoming boring. I wanted an anchor -- I craved it. And, when I had two wailing, smiling, joyful little blobs of waddling pink flesh, they became my entire existence, and saved me from one of pure apathy."

The transition could be tough, she said, but it was worth it. "I had the perfect life -- two beautiful babies who loved me more than anything. It was, and is, bliss."

Her widower, rock musician Tom Cohen, said Monday he would bring up their sons, Astala and Phaedra, "with their mother in their hearts every day."

A host of celebrities also paid tribute. TV mogul Simon Cowell tweeted his condolences: "The few times I met Peaches she was a sweet, funny warm person. Much love to her family she has left behind."

CNN presenter Myleene Klass said: "The news of beautiful Peaches is utterly devastating, God bless her babies. RIP mama xxx."

Geldof was the second daughter of Yates, who rose to fame in the 1980s as presenter of music show "The Tube." She died from a heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41.
