Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey moved one step closer to prosecuting the senior commanders behind a military coup in 1980 when a Turkish court approved on Tuesday a prosecutor's indictment of retired army general and former president Kenan Evren, semi-official Anatolian Agency reported.

Ankara's 12th Heavy Crime Court also announced retired air force chief Tahsin Sahinkaya was included in the indictment.

According to Anatolian, the indictment suggests life imprisonment for Evren and Sahinkaya for allegedly committing "acts against the forces of the state."

Some Turkish media have drawn parallels to the landmark prosecution of Chile's once unassailable military dictator Augusto Pinochet.

Hugh Pope, co-author of "Turkey Unveiled," said the coup "brought Turkish politics back to the kindergarten."

"[Evren] somehow wanted to force the politicians to be less conflictual, but he did so by dumbing them down to the point that Turkey's political system is still recovering from it," he said. "Unfortunately the consequences of his actions ruined so many people's lives. One has to wonder how Turkey is going to deal with that."

Erdogan's government has also overseen the arrest and trial of dozens of other army generals accused of a much more recent military coup plot, which was never successfully carried out.

According to Anatolian Agency, authorities arrested retired general Hursit Tolon on Tuesday in connection to the more recent plot. And last week, authorities detained retired general Ilker Basbug, who commanded the Turkish armed forces until 2010.

Some critics have called the prosecutions a witch hunt, targeting political opponents of Erdogan's government.

Other argue it has been a vital process to bring the military under the control of elected civilian leaders. Since 1960, the once politically-dominant Turkish armed forces have overthrown four governments.

"Ending the belief of impunity is very, very important," said Congar of 'Taraf' newspaper, which has published many damning reports about the Turkish military in recent years. "It's a huge step, obviously very late. These generals are very old. But it's still symbolically very important for this country."
