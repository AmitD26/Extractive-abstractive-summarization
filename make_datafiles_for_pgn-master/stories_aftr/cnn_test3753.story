Brickell, in a statement sent to CNN by her lawyer, said she started it.

They held hands when appearing before a judge in the Norwalk Superior Court Monday.

"Edie and I are fine," Simon said. "We're going to see our son's baseball game this afternoon."

Simon and Brickell live in New Canaan, an affluent Connecticut community about an hour's train ride from Manhattan. The town is home to a long list of rich and famous.

Simon is half of the legendary duo of Simon and Garfunkel that, starting in the 1960s, had hits including "Bridge Over Troubled Water," "Mrs. Robinson," "The Sound of Silence" and "Scarborough Fair." His solo career has spanned four decades and produced hits including, "Still Crazy After All These Years," "Graceland" and "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover."

Brickell has one chart hit, titled "What I Am," with her 1980s rock group Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. She has also recorded with Simon during their 22 years of marriage.
