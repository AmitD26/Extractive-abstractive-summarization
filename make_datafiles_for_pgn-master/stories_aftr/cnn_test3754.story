(CNN) -- You've been in an accident. The police officer goes through the normal drill, asking for your license and registration.

Officers would be required to return the phone after thumbing through its history.

"A lot of your accidents are happening due to distracted driving," Fair Lawn Police Sgt. Brian Metzler told CNN affiliate News 12. The trick, he said, is proving it.

The legislation is designed to cut down on distracted driving. But it comes at a time when revelations that the government has been monitoring our phone calls and online activities have shaken our sense of privacy.

"The legislature cannot authorize searches unless there is probable cause, therefore the bill is likely susceptible to a constitutional challenge."

Distracted Driving Laws

The distraction of technology

In addition to taking a driver's eyes off the road and hands off the wheel, the devices can engage people's minds so that they're paying less attention to the task of driving, experts say.

The cost of distracted driving

An often-quoted study on distracted driving known as the "100 car study" was conducted in 2003 and 2004 -- before the introduction of Facebook (2004), Twitter (2006), the iPhone (2007), and iPhone apps (2008).

Since then, 11 states have banned talking on hand-held cellphones while driving, and 41 states have outlawed texting when operating a motor vehicle.

But police reports are not a reliable source of information for the cause of distracted driving accidents, said Anne McCartt of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The cause of accidents is frequently not reported, and there are very large differences across the states, McCartt said.

The best studies, she said, used phone records to determine if drivers were possibly distracted at the time of a crash, she said.

Information from a report by Mike M. Ahlers is included in this story.
