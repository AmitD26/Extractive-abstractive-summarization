Police Sgt. Major Wichien Klanprasert was responding to a robbery call when his motorcycle was hit by what a witness described as a black sports car at 5 a.m. on Monday, the Bangkok Police said.

"I'm so shocked and very sad. I am just stunned," said Ubol Thongsanin, one of Wichien's sisters, as she visited the scene of the crash on Tuesday.

"I want to tell the parents that they should teach their children to drive carefully," she said.

According to the police account, investigators followed the path of leaked oil from the crash scene to the home of Vorayud. Dozens of police surrounded the mansion before entering with a search warrant and discovering a badly damaged black Ferrari.

The front was wrecked and its air bags deployed, said Bangkok Police Maj. Gen. Parinya Jansuriya.

Vorayud was taken to a police station for questioning and the car was seized by investigators, he said. Vorayud admitted driving the car and hitting the motorcycle, but he claimed he was suddenly cut off by the bike, according to Police Maj. Gen. Aunuchi Lekbumrung.

The man who had claimed to have been driving the car was fined 6,000 baht, about $200, the Police Chief Kumronvit Thoopkrachang said.
