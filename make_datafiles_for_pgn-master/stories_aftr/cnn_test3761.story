Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- The family of a teenager shot to death last month by a neighborhood watch volunteer -- a case that has sparked national debate and concerns about racial profiling -- will address a Sanford, Florida, city meeting on Monday, officials said.

Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed February 26 as he walked back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford after a trip to a convenience store. Police say he was unarmed, carrying a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea; he was shot by George Zimmerman, who claims he was acting in self defense, according to authorities.

The city of Sanford appealed Sunday for "civility and calm" during the "City Commission/Town Hall Meeting for Trayvon Martin."

"All of us have a stake in this, not just black people," said the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, of Ebenezer, according to CNN affiliate WXIA. "We are Americans, and we expect the system to work."

In Sanford, a "prayer for peace" and a candlelight vigil will take place Sunday evening. Another candlelight vigil will take place at the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama.

The case has sparked a national debate over the Florida law and concerns about racial profiling. Martin was black and Zimmerman is white Hispanic.

The attorney for Martin's family, meanwhile, said bringing a federal hate crime charge against Zimmerman will be "a challenge, to put it lightly."

Family of Martin to pursue civil case

Daryl Parks told board members of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) on Saturday that prosecution on the state level stands a better chance.

"Most state laws tend to be better for the prosecution of state crimes. And that's why we see the federal authorities expressing, although gently, in their statements that they can only do so much if there's some type of race statements involved. The state officials don't have that problem," Parks said.

"I think the focus is not necessarily a federal arrest over a state arrest. We want an arrest, period. And I think that the state aspect of that is the one that's most feasible, most attainable in this matter."

Parks said there is evidence that the Twin Lakes homeowners' association told residents who saw suspicious activity to call Zimmerman if they could not contact the police, according to an NABJ statement.

The Martin family plans to pursue a civil case against the homeowners' association, Parks said.

Demonstrations have taken place nationwide over Martin's death.

"Our utmost concern is for the safety of our employees, specifically based on the potential turmoil that could arise from the recent announcement of a bounty for his capture," spokeswoman Brandie Young said in a statement.

It also eliminated a long-standing "duty to retreat" in the face of imminent harm, asserting that would-be crime victims have the right to "stand their ground" and "meet force with force" when attacked.

Noting that 23 states have some version of the "stand your ground" law on their books, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called Sunday for the Justice Department to investigate "whether these laws are creating more violence than they are preventing" and whether some deaths go unprosecuted "because the laws place unintended additional burdens on local police and prosecutors that encourage dismissals of otherwise problematic cases."

"These laws seem to be encouraging vigilantism by allowing individuals to use deadly force as a first resort," Schumer wrote in a Sunday letter to Attorney General Eric Holder.

Sonner says his client was injured that night and went to the hospital with a broken nose and a serious cut on the back of his head.

Sanford police said Zimmerman did not indicate a chase, telling them instead that "he had lost sight of Trayvon and was returning to his truck to meet the police officer when he says he was attacked by Trayvon," the police said in the letter posted by Bonaparte.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott has formed a task force to review the law in the wake of the shooting. Scott told CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday that he met with Martin's parents Thursday to "let them know that I appointed a new state attorney and introduced them to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents that are working on the case."
