Santa Monica, California (CNN) -- A new, high-definition Kindle with a lighting system and a bigger Kindle Fire tablet topped the list of gadgets rolled out by Amazon on Thursday at a splashy event in an aircraft hangar.

"We love to invent. We love to pioneer. We even like going down alleys that turn out to be blind alleys," CEO Jeff Bezos told reporters and other guests. "Every once in a while those blind alleys turn into broad avenues. And that turns out to be lots of fun."

Bezos predicted users will "leave the light on all the time" and said the device will have eight weeks of battery life, even with its light on.

It's slightly thinner than the Kindle Touch and, at 7.6 ounces, the same weight.

The original style, non-touchscreen Kindle also will remain available, with its price dropping to $69 for the ad-supported version.

The Fire HDs will have either a 7-inch or an 8.9-inch screen. The big one is nearly two inches bigger than the current Fire's 7-inch display and slightly smaller than the iPad's 9.7-inch screen.

The Fire HD, which will continue to run a modified version of Google's Android operating system, features dual stereo speakers with Dolby Digital Plus and two antennas, which Bezos said will lead to better connections.

It will feature new gaming tools, including an app that lets parents limit the amount of time their kids can spend playing. They'll have Bluetooth connectivity and an HDMI port.

The 7-inch Fire HD will cost $199 and the 8.9-inch version, with 16GB, will go for $299. The 7-inch ships September 14 and the 8.9-inch on November 20.

The updated Kindle Fire will sell for $159 and ship on September 14.

And as a parting note reminiscent of late Apple CEO Steve Jobs' "one more thing," Bezos announced that they'll be offering a 32GB version of the 8.9-inch Fire with 4G LTE connectivity.

That price is significantly lower than a 3G iPad with 32GB ($729), but its data plan, at an affordable $49 a year, only includes 250 MB of data per month.

Bezos has called the original Kindle Fire Amazon's most successful product launch and, in a press release last week, said it accounts for 22% of tablet sales in the United States.

CNNMoney: With iPad Mini on the way, does Kindle Fire 2 matter?

The 7-inch Kindle Fire debuted a year ago at $199. It wasÂ met with lukewarm reviews but was still a hit with consumers looking for an affordable alternative to the $499-and-up iPad.Â Early complaints focused on many small design issues, such as the lack of external volume buttons, no video output and a poorly placed power button. Performance was also a problem, with sluggish Web browsing and video playback speeds.Â 

While all tablets have differences in hardware design, performance and price, a bigger factor may turn out to be access to music, books, movies and television shows.
