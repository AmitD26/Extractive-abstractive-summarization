Adventurous readers who are looking for a break from the usual beach read should consider this alternately horrifying and humorous, imaginative and energetic novel. CNN recently spoke to Duncan by telephone from his London home about the new book. The following is an edited transcript:

CNN: Talulla is such a compelling character, was there a big difference between writing her voice and Jake?

CNN: How did you develop the werewolf mythology behind your story? Were there traditional elements you wanted to keep, change or explore further?

Duncan: I just kept the parts of the traditional mythology I liked, or that served my thematic purpose, and ditched whatever I didn't. Death by silver, I liked, so it was in. Ditto visceral antipathy to vampires. Some versions of the myth allow for the lycanthrope's voluntary metamorphosis -- but that's not as rich a moral quandary as being forced to change, whether you like it or not, every full moon.

CNN: Do you have a favorite werewolf story and why do you think they have appealed to readers for so long?

Duncan: I've never read a werewolf story in my life, but my favorite werewolf movie is, of course, "An American Werewolf in London." (Closely followed by the brilliantly mad "Dog Soldiers.") Myths of metamorphosis are as old as the human ability to tell stories, and survive because they express something fundamental to the psyche. In the case of werewolves, the fear of the beast within, and the desire to be liberated into it.

CNN: You've unleashed your writer's id in these novels. There's lots of sex and violence, definitely not for the faint of heart. Was it fun to write?

Duncan: For me writing a novel isn't fun, no matter how much sex and violence it contains. It's satisfying, yes, to get something right at the level of the sentence, and it's fun to have finished writing the thing. ... But the actual writing? No. It's agony, every day, an endless search for reasons to not start writing. I wish it were otherwise, but there you are.

CNN: What would you like readers to take away from "Talulla Rising"?

Duncan: I'm not reading much contemporary work at the moment (not until the third werewolf book's done, in fact), but I'm a couple of hundred pages into "Don Quixote" -- which is absolutely hilarious. That'll last me through summer. Especially if it's an English summer.

CNN: Without giving too much away, it feels like you've set things up quite nicely for a trilogy. Any hints you can give us about your next novel?

Duncan: Impossible without spoilers. But multiple narrators -- including a vampire -- and a myth of origin for werewolves. Sex, violence, jokes, philosophy, love, death. Business as usual.
