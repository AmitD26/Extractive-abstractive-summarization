London, England (CNN) -- Prince William's younger brother Prince Harry will be his best man when he marries Kate Middleton in London in April, Clarence House announced Monday. Middleton's sister Philippa will be her maid of honor.

William, who is second in line to the throne, is due to marry his long-time girlfriend April 29 at Westminster Abbey. Prince Harry is currently third in line of succession.

Royal protocol states that the groom should have a "supporter" rather than a Best Man and speculation was rife that Prince Harry would be named supporter, and another friend of Prince William announced as his best man.

Naming Harry best man is a break with protocol, and is being taken as an indication of William and Kate's more modern approach to their upcoming wedding, which is taking place at Westminster Abbey on April 29.

Harry will be organizing the Prince's "stag" or bachelor party. Meanwhile Philippa, or "Pippa," will be expected to pull together Kate's "hen" or bachelorette party.

Lady Windsor, is the daughter of the Earl and Countess of Wessex as well as being the Queen's granddaughter, while Armstrong-Jones, Prince William's second cousin, is the daughter of Viscount and Viscountess Linley.

William "Billy" Lowther-Pinkerton, 10, the son of Prince William's private secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, will be the other page boy.

Details regarding the Bridesmaid's dresses and Page Boys' uniforms will remain a secret until the day of the wedding, Clarence House said.

Notable royals who have been left off the list include the Prince's cousin, Zara Phillips, who also announced her own engagement last year.

Wedding Planner, Sarah Haywood, gives CNN the lowdown on they myriad of duties the the average best man and maid of honor are expected to perform.
