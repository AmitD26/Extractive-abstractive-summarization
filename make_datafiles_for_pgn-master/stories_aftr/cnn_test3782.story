In this important story involving arguably America's most treasured sport, who said what when? Who knew what when? And where is this all going?

Can you explain this from the beginning?

This timeline is a great place to start to learn how far back this elevator incident goes -- it happened early in the morning on February 15 -- and the twists and turns continued until this past Monday when TMZ published a bombshell surveillance tape that revealed what happened inside the elevator. Until Monday, Ray Rice's punishment was a two-game suspension, a fine and an agreement to attend a rehabilitation program that some legal experts say could have cleared him of a third-degree aggravated assault charge if he met certain requirements.

On September 8, TMZ published surveillance footage that showed Ray Rice punching Janay Palmer. She is now Janay Rice. The couple married a little more than a month after the February elevator incident.

What did the NFL commissioner say after TMZ published the video?

On September 9, Goodell talked to CBS. He said that no one in the NFL had seen the tape TMZ published showing what happened inside the elevator.

About that scene -- in which Rice is seen pulling his unconscious fiancÃ©e out of the elevator, face-down -- Goodell said, "It was ambiguous about what actually happened" inside the elevator.

CBS's Norah O'Donnell asked: "But what was ambiguous about her laying unconscious on the floor being dragged out by her feet?"

Goodell told CBS that the NFL had requested all materials related to the case from law enforcement but did not receive anything.

Reaction to Goodell's handling of the Rice case was severe. Some sports observers and current and former players blasted him for giving Rice too light a punishment with the two-game suspension, and others said they doubted Goodell was being truthful that he'd not seen the tape showing what happened inside the elevator. Several questioned if he had really pushed hard enough to get it.

CBS asked Goodell if he thought his job was on the line. He said no.

What is this about a news report contradicting Goodell's claims?

On Wednesday, the Associated Press, citing an unnamed law enforcement source, reported that the video showing the violence inside the elevator was actually given to the NFL five months ago.

The law enforcement official told the AP that in early April, he sent the video to an NFL executive. The official played a 12-second voicemail recorded April 9 from an NFL office number, the AP reported, in which a female voice confirmed that the video had been received. According to the AP, she expressed thanks and said, "You're right. It's terrible."

How is the former director of the FBI involved?

On Wednesday, the NFL said that Mueller, the FBI chief from 2001 to 2013, will have access to all NFL records.

"Many of us were dissatisfied with the original two-game suspension of Ray Rice," Mara said in a statement Wednesday.

Goodell "took responsibility for that in his August 28th memo to the owners when he stated, 'I didn't get it right. Simply put, we have to do better. And we will.' He then took appropriate steps to address this matter."

The NFL's policy on domestic violence "has been strengthened," he said, saying that the league has a "strong partnership with anti-domestic violence groups," and will "be a better league for it going forward."

"There is no place for domestic violence in our sport or in our society," he said, "and we are committed to doing our part to prevent such heinous acts going forward."

"#FireGoodell" and "ResignGoodell" are trending on Twitter Thursday. Some current and former NFL players blasted Goodell on social media.

The commissioner "should be held accountable for his lack of action just like Ray Rice has finally been held accountable for his actions," free agent and former New Orleans Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma tweeted Wednesday.

The National Organization for Women, a longtime advocacy organization for women's rights, dismissed Mueller's appointment as "just window dressing," and was leading its web site Thursday with #ResignGoodell.
