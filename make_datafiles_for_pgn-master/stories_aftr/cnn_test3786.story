(CNN) -- The toughest conditions she has ever played in. That's how one of tennis' biggest stars described this year's scorched Australian Open.

With temperatures in excess of 40 degrees, and after four days of players fainting, vomiting and tirelessly icing themselves to keep cool, Li Na was feeling hot and flustered.

The fourth seed, a runner-up at last year's Melbourne grand slam, was facing match point and a shock early exit at the hands of world No. 26 Lucie Safarova.

But the Czech sent a backhand five centimeters long of the baseline, letting Li back in to take a second-set tie break and then take advantage of the extreme heat contingency plan.

"After the second set, lucky thing we had the 10 minute break," China's Li told reporters after her 1-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-3 victory set up a fourth round match with Russia Ekaterina Makarova.

"I think five centimeters saved my tournament. If she hit it in, I think me and my whole team would be on our way to the airport now.

"There will be some players who complain and no-one is saying it is terribly comfortable to play out there, but, from a medical perspective, we know that man is well adapted to exercising in the heat. Whether it is humane or not is a whole other issue," Wood told the BBC.

In the men's draw, defending champion Novak Djokovic remained on course for his fourth Australian Open title in a row as he eased into the fourth round with a 6-3 6-3 7-5 victory over Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan.

"I feel better on the court as the tournament is progressing," Djokovic, who played under the cool conditions of the Rod Laver Arena's closed roof, told reporters.

"Of course, I played three matches in different conditions. The roof was closed and the temperature dropped by at least 10 degrees, and you could feel that. It affected the play, it was much slower."

Victory for the Serbian, who won his first grand slam in Melbourne in 2008, sets up a meeting with his old friend Fabio Fognini, after the Italian beat American Sam Querrey.

"I'm going to try to win against him regardless of whether he's a friend or not," Djokovic continued. "I have a real friendship with him for more than 10 years but once we get on court we're both professionals and we want to win."

Spanish third seed David Ferrer, Tomas Berdych, the Czech seventh seed, and South African Kevin Anderson also booked their places in the next round of the sizzling Australian Open.
