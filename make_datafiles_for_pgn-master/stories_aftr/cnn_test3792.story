"The Newsroom" returns for season two on Sunday, and according to Jeff Daniels, who plays crotchety TV news anchor Will McAvoy, the show has found its groove.

CNN: As an actor, what was interesting about playing Will this season?

Daniels: The most exciting thing for me was that I knew who he was, going in. When you go from movie to movie to movie, you're creating different characters every time, and you're discovering them each time. For all the actors (on "The Newsroom"), we made a lot of those discoveries on season one. We were winging it. Season one really was, for Aaron (Sorkin) on down, a first draft. We're a lot of really smart people who have done really successful things over the years, but we were still guessing. So season two really felt like I knew the guy. I owned him. It was a whole different way of walking into a scene and feeling like the character was very familiar.

CNN: Will this season center on any big newsworthy moments, like the 2012 presidential election?

CNN: It seems like fans of "The Newsroom" are really interested in knowing how closely your own views align with your character's. Is that something you feel the need to address?

Daniels: They are fascinated by that, aren't they? It seems really important that they know. I can see why they would want to know that. You know what's more important? What Will thinks. Let me put it this way: I'm doing some acting. I'll say that.

CNN: Are you familiar with the Will McAvoy Twitter account someone started?

CNN: There's a really notable balance on the show between the serious high stakes of the newsroom and humorous moments. Why is that important?

Daniels: It's like life, where people say these very funny things right before they do very serious stuff. Humor is what keeps us sane. It's very smart humor. Very fast humor. These people get each other's jokes. It's these human beings with weaknesses and senses of humor. That's what Aaron does well: He writes complete people with flaws. It's coming from these people that, to us as we're doing it, feel real.

CNN: Do you have any sense of whether the newsroom on the show is true to the feeling of an actual newsroom?

Daniels: We're not shooting a documentary. It's fictional. I imagine that on a breaking news day, our fictionalized version comes close. When you dramatize something and put cameras in front of it, you take out the boring parts. I have a feeling that it's probably relatively authentic, which is what we're going for.

CNN: Did you spend any time in a newsroom or with real reporters to prepare for the role of Will?

Daniels: No. It was frightening how little research I did for this. I did think about all those newsrooms I've been in over the years promoting movies. It's not the same as being there when there's breaking news, but it's certainly helpful. I felt like I had enough of an awareness of what was going on to make up the rest. That's where the joy of acting comes, the making up the rest. If you've researched something to the end of its life, it becomes math. And I'm not good at math. I really like the "what if" of it all.

CNN: On a less highbrow note, what's the status of the "Dumb and Dumber" sequel?

Daniels: Well, the drop in intelligence is more than a little frightening. To go from Will McAvoy's IQ to Harry Dunne's, which I believe is an IQ of eight. That's quite a drop. My fear is that if we do come back for a third season that there will be portions of Harry that creep into Will, and I don't think that serves "The Newsroom" well. I love that A to Z range, but you want people to see each character separately, not Will McAvoy with a stupid haircut.
