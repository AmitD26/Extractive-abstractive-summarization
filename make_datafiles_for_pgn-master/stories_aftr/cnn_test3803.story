(CNN) -- Ever since his blistering debut as an angry, disenfranchised ghetto kid in "La Haine", Vincent Cassel has gained a reputation for giving the kind of performances it's hard to ignore.

A huge star at home, Cassel has enjoyed critical success abroad with roles in films like "Eastern Promises", David Cronenburg's 2007 tale about the Russian mafia in London, and is one of only a handful of French male stars to get parts in Hollywood. He has enjoyed cameos in "Ocean's Twelve" and "Ocean's Thirteen" as well as voicing the character of Monsieur Hood in the "Shrek" cartoon.

That said he's yet to score a real Hollywood hit in his own right. The moment for that may not be far away, especially after his recent virtuoso turn in the French blockbuster "Mesrine".

France's most wanted criminal in the seventies, Mesrine is a controversial figure in his native land. A charismatic and psychotic criminal, he courted the press and was known for daring bank heists and prison breaks. He was eventually gunned down by police on the streets of Paris in 1979.

The two-part movie --released in the UK and the U.S. this month -- is the perfect showcase for Cassel's muscular brand of acting and pairs him up with the grand old master of French cinema, Gerard Depardieu, who plays the head of Mesrine's band of hoodlums in the film.

"He's not yet seen on a par with Depardieu," said Poirier. "Not being of a classic beauty, Cassel belongs to the "gueules cassées" (which literally means "broken faces") such as Jean-Paul Belmondo before him. It's French gallic charm with character."

Cassel's first movie role was in "La Haine" (or "Hate" in English) the 1995 indie hit about a group of youths living on a Paris housing estate. Directed by "Amelie" star Matthieu Kassovitz, the film stirred controversy because of its stark depiction of racial tensions.

The 42-year-old Parisian didn't rest on his laurels following "La Haine." He made a string of hard-hitting films, the most controversial of which by far was the 2002 movie "Irréversible." The film is told backwards and features an excruciating 10-minute rape scene in which Belluci, his wife, plays the victim.

In spite of the raw subject matter, the experience of filming with his wife on "Irréversible" is something Cassel clearly enjoyed since the two have appeared with each other in eight other movies. The golden couple of the Gallic movie scene have a daughter together but France's strict privacy laws mean they're afforded a degree of freedom not always permitted to their Hollywood counterparts.

"Mesrine: Killer Instinct" is in UK cinemas now. "Mesrine: Public Enemy No.1" is in UK cinemas 28 August
