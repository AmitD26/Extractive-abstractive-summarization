ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- When Atlanta police officers Bryan Ernest and Bernatt Collins get a burglary call, they know that the house they walk into will probably be stripped, right down to the materials inside the walls.

Calls to Atlanta, Georgia, police are increasing for vacant homes ransacked by burglars.

Drawing their guns, the officers approach an empty house and shout "Atlanta police!" before entering. It's a burglary call, and they have to expect the worst.

"This is all copper that they are taking out down the walls," Ernest said. "You can see where the outlets were, any bit of copper they take."

The Atlanta Police Department doesn't know how many homes have been hit. The police are not keeping records that differentiate between thieves who steal from occupied homes and those who rip out copper and appliances from vacant houses, many of them the result of the nation's foreclosure crisis.

Across the country, law enforcement officials report that more empty houses are being burglarized. Developers are unable to sell newly built homes, and landlords have trouble renting properties. Atlanta is one of the few police departments that has formed a special vacant home burglary team.

Wanda Vaughn and her mother, Vera, operate a contracting service. Banks and homeowners hire them to fix what's been broken and/or replace stolen items after a thief strikes. Sometimes they replace everything in a home and board it up to prevent more burglaries.

Wanda Vaughn has seen water heaters ripped out and dumped on hardwood floors and carpet. "This has to be torn out and replaced," she said while walking through a burglarized house in Atlanta. "The baseboards have to be torn out because of mold on all the carpet padding and subflooring."

Estimated damage: between $15,000 and $20,000 for only about $40 worth of copper.

"They took the stove, the refrigerator, the cabinets, everything, including the kitchen sink!" Vaughn said.

"The neighbors have been calling and saying they are hearing banging or seeing a vehicle that's parked at a house that's supposed to be vacant," Ernest said.

"In one house, I betcha I replaced the air conditioning condensers three times, and they kept coming back," he said.
