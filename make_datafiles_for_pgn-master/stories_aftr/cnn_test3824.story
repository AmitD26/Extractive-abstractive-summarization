(CNN) -- It's arguably the toughest job in sports.

"I did it because it was my job but I hated it," said Georges Laraque, one of the most successful hockey heavyweights in his 12-year NHL career. "I hated to fight. I hated the pressure. I hated to be called a goon, and an animal. I hated promoting violence."

It was the third death of a current or former National Hockey League enforcer this summer, an almost unfathomable statistical anomaly. There are 30 NHL teams, and not all of them employ a so-called "hired gun" these days, both to intimidate opposing players and keep them honest.

In August, 27-year-old Rick Rypien was found dead in his home in Crowsnest Pass, Alberta, Canada. No official cause has been announced, but Rypien had a history of depression and was on personal leave from the Vancouver Canucks for much of last season. He signed a contract with the Winnipeg Jets for the coming season.

He retired from the league last season and was trying to start a broadcasting career. He was chosen to participate in the coming season of "Battle of the Blades," a Canadian version of "Dancing With the Stars" on skates.

While few answers regarding Belak's death have emerged so far, Laraque provided some insight in describing the life of the hockey enforcer.

The worst part is not the fighting itself, he said, because the adrenaline kicks in and you don't feel the blows. Instead, what weighs heaviest is the constant pressure of knowing you will have to fight another enforcer such as Boogaard or Belak, game after game, according to Laraque.

"It's the night before, the day of the game, before it starts," he said. "It's the shivers that it gives you, the worry in the head and the brain. It's when you go to a movie and you can't watch it because you're thinking the next game about having to fight Derek Boogaard or someone like that. Or you don't feel well, but something happens and you have to go out there. ... It's that pressure that's nonstop that you live with."

For that reason, he said, enforcers past and present have "demons" they live with, and often turn to alcohol to deal with them.

To Daniel Alfredsson, the longtime captain of the Ottawa Senators, "it's an adjustment from the high-profile life you live to go back to everyday (life), I guess."

When former NHL enforcer Bob Probert died suddenly last year at age 45, researchers discovered he had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease. Probert, a legendary tough guy who had a history of alcohol and drug abuse, died of heart failure while on a family boat outing.

After Rypien's death last month, described by Canadian police as a "nonsuspicious sudden death," NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said he expected the program to be reviewed.

"Guys like me, if there's no fighting, we won't be making a living," he said. "As tough and as hard as it is, I'll always be defending that job."

Removing fighting from the game means denying opportunity for kids who dream of an NHL career, just as he did.

To realize his dream, he became an enforcer, explaining: "I did that because I knew that's what I had to do."
