(CNN) -- That was a pretty catchy, sing-songy version of Sir Mix-A-Lot's rap hit "Baby Got Back" in Thursday night's episode of "Glee." It was also very familiar to fans of indie singer-songwriter Jonathan Coulton.

A representative from 20th Century Fox Television told CNN Friday the network is not commenting on the matter.

"Glee has a reputation for being a show that celebrates the underdog," he said, before catching a plane to San Francisco. "It's the anti-bullying show. But this is a bullying way to approach this."

When it comes to copyright protection, however, there's a distinction between what might seem ethical and what is legal, lawyers say.

The rights to "Baby Got Back" belong with songwriter Anthony L. Ray, also known as Sir Mix-A-Lot, and his music publisher, Universal, who have apparently given proper licenses to Fox and "Glee," said Kevin Parks, a copyright attorney with the Leydig law firm in Chicago who does not represent any party involved in what Twitter users are calling #JoCoGleeGate.

Because Coulton's cover is derivative of the original work by Sir Mix-A-Lot, Coulton does not have a copyright claim against "Glee" for using the Coulton version, Parks said.

"If 'Glee' used parts of Coulton's actual recording, there would be a copyright claim for him to pursue," Parks said. "If not, Coulton's gripe may have moral weight, but not the force of law."

Fans of Coulton are not taking this lightly. Some are undertaking sophisticated audio analyses of both song versions, Coulton said. One called "alacrion" created a side-by-side comparison of the two songs on SoundCloud, demonstrating a remarkable resemblance. A fan named Paul Potts posted his own investigation into the similarities of the audio, which he called "pretty convincing."

"Hilariously, for me, it comes down to the sound of a duck quacking, which is a sound effect that was in my version, used as a bleep noise to cover up an expletive," Coulton said. "While it is very hard to hear, if I at home mess with the equalizer settings and some filters, I can actually hear that quack is in that mix."

Coulton said his lawyer is in touch with "the people at 'Glee.'"

Astronomer Phil Plait, author of Slate's "Bad Astronomy" column, tweeted with a link to another story about the debacle: "I'll admit it: I used to watch and enjoy Glee. Not any more. It's dead to me."

As of this writing, Sir Mix-a-Lot has not responded on his own Twitter account.
