(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius has been sending the family of Reeva Steenkamp, the girlfriend he fatally shot last year, a monthly payment since March 2013, a probation officer told his sentencing hearing in South Africa on Tuesday.

Probation officer and social worker Annette Vergeer told the court that Pistorius' legal team had told her about the payments, of 6,000 rand (about $540) a month, and she suggested that this showed remorse.

However, the Steenkamp family has rejected the money, the court heard.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said that Reeva's mother, June Steenkamp, had said she didn't want "blood money."

She told the court that neither of Reeva Steenkamp's parents would testify for the state at the hearing.

Vergeer argued that Pistorius should not be sent to prison, saying that as a double amputee, he would be vulnerable to gang rape -- particularly if his prosthetic legs were taken away.

Nel suggested that if Pistorius were allowed to keep his prosthetic legs while in prison, he'd be fine.

But Vergeer said that even if the court allowed Pistorius to keep the legs, there was no guarantee the order would be complied with.

Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide, the South African term for unintentionally, but unlawfully, killing a person. However, the judge cleared him of murder in Steenkamp's death and granted him bail pending the sentencing hearing.

'Broken man'

On Monday, a psychologist said Pistorius was a "broken man" after the death of his girlfriend, as his defense tried to convince a judge of his fragile emotional state.

Dr. Lore Hartzenberg said the Olympian described Steenkamp as the love of his life. He lost faith in himself and his abilities after the killing, she said.

But the prosecution dismissed her findings.

Sentence hard to predict

The judge also found Pistorius guilty of one weapons-related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant.
