(CNN) -- It's perhaps the unanswered questions after Brandon Goode's death that will haunt his parents the most.

"Words do not exist to express the measure of our sorrow and sadness," Ricke and Connie Goode said in a statement issued Wednesday to CNN affiliates WESH and Central Florida News 13. "Whether mental illness, substance abuse or something else, we are a family searching."

A five-year veteran with the Windermere Police Department, German had just returned to the force after being on "light-duty status" following surgery for an injury he suffered several months ago, Windermere Police Chief David Ogden said.

"All he wanted to do is be a cop," the chief said. "Officer German was a good cop. He was one of the finest police officers that we had in this agency."

Just two days before the shooting, the two teens ran away from home, leaving only letters behind for their families to find.

"To my loving parents, I am sorry for all the pain and misery I have brought you both, not just now but from these past few years as well," begins Brandon Goode's note, hand-written in neat, even letters.

"I don't want to go through life knowing because of my mistakes that I amounted to nothing and was there fore (sic) a disappointment. Don't take that as me putting the blame on you because that is the furthest thing from the truth. Both of you have been so amazing with your constant help and support through my life."

"I love you with all my heart," the letter reads. "Please don't be sad, this is what I want now, I get to die peacefully with the woman I love, the woman of my dreams, my fiancÃ© (yes we were engaged!). I miss you both so much already."

Later that day, Kissimmee police filed a warrant to charge Goode with resisting a law enforcement officer without violence and reckless driving.

The next day, German encountered the duo, stopped them and called for assistance, police say. The responding deputies found German "lying on the roadway, mortally wounded," the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. The deputies performed what is called a tactical rescue, using a patrol car to shield their fallen comrade.

Windermere, just west of Orlando, is known for its luxurious homes and close-knit community. German's death profoundly affected its residents.

"Windermere's heart is broken. I had the opportunity to spend some time with his family this morning, and one thing that his mother shared with me was how he loved to be an officer and how he loved working for Windermere," Mayor Gary Bruhn said in a news conference this week. "There's a real hole in our hearts right now."

A law enforcement processional and memorial service to remember German will be held Thursday.

Goode's parents acknowledged the tragedy in their statement.
