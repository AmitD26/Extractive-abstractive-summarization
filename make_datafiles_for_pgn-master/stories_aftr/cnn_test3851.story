Incheon, South Korea (CNN) -- The number of crew members charged is rising, and so is the anger that families feel.

When she ran out of jackets, she ran to the next floor to grab more.

When she was asked why she wasn't wearing a life jacket, Park said that crew members would be last and that she had to help others first, according to witness accounts to South Korean media.

Park's body now lies in a funeral home in the city of Incheon.

She is one of the more than 100 people dead; 215 remain missing.

The other day, a man with injuries to his head showed up to the funeral room where Park's memorial stands.

Her relatives say Park wanted to stay in college, but she felt responsible for supporting her family after her father passed away two years ago. So she dropped out and joined the ferry company in 2012. She was transferred to a bigger ship, the Sewol, about six months ago, because she had proved her capabilities, her relatives said.

The Sewol's sinking has left many appalled by the alleged actions of several members of the crew -- including the captain, who now faces a series of criminal charges for his role in last week's sinking.

"This is so unfair that our Jee Young had to die while the captain ran away," said her aunt, who declined to give her name. "Jee Young was so responsible, and the captain just ran away."

Over two-thirds of those on board were students on a high school field trip, many of whom remain missing.

Students grieve in hometown

Those who are not students, teachers or parents were not allowed on school grounds to allow those to grieve privately. Well-wishers milled outside the school gate, writing Post-it notes and signs with messages of hope and encouragement. "Brothers and sisters, please come back," one read.

"I just hope, maybe, they could be found alive," Ambe said, wiping her tears. "I'm hoping God will intervene."
