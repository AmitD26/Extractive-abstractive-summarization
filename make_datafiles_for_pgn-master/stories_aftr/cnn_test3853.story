She told reporters Tuesday in Atlanta that Jackson, once a rising Democratic star and son of the famous civil rights figure, wasn't trying to duck the media by sneaking into prison early.

He just figured the sooner he started his 30-month sentence, the sooner he would be able to get back to his family, Hoffler said.

Confusion arose when Hoffler's office issued a news release on Monday evening saying Jackson had reported to prison in North Carolina. The statement included his prisoner number. But prison officials said Jackson didn't become a prisoner until Tuesday morning.

She came back and took him to a hotel. They re-reported at 10 a.m.

The former Illinois congressman had been ordered to report to a federal prison camp or correctional institution no earlier than November 1.

"He didn't just show up early," she told reporters. "It was our understanding and it still is that he would have been able to report early -- and ultimately he did."

Jackson, 48, was sentenced in August to 30 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to misuse of $750,000 in campaign funds, money that went to personal expenses like vacations, fur coats and movie memorabilia.

Jackson has promised to pay $200,000 toward his $750,000 fraud judgment by November 1, according to court documents.

Filed last week, the documents show that Jackson has so far been unable to meet his financial obligations in the judgment and has promised to sell a property he owns in Washington in order to start paying it off.

The property Jackson is promising to sell is in Washington's costly Dupont Circle neighborhood. Jackson could also be forced to sell a property in Chicago.
