"That address had a multistory apartment building under construction, a total of seven floors in the wood-frame stage, approximately 1.3 million square feet of area space," Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas said.

It took 250 firefighters to get the massive blaze under control.

Gottesman described the inferno as scary sight. "It was incredibly nerve racking being so close, and I actually was expecting to have to evacuate my building."
