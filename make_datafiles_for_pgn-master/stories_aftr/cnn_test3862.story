David Kronmiller will focus on writing and filmmaking now that he doesn't have election polls to check.

"There is some sadness to that," said Kronmiller, a North Hollywood, California, resident who frequently contributes his views to iReport.com.

Although he supported President-elect Barack Obama since the primaries, the end of the presidential election means he won't have a race to follow anymore.

"I expect serious withdrawal, like, tonight or tomorrow," he said Wednesday.

After two intense years of campaign ups and downs for both major U.S. political parties, the nation has finally settled on a president. Although initially, Obama's victory brings celebrations for supporters, experts say the let-down that voters of each side may feel after the campaign is akin to postpartum depression.

By contrast, someone whose favored candidate lost may go through something similar to grieving: starting with numb disbelief and then moving to anger, sadness and, eventually, recognition of the need to move on, she said.

Mourning over a lost campaign resonates with Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor who worked on Al Gore's campaign in 2000. In a column for CNN.com, she recalled feeling lost and disillusioned at first, and had no idea what to do with her life.

"It hurts like hell," she wrote. "It is like death of someone close to you -- the difference is no corpse or casket to help bring closure, just more election analysis and pundits spewing out what you did wrong."

Even supporters of winning and losing candidates may feel a little off for two weeks or more, she said.

Anyone who feels depressed, hopeless or powerless after the election should realize that they as individuals have the ultimate control over their everyday lives, she said.

"The president is not going to find you a job; the president is not the one who manages your individual budgets," she said. "If people want changes, they can do that in their day-to-day lives. They don't need a candidate to do that."

Those who feel truly overwhelmed should see a psychologist who can help them think out loud, she said.

Aric Butler, a Pennsylvania State University student who supported Sen. John McCain, said he's not upset that Obama won but does feel a sense of withdrawal.

"We had all kind of accepted that Obama was going to win probably, for the last month for so, so it wasn't like we were really that hopeful going into the election, so we had come to grips with it, at least I had," he said. "I'm ready for everything to kind of go back to normal."

Others say the end of the election simply means they'll have more time to focus on other aspects of their life. Adam Sieff, a Columbia University student who supported Obama, said he'll now have more time to concentrate on schoolwork and maintains that his "withdrawal" will not be of postpartum proportions.

With more free time in the absence of campaign-following, Kronmiller said he's going to get focused on his own writing and filmmaking. iReport.com: 'Obama won -- now maybe we can move forward'
