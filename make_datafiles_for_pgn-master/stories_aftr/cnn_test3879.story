The home of Ghassan Abu Jamal has a beautiful view of Jabel Mukaber. It looks over a small valley with olive trees and grazing sheep.

It also stinks here, the distinctive raw sewage smell of what's known locally as "skunk water," sprayed by Israeli police as a riot-control measure. And when you walk down the road to the Abu Jamal family's East Jerusalem home, you tread on the metal remains of tear gas canisters.

On Tuesday Ghassan Abu Jamal and his cousin Uday walked into a synagogue in the West Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof. Armed with meat cleavers, they attacked the worshipers inside, hacking at them with the knives. They killed four rabbis and a police officer before they were shot dead at the scene.

"I never thought my son would do something like this," he tells us.

We ask Mohamed what he believes triggered the gruesome attack.

In the hours that followed the attack, the Abu Jamal family says 15 relatives were arrested, some badly beaten in the process. They show us photos of the family's ransacked homes and Ghassan's younger brother with a purple, swollen eye, blood streaming down his face.

But perhaps the hardest part: their bodies may never be returned to the family. Israel says no decision has been made, but authorities here fear a family funeral could become a flashpoint, drawing hundreds to hold the cousins up as heroes. Instead, police are considering burying the bodies in a municipal grave.

Between 2000 and 2005 more than 650 Palestinian homes were demolished, displacing roughly 4,000 people, according to Israeli rights organization B'Tselem. Critics say these policies are ineffective, even counter-productive. But Israel's government insists that destroying homes may save lives.

"It is an extraordinary step, one of the tools in our tool box," Mark Regev, the spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told CNN.

In the Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan, Enas Shalodi is one of those loved ones. Her son rammed his car into a crowd at a tram station, killing a woman and a 3-week-old baby. He was shot dead at the scene.

Shalodi leans out over the remains of her son's apartment wall to see Aharonovitch arrive. She watches without expression as riot police point up at the blown-out walls of the home.

The neighborhood bristles with tension. Riot police have blocked off the road and are checking residents' IDs and bags. Police with rifles, stationed on rooftops, keep a watchful eye.

Aharonovitch won't answer any of our questions and bodyguards block our approach. But he lets us film as he shakes hands with riot police and chats with them.

For a moment, he seems to veer towards some nearby residents. One of his entourage offers a "Salaamalaikum" as if to start a conversation with an older Palestinian resident leaning against a car. But the man turns his head and snubs the greeting.

Aharonovitch and his staff quickly turn and drive away to another part of the neighborhood.

Throughout the visit, Aharonovitch never speaks to Enas Shalodi. If he did, this is what he would hear: "Violence only creates more violence. Adding more pressure only creates a bigger explosion."
