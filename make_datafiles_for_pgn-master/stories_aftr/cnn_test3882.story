SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- One of three American hostages rescued last week from Colombian rebels said Monday he believes his former captors will retaliate against those still being held.

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) had held the three U.S. government contractors since February 2003, after their plane crashed in a remote region of the South American country.

On Monday, the Americans spoke publicly for the first time since their rescue. Gonsalves, who called his rescuers "heroes," said he fears for the hostages who remain with FARC.

"They're going to get up early tomorrow morning, they're going to put a heavy backpack on their backs, and they're going to be forced to march with [a] chain around their neck while a guerrilla with an automatic weapon is holding the other end of [the] chain like a dog," Gonsalves said.

Gonsalves blasted the leftist rebel group, calling them "terrorists" who pretended to be fighting for the poor of Colombia so they could engage in crimes such as drug trafficking and extortion.

"They are not a revolutionary group. They are terrorists -- terrorists with a capital T," said Gonsalves, a Florida resident and Connecticut native.

He said the majority of FARC forces were poor children or young adults tricked into thinking they were joining a just, revolutionary cause. Later, he said, some would regret their decision to join, but they knew they would be killed if they tried to leave.

"I've seen how their own guerillas commit suicide in a desperate attempt to escape the slavery that the FARC have condemned them to," Gonsalves said.

Howes, the first contractor to speak, said, "Five and a half years ago, we fell off the edge of the Earth."

He thanked Northrop Grumman -- the contractor that employed him, Gonsalves and Stansell -- for supporting his family. Like Gonsalves, he called the Colombian rescuers "heroes."

"We're doing well, but we cannot forget those we left behind in captivity," he said, adding later, "It's a pleasure to be in the USA."

When it was his turn to speak, Stansell walked up carrying his twin 5-year-old sons. He said his family's ongoing support is "the reason I'm alive."

"To Gov. Crist of the great state of Florida: Sir, I don't have a driver's license. How am I going to get home?" Stansell said.

The contractors thanked the news media for covering their story but declined to take questions.

From the day of their rescue until Monday, the Americans had been kept from the news media so they could undergo a reintegration process that included medical tests.

Monday's statements were part of a "yellow-ribbon ceremony" that was intended to mark the contractors' success in that process and prepare them to "attempt a normal life," said Maj. Gen. Keith Huber.

Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems President James Pitts said the company's crisis team is prepared to assist the men as they adjust to their lives as free men.

FARC, which has been fighting the Colombian government and other paramilitary groups for decades, defends the taking of captives as a legitimate act of war.
