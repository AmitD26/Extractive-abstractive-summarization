Prosecutor Jim Flaiz, upon learning Ohio school shooter T.J. Lane was going to make a statement in court Tuesday, told relatives of his victims to be prepared for something inflammatory.

Lane's own lawyer told the court he urged his client not to make the type of statement that the attorney expected to be delivered.

But no one could have fully foreseen the actions and words of Lane, who entered the courtroom and removed his blue button-down shirt while the judge and those in attendance took their seats.

Lane, now 18, revealed a white T-shirt with the word "killer" written on it.

Given the opportunity to speak a few minutes later, Lane made an obscene gesture at the victims' families and spoke to them briefly, using explicit language.

"What he did was beyond anything I could envision seeing in a courtroom," Flaiz told CNN a few hours after a judge ordered Lane to spend the rest of his life in prison without parole. "I was shocked and disgusted at how the defendant conducted himself."

Lane smiled and smirked during much of the hearing, laughing when Flaiz described him as an "evil person."

Lane pleaded guilty last month to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and weapons-related charges.

The mother of a wounded student now confined to a wheelchair looked directly at Lane as she told him he was fortunate so many officers were in the small courtroom.

Walczak said she has watched her son, Nick, suffer daily in the year since he was shot in the school cafeteria and in the hallway when he was pursued by Lane.

"You are evil. I will have to eventually forgive, otherwise you will haunt me," she told Lane.

Demetrius Hewlin, 16, died from his wounds.

His brother, Philip Carter, read a statement in court on behalf of mother Phyllis Ferguson.

"In our humanity, we still cannot understand why his life was taken in such a violent manner," said Carter.

Authorities allege that Lane walked up to a table in the Chardon High School cafeteria and started firing.

When the violence ended, six students had been shot, and in the following days, three died: Daniel Parmertor, 16; Hewlin; and Russell King Jr., 17.

Lake Academy describes itself as a school for "at-risk" students who are "reluctant learners" struggling with problems such as substance abuse and mental health issues.

After the shooting, an assistant football coach chased Lane out of Chardon High, and police arrested him nearby a short time later.

Tuesday, she looked at Lane and called him a "weak, pathetic vile coward."

Before he sentenced Lane to consecutive sentences of life without parole and additional sentences totaling 37 years, Fuhry said the former student showed no remorse, feigned mental illness and seemed determined to make "front-page news."

After the sentencing, defense attorney Friedman said Lane's comment to the families was a "very difficult statement to hear."

"Many families were damaged that day. Our family was, too," she said.

While the judge indicated Tuesday there was no known motive for the attacks, Flaiz said his office has a theory it would have presented if the case had gone to trial. He declined to elaborate, saying he will meet with victims' family members in the next week.

"I got a sense from the families they wanted to hear why he did it and they wanted to hear remorse," Flaiz said.
