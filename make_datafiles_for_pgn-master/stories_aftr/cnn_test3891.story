The Spanish champions took a first half lead after Real's goalkeeper Iker Casillas fumbled Tiago's shot into his own net.

Although there was little Casillias could do about Saul Niguez's stunning overhead kick that gave Atletico a 2-0 halftime lead.

But Atletico pushed on in the second half with goals from Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic sealing a historic derby day victory. Atletico are now unbeaten against Real in six matches.

"It is easy to analyze this game because Atletico were better in every facet of the game: they fought more, had more quality on the ball, had better organization, everything," Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told AFP after the match, calling it  "the worst game we have played since I have been coach."

Ronaldo unhappy

"Real Madrid cannot lose 4-0 against anyone," said Ronaldo.

"I always insist that the players are the most important people," he said.

"Today their capacity to understand what we needed and execute it was fantastic."

The victory has revived Atletico's flagging title aspirations. They sit in third, with Real's lead at the top cut to seven points.

Barcelona, in second place and four points behind Real, will hope to take advantage Sunday when they play Athletic Bilbao
