A teenager in India, who had more than 200 "teeth" growing in his mouth due to a benign dental tumor, has had them removed.

Ashik Gavai, a 17-year-old student from Buldhana, underwent the six-hour operation, which involved four doctors at Mumbai's J.J. Hospital on July 21.

"It is very common for a person to have a (small) number of abnormal teeth, but this many is very rare," said Dr. Sunanda Dhiware, head of the Department of Dentistry at J.J. Hospital. She adds that she knows of cases where 40 to 50 teeth were removed.

Gavai's normal teeth are to remain in his mouth, although the doctors did help to remove a wisdom tooth.

The teen is currently recovering in the hospital and has been put on a liquid diet of mainly coconut water and milk.

Gavai's doctors said the denticles likely started to form when the patient was six years old, but Gavai did not notice the abnormal teeth until a month ago, when his mouth began to swell.

Doctors say denticles are likely to grow again in Gavai's mouth, but probably not in such a large number.
