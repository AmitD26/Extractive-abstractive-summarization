(CNN) -- Three days ago, I decided to write an open letter to black protesters because I couldn't stay silent any longer.

I wrote about how proud I am to see young black men and women mobilize and rally for a cause but that too many in their movement overgeneralize and paint all law enforcement as corrupt. I explained how, contrary to what is often portrayed, the vast majority of cops aspire to be peacekeepers and that our good work often goes unnoticed. Finally, I offered what I believe could be achievable solutions to improve the relationship between law enforcement and the communities of color we serve.

I wrote, referring to the protesters:

"Contrary to what many believe, we do not hope to have violent run-ins. It is actually what I dread the most."

In the piece, I decided not to give my full name. I didn't know what type of reaction or backlash to expect. For me, submitting this was not without risk. I feared being ostracized in the profession I chose, especially by the community I was born into and love.

One thing that was abundantly clear from reading the reactions was how much television and movies have overtaken reality. There was an all too common perception that within every agency, there is a rogue, a power-hungry officer who would violate any policy in his attempt to destroy the black community.

I was pleasantly surprised by how many of the readers welcomed this encouragement. These are some of the voices from our community that the media often fails to represent.

"As an African American teacher in the American public school system, I can identify with his words. I know what it is like to do a thankless job and to be misunderstood and undervalued both when my professional uniform is on and off. A huge shift would come if people of color decided to take jobs in law enforcement and teaching."

"Bro, I was proud that a black man and officer spoke up about it. It needed to be said. It was the truth of how African Americans act and respond in these situations."

But nothing was more gratifying than to hear the words of encouragement I received from fellow black officers representing various police departments throughout the country. They were relieved that someone had given them a voice. To hear their appreciation was emotionally rewarding.
