ISIS control just a few marginal fields in Iraq's north, but they are enough to fund the terrorist group's self-sufficiency.

This could fetch them more than $730 million a year, enough to sustain the operation beyond Iraq.

ISIS have been battling over Baiji and the refinery is still under siege. However, if ISIS succeed in capturing it, the refinery would be very difficult to operate without capable and technical staff.

What do ISIS do with the oil they get?

ISIS smuggle the crude oil and trade it for cash and refined products, at a reduced price. They also have their own small and rudimentary refineries in Syria.

Refined oil is returned to ISIS for selling locally, in Iraq and Syria. ISIS also use the oil in their own warfare.

Turkey has turned a blind eye to this and may continue to do so until they come under pressure from the West to close down oil black markets in the country's south.

ISIS' oil will remain limited to these black markets, and the group will have no chance to establish a sophisticated pipeline network. Fixed distribution networks are complex, require investment and can become targets by the Iraqi Army and Kurdish Peshmerga.

What is ISIS' ultimate aim and how does oil wealth play into it?

At present, ISIS are trying to establish a self-sufficient state and a capital in what is known as the "Sunni triangle" (west and north Iraq), and oil production will be part of this.

ISIS declared its Caliphate by turning Iraq and Syria into a hub to attract extremists. They are aiming to take over the Arabian Peninsula as their epicenter to launch attacks globally.

If this happens, they will be in control of a region that holds 60% of world's conventional energy reserves and produces 40% of global oil and gas production.

And the only way to do it is by attracting the masses of jihadists and extremists from all over the world to eventually outnumber the locals, which will endanger global security and economies.

In the short to mid-term, the impact will be minimal as Iraq's south is its dominant producer.

However, the instability created by Iraq effectively being broken up would have a ripple impact, in terms of hindering investment prospect in the country.

Terrorist group ISIS controls some oil fields in North Iraq, which helps fund its activities

@highlight

The group is using smuggling routes to get crude into nearby countries, and refine it

@highlight

The refined oil is then sold locally and used to fund ISIS' warfare and raise money

@highlight

The impact on global markets has so far been limited as ISIS is not in southern Iraq
