Dr. Rick Sacra, who entered The Nebraska Medical Center three weeks ago with Ebola, was released Thursday.

"The CDC has declared me safe and free of the virus," Sacra said at a news conference. "Thank God, I love you all!"

"I did say, wow, Nebraska? Who made that decision?" Sacra joked. "Once I heard about (the biocontainment unit) I was like cool, I've never been to Nebraska."

Sacra locked himself in his room for three days when he first came down with a fever in Liberia on August 29. A mobile CDC lab confirmed he had the disease on the third day, and by the sixth he was flying home to the United States.

"I never felt like I was not going to make it," he said. "The care was so excellent, so speedy, so prompt, that I'm just thanking God for that."

Sacra says he is now feeling good, though he's still very weak. He was up to five minutes on a stationary bike he had in his hospital room before being released, but even that tired him out.

When Sacra arrived in Monrovia, that's exactly what he found. His wife, Debbie, has said there wasn't a single pair of latex gloves to buy in the entire city. Without protective equipment, medical clinics shut down. She says Sacra drove from hardware store to hardware store, looking for boots to protect his staff.

When he was finally able to open the clinic, for some it was too late. She says dozens of pregnant women who needed Cesarean sections turned up at the clinic after having failed to find help anywhere else in the city.

By the time these women arrived at Sacra's clinic "only the mothers' lives could be saved," Debbie Sacra said.

He and his wife will return home soon, where Sacra said he hopes to take his dog for a long walk. He knows his recovery will move slowly, as Brantly told him to "be patient." But he is not ruling out an eventual return to Liberia, the country he called his second home.
