"Working relations, participating in debates and discussion and exchanging papers, sending information and requesting information, and organizing visits and so on and so on, this is all suspended," Yigal Palmor said about the decision by senior management of the Foreign Ministry.

Palmor said the Israelis were discussing possible punitive measures against the Palestinians.

But Mohamad Shtayeh, senior Palestinian negotiator, dismissed the uproar and the threat.  "We know Israel is not in a position to take any measures against the Palestinian Authority because the Palestinian Authority is taking peaceful measures to protect its land and its people and this is something very legitimate and legal under international law," he said.

In a statement communicated by the media adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister berated the council as "hypocritical" and said it "ought to be ashamed of itself."

"It's just going to distract efforts to help parties resolve the issue directly, which is what has to happen here, and it takes up time and limited resources that the council ought to be spending on other issues," she said.
