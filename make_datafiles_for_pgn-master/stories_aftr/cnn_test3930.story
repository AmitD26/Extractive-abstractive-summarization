In a decision many might consider a blow to freedom of dissent in Egypt, one of the nation's most popular comedians, Bassem Youssef, announced on Monday his political satirical show will no longer air on Egyptian TV.

Youssef didn't offer a detailed explanation for his decision but suggested outside pressure and a fear for his safety were factors.

"I'm tired of struggling and worrying about my safety and that of my family," Youssuf said at a news conference inside a Cairo theater where he performed his weekly show.

Youssef shot to fame during Egypt's 2011 revolution when he mocked former Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak on his homemade political satire show -- shot in his laundry room and posted on YouTube.

His show "El Barnameg" -- "The Program" in Arabic -- drew more than 5 million viewers in three months.

By then, Youssef had gained worldwide recognition and was regularly compared to American political comedian Jon Stewart.

In April 2013, Time magazine named Youssef one of its 100 Most Influential Men in the World.

Several months later, Egyptian broadcaster CBC pulled the plug on Youssef when he poked fun at the almost cult-like adoration of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi -- the former Army chief who is now Egypt's President- elect.

But the show never returned to air as scheduled on May 30.
