"The public conversation is what he has been saying to us. He is honestly struggling with this decision," says a source familiar with the process, who argues it is "real," unlike some other GOP contenders who have decided to run, but won't say so. "He's doing this in a thoughtful way, and he hasn't made up his mind."

And while Bush, as a potential presidential candidate, if often critiqued as someone out of touch with his own party, another source claims that consideration is not a part of the Bush equation. "He doesn't worry about whether he's in tune with his party," this source says. "He knows what he believes." Indeed, adds another source, "he would fully expect and welcome a fight."

In fact, in his recent appearance before a Wall Street Journal CEO Council event, Bush mused that the GOP nominee needs to be willing to "lose the primary to win the general (election) without violating your principles."

Sources also say that while Bush has said he will decide in "short order" — perhaps sometime early in the New Year — a decision will likely not come in a major announcement.

Instead, one source says, "he could send some signals." In campaign parlance, that could mean the hiring of staff, forming an exploratory committee or formally soliciting money. Or simply say he's leaning towards a run or against it.

While top Bush advisers have been gathering data on what a run would entail, no commitments have been made or asked of potential staff or supporters, one source says. Rather, the conversations have been "if he decides to run would you talk further with us," this source says.

It's also clear that Bush is weighing the strain of daily campaign in a 24/7 media cycle in which everything he says will be relentlessly scrutinized.

In his appearance before the WSJ conference, he made several telling asides about being "fact-checked" as if to underscore the media spotlight — and fishbowl life — that accompanies a presidential candidacy.
