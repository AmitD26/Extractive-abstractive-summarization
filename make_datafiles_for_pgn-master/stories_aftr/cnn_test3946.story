But this time was different.

The sound -- what the lead investigator described as an "unusual noise" -- gave away Tuesday morning that something was amiss. What followed immediately afterward proved it, as a news helicopter tumbled to the ground and burst into flames, with those flames spreading to several parked cars in its path.

The two people aboard the helicopter died in the crash, and another person who'd been in one of the three vehicles that caught fire was critically burned, officials said.

The incident rattled a vibrant part of the Emerald City, falling a few feet from the Space Needle and near the Experience Music Project, Children's Museum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation offices, a quarter-mile away.

"We want to understand what actually happened, so we can understand what we can do in the future to prevent this from happening," Mayor Ed Murray said.

Man leaves car 'in flames,' bleeding

The 2003 Eurocopter AS350 was owned and operated by Helicopters Inc., a company that specializes in providing news-gathering copters. While KING indicated on its website that it sometimes made use of the helicopter, it was being leased at the time by CNN affiliate KOMO.

"A witness described as the helicopter lifted off from the building and began to rotate counterclockwise and subsequently crashed," he said.

Video showed what was left of the helicopter immersed in flames, as well as a line of fire in the street that engulfed several vehicles.

The injured man -- in his late 30s -- was taken to Harborview Medical Center in critical condition, with burns over 50% of his body, fire department spokesman Kyle Moore said.

Gregg said the man may have helped reduce the severity of his injuries by rolling on the grass, extinguishing the flames.

Media mourn loss of their own

Strothman had earned 14 Emmy Awards during his career; his son works as a photographer for the station.

"He was a guy who really knew how his pictures could tell a million words," KOMO news anchor Dan Lewis said of Strothman, who also worked for the helicopter leasing company that was operating the aircraft. "... He was such a gentleman, a true gentleman."

Pfitzner too was a familiar face at the station. "He always had a smile on his face," said anchor and reporter Molly Shen. "He loved what he did, loved to be able to fly and be up there above the city and see things from a perspective that most of us don't get to see."

Seattle's mayor, Murray, met Tuesday with Strothman's family, having known the father and son.

'Just a part of the tail and burnt-out metal'

Arriving firefighters found lines of blazing fuel in the street and thick, black smoke covering the area, with "wreckage strewn across the lawn along with wreckage across the street," said Moore, the fire department spokesman.

The first responders' prompt and "pretty outstanding" actions, as Murray described them, helped prevent a horrific situation from becoming worse.

Ten tons of sand were dumped on the street to absorb the helicopter's fuel, with vacuum trucks later heading to clean up the site, said the mayor.

The Space Needle closed due to the crash, as did the city's monorail and parts of streets in the area.

The helicopter did not appear to any have struck any nearby buildings before its fiery end.

The president of Helicopters Inc., Stephen Lieber, issued a statement offering his company's condolences.

"We mourn their loss and suffering and our thoughts and prayers are with them," he said. "We will cooperate fully and completely with the National Transportation Safety Board and provide to it whatever information it wants in order to assist it in its work in determining what happened."
