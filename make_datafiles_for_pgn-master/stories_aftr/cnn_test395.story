(CNN) -- Donna Summer died of lung cancer, but the singer wasn't a smoker, and the cancer wasn't related to smoking, her family's representative said Friday.

Summer's family issued the announcement in the wake of how "various reports currently surfacing about the cause of Ms. Summer's death are not accurate," representative Brian Edward said.

Five-time Grammy winner Summer, 63, known as the "queen of disco" during the 1970s, died Thursday at age 63.

Summer died surrounded by her family in Florida.

Said her family in a statement Thursday: "Early this morning, we lost Donna Summer Sudano, a woman of many gifts, the greatest being her faith. While we grieve her passing, we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy."

Summer later recalled that the church performance left worshipers in tears.

While she is iconic in the disco genre, her Grammy wins were also in the R&B, rock, inspirational and dance categories.

"Her talent was a true gift to the music industry," said Neil Portnow, president and CEO of the Recording Academy.

At the height of her career, she and Casablanca Records created a sex symbol persona for her, and in an October 1977 cover story for Ebony, she remarked about her other nicknames: Queen of Love and Symbol of Eros.

"I can sing songs like 'Love to Love You, Baby,' but I can also sing ballads, light opera, things from musical comedies, church hymns -- all kinds of things. Plus I can write, act and think."

"Yes, it was a big complex and the image was sort of created around me," Summer said. "I was sort of there, but not consciously there. And I didn't have anybody sort of on my side at that point, fighting for me, except for me, being in the middle. And then people would say, you know, 'Lay down here and do this.' And you know, whatever," Summer said.

Her big break came when she was a teenager and auditioned in New York for a European version of "Hair." She landed a role and went to Europe.

When she achieved success by her mid-20s, she wasn't able to handle it well.

"It was tough," Summer said. "I think success is always a surprise, you know."

She lived in fear during that relationship, she said.

"Thank God this person was from Europe, so they were deported. And then I was able to sort of be free, but I was afraid for years," she said.

Summer rose to fame the mid-1970s, thanks to "Love to Love You Baby." The song, with Summer's whispered vocals and orgasmic groans supported by heavily synthesized backing tracks, fueled the decade's disco mania and hit No. 2 in 1976.

But with her 1979 album "Bad Girls," Summer broke out of the disco mold as the genre, stimulated by the success of the Bee Gees' "Saturday Night Fever" soundtrack, was feeling a backlash. "Bad Girls" demonstrated Summer's vocal and stylistic range and produced two No. 1 hits, "Hot Stuff" and "Bad Girls," as well as a Top 10 ballad, "Dim All the Lights."

However, Summer had some trouble adjusting to the changing times. Her next album, "The Wanderer," went for more of a rock feel. It produced a Top 10 hit in the title track but fared relatively poorly on the charts -- especially disappointing after the success of "Bad Girls," a double album that spent five weeks at No. 1.
