An imposing ancient floor mosaic depicting a man driving a chariot drawn by horses and led by the Greek messenger god Hermes is the latest in a series of remarkable finds archaeologists have unearthed in the largest ancient tomb found in Greece, at Amphipolis in the country's north.

A visit to the site by Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, who has described it as very important, has increased local certainty about the significance of the tomb. Despite what historians say, there are many who argue that only Alexander could be buried in such opulence.

There is such a wealth of heritage in Greece, often referred to as "the cradle of civilization," that there is no denying that antiquity remains one of its strongest cards, and with tourism being its second largest moneymaker after shipping, the country is keen to promote it further.

Only days ago at a presentation at the Archaeological Museum of Greece's second city, Thessaloniki, a team of Greek experts  confirmed that bones found in a royal tomb at Vergina, also close to Amphipolis, are those of the Macedonian King Philip II, Alexander the Great's father.

As Greece looks to the past to move forward at a time of crisis, it is also preparing to bring back to the limelight a cultural cause celebre, that of the Parthenon marbles housed at the British Museum in London. Greece says they were removed illegally and is asking for their repatriation.

Three prominent lawyers have arrived in Greece for talks with the government to explore the legal route for the marbles' return. And there are few people who are likely to attract more attention than the youngest of the three, 36-year-old Amal Alamuddin, who recently became Mrs. George Clooney after marrying the Hollywood star in Venice.

The Oscar-winning actor took the audience by surprise when he called on Britain to return the marbles to Greece in February during a news conference for his film "The Monuments Men," which deals with the recovery of artworks stolen by the Nazis. Responding to a question by a Greek reporter, he said, "I think you have a very good case to make about your artifacts."
