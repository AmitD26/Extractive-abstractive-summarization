(CNN) -- Virginia Tech will be fined $55,000 for waiting too long to provide timely warnings about a shooter on the loose during a 2007 rampage in which 32 people died, the U.S. Department of Education said Tuesday.

The school said it will appeal.

The same shooter, identified as Cho Seung-Hui, 23, went to the university's Norris Hall more than two hours later and killed 30 more people before turning a gun on himself.

The Clery Act was created in 1990 in memory of 19-year-old Jeanne Ann Clery, who was raped and killed while asleep in her dorm room at Lehigh University. The law requires colleges and universities to disclose information about crimes on or near their campuses.

"While Virginia Tech's violations warrant a fine far in excess of what is currently permissible under the statute, the department's fine authority is limited," wrote Mary E. Gust, director of a department panel that reviewed the case.

Larry Hincker, associate vice president for university relations at Virginia Tech, said Tuesday the school "respectfully disagrees" with the fine.

According to the report and Tuesday's letter to Virginia Tech, police went to the scene of the Virginia Tech dorm shooting at 7:24 a.m.

But it was not until 9:26 a.m. that the university first notified students and staff by e-mail about the shooting.

"The message was vague and only notified the community there had been a shooting on campus. It did not mention that there had been a murder or that the killer had not been identified," the Department of Education said Tuesday.

A second message was sent to the community at 9:50 a.m. with a "much more explicit warning."

University officials disputed the federal findings.

"We believe that Virginia Tech administrators acted appropriately in their response to the tragic events of April 16, 2007, based on the best information then available to them," Hincker said.
