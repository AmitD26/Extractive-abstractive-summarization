The fight is said to have lasted a half-hour and pitted a leopard against a woman armed only with a farm tool in an isolated field in India.

Kalama Devi, at 54 years old, won.

It fractured her left hand first, so with her right hand clutching the sickle she repeatedly hit the animal -- for about 30 minutes.

Exhausted and bleeding

She said she kept pounding the leopard until she ran out of energy, then, exhausted and bleeding, limped one kilometer to a nearby village to seek help, Dr. Abdul Rahul at the HNB Base Hospital in Srinagar told CNN.

It's not the first leopard attack in the area, Rahul said, though he added it was more common to see injuries as the result of attacks by bears.

"These are alarming incidents because usually leopards attack and kill dogs, goats or young children -- not adults," Khati told CNN.

He said the big cats' natural habitat is shrinking, and their natural prey are becoming scarce.
