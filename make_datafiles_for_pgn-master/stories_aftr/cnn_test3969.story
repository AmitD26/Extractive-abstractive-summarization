Shailene Woodley and Theo James weren't expecting a frenzied mass of "Divergent" fans to greet them at a premiere in early March.

Well, they'd better get used to it.

The two stars of the new film, set for release Friday, were the focus of a swarm of at least 200 fans, mostly female, who screeched and cheered for their heroes at a special Atlanta screening. Woodley wore Alexander McQueen; James, an affable Brit, signed autographs. Both answered questions. The fans ate it up.

And why not? "Divergent" is being touted as the new "Hunger Games." That's no surprise, given its action-oriented female heroine, youthful cast and post-apocalyptic setting. The film is based on the first book in a best-selling trilogy by Veronica Roth, a series that also earned comparisons to Suzanne Collins' "Hunger Games" works.

James said he welcomes the fans' passion.

"It's good to be involved in something that has a bunch of people invested in the material already," he said.

'You have to make bold decisions'

The book series, which also includes the sequels "Insurgent" and "Allegiant," has sold more than 10 million copies. More importantly, it's got that powerful fan base. There are several fan sites devoted to the series on the Internet, and Roth has more than 200,000 Twitter followers.

James, however, says that comes with the territory.

"You have to make your own decisions based on what you perceive the character to be," said James. "You have to make bold decisions, stick with them, and whatever will be, will be."

The two had plenty of help getting into character. They had their own boot camp to get into physical shape, and did some of their own stunts -- though stuntpeople stood in for the big falls, and special effects helped with certain details, like a zip-line run off Chicago's John Hancock Center.

They did go up in the big Ferris wheel on the Navy Pier, which Woodley remembers as a special night.

"It was a full moon, so we got to watch the moon go across the sky and go up and down this crazy 75-foot ladder. It was just magic," she said. "It's one of those moments where you wonder how you got this life."

"They all have in common the fact that they love the art of acting, still. They love being on a movie set," she said.

As "Divergent's" release nears, the two -- along with youthful co-stars including Miles Teller, Jai Courtney and Ansel Elgort -- will see if they can hold on to their love of acting in the midst of a celebrity culture that would like to reduce them to gossip fodder as superficial as members of "Divergent's" single-minded factions. History offers mixed lessons: The shrewd and award-winning Lawrence and the "Harry Potter" kids have apparently succeeded. Other young actors burn out as quickly as they rise.

James -- a veteran of several British TV series, including an episode of "Downton Abbey" -- seems intent on making the most of the opportunity to widen his horizons. As pre-production begins on "Insurgent" and "Allegiant," he's already done two other films: A version of Martin Amis' novel "London Fields" and a film called "Franny" from indie director Andrew Renzi. He may be living by one of the lessons of the film.

"One of the key messages of the film is that no one can be categorized," he said. "Everyone is multidimensional."

And Woodley? She's taking it easy for now. But, like the quietly astute Tris, she understands that you don't present all that you are.

"I think it's important to have your own secrets, preserve your own personal space," she said. "You don't give all of yourself away."
