Eastern Europe remained in the grip of brutal cold and deep snows Tuesday, with authorities in Ukraine, the hardest-hit country, scrambling to help thousands of people whose lives are at risk due to the weather.

At least 250 people have already died across the region during the cold snap, with 135 of the dead in Ukraine.

Authorities there have set up an emergency hospital to deal with people suffering from cold-related conditions, and distributed 3,000 emergency relief tents across the country, they said. The tents are heated and can supply hot food and drinks to people with nowhere else to go.

Kiev alone has more than 14,000 homeless people, authorities said -- among the most vulnerable to winter.

About 2,000 people have been hospitalized due to the cold since January 27, officials said.

Electricity consumption in the country is at historic highs, Ukrainian energy minister Yuri Boyko said.

Southeastern Europe will see more heavy snow in contrast to the northeast, which is predicted to shiver under temperatures much lower than its winter averages,  said CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward.

Cold air arriving from Siberia has been hitting maritime moisture from the Mediterranean Sea, turning it into frozen precipitation. This will continue, and Bosnia, Serbia and Macedonia are expected receive new layers of snow.  "Turkey is also going to have heavy snow," said Ward.

More than 50 people, most of them homeless, have died in Poland, according to Polish TVN.  At least 64 people have died because of the cold in Russia, the government said.
