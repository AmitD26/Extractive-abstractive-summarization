The move came as senior administration officials said President Obama had OK'd a special interrogation unit to be housed within the FBI, and as a redacted CIA inspector general's report on interrogation methods was made public for the first time.

Durham has been investigating the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes since January 2008. He was initially appointed to do so by then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey.

"As a result of my analysis of all of this material, I have concluded that the information known to me warrants opening a preliminary review into whether federal laws were violated in connection with the interrogation of specific detainees at overseas locations," Holder said in a written statement.

President Obama issued a statement echoing Holder's comment that Obama would "look forward and not backward when it comes to issues such as these."

Then-President George W. Bush authorized "enhanced interrogation techniques" for terror suspects in the years following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Those techniques, which included the practice of waterboarding -- simulated drowning -- drew sharp criticism from opponents, who said they amounted to torture.

Prior to his appointment to looking into the interrogation tape destruction, Durham was an assistant U.S. attorney in Connecticut, where among other cases he oversaw the investigations and convictions of a pair of Connecticut mayors.

Durham was tasked with investigating the destruction of tapes of CIA interrogations of terror suspects. The tapes were destroyed in 2005 and never handed over to the courts or the special 9/11 commission.

Earlier Monday, senior administration officials said Obama approved the establishment of a special unit of terrorist interrogators based out of the FBI.

The move comes in the wake of criticism of questionable CIA interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding and the transfer of detainees to countries where torture is common.

The decision to place the FBI, rather than the CIA, in charge of interrogating suspected terrorists represents a major shift in U.S. national security policy.

The change is based on the recommendation of an interrogation task force that Obama established shortly after taking office in January.

The manual provides "adequate and effective means" of conducting investigations, the administration officials asserted, though they left open the possibility of adding new methods based on the latest scientific research regarding what are called "best practices" for interrogation.

Asked to comment on the transfer of responsibility for interrogations from the CIA to the FBI, two former senior CIA officials said the agency never intended to handle detentions, and that it essentially was forced to do so as a result of its pursuit of suspected terrorists after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Some of the questionable tactics used in that pursuit were highlighted Monday by the release of a 2004 report from the CIA's inspector general. The report outlines the use of multiple unauthorized detainee interrogation methods.

Among the findings: U.S. interrogators threatened a captured al Qaeda operative with a power drill to try to scare him into giving up information. Interrogators also threatened to kill another top captive's children in an effort to get the men to talk, the report says.

The gun and drill were used in two interrogation sessions against Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, according to a source familiar with the report's contents. Al-Nashiri is accused of plotting the 2000 attack on the USS Cole, which left 17 U.S. sailors dead.

Interrogators also reportedly told Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, that "if anything else happens in the United States, we're going to kill your children."

Unauthorized detainee interrogation methods also included, among other things, "the making of threats, blowing cigar smoke, employing certain stress positions, the use of a stiff brush on a detainee, and stepping on a detainee's ankle shackles," the report says.

A federal judge in New York had ordered a redacted version of the report to be released as part of a lawsuit filed by the ACLU.

"This is in many ways an old story," CIA Director Leon Panetta said in a written statement.

"The outlines of prior interrogation practices, and many of the details, are public already. The use of enhanced interrogation techniques, begun when our country was responding to the horrors of September 11, ended in January. For the CIA now, the challenge is not the battles of yesterday, but those of today and tomorrow."

The interrogations took place in the CIA's secret prisons before 2006, when Bush moved all detainees from such facilities to the detention center in the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

A CIA spokesman would not talk about specifics of the inspector general's report but said all the incidents described in it have been reviewed by government prosecutors.

"The CIA in no way endorsed behavior -- no matter how infrequent -- that went beyond formal guidance. This has all been looked at; professionals in the Department of Justice decided if and when to pursue prosecution. That's how the system was supposed to work, and that's how it did work," CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said.

The official called it "nickel-and-dime foolishness" that was not tolerated. The individual who used the drill was pulled from the program and "sharply reprimanded," the official said.

Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU, released a statement Sunday saying, "Leaked portions of the CIA inspector general's report offer more proof that government officials committed serious crimes while interrogating prisoners. So-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' like mock executions and threatening prisoners with guns and power drills are not only reprehensible but illegal."

In anticipation of the release of the report Monday, Romero added, "Releasing the report with minimal redactions is essential to knowing what crimes were committed and who was involved."

CNN's Pam Benson, Elaine Quijano, Kevin Bohn and Gloria Borger contributed to this report.
