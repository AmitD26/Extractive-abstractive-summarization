"I'm just happy to be alive," said passenger Jarrod West, who slid down holding his black Chihuahua. "I don't think I'll be mean to anybody ever again."

Then the right engine "blew," JetBlue told KCAL.

A signal alerted pilots that an engine was overheating, fire department spokesman Jake Heflin told KCAL. The pilots deployed extinguishers.

Thick smoke filled cabin

Actor Jackson Rathbone was on the flight with his wife and child. "Our right engine exploded and our cabin filled with smoke," he posted to Twitter.

It grew so thick that passengers could no longer see the people seated next to them, said passenger Jonathon Hubbard.

West realized he would have a hard time breathing soon, but oxygen masks did not drop down, he said.

So, flight attendants went around deploying them by hand.

Fortunately, not far from its departure airport, the plane made a sharp turn back toward it, Rathbone said. The actor is known for his role as Jasper Hale in the "Twilight" movie series and stars in the TV series "Aim High."

"Everyone was crying," passenger Dean Delbaugh said. "I thought this was it." His wife, seated next to him, clung to him.

Rathbone was also flying with his family.

"I recited the Lord's Prayer as I held my son and my wife in my arms," he posted to social media site whosay.

Then flight attendants prepared the passengers in the event of a hard landing.

Happy to be alive

"He put it on the numbers. He did good," West said. "He came by afterwards and said 'hello' to everybody. All of us were hugging him and saying 'thank you.'"

JetBlue spokeswoman Jessica Felipe said everyone evacuated the plane by using emergency slides.

There was no statement on the Flight 1416 incident on JetBlue's website. But on the day of the incident, the airline announced CEO Dave Barger would step down, effective in February. The statement did not connect the decision with the mishap.

Rathbone and his family went home to celebrate their living through Thursday's scare with a wine and champagne tasting, he said on whosay -- they opened a half-dozen bottles.
