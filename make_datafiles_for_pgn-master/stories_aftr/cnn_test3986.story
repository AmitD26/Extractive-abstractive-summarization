Sen. Mark Udall apologized Monday for saying that the two beheaded U.S. journalists would agree the U.S. shouldn't "be impulsive" in dealing with ISIS.

Terror fears could help GOP in midterms

Udall, who faces a competitive re-election bid this fall, made the original comments during a debate Saturday while warning against rushing into further action beyond the current air strikes in Iraq.

"Steve Sotloff and James Foley would tell us, 'Don't be impulsive,'" Udall said at the debate, as seen on video published by National Review Online. "Horrible and barbarous as those executions were, don't be impulsive, come up with a plan to knock (ISIS) back."

In his statement Monday, Udall said his "intent was to emphasize the importance of taking the right next steps as we confront this serious threat."

Obama's 'core coalition' won't defeat ISIS without Mideast

His views are at odds with a majority of the country. According to a new CNN/ORC International poll, seven in 10 Americans believe ISIS has the resources to launch an attack against the U.S.

"I will continue to push the Administration and demand that our country's approach is both tough and smart," he said.
