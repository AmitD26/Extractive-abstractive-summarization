(CNN)What? Not enough snow, ice and cold for you? You say you STILL need some "Frozen" references in your life?

And here's the thing ... people are going there! And not in a "Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un is going, so we better go and smile, too" way. These folks are going voluntarily.

"I haven't seen it like this in a long, long time," one visitor, Maryann McCleary, told the station.

Some tourists had come from as far away as Alabama and even from overseas, the station said.

Niagara Falls isn't exactly frozen over; water is still flowing underneath the ice. It's not uncommon for parts of the falls to ice over in winter. The only recorded time the water flow stopped completely was in 1848, thanks to an ice jam upriver.

Last year's 92.5% peak was No. 2, the agency says.

But there's still time for this year to contend for the record. The National Weather Service says extremely cold arctic air will allow for expansion of the ice coverage in the coming days.
