As the nation choked on its cornflakes, many took to social media to express shock and dismay and repeat the question, "Is this a joke?"

Of Prince Philip, Abbott said: "He's the patron of hundreds of organizations. He's the inspiration and wellspring of the Duke of Edinburgh's Awards which have provided leadership training for tens if not hundreds of thousands of Australians over the years."

The 93-year-old duke is the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece, whose ancestors hail from Danish royalty. He married in Queen Elizabeth II in 1947, who is head of the Commonwealth and is required to sign off on Abbott's decision, an irony not lost on Australia's comedians.

Abbott reintroduced damehoods and knighthoods last year, 28 years after they were retired under the leadership of Bob Hawke's Labor government.

So far, only one dame and three knights have been appointed, including Air Chief Marshal Sir Angus Houston, who has most recently led operations to recover lost Malaysian flights MH370 and MH17.

"It's not about him, but he's a British royal -- why would we give him our top Australian honor? He's already got a lot of them," he said.

Some wondered how Prince Philip would react to the announcement.

For others, it was an opportunity to revive some the Duke's famous quotes.

Some thought it was sure sign Phil could take some of Australia's other top honors.

At the time of writing, Buckingham Palace had yet to release an official statement. Though its Twitter account posted a link to learn more about "the Australian Royal Family."

His contribution to the great wall of outrage was a simple.

Not likely, 'Straya says.
