(CNN) -- Acts of kindness will help pull the nation through its economic crisis, according to the woman who came to the rescue of a homeless Floridian who publicly appealed to President Obama.

"You don't have to be a politician to put forth a stimulus package," Chene Thompson said during a joint interview with Hughes Thursday on CNN's "American Morning." "This is our own little mini-stimulus package for a person who was a stranger and now is a friend.

"Anybody can help anybody at any time. It doesn't need to be something that comes from Washington; it can come from your own home and from your heart, even if it's for a little bit."

Thompson, who was in the audience, stepped forward afterward to offer Hughes her vacant house, which the Thompsons had to leave because it is outside her husband's legislative district.

Hughes feels "overwhelming gratitude," she told CNN in the front yard of the house, "because no one would do that."

According to the White House, the Fort Myers-Cape Coral area had the highest foreclosure rate in the nation last year, with 12 percent of housing units receiving a foreclosure-related notice.

Median housing prices in the Fort Myers metropolitan area have plummeted from $322,000 in December 2005 to less than $107,000 in December 2008, the Obama administration said.

Nearly 12,000 jobs have been lost in Fort Myers in the past year.

White House spokesman Joshua Earnest said Wednesday that the administration connected Hughes with local housing officials in the crowd.

"If that would pass, that would help many other -- hundreds and thousands of -- low-income persons to receive housing," she said.

CNN's Ed Hornick and Mary Snow contributed to this report.
