Turkey is home to 82 million people, 99.8% of whom are Muslim, according to the CIA World Factbook.

Police went to the offices of Istanbul newspaper Cumhuriyet and blocked off traffic around it after the paper published excerpts from the Charlie Hebdo issue.

Cumhuriyet included a four-page sample of Charlie Hebdo's latest edition, translated into Turkish. That sample, which the prosecutor's office saw, did not include the cover, the paper said.

An editorial in the newspaper said the drawing on the Charlie Hebdo cover did not seem to have "anything to do with Prophet Mohammed. That drawing is a symbol of a humane and conscientious attitude and it says, 'All is forgiven.'"

Cumhuriyet editor-in-chief Utku Cakirozer explained on Twitter and on the newspaper's website that Cumhuriyet "has lost writers to terror attacks" and "understands the Charlie Hebdo massacre very well."

Muslims' mixed response to new Mohammed cover

People called the Cumhuriyet offices on Wednesday issuing death threats, employees told CNN.

Three protesters were arrested in front of Cumhuriyet's offices, CNN Turk reported.

CNN's Gul Tuysuz and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.
