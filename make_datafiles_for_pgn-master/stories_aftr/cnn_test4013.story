He shook hands and took selfies with young voters, attacked Hillary Clinton in a high profile speech, and laid out his thoughts about foreign and domestic policy—all signs that suggested he was gearing up for a third presidential bid.

But a closer look at the day's events—and the benefit of hindsight—reveal some clues that Romney knew at the time he wouldn't be throwing his hat in the ring.

He lovingly recalled people he met on the campaign trail, labeling some of his most devoted followers in Iowa and New Hampshire "heroes" because they adamantly supported someone they believed in. He described the campaign as one of "the most remarkable of my life's journeys" but spoke with a tone of finality when recalling that it would eventually come to an end.

Granted, it's a line he has used in previous speeches, but it's an example of how he was in a reflective mood.

He declined to answer a question from the moderator about how he would run a potential campaign differently from 2012—"That's another question I won't answer"—and went on to talk about how Republicans should do better at having a "clear and compelling message," especially when talking to nontraditional GOP voters, like minorities and young people.

He even suggested that Republicans have "to stop thinking so much about the primary and start thinking more about making sure we have people that support us in the general election."

Romney appeared to sound more like he was angling to become a kingmaker than a candidate. He continually referred to a need for "strong leaders" and "leadership" but didn't narrow down his remarks to talk rhetorically about a single leader.

His policy ideas were vague

It was on that very topic—minority outreach—that political observers were most closely trying to examine Romney's recent statements and comments. He won only 6% of the African American vote and 27% of the Hispanic vote in 2012.

Speaking to the Republican National Committee earlier this month, Romney suggested the party needed to focus more on anti-poverty policies, and in his speech on Wednesday he laid out some of his ideas for tackling the issue.

But his ideas were vague and lacked the kind of depth that would churn more interest in a potential campaign. He argued that the government, for example, was providing incentives for single mothers to stay on federal assistance and avoid marriage because they could lose their benefits once they became married.

"If marriage ... is essential to helping people to stay out of poverty, then we want to do the opposite," he said. "We want to create incentives for them to get married, not to not get married."

He also said K-12 education needs to improve, and he encouraged creating incentives for people to hire workers who haven't worked before, but didn't outline specifics.

Those come nowhere near close to some of the more serious proposals by his former running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, or by Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul -- who have made efforts to address poverty through criminal justice reform.

Mystery and pulled pork

"Do you still consider yourself a politician, then?" one reporter asked, to which Romney replied: "You're taking my picture. What can I say?"

"It'd be nice if people who run for office, that their leadership experience and what they've accomplished in life would be a bigger part of what people focus on, but it's not," he said. "It's mostly what you say."

Still, he was doing a meet-and-greet—in his jeans and a plaid shirt like he used to—and anyone watching him could have walked away thinking this was a "go."

The mystery of his barbecue outing--the will he or won't he--was perfectly captured in a response Romney gave to one man who urged him to run again.

"You're very kind," Romney replied, patting the man on the arm. "I wish I were there right now, I gotta tell ya."
