Fotokol, Cameroon (CNN)A Cameroonian soldier lies in a trench, the tip of his Kalashnikov rifle pointing toward the Nigerian town of Gambaru, which has been taken over by Boko Haram terrorists.

A suspected terrorist attempts to cross the El Beid River, which separates Gambaru from Fotokol in Cameroon, but is hit by a bullet from a Cameroonian soldier.

That battle took place on February 11, but "fighting here has become a daily occurrence," says Maj. Nlate Ebale of the Rapid Intervention Battalion -- known as BIR -- of the Cameroon military.

The dusty roads of the once bustling town are now deserted. Frequent exchanges of gunfire between Boko Haram fighters and the combined Cameroonian and Chadian soldiers have driven many away. Only elderly people and some children remain, Kodji says.

"Chadian troops here have the mandate to fight Boko Haram right at their base in Gambaru," Ebale says. "We have to secure this bridge and stop the terrorists from crossing over into Cameroon. So we do work in synergy with Chadian forces here."

In February, Chadian troops launched a large offensive in Gambaru, using land and air forces, killing some 200 Boko Haram militants, Kodji says.

"We register at least one to two Boko Haram attacks in different localities a day," he says.

Several African nations -- including Niger, Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria -- have pledged to deploy 8,700 troops, police and civilians as part of a regional effort to fight Boko Haram.

The violence in northeast Nigeria has caused more than 157,000 people to flee into Niger, Cameroon and Chad, Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said in February. Nearly 1 million more people are believed to be internally displaced inside northeast Nigeria, according to Nigeria's national emergency management agency, Edwards said.

Amchide has become a military base to protect the area from insurgents. Soldiers patrol the streets in armored vehicles and lie in trenches. But the military has become a major target for Boko Haram attacks.

"It was at about 4 a.m. when we heard them shouting from four different angles of our base. Then it was clear that their intention was to strike our base. It was definitely a difficult situation to handle, given that they were coming from different directions.

"I ordered that the lone tank we had should be deployed in such a way that the terrorists would think we had at least four tanks. So we would rush to one angle, shoot for about 15 minutes and then rush to the next angle, shoot for 15 minutes. ... Within hours, we were able to put the terrorists to rout," Hob says.

Porous borders ease their incursions into Cameroon.
