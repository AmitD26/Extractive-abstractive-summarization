About 45 Greenpeace activists hung a black banner and protest signs Sunday at the Angel of Independence, a victory column in a busy traffic circle on one of Mexico City's major thoroughfares. It is one of Mexico City's most recognized monuments.

Genetic engineering can improve desired traits such as nutritional content or resistance to herbicides, pests and disease. The modifications also can increase tolerance for cold and drought.

Other genetically modified crops include soybeans, cotton and papayas.

Critics of the technique say they worry about the effect on consumers, other crops and the environment.

Germany earlier this year banned a genetically modified strain of corn, saying the government wanted to protect the safety of consumers and the environment.

But the Mexican protesters said they fear the genetically modified corn could harm the nation's 55 varieties of native corn.

"Without corn, there is no country," some protesters said. The slogan rhymes in Spanish: "Sin maiz, no hay pais."

Two scientific studies have determined that transgenic corn has already contaminated some native Mexican corn fields.

In 2001, a study in the journal Nature reported that transgenic DNA had been found in traditional corn crops in the state of Oaxaca. Earlier this year, research published in the journal Molecular Ecology also found genetically modified corn contamination of native Mexican corn.

Greenpeace and other critics say that modified corn would kill off independent growers, because they would have to buy their seed from one of four businesses that own the patents.

In its February article, Molecular Ecology said that most of the current crop in the nation comes from private supplies of seed.

"Maize is a staple food in Mexico, with a pivotal place in the country's past and present economic, cultural and agricultural spheres," the article says in its introduction. "In contrast to the United States and Europe, commercial seed sources account for only one-fourth of the maize seed planted in Mexico. Furthermore, Mexican maize is mostly grown by smallholder farmers who obtain seed from their own harvest or from other farmers."

Molecular Ecology also points out, though, that the "introduction of transgenic maize has resulted in an increase in maize production."

And it is that increase in production that lies at the heart of Mexico's decision to allow the two test permits, analysts say.

"Mexico is a net importer of corn from the United States," said Bruce Bagley, chairman of the University of Miami Graduate School of International Studies.

White corn is used for human consumption while yellow corn is used primarily for animal feed. An increase in meat and chicken consumption in Mexico in the past decade has led to greater demand for yellow corn for animal feed. Unable to meet this demand, Mexico has had to import about 89 percent of the corn it needs for feed, says the U.S. Agriculture Department. And 99.8 percent of that corn comes from the United States, the department says.

"Mexico is feeling the pangs of food insecurity," Bagley said.

Bagley also sees another reason why Mexico may have allowed introduction of the genetically modified corn.

But if the experimental plots lead to greater contamination of native crops, Bagley said, Mexico could have the legal grounds to refuse widespread importation of the new corn.

Greenpeace doesn't want to wait that long. The global environmental organization asked Mexico for an immediate moratorium on the use of the transgenic corn.

There has been no indication they're likely to get it any time soon.
