The team was supporting oil exploration operations near Pucallpa, Peru, when the helicopter they were traveling in crashed Monday afternoon, according to Columbia Helicopters, the Portland, Oregon-based company that employed the victims.

Minutes after the helicopter took off from the Pucallpa Airport, authorities lost communication with the pilot, and people in the control tower could see a heavy smoke column in the distance.

A company official said Tuesday that it was unclear what caused the crash.

Columbia Helicopters has dispatched an investigation team to work with Peruvian authorities, Fahey said.

A local police chief said three of the bodies were found away from the site of helicopter's crash and explosion, and those bodies had no burn injuries, leading authorities to believe the three passengers jumped out before the crash.
