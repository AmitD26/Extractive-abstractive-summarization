Washington (CNN) A huge Obama foreign policy decision, a big immigration question and interesting steps related to Hillary Clinton, John Boehner and Marco Rubio filled an informative Sunday loop around the 'Inside Politics' table.

There's nothing like a signature hire to quiet those who think you might blink and skip the fight.

At issue is Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who remains a single-digit blip in Republican polls. So weak have his early poll showings been that many GOPers to this day say they would not be shocked if he decided not to move from exploratory candidate to official candidate.

But a new hire sends a signal. Veteran South Carolina GOP strategist J. Warren Tompkins is signing on to run a pro-Rubio super PAC. That same PAC is in line for seed money from Florida billionaire Norman Braman.

Tompkins is a protege of the late GOP Gov. Carroll Campbell and legendary South Carolina strategist Lee Atwater.

For those of us who lived through the Clinton White House years, and especially the Monica Lewinsky scandal, it was interesting to say the least listening to Hillary Clinton a few days ago wax nostalgic about her relationship with Newt Gingrich.

And the former House speaker shared similar fond memories in a conversation with Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast.

But Boehner sees a chance to get two big-ticket items on their way to passage, and through those debates to get the House back on a more productive track.

Robert Costa of The Washington Post shared his reporting on the speaker's calculations -- including one health care bill where he struck up an alliance with Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.

President Obama meets with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani this week, and is open to slowing the withdrawal of U.S. forces.  A big change, but with a bigger goal in mind.

Julie Pace of The Associated Press shared inside reporting on the administration's willingness to leave up to 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan for the time being.

The surge undermined what was already a long shot chance of congressional consensus on immigration reform.

NPR's Steve Inskeep reports that both policymakers and political strategists are watching to see if there is a similar seasonal surge this year.
