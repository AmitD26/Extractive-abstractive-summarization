(CNN)Nineteen-year-old Tony Robinson was not armed when a Madison, Wisconsin, police officer fatally shot him, Police Chief Mike Koval said Saturday.

"We have to be clear about this," Koval said. "He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators, the public, to accept, to understand ... why deadly force had to be used."

Kenny was exonerated of any wrongdoing and even received a commendation, the chief said, adding that the incident was "concluded to be a suicide by cop" situation.

Kenny was responding Friday evening to a reported disturbance at a Madison residence when Robinson attacked him, Koval said.

Robinson had a criminal history, according to the state of Wisconsin public records.  These records were first reported by the Wisconsin State Journal newspaper.

Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate that Robinson pleaded guilty in December of last year to an armed robbery that occurred April 25, 2014.

In a press conference, he stated, "I could but I choose not to. I am not here to do a character workup on someone who lost his life less than 24 hours ago."

But he also said that the public records were available to all.

Koval said he visited the home of Robinson's mother late Friday and met Robinson's grandparents outside the house.

They talked and prayed, the chief said, but they advised him to put off visiting Robinson's mother "based on the dynamics" of the situation.

Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, told CNN affiliate WKOW that she didn't understand what happened. "My son has never been a violent person, never," she said. "To die in such a violent way baffles me."

Irwin said Robinson served as a father figure to her other children.

"He was our caretaker and so gentle," she said.

The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Koval said. Dispatchers identified him as Robinson, according to 911 audio obtained by WKOW.

A little later the dispatcher says, "Apparently Tony hit one of his friends, um no weapons seen."

When Kenny went to the apartment, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said.

Backup officers and others at the scene performed CPR on the young man, who later died at the hospital.

Kenny suffered a blow to the head, but is being treated and will be released, Koval said. Kenny has been placed on administrative leave with pay.

In a statement Saturday, state Attorney General Brad Schimel said he "can only imagine the heartbreak" of Robinson's parents and added he's "concerned for the officer ... who, I imagine, is experiencing great trauma as well."

"They are all in my thoughts and prayers," Schimel said.

Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once DCI completes the investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said.

Some were demanding answers sooner rather than later.

On Friday night, dozens of demonstrators came out to the area around the apartment, which police had blocked off. A group also moved toward City Hall before dispersing early Saturday.

"Who do we trust?" some called out, prompting the response, "No one!"

And in another refrain, they chanted, "Black lives matter."

The protesters' sentiments were echoed online, where some adopted the #WillyStreet hashtag in reference to Williamson Street, where the shooting happened.

"Praying for Madison tonight," wrote one activist. "Stand up, sit in, walk out - until u get answers. And until there are no more hashtag eulogies."
