(CNN)In the two years since "Lean In" became a best-seller and sparked countless conversations about gender equality, author Sheryl Sandberg says she has gotten one question over and over from men: What can they do?

Now the Facebook chief operating officer is giving them some specific answers by aligning with one of the most popular athletes on the planet. If LeBron James is encouraging men to lean in for women, don't you think some of his 19 million Twitter followers will get the message too?

In a 30-second video of NBA and WNBA all-stars, we see James of the Cleveland Cavaliers holding up a poster, which says "All-Star Dad."

Dwayne Wade of the Miami Heat says, "When men lean in, everyone wins," and then touts how he leans in for his wife, mother and grandmother.

"Help women aim high," says Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks.

But Sandberg says with the list of "simple, clear, everyday things, practical things" men can do that are based on real data, men will see not only how they can help but how they individually will benefit.

Despite 'Lean In,' workplace equality remains abysmal

Dads might think they are doing all they can by telling their daughters they can be anything they want, but if Mom is still doing all the cooking and cleaning, their girls aren't getting the full message.

Another huge goal, Sandberg says, is showing men they won't lose out in the workplace when there is more equality in the executive suites and in boardrooms.

"If you've long been in the majority and long held power, and you see change, you could naturally be nervous that this wasn't going to help you," said Sandberg. Men need to realize it's not a zero sum game, she said.

"When companies do better, there are more jobs, more promotions, more salaries for everyone. When companies do worse, there's less for everyone," she said. She mentioned a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, which found that if women were in the workforce at the same percentage as men in the U.S., our country's gross domestic product would grow by 5%.

"We haven't seen 5% GDP growth in a long time. ... That's a lot of jobs for a lot of people, so understanding that this is beneficial for everyone, I think, is huge."

Work-life balance not just a women's issue

In January, a U.N. conference sponsored by Iceland and Suriname, which I was honored to attend as a panel participant, brought together ambassadors, other policymakers, and athletes and artists, with the goal of changing the discourse among men on gender equality.

That is why the recent focus on caring dads in ads during this year's Super Bowl was so applauded by men like sociologist Michael Kimmel, who is spearheading this week's New York conference on men and masculinities.

"This provides a counternarrative to all the action hero, buffoon images that we see," Kimmel told me when I talked to him days before the Super Bowl.

Kimmel said very few men, fewer than 10%, can relate to the way the media depict masculinity, according to a study conducted by Dove Men+Care. Kimmel was hired by the brand as an adviser to help analyze its research.

Men today are spending far more time doing housework and helping with child care and are enjoying more egalitarian relationships than any generation in American history, and their ideas about what it means to be a man have begun to shift as well, said Kimmel, who is the author of more than 20 books including "Manhood in America: A Cultural History."

Sandberg says we need to recognize and support the new definitions of masculinity and hopes the message from stars like James and Wade goes a long way toward doing that.

Admittedly impatient about gender equality (I'm impatient too!), Sandberg concedes we have a long way to go until the gender equality problem is solved and LeanIn.org can close its doors.

Enter King James.
