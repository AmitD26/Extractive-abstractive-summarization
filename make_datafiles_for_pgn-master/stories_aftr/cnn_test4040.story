But China's Great Firewall  --  a massive Internet surveillance and content control system -- has, in many respects, been an unparalleled success.

And now, some fear, the model is going global.

Soon after China tip-toed onto the Internet in the late 1980s, it laid down the foundation of the Great Firewall but critics asserted that an Internet with Chinese characteristics would be no Internet at all.

During a high-profile media tour in Beijing in 1999, MIT Media Lab founder and technology pundit Nicholas Negroponte declared that a "healthy disrespect for authority" was required for any successful Internet industry.

A year later, then-U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that "liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem" and that any attempt to control the Internet in China would be "like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall."

It's nailed the Jell-O. China has proven it can have its Great Firewall and enjoy great prosperity too.

Lokman Tsui, associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and former head of free expression at Google Asia-Pacific, says that most Chinese are happy with the status quo.

Currently home to the world's largest Internet market, China is also home to some of the world's most valuable Internet companies including e-commerce giant Alibaba and Tencent, now estimated to be worth $66.1 billion.

The government has fostered the development of the Internet by offering incentives for local entrepreneurs while building walls to keep big Western rivals out.

The ban on Western social media sites like YouTube and Facebook has also given home court advantage to China's own Internet stars like Youku and WeChat.

"From Beijing's perspective, there's this fear that if we open up the Internet then it will be chaos.

So if the cost is good-enough or almost-good-enough innovation... it seems like a pretty straight forward equation from the perspective of the policymakers."

Last week, the Chinese and English news websites of Reuters news agency became inaccessible in China, joining a number of foreign media destinations that are barred online in China.

There have been ways to get around it.

Through VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks, web users in China can access restricted content.

But in a recent crackdown, the Chinese government is shutting down VPNs -- Beijing's latest move to shore up its cyber-authority.

"The problem is that it's decided on a national level by the government," he adds. "It's this attitude that 'father knows best.'"

And that "father" would be Lu Wei, the so-called Internet czar of China who was recently photographed smiling at Mark Zuckerberg's desk during a visit at Facebook's headquarters in California.

"It would be a very attractive model for instance for Russia, for Egypt, or for other states," Rife says.

"It would be obviously in China's interest for other people and other nation states to agree with them and their interpretation of Internet sovereignty."

It's unlikely, says Bishop.

"I actually think most users don't care."

"At the end of the day, they're not going to give up Facebook because Facebook is operating differently in China."

A Facebook that fits the firewall, and fortune at the expense of freedom.
