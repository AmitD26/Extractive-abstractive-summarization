Jakarta (CNN)An Indonesian court has rejected a bid by two Australian drug smugglers -- members of the "Bali Nine" -- to challenge their planned executions.

Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are awaiting death by firing squad on Indonesia's "execution island" for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot.

Lawyers for the pair had argued that Widodo had failed to individually consider their cases.

One of the condemned men's lawyers, Leonard Aritonang, said he was disappointed with the rulings but would respect the court's decision.

"We had predicted it will be rejected because clemency is a prerogative right of the President, as head of the government, not an object of a suit at the administrative court," he said in a message.

Indonesia has long taken a hard line on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, Widodo has made it clear he intends to be tough on those found guilty of such crimes.

In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in January, he said there would be "no compromise" on drug dealers.

"Indonesia is in a drug emergency, so we need to have something that's firm," said Widodo.

In December, six prisoners convicted of drug offenses were killed by firing squad, including five foreigners from Brazil, the Netherlands, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam.

Police caught four people at the Denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.

Another four -- including Sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta. Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney; he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot.

Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden.

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said that their rehabilitation is genuine.

Australians have shown public support for the men, with politicians and members of the public turning out for a dawn vigil to demonstrate opposition to the planned executions.
