(CNN) -- "Back in my day, we used to walk five miles uphill, carrying all our books in the blistering cold and the pouring rain..."

In Somerville, New Jersey, there's a different school bus making the rounds and picking up students near Van Derveer Elementary School. It's called a walking school bus, and it has been rolling -- stepping, really -- for more than 10 years.

"It's just the coolest thing," said Susan Haynes, principal of Van Derveer Elementary School.

At that time, Haynes was the newly minted principal with this dilemma on her desk: In New Jersey, bus service isn't required if students live within 2Â½ miles of school and all Van Derveer's students fall within that range. Budget cuts meant the district's free shuttle service would be eliminated.

Cuts as extreme as those in Somerville aren't common, but the savings can be substantial, said Jim Crane, project manager for the National Center for Safe Routes to School.

Special days have been designed to draw extra attention to their everyday initiative. Walk to School Wednesdays and Foot-It Fridays are a direct result of student feedback and involvement. One-third of the student body participated in the school's most recent Walk to School on Wednesday.

"It's kind of like you're driving in a real school bus, but you just walk all the way to the school," fifth grader Makhia Robinson said.
