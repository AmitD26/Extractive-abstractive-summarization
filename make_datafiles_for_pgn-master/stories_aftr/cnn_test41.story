Cairo (CNN) -- Demonstrators angry that ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak's former premier will face off against a representative of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt's presidential runoff have called for more protests Tuesday.

On Monday, several thousand protesters in Tahrir Square called on Egyptian courts to disqualify former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, chanting, "Where is the revolution?"

Others ransacked Shafik's campaign headquarters and set it ablaze after learning that he was one of the two candidates who made it through the first round of voting.

Shafik campaign spokesman Ahmed Serhan said the fire was soon contained and no one was injured. Serhan said that while the anti-Shafik protesters numbered in the dozens, "supporters in the hundreds are outside the building supporting him."

In Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the 2011 revolt, the crowd carried Khaled Ali -- a presidential candidate who failed to make the runoff -- on their shoulders while demanding an end to the military government that followed Mubarak. Anti-Shafik protests were also reported in Alexandria and other cities, and revolutionary leaders said they would hold more on Tuesday outside Egypt's High Court of Justice.

Voters' dilemma: Choice between two tyrants?

In all, 23 million of Egypt's 50 million eligible voters, or 46%, cast ballots in the first round of the election.

Thirteen candidates appeared on the first-round ballot, though two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed. The winner of the landmark vote will become Egypt's first freely elected president.

Neither of the frontrunners had been favored by the revolutionaries responsible for toppling Mubarak.

Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who led a delegation observing the voting, told reporters last week in Cairo that he couldn't say "the entire process has been proper" because of restraints on observers. But the group found the election period to be peaceful, with citizens accepting the voting process as "quite successful."

Carter said there were no apparent patterns in election procedures that "favored a particular candidate."

Mubarak led the North African nation for 30 years before being forced out last year amid a popular outcry that marked one of the seminal developments of the Arab Spring.
