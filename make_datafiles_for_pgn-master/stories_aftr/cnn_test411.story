(CNN) -- She was trying to get help for her sister.

"I'm trying to control her," the sister said, expressing worry about her sister's three children. "... I'm trying to keep them safe."

At first, the plea appeared to pay off: Police caught up to the woman -- later identified as Ebony Wilkerson -- after she sped away from her sister's Daytona Beach apartment. An officer questioned her as her three children sat in the Honda Odyssey's backseat, smiling and seemingly calm. Wilkerson explained that she feared for her safety, worried that her estranged husband would harm them.

According to a Daytona Beach Police report, the officer believed she might have a mental illness. Despite these concerns, the officer talked to a detective also at the scene and let her go on her way, concluding she couldn't be held under a Florida law that allows for detention of people believed to be impaired by mental illness and who possibly pose a risk of harm.

Almost two hours later Tuesday, Wilkerson drove her black minivan -- with the three kids still inside -- into the surf of the Atlantic Ocean.

Tesseneer threw the car in park and raced over to help. One child was screaming, Tesseneer recalled Wednesday to CNN's Piers Morgan. "'Please help us, our mom is trying to kill us.'"

Another child, a 3-year-old girl, was strapped in a car seat. A lifeguard dived in through a front window and unbuckled the child and handed her to another lifeguard as the vehicle bobbed in water about 3 feet deep.

Meanwhile, Wilkerson walked away quietly with a strange, almost "possessed" look on her face, witnesses said.

For evidence of their ordeal, one need only listen to what all three continuously uttered when officers caught up with them at Halifax Health Medical Center.

"Mom tried to kill us."

The story begins in South Carolina, where Wilkerson and her children had been until she made the decision to leave the state, to leave her husband behind. Her children later detailed the fractured relationship between their parents, as well as the time her son got into trouble after speaking to authorities probing a domestic situation there.

"She came down to me for protection," Wilkerson's sister explained in her 911 call, of the quartet coming to the eastern Florida coast.

Or so she thought.

That was followed by the initial encounter with the officer and detective, then later the incident on Daytona Beach.

The children later told investigators that their mother told them "to close their eyes and go to sleep." As they screamed as the minivan went into the water, she insisted she was taking them to a better place, saying repeatedly: "I am keeping all of us safe."

Wilkerson was being held on three counts of aggravated child abuse in addition to the first-degree murder charge, Johnson said Friday.

Her bond has been set at $1.2 million, said James Purdy, the elected public defender for the 7th Judicial Circuit of Florida. Purdy said he would seek a court hearing on that bond, which could occur in the next week or so. He said he was going to speak with Wilkerson on Saturday.

Investigators have claimed in the charging affidavit: "Ebony Wilkerson acted with premeditated design to kill her three children.
