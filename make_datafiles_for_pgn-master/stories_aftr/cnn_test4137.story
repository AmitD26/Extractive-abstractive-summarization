Tenino, Washington (CNN) -- Authorities in Alaska are examining two wolves to see if they are the animals that killed a jogger last week, said a wildlife biologist investigating the attack.

"We had a systematic search," he said. "These were the only two wolves we could find tracks for."

Officials will conduct tests on the wolves' carcasses to determine whether they killed Berner, Butler said.

The carcasses will also be examined to see whether the animals were rabid or starving, or suffering from some condition that led them to attack a human, he said.

The rare wolf attack shook Chignik Lake, population 105.

"We see wolves a lot," said Johnny Lind, president of the Village Council. "But we've never had anything like this happen."

"They are not human predators. It's healthy to have awareness of them, for sure. But to be afraid of them is too strong an emotion," he said.
