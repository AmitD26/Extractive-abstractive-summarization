Miraculously, the 70-year-old Zizi survived seven days trapped under the rubble before she was rescued by international search crews this week. A person can, give or take, expect to survive 72 hours trapped without water or food. Zizi managed to hold on for twice as long, something that experts say speaks to the body's resilience in times of danger. It is possible for a healthy person to survive more than 10 days in some cases, experts say.

"I wasn't surprised. I knew she would live through that. She is a tough woman," Janvier said, recalling when he heard the news, via a CNN tip, that his mother had been found. Earlier, he had used CNN's Web site to enter his mother's name, age and approximate location in hope of someone identifying her.

Zizi has since been moved to a medical facility aboard the USS Bataan, and now her son is seeking help moving her to a hospital in Florida for further treatment.

"I haven't given up hope," Janvier told CNN. "It's God's sign to me that I will have another chance to see my mom."

A CNN crew captured video of Tuesday's rescue.

After hours of careful extraction by rescue crews from Germany, South Africa and Mexico, Zizi was carried from the rubble on a wooden board as she grasped the edges, her face covered in dust.

Janvier said he has no doubt that his mother's faith played a role in her survival.

"Definitely, no question. Everyone was praying," he said.

The next step in Zizi's recovery, however, remains unclear.               Full coverage  l   Twitter updates
