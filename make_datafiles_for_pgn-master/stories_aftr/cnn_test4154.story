However, after two days of further negotiation, Arum said no agreement could be made with Mayweather, with the result that both fighters would now miss out on a potential purse of $40 million each.

"It's not surprising. I always felt that he wasn't going to do the fight. He knows Manny will beat him. Mayweather's never stepped into the ring with a guy he had any question but that he was going to beat. Our guy was agreeable, Mayweather wasn't," the Top Rank promoter said.

"That's why there's never been a (Shane) Mosley, there's never been a (Antonio) Margarito, there never was a (Miguel) Cotto, and there's no Pacquiao.

"Floyd Mayweather is a coward. He will never fight anyone that will remotely give him a tough fight.

The welterweight title bout was thrown into doubt when Mayweather demanded that random drugs testing should be employed before the fight, a request that prompted Pacquiao to take legal action for defamation.

Pacquiao filed a lawsuit in a federal court in Las Vegas last week for  defamation against Mayweather and others for allegedly claiming he had used performance-enhancing drugs.

The bout at welterweight appeared to be virtually set after other issues around the cut of the purse for each fighter were settled, but then the drug-testing row erupted over the Christmas period.

Pacquiao became a five-weight world champion after his WBO welterweight title win over Miguel Cotto in November, while the unbeaten Mayweather returned from a 21-month retirement to beat Mexican Juan Manuel Marquez in September.
