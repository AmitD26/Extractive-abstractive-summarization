Arlington, Virginia (CNN) -- It may surprise the casual visitor at Arlington National Cemetery to see a rubber duck on a headstone or an old football helmet lying in the manicured grass of a fallen soldier's grave.

After all, America's most hallowed ground is the final resting place for war heroes, astronauts, even a U.S. president.

"I have seen everything from report cards to an Alabama football ticket stub," said Roderick Gainer, a curator with the Center of Military History.

"Obviously, these deceased service person was a Crimson Tide fan. Letters, hotel keys. I've seen jewelry, lots of things."

Gainer is part of a new effort by the Army to make sure these items don't end up in the trash.

Before this effort began late last summer, most of the items were thrown away. Some cemetery employees tried to gather some special mementos, but no record was kept about what graves those items came from.

Now, curators from the Center of Military History are making sure a thorough record is kept.

There was a case where some items were collected from a grave, but the family didn't want the items moved, so the center returned the materials to the family. The curators also pay attention to when the materials are left. If they are birthday cards and a birthday is approaching, they will usually leave them. But if the birthday has passed, they will collect them.

While Gainer does this job every week, some things still get to him.

Like a poem left on Cmdr. Phil Murphy-Sweet's grave that reads:

a small white stone, three little pebbles,

an inscription, and a patch of green grass.

That's where he'll stay.

He should be home laughing with kids or still serving his country.

The poem is signed "Jeanne and Lelila Musgates." But it's unclear why it was left on Murphy-Sweet's grave. Were they relatives, friends or just patriotic Americans who wanted to remember a fallen soldier?
