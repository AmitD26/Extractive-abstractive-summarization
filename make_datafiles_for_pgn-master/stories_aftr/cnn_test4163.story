THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Back from the weekend and ready to launch into 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines, including dueling protests, an Iranian announcement and one teen's push for peace. I'm Carl Azuz. This is CNN Student News.

First Up: Egg Safety

Islamic Center Debate

AZUZ: In New York City, things are tense over plans to build an Islamic center with a mosque a few blocks away from Ground Zero. That's one site of the 9/11 terror attacks. And Sunday, hundreds of people turned out in protest, both against the plan and for it. Most of the protesters are opposed to the plan; they're opposed to the Islamic center. They argue that it's insensitive to build it so close to Ground Zero. According to a CNN poll that was taken earlier this month, nearly 70 percent of Americans agree with them; they are against the plan. But on the other side of the debate, those folks who support building the Islamic center argue that the issue is freedom of religion. New York Governor David Patterson says there are no laws that prevent the construction of the Islamic center. But he says the controversy shows him that "the wounds of 9/11 haven't healed." One of the leaders of the group that's behind the development of the Islamic center says that there are no plans to move the construction site, at least not for now.

Shoutout

TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What is the name of the Middle Eastern country that's highlighted on this map? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Saudi Arabia, B) Iran, C) Pakistan or D) Oman? You've got three seconds -- GO! The Islamic Republic of Iran is highlighted here. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout!

AZUZ: Moving east from Iran to Pakistan. We've told you about the severe flooding there. We're starting to see some of the aftermath of that flooding in terms of disease: skin diseases, respiratory infections, malaria. The World Health Organization says nearly a million Pakistanis are suffering some kind of illness. The floods are making a massive impact on the country's economy as well, and Jonathan Mann has more on that.

MANN: Under all of that water, there are homes, farms and factories, bridges, roads and irrigation canals. Five hundred thousand tons of stored wheat is now reported ruined. Add potentially two million bales of cotton. Food prices have been rising in markets around the country. Pakistan's long-standing electricity shortage is suddenly so much worse because power plants have been shut down or damaged as well. The county's high commissioner to Britain told the Reuters news agency that it might cost $15 billion to rebuild from the devastation. And Pakistan -- already deeply in debt -- will have less money to spend, because its ability to earn with exports has been dramatically reduced.

CHAMBERLIN: What the floods have done is to virtually wipe out an infrastructure, agricultural infrastructure that it depended upon for its wheat exports. And because about 60 percent of the population worked in the agricultural sector, so the amount of investment that will need to go in just to bring Pakistan back up to a status quo, a status quo that was not sufficient, is going to cost billions and billions of dollars.

MANN: The world has responded with millions in aid. The World Bank alone has pledged $900 million more. But Pakistan will need so much more money than that, even long after the water is gone. Jonathan Mann, CNN.

Is this Legit?

SHELBY ERDMAN, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The demilitarized zone, or DMZ, divides North and South Korea. Legit! It was established in 1953 as part of the agreement that ended the fighting in the Korean War.

Peace Mission

AZUZ: The fighting ended a while ago, but technically, North and South Korea are still at war. And the DMZ is patrolled at all times by troops from both countries. It doesn't sound like the kind of place you might want to spend a vacation, but there's a 13-year-old from Mississippi who thought so. And Emily Chang introduces him and his hope to us.

EMILY CHANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: He's a 13-year-old boy turned international envoy.

LEE: Actually, I was really kind of scared at first. But once I got there, I was kind of relieved because I felt, in my experience, very safe.

LEE: I would really like, if possible, maybe of children from both countries to be able to meet and play with each other, like a big playground.

CHANG: How did you feel when he came up with this idea?

MELISSA LEE, JONATHAN'S MOTHER: I was like, really? You want to go to North Korea, and when? And then he was so adamant and so strong about how he felt, I was like, okay. I was cool with it. I was fine.

LEE: My idea for the mission statement of the children's peace forest is "Above politics, above borders, above ideology, above conflict."

LEE: Well, I was a little disappointed, but I'm going to keep trying. Maybe if I keep trying, I don't know, maybe eventually, hopefully.

Before We Go

AZUZ: All right, before we go today, we've got a story that's just too doggone cute -- or ugly -- to ignore.  This is Izzy, a two-year old Chihuahua. But she's only half the story. Look down by her leg. That's a baby squirrel! Two of those were abandoned under the tree. Izzy's owner took in the squirrels, but Izzy decided to take over, adopting the little ones. We've actually been holding on to this video for a few days, kinda waiting to show it off to you.

Goodbye

AZUZ: I guess you could say we've been squirreling it away. Chihuahuas, squirrels, puns: It's the little things on CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz.
