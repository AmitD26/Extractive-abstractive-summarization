Kapikoy, Turkey (CNN) -- Hamide Yeni is a woman on the hunt.

The women's rights activist wears a determined expression on her face as she paces the dirt roads of this remote village, looking for the man who Turkish authorities say beat his wife and put her in a hospital twice in less than 12 months.

"Have you seen Faruk?" she asks the village mayor's daughter. "He disappeared with his car."

Convicted wife beater

The man Yeni is looking for is Faruk Platin, one of the 600 residents of Kapikoy.

Last fall, a court sentenced him to 15 months in prison for assault, after his 30-year old wife Sidika was hospitalized with trauma wounds.

Sidika Platin is an ethnic Kurd who speaks no Turkish. According to eyewitnesses, when she appeared in court, she could not understand the judge or prosecutor, and relied on her husband to translate legal proceedings.

On a snowy day last December, local women's rights activists like Hamide Yeni could do little more then watch helplessly, as Faruk Platin led his mutilated wife away from the courtyard, back to the village where they lived.

Widespread violence against women

"This kind of thing happens in every village," says Yeni, one of the founders of a grassroots local family protection association in the Saray district of southeastern Turkey. "There are thousands of women like Sidika out here."

"We think it's much higher than 42 percent."

Domestic violence against women is not confined to economically-depressed, rural regions of eastern Turkey. According to the Turkish government survey, the statistics for physical and sexual assault were roughly the same in the countryside as in the most developed, fast-growing cities in the western part of the country.

Over the past 15 years, Turkey has adopted several progressive pieces of legislation to protect women, including a 1998 Protection Order against Domestic Violence. Reform of Turkey's Civil Code in 2001 gave women legal equal status to men in the family.

Meanwhile, changes to the country's Penal Code in 2004 criminalized marital rape. But critics argue that the Turkish state has lapsed far behind in implementing these laws.

'It looks as if she was tortured'

Not long after Sidika Platin returned to the village of Kapikoy, neighbors and relatives began contacting authorities, reporting that her husband was once again beating her.

Niyazi Yakin, a member of the Kapikoy village council and a relative of Faruk Platin, says he personally asked Sidika if she was being abused, and she said no.

"She deserved what happened," Yakin said. "Because we gave her the chance to leave him and she didn't."

On July 15, Faruk Platin brought his wife to the hospital in Van.

"When the doctors discovered that she was battered, the husband escaped," the Van Social Services Directorate announced in a written statement on July 19.

"It looked as if she had been tortured," one Van hospital doctor told CNN, on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give an interview.

"Usually if a woman comes in who has been beaten, she will say 'I fell down the stairs' or 'I bumped into the refrigator," Cankaya said. "It stays in the family...and as doctors, we cannot interfere."

Meral Demirbas, the district governor of Saray, told CNN an arrest warrant has been issued for Faruk Platin, who is on the loose.

But Hamide Yeni says that is not enough.

"The state is guilty, the system is guilty," she says. "It failed to protect the victim."

"It wasn't our responsibility," insists Saban Altinli, a brother of the village muhtar, or mayor.

"When there is violence, it doesn't matter if it's your relative," Yeni responds. "You can still make a call and inform that this woman is being beaten."
