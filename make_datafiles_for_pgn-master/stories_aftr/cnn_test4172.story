The number crunchers at Election Data Services estimate that next year, Ohio is going to lose two seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. It's up to the Ohio state government -- including the governor -- to decide which House members will go: Democrats or Republicans.

Imagine if, 10 days from now, the Republicans win control of the House, but by only a one-seat majority. Republican John Boehner becomes speaker.

But there's more to this chess game. Ohio isn't the only state that stands to lose seats, and other states will win seats. Texas, for example, is poised to gain four seats. Republicans control the legislature in Austin, and there's a tight race for the governor's  office.

In all, 18 states will gain or lose representation in the House of Representatives, totaling a change of 24 seats.

In most states, it's all up to the legislature, and the governor vetoes or approves the map. Some states have a different process to try to minimize political games, but that's hard.

Sound unfair? The redistricting process is required by the U.S. Constitution to ensure that every member of the House has an equal population district. It's the main reason we conduct a Census every 10 years, so we can rebalance districts based on where people are living. These new district lines last for 10 years, until the next census.

When a state has to change even one seat, all the districts in the entire state stand to be redrawn. Remember, every district has to have population of equal size. That means the whole deck is reshuffled.

"A long time ago, people figured out you could do more than rebalance populations so politicians can manipulate the boundaries to their favor," McDonald said, adding that manipulation for political gain is ingrained into our politics. "This is what's called gerrymandering. So the party that controls a state can tilt the balance of power in Washington, D.C."

The origin of "gerrymandering"

The list of states that will gain or lose seats is released in December. But Election Data Services crunched the preliminary census numbers and estimates that the following states will see changes.

Texas will gain four seats, Florida will gain two, and Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah and Washington will each gain one.

Ohio and New York will lose two seats, and Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania will each lose one.
