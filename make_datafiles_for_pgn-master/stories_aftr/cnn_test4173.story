Lewis, a 41-year-old grandmother, pleaded guilty to her part in the 2002 slayings of her husband and stepson in their rural home near Danville, Virginia, about 145 miles from Richmond. Two male co-conspirators -- the triggermen -- were given life in prison without parole.

McDonnell last week refused to issue a stay for Lewis, who is the first woman scheduled to be executed in Virginia in nearly a century.

"Having carefully reviewed the petition for clemency, the judicial opinions in this case, and other relevant materials, I find no compelling reason to set aside the sentence that was imposed by the Circuit Court and affirmed by all reviewing courts," the governor wrote. "Accordingly, I decline to intervene and have notified the appropriate counsel and family of my decision."

Lewis and her lawyers had formally asked the governor to spare her life, arguing she has an IQ that is borderline mentally retarded and that she was manipulated to commit the crimes by a dominant male co-defendant. She pleaded guilty to her participation in the murders, but now regrets her actions.

Teresa was in bed with her husband when he was blasted with a shotgun by Shallenberger. Julian Lewis survived long enough to tell police: "My wife knows who did this to me." C.J. Lewis was killed by Fuller in his bedroom down the hall.

Despite her guilty plea, a state judge later sentenced Lewis to death while sparing the lives of triggermen Shallenberger and Fuller. The judge at sentencing called her "the head of this serpent."

"I can frankly say that Teresa Lewis is as evil a person as I've ever met," said David Grimes, commonwealth's attorney for Pittsylvania County, who was at the scene of the crimes shortly after they occurred. "I would wager with some assurance that you wouldn't find anyone who knew her before this event occurred who thought she was mentally retarded, or had a limited mentality -- that it would ever cross their minds."

Her supporters say Lewis is deeply remorseful and has been a model prisoner, helping fellow female inmates cope with their circumstances.

Amnesty International and best-selling author John Grisham are among those supporting leniency.

Defense lawyer Jim Rocap argued that such evidence suggested "Teresa could not have been the mastermind."

"Shallenberger has stated, and the experts that have examined her agree, that she was being used by Shallenberger, not the other way around," he said.

"She was exactly what I was looking for," he wrote. "Some ugly bitch who married her husband for the money and I knew I could get to fall head over heels for me."

Furthermore, they said, Shallenberger said he "manipulated the whole thing" and "knew he was going 'take' Lewis from the moment he met her," according to an affidavit from one of their investigators.

But Shallenberger, who committed suicide in 2006, refused to sign the affidavit and actually tore up and ate part of it.
