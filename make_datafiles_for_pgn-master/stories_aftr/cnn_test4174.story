Maybe Twitter can tell us.

Every second, millions of people across the world are sharing their thoughts in the form of 140-character messages using Twitter. The "tweets" range from the mundane to the profound, and convey, for example, what people are doing, thinking and reading at any moment.

The amount of information in any individual tweet is highly variable, but in aggregate the more than 65 million tweets composed per day represent a detailed, real-time trace of the collective thoughts and feelings of a significant fraction of the population -- potentially offering valuable information to everyone from politicians to advertisers to social researchers.

To demonstrate the unique power of Twitter data, our research group at Northeastern University and Harvard Medical School recently began a study to infer the mood of Twitter users in the United States from their public tweets.

We can observe very distinct patterns over the course of the day, as well as weekly patterns that match conventional wisdom, such as the tendency of users to write happier tweets on weekends.

With Twitter, we now not only know which users are communicating, but we also know what they are saying. From a research perspective, Twitter is more than just a new tool; it's an entirely new kind of tool. Never before have academic researchers had access to this much real-time public information about what people are thinking and saying.

In the past, researchers studying traces of human communication, such as phone records, have shown that the social network that connects us has rich hidden complexity. But legal and privacy concerns have caused these previous studies to almost universally omit the content of the communication. Because most users leave their tweets public, Twitter represents an unprecedented opportunity.

Like any scientific tool, the ability to use the data for research is subject to caveats and limitations. Unlike many existing tools, such as surveys and polls, researchers cannot ask a question of the Twitter users directly; instead, researchers must determine whether the question is one that the Twitter data can answer.

From a scientific standpoint, Twitter data can shed light on how information spreads through society. Researchers can also investigate network effects: How does what our friends discuss influence what we discuss?

In short, the data that is now becoming available from Twitter and related websites offers a new lens through which we can view society. It promises new approaches to understanding social phenomena, what some colleagues have dubbed "computational social science."

This new kind of data presents new challenges, such as privacy, anonymity and legality, but developing a science around it has the potential to do enormous good.
