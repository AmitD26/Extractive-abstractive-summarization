Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- An experienced diver and master sergeant in the South Korean navy died Tuesday while conducting rescue efforts for 46 seamen who were aboard a patrol ship when it sank, a military official said.

The 53-year-old chief master sergeant lost consciousness while underwater in the Yellow Sea, the official said. He was taken aboard a U.S. Navy ship, the USS Salvor, but could not be resuscitated.

U.S. divers were on the scene Tuesday and were observing the situation, according to the official. The U.S. divers plan to enter the water on Wednesday, he said.

Citing accounts of rescued sailors who handled the ship's radar, Kim said they reported no signs of a torpedo attack ahead of the explosion.

The navy plans to salvage the vessel, which was carrying missiles and torpedoes, to determine what caused the incident, Yonhap reported.

President Lee Myung-bak has called for a thorough investigation into the cause of the explosion.

Baengyeong Island, the Seoul-administered island near the scene of the accident, is a flash point maritime border area between the Koreas. Given Baengyeong Island's proximity to North Korea, North Korean involvement was feared, but South Korean officials have played down that scenario.

North Korea's official media has yet to mention the incident, according to Yonhap, but accused the United States and South Korea of conducting a maritime drill for the purpose of invading North Korea.

"Military tension is intensifying on the Korean Peninsula due to the brazen moves by the U.S. and its war-mongering puppets to provoke a war," North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said, as reported by Yonhap.

Journalist Andrew Salmon contributed to this report for CNN.
