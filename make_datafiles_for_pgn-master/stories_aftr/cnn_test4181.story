(CNN) -- Move, Sony's new motion controller for the PlayStation 3, has been nearly everywhere in the days and weeks leading up to its official release September 19.

At a demo event in Washington, the man behind the Move, Richard Marks, talked about how the motion controller came to be and where he hopes it will take gaming in the future.

It's not surprising, then, that the hand controllers for the Move, which started showing up in online stores this week, are topped with colored balls that have led some to compare them to ice cream cones.

"The sphere looks the same no matter what angle you hold it," he said. "The camera then tracks the location by the size of the sphere. Bigger sphere means closer to the screen, while smaller means further away."

The development team used foam spheres with some success until a researcher wanted to make the spheres light up. It turned out that lighting the ball helped the EyeToy track the device even better.

"[The researcher] wanted the sphere to change colors to reflect different things in potential gameplay," Marks said. "What we found was that the camera worked better because the colored light in the ball makes it stand out from any background."

The Move and EyeToy actually examine the surroundings of a player for color pixels and then assign a completely different color to light up the sphere. The result is a smoother tracking of movement in three dimensions, something that a similar controller for another console can't do.

Once they got the camera to track a lighted, colored sphere reliably, how could they turn that into a game device?

Marks said that for his very first rudimentary Move controller, he took a regular controller for the PS3 and put the ball on one end.

"I cut the ends off because I wanted to make something that would feel good in one hand and had buttons to help with gameplay," he said. "It wasn't pretty."

The research-and-development team began to tweak the look and feel of the proto-Move controller, adding a gyroscope and accelerometer to assist with game movement.

Marks insisted that the new device keep the buttons from the PS3 controller because he said they are needed to do specific, in-game movements.

He said the Move can pinpoint the position and angle of the player's hand in a way that's perfect for point-of-view games.

"Two Move controllers allow for more detail," Marks explained. "It opens up so many more possibilities for game developers to really put players in the middle of the action. There are a lot of things you can do as long as the platform is good."

"I want new ways to show up to do things we haven't even thought of," Marks said. "The Move isn't going away any time soon."
