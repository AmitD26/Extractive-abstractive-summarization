The Board of Control for Cricket in India held an emergency meeting on the matter in Nagpur on Wednesday, and president Shashank Manohar said the dispute between Rendezvous Sports World and a group of investment firms who share the ownership must be resolved.

"The governing council has invoked clause 12 (1) against the Kochi team and served a 30-day notice. If they fail to provide a satisfactory reply the franchise would get cancelled on the 31st day. This was an unanimous decision," Manohar said, the UK Press Association reported.

Rendezvous owns 26 percent of the $333 million franchise, which was bought at a public auction in March, and the five other firms hold 74 percent.

"We are thankful that they have given us enough time to tie up our differences. We had asked for a grace period of 10 days but we got 30, so I am sure we will do it at the earliest," he said.

"Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab had changed their shareholding pattern without informing the BCCI. There is no such breach in this instance," he said.

"There is no transfer of control issue here, and this is only a dispute within the owners. Therefore, this is a remedial case."

The Royals, who won the inaugural IPL in 2008, have taken their case to the high court in Bombay and it has been adjourned until October 29.

Batsman Katich also returned home with a thumb injury and quick bowler Harris had knee surgery in July.

However, Cricket Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said all three should be ready to play for their state teams next month and be available for the first match of five against the tourists in Brisbane.

The Australians are seeking to win back the Ashes following last year's 2-1 series defeat in England.
