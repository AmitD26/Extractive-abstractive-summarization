Money expert Suze Orman answers the question that keeps people up at night: Can I afford this?

Michaela estimates her husband has spent about $25,000 on his "man cave"--including a $2,200 television, a $900 surround-sound system, custom-framed photos worth about $300 and a poker table worth $500 to $1,000.

Chris estimates that he spends about $7,000 a year on his hobby. Can he keep it up? Orman runs the numbers.

Chris and Michaela's monthly income is $9,000, and their monthly expenses are $7,700. Even with $1,300 leftover every month, they still face their large student debts and only have $5,000 in an emergency fund.

"In this economy, what I'd like to see is that people have at least an eight-month emergency fund, which would be $40,000 because we have three children here," Orman says.

Orman denies Chris -- but with love. "We only have $5,000 of an emergency fund," she says.

"What is the rule of thumb? You plan for the worst and you hope for the best," Orman says. "But [Chris is] in sales. Anybody in sales, anything can happen at any time. So I love that you love football ... But you cannot afford it, sir."

Ken and Deb are a couple facing a heart-wrenching life decision in the middle of a poor economy -- divorce. Married for 12 years, the couple has a 9-year-old son and twin 7-year-old girls, one with Down's Syndrome.

"Having the three children, it's been taxing on us. It just seems like we never get a chance to be alone and be together and just talk things out," Ken says. "We're just not on the same page."

"Ken and I have been living in separate rooms since last November. He lives down the hall in what used to be our home office, and it's very difficult living under the same roof," Deb says. "Unfortunately, we cannot afford to financially divorce and move on with our lives."

In April 2009, Ken and Deb will be officially divorced. To complicate matters, Ken recently found out that he will be losing his job. "I think if Ken and I separated, we'd both be more relaxed and we'd be happier people," Deb says. "Obviously, we cannot afford to maintain separate households."

Deb has come to Orman for help with her question -- can she afford to get divorced?

Before Ken lost his job, the couple made a combined $4,500 a month. With only Deb's income, the household total will decrease to $1,645. Monthly expenses that will not decrease total about $4,300 each month. The couple also has $10,000 in credit card debt.

Despite their precarious financial situation, Orman approves Deb for a divorce.

Orman says Deb could rent an apartment for about $800 a month. "And on everything else that I figured for her, she could live in that apartment with her children and make it for $1,645 a month, also assuming that one day Ken will have to pay child support when he does get a job," Orman says.

Still, Orman says the real question here isn't about the money. "Can she afford not to, emotionally speaking?" Orman says.

Because Deb says she never puts herself first, Orman wants to know how much longer Deb would stay in a marriage she says is already over.

"How much longer are you going to stay in a situation that you know is absolutely over because you think you don't have the money to leave?" Orman says. "You lose your soul for money. You lose your children in terms of not understanding what's happening for money. Is money worth that?"

But Deb's not alone. Orman says the No.1 deficit in this country is women not taking care of themselves. "Women give of themselves. They never give to themselves. And that we have to change," Orman says.
