(CNN) -- Lindsay Spencer was two years out of college and facing one of the biggest decisions of her young life: what to do with those Facebook friend requests from people she met through her job.

Many of the job-related friend requests came after meeting people at conferences. Eventually they would find her by searching on Facebook and request to be "friended."

Initially Spencer decided to ignore the requests. After all, does a virtual stranger really care what her favorite movies are? Do they really benefit from learning details about her weekend leisure time?

Spencer's answer was to create a second Facebook page, which she devotes to work-related information.

This means she now has her "friend friends," about 400 of them, and then she has her "work friends," four, so far.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, says Paul Levinson, professor of communication and media studies at Fordham University in New York.

And with the popularity of smartphones and other handheld devices, many people carry their work into their homes and are never separated from e-mail.

And again, Levinson doesn't think it's a bad thing to have access to all this information about work and co-workers.

Spencer, who has friended her manager but not her big boss, says she likes to think her co-workers are sensible enough not to put out too much information -- especially photographs -- on social networking sites.

And so far, so good. There have been no embarrassing images of drunken escapades, no status updates erupting with emotional outbursts.

Social networking sites have both good and bad uses in the business world, says Dr. Lynn Friedman, a clinical psychologist and adjunct faculty member at Johns Hopkins University.

Face time vs. Facebook time

But people can use the sites too much and as a consequence give less time to meeting with co-workers in person.

Paula Pile, a psychologist who practices in North Carolina, says you need to be careful to make sure that social networking sites aren't encroaching on your office time.

More than an hour a day is excessive, she warns. Worse, spending too much time on the sites can disrupt your balance between work and private time.

It can also take you out of your family time with your spouse or children.

"If you are spending two hours at home on them each night, you are not available to your family," she says.

Friedman also suggests setting goals for using social networking sites and telling others about your limits to avoid hurt feelings.

She uses an example of someone who lets people know, "I don't do those things at nights or on weekends so I can have my time with family."
