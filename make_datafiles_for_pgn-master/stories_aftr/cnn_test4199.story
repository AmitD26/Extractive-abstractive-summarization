Gattuso had already had an altercation with 59-year-old Jordan, who ironically starred for Milan during his playing career, earlier in Tottenham's 1-0 win, before the two went head-to-head again at the final whistle.

Why Gattuso has to lose his cool

"I made a mistake doing what I did to an older person, and that's it. I will wait and see what UEFA decides now," he added.

And European football's governing body UEFA have already issued a statement saying: "UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Gennaro Gattuso after the incidents that took place after the match between AC Milan and  Tottenham.

"The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body will meet next Monday February 21 to discuss this case."

"I didn't like this episode, it's not nice to see, of course it will be looked at by UEFA, there was certainly a reason that he behaved this way but you can't excuse it."

Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp added: "Gattuso had a flair-up with Joe Jordan. I don't know why. He obviously hasn't done his homework. He really could have picked a fight with someone other than Joe.
