Then finally he is left alone to prepare for this night's performance of Benjamin Britten's "The Turn of the Screw." Alone except for his mother. Michael Kepler Meo is just 12 years old.

Michael's professional singing career began just a couple of years ago. He had been singing in a boys' choir in his native Portland, Oregon. It was one activity among many along with soccer and learning guitar. The Portland Opera company was holding auditions for "The Turn of the Screw" and Michael's choirmaster suggested he give it a try.

Michael won the role of Miles, a troubled boy threatened by menacing ghosts in a rambling English country home. It is a pivotal role in the production. He also starred in the premier performance of "The Golden Ticket," an operatic version of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."

Conlon says only a handful of boys are capable of taking on operatic roles. "You have to find somebody whose voice is strong enough, and somebody who can sing at all levels with a very focused tone. And Michael fits all of those characteristics."

Michael works hard in rehearsals, enjoys the performances and loves the applause.

"He is lucky that he found something that he is so good at at so young an age," says his mom.

By almost any measure, Michael's rise in the world of opera has been meteoric. As soon as his role in "The Turn of the Screw" ends in Los Angeles, he's off to New York and a New York City Opera production of "SÃ©ance on a Wet Afternoon."

But how long can it last? It won't be long before the boy soprano's voice changes. What then?

It will be a challenge, but, "It may be better," Michael says. "In opera you can sing even if you are old."
