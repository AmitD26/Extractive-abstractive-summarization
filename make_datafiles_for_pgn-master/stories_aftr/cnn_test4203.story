Christopher Tierney, 31, was moved into the center after being discharged from New York's Bellevue Hospital on December 28.

His father, Tim Tierney, said he isn't sure when his son will arrive at his Portsmouth, New Hampshire, home, but said he is scheduled to be released from the facility Wednesday.

Christopher Tierney suffered four broken ribs; a hairline skull fracture; a broken scapula, or shoulder blade; a bruised lung; three cracked vertebrae; and broken bones below his elbow in the December 20 fall, the elder Tierney has said.

Tim Tierney said his son is improving.

The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and Howell (aka The Edge), is the most expensive in Broadway history, but production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems.

Once Christopher Tierney is home, his family plans a belated Christmas celebration, Tim Tierney said.

"Spider-Man was on a bridge, and Mary Jane was dangling from it," he said. "I think he was meant to sort of swoop over there, but he just fell off ... the harness, you could see it just flick off his back and fly backward."
