An election rife with fraud had ousted him from the race. Martelly's dreams of leading Haiti were all but dead. But four months of recounts and reviews and then a runoff changed everything, and the unexpected candidate is poised now to move into the presidential office.

Unexpected because Martelly has never been a politician.

Already the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti is reeling from devastation caused by last year's massive earthquake followed by a cholera epidemic later in the year.

On the streets of Port-au-Prince, thousands turned out to chant one of his most popular nicknames: "Tet Kale," which means bald head in Creole. Haitians, especially the youth, were starving for a fresh face. And they got it Monday when the election council announced preliminary results.

Martelly won by a landslide with 67.6% of the vote, soundly defeating his challenger, former first lady Mirlande Manigat, who received 31.5%.

"This was a man who could move millions with a microphone," Pierre-Pierre said.

His supporters took to the streets, angry at what they said was a rigged election.

Then came a review of the vote, monitored by the Organization of American States.

Martelly appeared in jeans and a button-down shirt at his plush home in Peguyville, a suburb of Port-au-Prince up in the hills. A silver arm cuff hugged his right wrist and he sipped hard on his favorite ice-cream soda. He sat at a table surrounded by a piano and eight wall-mounted speakers. It was not hard to tell this was a party house.

"This is a very dangerous corner in Haiti's history," he said. "But it's a revolution that can be done peacefully through the election."

Under the father-and-son Duvalier dictatorship, Haitians lacked freedom, but the people had clean roads, electricity, jobs, security, Martelly said. When democracy came overnight to this Caribbean nation, people didn't know how to handle it.

"We are ruled by corruption," he said. "The people have no confidence in their government."

The lack of confidence was further eroded by a presidential election in disarray.

"You know how (U.S. President Barack) Obama said it's not about the man, but it's about the plan?" he said. "Here it's more about the man than about the plan."

Haiti will go nowhere, he said, unless the people have a president they can trust, a president who is honest. He was that man, he insisted.

He said his background in music as well as social work -- he founded an aid agency that helps the poor -- gave him 22 years on the ground. The people know him, he said. He was their light at the end of the tunnel.

But the man also had plans.

He said, for instance, that the $12 billion that was pledged by the international community for earthquake assistance should come in the form of infrastructure, not money, because Haitians don't know how to manage money.

"People are fed up here," he said. "They have no food, no education, no health care. What kind of place is it when a young girl will sell her body to buy a phone card?"

"He's stepping into not only a complicated moment in Haitian history but he is also stepping into the wasp's nest of Haitian politics," said Amy Wilentz, author of "The Rainy Season: Haiti Then and Now."

"I don't see any reason to believe or not to believe he will be good at it," Wilentz said. "I think Haiti needs a fresh start. It needs to step out of the muck."

Maybe, she said, Martelly is the man to do just that.

But look what happened to Aristide, Pierre-Pierre said, referring to the fall of Haiti's first democratically elected president, who coincidentally returned from exile just days before last month's election.

"He is a musician and a good one at that," he said.

That makes Pierre-Pierre a fan of Sweet Mickey but not necessarily a supporter of Martelly's. Ultimately, Pierre-Pierre said, what does an entertainer know about Haiti's role in the world.

"It's sort of a bad joke," Stotzky said.

But criticism doesn't deter Martelly. When asked in December whether a man who made a name dancing and singing had the mettle for his nation's top job, he smiled.
