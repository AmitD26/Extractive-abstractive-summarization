Now the 29-year-old has swapped the ice for a rugby ball as she sets out on her quest to be a Summer Olympian with the United States sevens team at the Rio Games in 2016.

It's an ambitious bid -- Meyers had never played the game until two weeks ago.

"I'm offside all the time," she says frankly. "I'm running ahead of the ball all the time.

Meyers could have been forgiven for taking more time off after the Olympics. With a bronze from Vancouver four years ago, she had gone to Sochi seeking gold with new partner Lauryn Williams -- a track star who tasted success at London 2012 in the 4 x 100 meters relay and won 400m silver in 2004.

"So how does it feel to feel like you choked in front of the whole world? How does it feel to have your lifelong dream slip away literally from your fingertips? It sucks. Was I too exhausted? Did I just finally hit my mental limits? I don't know."

"A couple of girls on the bobsleigh team had previously played rugby and made the switch," she says. "So I thought why can't I do it the other way around?

"Even though I haven't played the game before, I think they looked at me and thought I was the right build. I'm a big girl -- I'm 175 lbs and 5 foot 8 inches -- so I knew I wasn't worried about doing the hitting or getting hit.

"I think I was just worried about not knowing the rules. It's been a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire, but it's been a blast."

The switch of sports is nothing new for her. Her first sporting foray of note had been in softball and there were hopes of being selected for the U.S. team for the 2008 Olympics. She missed out, and the sport was duly scrapped from the Olympic schedule.

By then, her focus had already switched to the bobsleigh, an event she first tried out in 2007.

It has brought her two Olympic medals and two world titles, as well as a fiance -- fellow American bobsledder Nic Taylor.

As if mastering a new sport wasn't enough, Meyers is now planning a wedding for April 24.

"It's been crazy but it's mostly planned. Obviously the focus was on Sochi so we were a little bit late out with the invitations but we're steadily getting the RSVPs in," she says.

The pressure is on Meyers to play a remarkable game of catchup with her fellow American rugby players as she attempts to marry her strengths to the requirements of the code -- a shortened version of the 15-a-side union format.

But as an athlete nicknamed "E-Money" -- from her ability to deliver when it counts in the pressure situations -- she is confident she will get to grips with it.

"But that's some way off. My legs were burning so much from that first week. It's not that I'm not fit but this is such a different level of fitness, there's so much cardio.

"But I'm optimistic that I'll get better ... a lot better. To get to Rio would just be super crazy."

"Lauryn talked about how special the Summer Games was, how huge it was," says Meyers. "She talked a lot about the pressure of being on the start line for the 100m final.

"I've basically been asking her for as much information as possible. She's given me some good advice."

Meyers has oval-ball history -- her father used to play in the NFL for the Atlanta Falcons, though his career was coming to an end when she was young.

"I really remember there was a McDonald's nearby and I remember eating a cheeseburger in the playground when the Falcon appeared. I'm not sure my Dad appreciates that being my favorite memory of him playing."

Despite her new sporting flirtation, Meyers is not divorcing herself from the ice track just yet.
