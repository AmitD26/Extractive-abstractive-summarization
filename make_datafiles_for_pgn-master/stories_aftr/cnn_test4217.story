The 500-acre gated community features plane enthusiasts who build custom homes on lots that include hangars. The community has a runway so that people can fly from their homes.

"The vision was to have a variety of great airplanes, a variety of great pilots," Leeward said in a documentary about his ranch.

"And a place where everybody could really have a lot of fun. I wanted that as part of my vision to be something that was just like my father had in the 1930s."

His family also left a message on the page.

Leeward, a son of a pilot, said that he was raised in airports. He worked as a stunt pilot in several films, including "Amelia" and "The Tuskegee Airmen."

He had been part of the Reno air race since 1975, said Mike Houghton, president of the Reno Air Racing Association.

"He was very active in aviation. He did a lot of stunt flying for movies," he said. "He was a close personal friend. Well liked. Great guy. Great family man."
