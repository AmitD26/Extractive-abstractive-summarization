After eight victims were buried, protesters shouted slogans including, "The people demand the fall of the regime," Tarif said.

National security forces left the marchers alone because the dead had been declared martyrs, the source said, requesting not to be named for safety reasons.

The government did not immediately confirm there had been a march or that security forces had steered clear.

The Damascus Center for Human Rights Studies said Sunday that 123 people have died since the start of the unrest in Syria last month.

Opposition leaders circulated a list of demands, saying that if the regime were to respond positively, they would not call for the government's collapse. The demands include the immediate release of political prisoners, lifting of emergency and martial law, and withdrawal of intelligence forces from Syrian cities.

The government resigned last week in the face of protests that have left at least dozens dead.

At least 15 people were killed in Douma on Friday, Tarif said Sunday. He based his tally on calls to hospitals and relatives of the victims, he said. Eight people were buried Sunday, he added.

SANA reported that a girl was killed when the armed group opened fire on civilians in the city of Homs.

The agency cited an official source as saying that snipers from the group fired at citizens and security forces from rooftops.

Activists and witnesses dispute the government account, telling CNN that government snipers fired shots at unarmed protesters and government forces beat demonstrators.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said security forces in the volatile southern city of Daraa and in Homs arrested  about 20 people on Saturday after demonstrations the day before.

Along with the protests in Douma, Daraa, Homs and Al Sanameen, people also took to the streets in Latakia, Baniyas and Kamishli on Friday, activists told CNN.

Before Friday's fighting, dozens of people were killed in the last two weeks across Syria, with many deaths reported in the southern city of Daraa, where popular demonstrations started, and the coastal city of Latakia, activists say.

It called for an amended constitution accommodating "a multi-party democracy" and guaranteeing "basic human rights," the establishment "of a truly independent judiciary system," freedom of information and expression and an end to "the existing corruption in Syria."
