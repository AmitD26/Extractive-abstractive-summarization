That mystery man is Laurence Leavy. He is the Marlins Man. And he loves watching sports in person and up close.

The event that triggered Leavy to start attending so many games was a breakup. He says he was in a relationship with a woman who didn't like sporting events. "So when I stopped seeing her, I decided I'm going to start going to stuff I'm watching on TV. That was about 15 years ago, and I've been doing it ever since."

He is a Marlins season ticket holder, with two seats -- you guessed it -- behind home plate at Marlins Park. He also has four tickets in the first row by first base. He says gives those away to his employees or strangers before games.

"Nobody ever noticed me when I used to wear like a Yankees hat or a Cowboys jersey or anything like that, and I used to wear Marlins teal," Leavy said. "But in 2012, when I went to the World Series for the Giants game, people noticed me wearing an orange Marlins jersey behind the Giants bench, and that's kind of how the whole thing started with people knowing who I am and what I did."

On Thursday, Leavy said he knew he was in for a ride when he saw himself on the front page of Wednesday's USA Today. So why is he getting noticed by so many now? Leavy said he thinks things got big because of the color contrast with the Royals blue.

"It's a wonderful experience, and I've decided I want to keep doing this, so I am going to keep doing it," Leavy said. "I've been asked a lot recently, 'Are you going to keep doing this?' And I said, 'Why not?' So I'm doing this."
