(CNN) -- Magnificent snow-peaked summits and quaint thousand-year-old villages provide the backdrop for an unforgettable adventure in Nepal. Exploring the dramatic landscape on foot is nothing short of extraordinary, trekkers say.

"[One night] the back doors were open towards the view of Mount Everest and the other peaks of the Himalayas. It was so beautiful with snow-capped mountains and the sky was full of stars. I think that was one of the most magical moments I've ever had," says iReporter Kuna Rajandran, who trekked to Everest base camp in April.

Planning a Nepal expedition may seem daunting at first -- and you will be challenged -- but in the end, itÂ¹s worth it. You will come away with some of the greatest memories of your life, from savoring locally cooked meals at teahouses to soaking in breathtaking views of the high Himalayas, according to adventurers who've made the trip.

Worlds away in Kathmandu

Experts urge travelers to be wary of individual porters and guides who approach you on the streets of Kathmandu. They are most likely uninsured, cautions Mohan Lamsal, general secretary of Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal (TAAN). Have a detailed discussion with your chosen trekking company to assess their professionalism, Lamsal advises.

Be careful not to overestimate your abilities. Even if you feel completely comfortable with the people and the landscape and think you can make the trek on your own -- don't. Trekking with at least one companion is a must, especially if you're a beginner, experienced trekkers say.

Since both the Annapurna base camp and Everest Base camp treks are located in conservation areas, you will need permits, said iReporter Barry Wenlock, a Kathmandu resident and an experienced Himalayan trekker who has been leading tours since 1995. You can get permits before you begin or upon entry into the parks. Additionally, every trekker needs a Trekkers' Information Management System (TIMS) pass. You or your trip organizer can get this card, which is part of a database that stores visitor information for safety reasons.

"There are such beautiful forests [at the foothills of the Annapurna], and it's Nepal's primary rhododendron forest, so if you visit there in the last week of March, first week of April, the rhododendrons are full and it's an absolutely staggeringly beautiful place. And the pink and red rhododendrons all up the hillside, a few magnolias mixed in, some jasmine," Wenlock says.

It's cold in Nepal -- really cold. Weather-appropriate supplies are a must for any trekker, novice or expert. Remember to pack your warmest down jacket and broken-in hiking boots as well as sun and eye protection.

iReporter Udayan Mishra, a Kathmandu resident who has been on several expeditions in Nepal, suggests taking the trek gradually to acclimatize yourself -- overexertion in the beginning may lead to problems later on.

Make sure you have enough Nepalese currency before you get on the path. Gakos recalls that there was "one ATM on the whole trek." And even if there is an ATM, there's no guarantee that it has been recently stocked with money.

There are two typical types of treks: the more popular teahouse trekking and a fully organized camping trip. A teahouse trek gives you the comfort of knowing that lodging and food will be provided. You can carry additional supplies -- clothing, snacks, sleeping bag -- on your own or hire a porter to carry it for you.

Once you finish walking, five to six hours on average per day, you settle down in a village. If you don't have a guide to recommend a teahouse, talk to other travelers and consult guidebooks for suggestions. In teahouses that provide lodging and food, guests are expected to eat at least two meals: dinner at night and breakfast the next morning, Gakos says.

Don't expect a hotel experience -- expect better. Nepali locals are known for being extremely kind and hospitable. Wenlock says you'll be treated like family during your stay. Gakos was looking for that kind of personal exchange.

'"That's why] we picked Annapurna, it was the perfect balance of wilderness and viewing the high Himalayas while also getting the Nepali culture," Gakos says.
