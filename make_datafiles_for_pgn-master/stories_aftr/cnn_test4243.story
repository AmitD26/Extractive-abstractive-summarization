By a 51-48 mostly party line vote, the motion by Democrats to table the amendment succeeded, effectively killing it. Three Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the tabling motion, while one Republican -- retiring moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine -- voted with Democrats in favor.

The so-called "conscience" amendment, sponsored by Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, was the Senate Republicans' response to the simmering controversy over a recent Obama administration decision to mandate the kind of health care coverage provided by religious employers.

The specific potential impact of the amendment was a matter of debate. On his website, Blunt rejected complaints that it would have allowed anyone to deny coverage of anything for any reason.

Representatives from many faiths opposed the decision, calling it a violation of their religious conscience.

In response to the uproar, the White House backed off the directive and instead said that religious employers could opt out of offering coverage for birth control, but insurance companies would have to offer such coverage separately and at no charge.

Some critics say the White House's changed position does not go far enough.

Part of the uproar surrounded universities and hospitals affiliated with religions, which were not given the same exemptions as churches and other religious institutions.

The Blunt amendment would have established that an entity refusing coverage on religious or moral grounds is not in violation of the law. It did not mention contraception specifically and included health insurance companies .

To get a vote on the Blunt amendment, it was tacked onto a $109 billion transportation bill, raising complaints from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, that the proposal was not germane to the legislation.

Because of the dispute, action stalled on the transportation bill, which is backed by both parties.

Reid said Tuesday that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, insisted on a floor vote on the Blunt amendment "before we can move ahead with this jobs bill."

"Once we have put this extreme and distracting proposal behind us, I hope my Republican colleagues will stop living in the past and join us this year, 2012, and help us create jobs," Reid said.

Blunt welcomed the vote by tweeting, "Glad Sen. Reid is going to allow a vote on my bipartisan admt to protect religious freedom this Thursday. #HHSMandate."

Voting on the amendment forced senators to take a stand on the controversial contraception decision. Though many Republicans have come out in support of the measure, Snowe told MSNBC the amendment is "much broader than I could support."

A CNN/ORC International poll earlier this month showed a partisan divide on the issue, with 70% of Democrats agreeing with the Obama administration policy while 85% of Republicans opposed it. Independents were statistically split.
