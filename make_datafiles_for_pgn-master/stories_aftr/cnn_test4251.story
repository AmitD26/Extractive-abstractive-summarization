Sudanese journalist Lubna Ahmed al-Hussein was facing 40 lashes for wearing trousers.

Lubna al-Hussein, a journalist who worked in the media department of the United Nations mission in Sudan, was jailed Monday for refusing to pay a court-ordered fine, her lawyer, Nabil Adib, said.

No further details of her release were immediately available.

Al-Hussein had faced 40 lashes for wearing pants deemed too tight and a blouse considered too sheer.

She will appeal her verdict in an effort to have the conservative Muslim government's decency law declared unconstitutional, her attorney said by phone Monday from Khartoum, Sudan.

Al-Hussein, who was arrested in July, pleaded not guilty during her one-day trial, Adib said. She was not allowed to call defense witnesses or present a defense case, he added.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he is concerned about al-Hussein's case.

In August, scores of protesters supporting al-Hussein gathered outside the courtroom in Khartoum, waving banners and wearing headbands with the messages, "No return to the dark ages" and "No to suppressing women."

A Sudanese official accused "the West" of interfering in the case.

Al-Hussein was arrested along with 18 other women on July 3 at a Khartoum restaurant when police burst in and checked women for their clothing. At the time of her arrest she was wearing pants, a blouse and a hijab -- a headscarf worn by Muslim women, she said.
