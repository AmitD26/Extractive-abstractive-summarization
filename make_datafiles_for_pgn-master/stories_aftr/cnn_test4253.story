With the playoff first leg in Bosnia tied 0-0, Portugal were looking for a fast start and got it as Real Madrid star Ronaldo netted early with a trademark free-kick.

How should football tackle racism?

An incident-packed second half saw Bosnia lose Senad Lulic for a second yellow, but a goal from Emir Spahic gave them renewed hope against the nervy hosts.

However, a late double from Helder Postiga and a further strike from Miguel Veloso saw the Euro 2004 runners-up romp home in spectacular style.

The Irish -- whose only previous appearance in the finals of a European Championship was in 1988 -- opened the scoring through Stephen Ward after 32 minutes.

Estonia's Konstantin Vassiljev equalized in the second half with a long-range shot which eluded goalkeeper Shay Given.

The Czech Republic booked a fifth successive Euro finals place with a 1-0 win in Montenegro.
