(CNN) -- All this month, we will see thousands of college students from coast to coast, north to south, east to west, jumping up and down, yelling, screaming, pumping fists, sleeping outside in tents, painting their faces -- all a result of the usual frenzy surrounding March Madness.

That's the scene we see every year when college basketball teams are fighting and clawing their way to one of the precious 65 seeds that enter the NCAA Tournament.

But instead of doing all of that for basketball, these same students should say the heck with the games and put their energy, zeal and passion into two fundamental issues posing the most dramatic barriers to their college education: the rising cost of tuition and the lack of financial aid.

On Thursday, we saw students begin this process by leading rallies in cities nationwide to protest rising tuition costs. While our political leaders in Washington, D.C., are decrying the rising cost of health care, college tuition is exploding across the nation, from community colleges to technical schools to four-year public and private schools.

The Obama administration has proposed eliminating the substantial subsidies banks enjoy for handling most of the federal college loans processed, with virtually no risk. Federal officials say the banks are reaping upwards of $9 billion a year in these subsidies, which include interest collected, and the Obama administration wants to push more of that money to students by increasing Pell grants and Perkins loans.

There are some grass-roots organizations fighting the banks, such as the United States Students Association, but they are going up against entrenched interests, and some of those are university officials. In some cases, the banking industry has used its financial power to wine and dine college officials, lavishing gifts, golf trips and other perks to keep them in line. So some of the very folks who should want students to get as much money as possible to stay in school are not always operating in their best interests.

So here you have two fundamental roadblocks facing students, and too many are only complaining about them and not focusing on action. Some even suggest they have no power to fight such well-funded interests. I say nonsense.

Over the course of our history, it has always been the nation's young who took to the streets, statehouses, college campuses and the halls of Congress to demand change.

It worked then, and it can work now.

It's time that we see college students, high school students who are looking forward to college, and the parents who are bearing the burden of paying for it, join those who are still paying back student loans to identify the banks that are fighting changes in the financial aid system and do the following if those banks persist:

• Stage pickets and sit-ins. Imagine what would happen if thousands of students fanned out across a city and picketed and actually led sit-ins in the banks. Yes, shut them down.

• Rally the masses online. Today's generation is far more proficient at text messages, social media and online video. Instead of talking about the latest celebrity news, use online media to galvanize and build a national movement.

• Hit the hallways of Congress and state legislatures. The heck with going skiing or hitting the beach during spring break. If they are still in session, come up with a list of legislators not fighting rising tuition or who are in the pockets of Sallie Mae and the banks. Send throngs of students from each district and make it clear that you will organize young voters and parents in those districts and throw them out of office if they continue to allow the banks to run roughshod.

Students, basketball is wonderful, and seeing your team in the Big Dance is great. But if tuition keeps going up and less money is available in the form of financial aid, you'll be cheering from afar because you won't be able to keep going to that school.

For America to be strong, we must cultivate, teach and train the next generation of leaders.

Students, the time for talk is over. The time for action is now. Many of you went to the polls to vote for Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain. Election Day 2008 was not the end, but the beginning. If you want change, then you better work for it.
