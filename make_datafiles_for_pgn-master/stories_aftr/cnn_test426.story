The man was flying for delivery a Cessna 310 twin-engine aircraft from Monterey, California, to Hilo when he radioed federal aviation authorities that he was 500 miles out and low on fuel, said Petty Officer 3rd Class Angela Henderson, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard.

The plane didn't make it, running out of fuel as the pilot had predicted.

"The pilot ditched his airplane at approximately 5:23 p.m. and climbed out of the cockpit onto the wing," the Coast Guard said in a statement.

Video released Saturday by the Coast Guard shows the small aircraft skimming along the water before coming to a stop. It eventually settles and floats in the water, seemingly intact and with its nose pointed in the opposite direction from which it came.

A man is then shown being pulled from the water toward the helicopter.

After being rescued, the pilot was transported to Hilo Medical Center for evaluation, Henderson said.

"He was reported to be coherent with no significant injuries," the statement said.

American King Air Services, an airplane ferry service, said on its website Saturday that the pilot had "successfully ditched." It said that he is "in good condition," and that the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident.

Hilo is about 2,300 miles west of Monterey, where the pilot's flight began.
