London (CNN) -- The European head of consumer goods giant Unilever believes that improving the company's environmental practices could help double its sales, such is the appetite from customers from sustainably-made products.

Jan Zijderveld, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate's president of Europe, said there was a clear demand from consumers for "green" products.

He said the days were gone when consumers were driven by low prices alone. "The funny thing is that for the consumer, 'good value' doesn't necessarily mean 'cheap.'"

While the company had strong global credentials, having operated in Asia for more than a century, it had recently been extending further into emerging markets such as Russia.

The emerging markets compared favorably to Europe in their attitudes toward business, he said

"The environment is much more pro-business ... they understand that business is a force for good. Business generates new products, it generates jobs, it pays taxes," he said. "It is a lot easier to do business in the emerging world -- it is a lot more proactive, it is less bureaucratic."

He felt there was "too much negativism" towards business in Europe, and said he would like to see a cultural and policy shift to create a more dynamic, innovative business sector.

"To get the innovation through takes too long, to get approvals through takes too long, so things are just too slow and too bureaucratic," he said. "If we want to reinvent this continent and make it creative, growing and dynamic, you need to loosen it up a little, give it some fresh air ... Europe needs a little bit of a spring clean to be able to innovate again and grow again."
