"The decision was absolutely not, despite what's been reported in the media, influenced by any one group," said Lowe's vice president of marketing, Tom Lamb. He said that the decision to stop advertising on the show had been made before the Florida Family Association emailed Lowe's CEO, Robert Niblock.

Lamb's statements were made after the company met with North Carolina clergy members who delivered a petition from people opposed to the retailer's decision to pull commercials, according to the Charlotte Observer. Lowe's is based in Mooresville, North Carolina.

"We're surprised at how much happened and how quickly it happened in the context of an advertising decision," Lamb said.

Meanwhile, the Florida Family Association claims that more than a million people sent emails companies who advertised on the TLC show and asked them to stop.
