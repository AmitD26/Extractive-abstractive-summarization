Pacquiao appeared to dominate Bradley during the fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Saturday night, but the judges felt otherwise.

Defeat leaves 'Pacman' fans stunned

Bradley, a native of Cathedral City, California, remains unbeaten with 29 wins, along with one no-contest. Pacquiao suffered his first loss since 2005.

Some analysts believed Pacquiao would win the bout, given he was arguably the world's best pound-for-pound fighter. He was the first fighter to win world titles in eight weight classes, but none of that mattered Saturday.

'Shocked' by 'local hero' Bradley win

Now, the question is what Bradley's win or Pacquiao's loss will mean for boxing. After the bout, both announced they were interested in a rematch. Many fans have called for a potential showdown between Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr.
