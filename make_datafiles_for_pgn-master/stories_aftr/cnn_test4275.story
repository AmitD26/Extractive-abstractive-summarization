(CNN) -- Chelsea booked a semifinal date with Champions League holders Barcelona with a 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge over 10-man Benfica Wednesday.

A first half penalty from Frank Lampard was canceled out by a late Javi Garcia header for the battling visitors, who had Maxi Pereira sent off just before halftime.

Chelsea, who won 1-0 win in Lisbon last week, went through 3-1 on aggregate.

Former World Player of the Year Kaka capped an electrifying first half performance with the second on 36 minutes with a curling shot.

The visitors, the first Cypriot team to reach the last eight of the Champions League, had brief cause for celebration through a Gustavo Manduca goal just after the hour mark, but Ronaldo grabbed his second with a stunning free kick to re-open a two-goal advantage on the night.

It was his eighth in the Champions League this season and leaves him one short of 50 in all competitions.

Hamit Altintop brought down Adorno for a penalty and Estbeban Solari sent Iker Casillas the wrong way.

Chelsea's continued their passage under interim manager Roberto Di Matteo, but their fans were kept on the edge of their seats until the very end of their second leg tie.

Benfica made a bright start but when Garcia brought down Ashley Cole to concede a penalty, well-taken by Lampard, Chelsea could breath easier.

"We knew before the game we were going to face a difficult game tonight and it proved that.

"Benfica are a good side, but we are pleased we are in the semifinal now. The second goal was missing to kill the game. With a 1-0 lead they still had a chance and they knew that. We missed a lot of chances to kill the game," he told ITV Sport.
