That tweets caused a backlash on the social networking site, with readers accusing her of "begging for viewers" and being "desperate."

Oprah followed up with a flurry of defensive replies that were apparently in response to reader criticism: "The word 'please' is used as courtesy not a beg ... 'desperate' not ever a part of my vocab ... 'unethical' a little harsh don't u think? Seemed like it made sense to me. Sorry if u're offended."

As Deadline noted, networks are not allowed to specifically target Nielsen subscribers. It's policy prohibits "attempts to single out panel members ... to change their viewing habits."

UPDATE: Oprah Winfrey released this statement: "I removed the tweet at the request of Nielsen. I intended no harm and apologize for the reference."
