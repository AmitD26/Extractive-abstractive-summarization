Hours later, Gov. Paul LePage said negotiations with Hickox over where she could go had failed, adding that he would "exercise the full extent of his authority allowable by law" to keep her away from public places.

"I don't want her within three feet of anybody," LePage told CNN affiliate WCSH.

The state has made it clear it's going to do something. But what?

"The first thing the governor has to do, which he has not yet done, is get a court order which requires her to stay in quarantine," CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. "There is no court order now. She's not violating anything by taking a bike ride or leaving her house."

There's no guarantee the governor will be able to get a court order, Toobin said, "because, according to the science, she is not in a communicable situation."

It's unclear what the exact sticking point has been in negotiations between the state and the nurse. At first, Maine officials said they wanted Hickox to remain at home for 21 days -- the deadly virus' incubation period. Since then, they've said they want Hickox -- who has twice tested negative for Ebola and says she feels healthy -- to avoid public places such as stores during that time.

Attorney: Nurse was making a point with bike ride

Hickox has said it's state officials who aren't being reasonable. She contends the U.S. Constitution and science are on her side.

Hickox has said she's willing to compromise with the state, and that she's open to travel restrictions barring her from public transportation and limiting her to Fort Kent, a town of 4,000 on the Canadian border.

"So I think there are things that, I know, work," she said. "And I know all aid workers are willing to do those things. But I'm not willing to stand here and let my civil rights be violated when it's not science-based."

What could be next?

When she returned from a month working with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone last week, Hickox had a temperature at an airport in Newark, New Jersey, officials said. She was put into an isolation tent.
