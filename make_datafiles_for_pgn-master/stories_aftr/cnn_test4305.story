The 5.4-magnitude earthquake hit near the border with Myanmar, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

It collapsed houses in the remote Yingjiang county in Yunnan province, according to a county official who would provide only his surname, Ke -- a common practice among officials.

The epicenter was 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the center of Yingjiang county, which has a population of more than 270,000 and is home to several of China's ethnic minorities.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed condolences on behalf of the Obama administration.

"As people in Yunnan province mourn the loss of life and work to save those that are injured and trapped in the rubble, our thoughts are with the injured, the families of the victims, and with all the people of China," she said.

Many jittery residents celebrated the lunar New Year holiday in tents last month.
