Romney told an interview broadcast on ABC that his biggest concern about the three upcoming presidential debates is that Obama will be untruthful.

"The president tends to, how shall I say it, to say things that aren't true," Romney said, contemplating whether he would spend debate time "correcting things that aren't quite accurate" or "talking about the things I want to talk about."

Obama appears to have maintained a narrow edge in most polls, with a new CBS News/New York Times survey released Friday giving him a slight 49%-46% advantage over the former Massachusetts governor.

While the president's margin was within the survey's sampling error, making the result statistically even, the new survey continued a trend reflected in other polls of Romney failing to gain ground on the president after the recent political conventions.

In particular, Republican politicians and conservative commentators have cited the killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans amid anti-American protests in Libya this week as an example of the nation's weakened stature around the world.

At a ceremony Friday to bring home the remains of the slain Americans, Obama acknowledged the unrest in Libya and other Arab Spring nations, saying "these are difficult days."

Both Romney and his running mate -- Rep. Paul Ryan -- mentioned the four slain Americans at separate campaign events later Friday, asking for a moment of silence after reciting the names of the dead.

Earlier, Ryan kept up the attacks on Obama's foreign policy at a Values Voters summit in Washington hosted by social conservative groups.

"The slaughter of brave dissidents in Syria. Mobs storming American embassies and consulates. Iran four years closer to gaining a nuclear weapon. Israel, our best ally in the region, treated with indifference bordering on contempt by the Obama administration," Ryan said. "Amid all these threats and dangers, what we do not see is steady, consistent American leadership."

Calling for "moral clarity and firmness of purpose" in U.S. foreign policy, he added that "only by the confident exercise of American influence are evil and violence overcome."

The Obama campaign responded to Ryan's speech with a statement that called it "a series of over-the-top, dishonest attacks" that showed the 42-year-old congressman was "just not ready for prime time."

Meanwhile, an array of other speakers at the conservative summit accused Obama of weakening the country.

"It is my belief and my opinion that Barack Obama has been the most dangerous president we have ever had on American foreign policy," said GOP Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a tea party favorite who ran unsuccessfully for the party's presidential nomination.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told the gathering that the upcoming election "is going to determine whether or not the very moral fabric of our country will be upheld or whether it will be torn apart."

Also Friday, a top foreign policy adviser to Romney's campaign stood by his argument that this week's attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts in Libya and Egypt could have been averted if Romney were president.

Regarding Egypt, Williamson cited what he called a lack of U.S. involvement after the Egyptian protests of 2011, which ultimately led to the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. In Libya, Williamson argued, the United States should have been more active in "reconciliation and reconstruction" after a multi-country coalition took military action against Libyan forces with American help.

Romney drew criticism for blasting the Obama administration on Tuesday night -- the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States -- for a statement by the U.S. Embassy in Cairo that condemned the anti-Islam video.

Romney has since toned down his sharpest rhetoric on the matter but kept up the main theme, telling a New York fundraiser on Friday that "there have been, over the years, confusing messages sent by the president of the United States to the world."

In particular, Romney argued that Obama "had nothing to say that sent a message to the world" during the 2009 anti-government protests in Iran, adding the president should have given direct assistance to the demonstrators. At the time, several months into his presidency, Obama condemned violence against the Iranian protesters but not did lead or call for U.S. involvement in Iran's post-election unrest.

In the ABC interview, Romney conceded a rare shared stance with Obama, saying the two would draw the same "red line" on nuclear weapons in Iran.

Obama has used almost identical language to describe the situation in Iran, and Romney said "yes" when asked in the interview if the two candidates would have the same "red line" going forward.
