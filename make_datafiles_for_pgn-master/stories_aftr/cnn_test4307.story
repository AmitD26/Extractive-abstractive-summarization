Edward Chrisman, left, crosses the Mexican border into the United States after being freed in March.

The 88-year-old's ordeal began in January, when he went to Mexico with grandson Gary Chrisman Jr. for inexpensive dental work, family members said.

The pair ran into trouble in Algodones, Mexico. At a convenience store, the younger Chrisman went inside to buy soft drinks while his grandfather waited in the car.

At that point, the Chrisman family says, the mother demanded more money from Gary Chrisman, he refused, and she called authorities, alleging that he had tried taking pornographic pictures of her daughters.

Both men were arrested, but the police report does not say why the elder Chrisman was arrested.

A Mexican judge ruled that Ed Chrisman could be released based on his age and health, KOMO reported.

The grandson remains in a Mexican jail, awaiting trial.
