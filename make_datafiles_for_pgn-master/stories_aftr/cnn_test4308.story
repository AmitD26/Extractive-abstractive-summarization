Los Angeles (CNN) -- Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra "love nest," where her romance with Richard Burton started, was trashed while it was on loan for filming of Lindsay Lohan's "Liz & Dick," the owner of the dressing room trailer said.

Fox Studios spent more than $75,000 in 1963, about a half million in today's dollars, to create an environment fit for the queen Taylor was playing. She rested away from the set between roman columns with walls and ceilings handpainted in the style of Cleopatra's era.

"I was specifically told that it would come back in pristine condition and in even better condition than it was at that time," Alger said.

When she saw it again in July, she was devastated to see damage she estimated to be at least $100,000.

Photos show cigarette burns on fabric, furniture and even a portrait of Taylor. Dishes, mirror and glass were broken.

What's worse is what's missing, Alger said.

An exquisite antique European rocking chair that Taylor sat in after filming every night was taken.

"I did not get to enjoy using the lavish French phone that she used or even her personal hair brush that probably still had some of her hair in it," she said.

Alger said she suspects it was Lindsay Lohan, based on a studio employee's comment to her that the actress and her friends had access to it each night after filming.

But Lohan's publicist said there was no way Lohan, who he said worshiped Taylor, would ever destroy anything connected to her.

Alger said she would like more information from the studio to help solve the mystery.

She is hoping media attention to her story will change that.

She had plans to make money exhibiting the trailer in Los Angeles. With many irreplaceable furnishings missing and others broken or marred, those plans are on hold for now, she said.
