She took advantage of holing a string of birdie putts to total 17-under 271 with long time leader Stacy Lewis of the United States and Australian Karrie Webb tied for second.

"This is so exciting," she said. "Today I was red hot with the putter."

China's Feng Shanshan, who shot a 66, South Korean amateur Kim Hyo Joo (68), and the 2007 champion Natalie Gulbis (68) of the United States tied for fourth place on 14 under par.

Meanwhile on the men's European Tour, Bernd Wiesberger cheered home fans as a seven-under 65 gave him victory in the Austrian Open in Vienna Sunday.

The 26-year-old overtook overnight leader ThorbjÃ¸rn Olesen of Denmark and Frenchman Thomas Levet with four birdies in five holes around the turn at the Diamond Country Club.

It was Wiesberger's second win on the Tour this season after his victory at the Ballantine's Championship.

"It seems like it went my way, especially the last two holes. I had such a great country and such great fans backing me."
