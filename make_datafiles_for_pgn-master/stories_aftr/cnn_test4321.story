Black players such as Bryan Habana typify the new multiracial Springboks.

But appearances can be deceiving. On the field, history is being made. South African rugby has changed. And the game's most ardent fans -- in the heart of Afrikaner country -- don't seem to mind.

Facing Wales, South Africa's rugby team -- the reigning world champions -- took to the field with a new black coach, Peter de Villiers, and seven black players out of a team of 15 --- the most black players ever.

Fourteen years after democracy, it seems South Africa's messy post-Apartheid race relations are slowly being worked out on the sports field.

"This is a new era. It changes the face of rugby. Historically and politically it's always seen as a white preserve. But the appointment of Peter de Villiers is a huge change in terms of mind set," South African rugby president Oregan Hoskins told CNN. Is South African sport doing enough to tackle the legacy of Apartheid? Have your say

The man at the heart of this rugby revolution is easy to miss. Amid the thick necks and even thicker thighs of a Springbok training session, de Villiers is the short, slight man who seems to have perfected the art of disappearing into the crowd.

In fact, the largest thing about him is his bushy moustache. It took us months to pin him down for an interview and he already has a reputation for dodging the media. I couldn't figure out if he was nervous or just deeply suspicious of the press.

That said, he admits that "since my childhood I've wanted to be a Springbok. To be a part of the set-up. But politics didn't allow us." He says he was a good player -- but as a colored man he was barred from the white rugby set-up.

Yes, say the fans. White, Afrikaans and by now tanked up with brandy and coke, we could not find one person who resented the new black Springboks.

One group of burly men who were braai-ing Springbok meat on kebabs, told us: "It is our team, we have to support them -- Don't think it bothers anyone as long as we can see them win."
