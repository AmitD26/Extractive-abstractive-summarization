(EW.com) -- Last weekend, a dark cloud hung over the box office after the tragedy in Aurora, Colorado, rocked the country.

Once again, The Dark Knight Rises will top the chart. The question is how hard it will fall in its sophomore frame. In 2008, The Dark Knight dropped 53 percent to $75.2 million in its second weekend, but Rises will be lucky to earn a similar drop. After six days in theaters, "Rises" is lagging behind "The Dark Knight" ($211.8 million vs. $222.2 million) despite a stronger start.

On its first Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, "The Dark Knight" earned $24.5 million, $20.9 million, and $18.4 million, respectively. Rises, meanwhile, earned $19.4 million, $17.8 million, and $13.8 million. I see four possible reasons for this slighter performance:

•"The Dark Knight Rises," while well-received, is not earning the same amount of feverishly strong word-of-mouth that propelled "The Dark Knight" into the box office stratosphere.

•"The Dark Knight Rises" is playing like a typical sequel. They open bigger (in this case, only slightly bigger), but then fall much more quickly due to up-front fan excitement.

Whatever the reason, "Rises" doesn't seem to be holding up quite as strong as "The Dark Knight." Thus, I'm thinking a drop in the 60 percent range is in store for Warner Brothers' $250 million Batman sequel. The Dark Knight Rises may gross $65 million over the Friday to Sunday period, which would lift its total right around $290 million.

The other new release is "Step Up Revolution," the fourth installment of the popular dance franchise, which recently shifted from Disney to Summit. The $33 million sequel comes two years after "Step Up 3D," which earned $42.4 million, substantially less than its predecessor, "Step Up 2 The Streets," which grossed $$58 million.

Rounding out the Top 5 will be Ice Age Continental Drift, which may earn about $13 million in its third weekend, and then either Ted or The Amazing Spider-Man, both of which should finish with about $6.5 million.

3. Step Up Revolution -- $13 million

4. Ice Age: Continental Drift -- $13 million

5. The Amazing Spider-Man -- $6.5 million
