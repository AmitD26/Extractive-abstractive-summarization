LONDON, England (CNN) -- A Russian billionaire and former KGB agent is buying a controlling stake in the venerable Evening Standard, the London newspaper announced Wednesday.

The Evening Standard was sold for the token sum of £1.

Alexander Lebedev, 49, already owns the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, one of the few pro-democracy newspapers in Russia.

Lebedev is buying the Evening Standard for £1, or $1.38, a spokesman for the deal told CNN. While it sounds like a steal, the purchase price is more symbolic than reflective of the paper's worth. With it, Lebedev also assumes the unprofitable paper's debts.

Lebedev said the Standard was "a very good newspaper" with some "brilliant journalists."

The oligarch said he had no intention of interfering in British politics and vowed a hands-off approach, telling The Guardian, "My influence would be next to zero."

Top management of Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), which is selling its controlling interest to Lebedev, said the move ensures continued investment in the 182-year-old paper.

Lebedev owns 49 percent of Novaya Gazeta together with former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev. A journalist from the newspaper was killed Monday in Moscow when she tried to intervene in the fatal shooting of a Russian human rights lawyer, Russian media reported.

In addition to owning Novaya Gazeta, Lebedev is also chairman of the board of the National Reserve Corporation, which is the majority shareholder in National Reserve Bank, one of Russia's largest.

Lebedev is purchasing the Evening Standard with his son, Evgeny, 28.

Forbes Magazine listed Alexander Lebedev as the world's 358th-richest person last year, worth $3.1 billion. Forbes said Lebedev made most of his money through investments in banking and insurance companies and in Aeroflot.
