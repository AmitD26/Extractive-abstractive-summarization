How strange, because this is a 93-year-old league whose most impressive guy at running a franchise these days is darker than Vince Lombardi of the past and Bill Belichick of the present.

They call Newsome "The Wizard" for his ability to keep the Baltimore Ravens vibrant throughout his decade as the NFL's first black general manager. In fact, this Pro Football Hall of Fame tight end-turned expert talent evaluator has replaced the Gatorade bath after huge victories as the rage around the league.

Just ask Lionel Vital, who joins Newsome among the league's highest-ranking black executives as the director of player personnel for the Atlanta Falcons. Vital began scouting with Newsome in the Browns organization in the early 1990s, when Belichick was running the show before his prolific stint with the New England Patriots.

Later, Newsome was Vital's boss in Baltimore from 2005 to 2007.

"Ozzie understands people maybe better than anybody I've ever met," Vital said. "Those draft picks he makes (through the annual NFL draft) are people, and he just knows how to deal with them. Those guys play for him, because those guys can be themselves around him.

"Whether you're a player or a scout or anybody else in the Baltimore organization, Ozzie wants you to be you, and he lets you be you."

It works. Under Newsome, the Ravens have reached the playoffs seven times (including the last five seasons), and they've made three trips to the American Football Conference title game.

More impressive, despite a defense with more aches and pains than anybody in the league, the Ravens used several of Newsome's shrewd picks through the years to reach the Super Bowl on Sunday at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome against the San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens operate with Newsome's fingerprints wrapped around everything they do.

The others: Newsome is noted for seeing things that nobody else does when studying players in the draft or free agency. His picks regularly are enlightened (see the Ravens' multiple trips to the playoffs).

Most recently, there was Newsome taking a chance on 400-something pounds of Terrence Cody, who was considered a bust by many. He was gifted but unmotivated. The Dr. Phil of general managers spent his interview time with Cody at the 2010 NFL scouting combine calling the nose tackle everything shy of a fat slob.

That quartet represents the only other black general managers among the NFL's 32 teams.

Oh, well.

"These are the lowest head coach diversity numbers the league has seen since 2003, when the Rooney Rule was just implemented," wrote Harry Carson, the Fritz Pollard Alliance's executive director, in a letter to NFL officials regarding the drop from six to four black head coaches in the league after this past regular season. "Similarly, no minority front office candidate was selected for any of the vacant GM positions."

So the Fritz Pollard Alliance want the Rooney Rule expanded to include openings for offensive and defensive coordinators. Many of the NFL's future team leaders come from those positions.

There currently are six black defensive coordinators in the league and just two black offensive coordinators.

The NFL knows there are issues along these lines. Last month, league executive vice president of human resources Robert Gulliver said, "While there has been full compliance with the interview requirements of the Rooney Rule and we wish the new head coaches and general managers much success, the hiring results this year have been unexpected and reflect a disappointing lack of diversity.

Beyond the quotes, Newsome speaks loudest through his actions as the epitome of what could be for an NFL franchise looking for success. That is, if other blacks are given a chance in team decision-making roles.

"I think Ozzie is an incredible role model for anybody within an organization with the desire to be a general manager, and, honestly, that's true whether you're talking about an African-American or a Caucasian," said Thomas Dimitroff, the Falcons' general manager.

Dimitroff's late father, Thomas Sr., was a prominent scout for the Browns down the stretch of Newsome's Cleveland playing career that ended after the 1990 season. The older Dimitroff also was around for Newsome's opening five years in the Browns' scouting department.

That was before Newsome continued as an NFL boss in 1996 when that particular Browns' franchise (there is another one now) moved to Baltimore to become the Ravens.

Said Dimitroff, "My dad -- as an older school, tough football guy -- was very complimentary of how Ozzie handled that transition from player to team executive. He handled it with tact and with respect to the other football people who were there before him. He didn't just thump his chest to say he had arrived, because he was such a great player."

Newsome still doesn't thump his chest -- you know, even though he is a great general manager.
