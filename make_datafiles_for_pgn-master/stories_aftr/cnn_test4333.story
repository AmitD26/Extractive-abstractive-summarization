(Rolling Stone) -- Since the 1999 debut of his hit series "Family Guy," Seth MacFarlane has been best known for his filthy fiefdom of anarchic, envelope-pushing cartoons.

Lately he's been expanding his empire, hosting "SNL," recording a Grammy-nominated album of standards and show tunes, and directing a Hollywood blockbuster, "Ted," in which MacFarlane gave voice to a horny, drug-abusing toy bear. His official coronation as a showbiz don came earlier this month, when he was announced as next year's Oscar host. But the 39-year-old confesses, "I love a good fart joke."

Seth MacFarlane Tapped to Host 2013 Oscars

Why do the Oscars frequently suck, and how will you make them better?

The staff hasn't been assembled. But this is not going to be "Family Guy Meets the Oscars." Hosts who come in with a specific brand and try to turn the show into the brand, it never works. You have to adapt yourself to the Oscars, not vice versa.

For all its success, "Family Guy" is sometimes dismissed as frat-boy humor. Does that surprise you?

A lot of that comes, I think, from people who haven't actually seen the show. They're going with what they've heard. The show itself contains a degree of frat-boy humor -- there are fart jokes, there are shit jokes. But we try to include an equal amount of intelligent humor. If it makes you laugh, what's wrong with that? There's room for both highbrow and lowbrow.

Louis C.K. has said he loves "Family Guy," but the show has also been mocked by "The Simpsons" and "South Park." Did you ever feel like you were on the outside of some comedy in-crowd?

Review: 'Ted'

You're rebooting the Carl Sagan science show "Cosmos." Do you hope creationists tune in?

Oddly, I don't relate a lot to that character. I never had a stuffed animal I wished would come to life. The story felt universal enough to resonate. But working in entertainment, you have to retain a degree of childishness. That's one reason Spielberg has been so successful: He's been able to maintain that sense of wonder into adulthood. I suppose that makes people like us a little more stunted than everyone else, emotionally.
