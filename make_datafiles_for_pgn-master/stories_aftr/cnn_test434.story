(CNN) -- Newly released text messages reportedly from the morning of September 11, 2001, show panicked family members trying to contact loved ones and officials frantically trying to grasp what was happening.

A total of 2,976 people -- not including the hijackers -- were killed in the attacks.

Some people witnessing the attacks reached out to loved ones out of fear there might have been more attacks coming and they might die.

"The only thoughts I have are of Nicholas, Ian and you," read one text message. "I am terrified. I needed to tell you that I truly love you. always, diane."

"I know you have a new relationship and do not care about me. But just in case anything happens know I love you hon. Missed Ya good bye."

The first indication of a problem comes at 8:50 a.m., five minutes aft.er the first plane hit the World Trade Center.

Another text message references "a bomb detonation" in the World Trade Center and asks recipients of the message to report back assessments of their areas.

A minute later, firsthand reports started flooding in.

"The world trade center has just blow up, we seen the explosion outside our windows. Teresa ..."

At 8:53 a.m. a message from the New York Police Department's operations division mobilizes officers toward the World Trade Center, telling them to meet at Church and Vessey streets.

"It's a deliberate attack ... a second plane just few into the second tower," a message said 52 seconds later.

By 9:25 a.m. the personal messages have grown more frequent and more frantic.

Companies begin sending out messages asking for head counts on all employees.

9:25:40 a.m.

9:29:38 a.m.

"Wondering where you are. Are you okay. Give me a call back asap. I just need to know these things. Even if it's collect. Call me. Darryl"

11:32:56 a.m.

"if i do not hear from you by high noon, i am going to pick laura up at school and tell her her father is dead."

Some texts brought relief.

"My dad survived! I got a call from stepmom's coworker saying my dad is alive, although that is all the info I have. I do not know if he is injured or unscathed."

"urgent. It's tim. I'm okay. Call me at home...i was outside the building when it exploded, but i'm fine."

Others have to wait and worry. Numerous messages simply read: "Are you okay?" "Where are you?" or "CALL ME NOW!"

A message at 10:24 a.m. appears to show authorities working to secure the first family.

"TWINKLE AND TURQ ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND SAFE," the message says. Twinkle and Turquoise were the code names used for then-president George W. Bush's twin daughters Jenna and Barbara.

At 10:32 a.m. a Secret Service message said "ANONYMOUS CALL TO JOC REPORTING ANGEL IS TARGET" -- referring to a call to the Joint Operation's Center refering a threat made against Air Force One, which used a code name of Angel.

A message from the Secret Service's New York field office sent conflicting messages about where agents should report.

"There is a hijacked plane circling dulles airport. Please call me!"

"unconfirmed reports of plane crash at camp david now."

Wikileaks says it has verified some of the texts and says they all appear to be authentic.

"And from the publishing perspective of the Wikileaks perspective, that is what counts. We are helping to maintain an uncensorable part of this day's record in more detail than has ever been provided before."
