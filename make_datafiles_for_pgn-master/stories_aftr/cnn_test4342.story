They crowd into four cabins (showers are a walk away), tote everything they need (even toilet paper) and divide all the chores. And they wouldn't have it any other way.

Maybe it's the economy. Maybe it's the need to reconnect with friends and family. At beach houses and on sailboats, city condos and mountain cabins, families and friends are joining forces on vacation.

According to a new survey from TripAdvisor of people with children, nearly a third report they will vacation with another family this year to save money -- a significant jump from 2008.

"We get calls daily from family and friends who want to get together in our cabins," says Stephanie Seacord from Point Lookout Resort in Maine where cabins that sleep nine or more start at $195. Cabins can be rented for even less in Colorado at the YMCA of the Rockies where my family has also shared quarters -- and cooking chores -- with relatives at a family reunion.

Even Disney is getting into the act, with new Disney Deluxe Villa Resorts Vacation Club options that you can turn into your home away from home. In Florida, Kidani Village at Animal Kingdom Lodge and Treehouse Villas at Saratoga Springs Resort are brand-new with a third villa resort slated to open later this summer. Another resort is expected to open at Disneyland in California in the fall.

And they spent less than they would have on a cruise. "We saw everything we wanted (except Denali stayed hidden behind clouds)."

When the kids were small, we met up every summer in Minnesota at Ludlow's Island Resort where we ate the fish we caught for dinner and the kids would chase frogs and ride in the special car that goes in the water.

But these trips are about much more than saving money. "I love that our group can get together once a year or every other year and feel like we haven't missed a beat," says Carin Kromm, a geologist from Kernersville, North Carolina. Kromm gathers with her college friends and their children at a vacation home owned by one of the group.

Single mom Kelly Ladyga adds that it was much more relaxing to join forces with another single mom than to take her young daughter solo. Besides sharing the cost of rent at a beach house in North Carolina, groceries and rental car, she was able to get a much-needed break -- far more relaxing than the solo trip she took to Hawaii. "Plus it was nice to sit with someone on the deck at night, drink wine and laugh about the day's adventures."

"It helps with your sanity for sure, kids seem to play better when they have other kids to play with -- the more children, the busier they keep each other," says Michelle Revuelta, the Miami mom of two young daughters who has rented condos in Orlando and elsewhere with other families.

"You truly feel you are on vacation," she says. And that isn't easy to accomplish with young kids in tow.

There are some rules to be sure. Never discipline anyone else's child, for one. That's a parent's prerogative.

Rates for some three-bedroom vacation homes start at just $99 per night, but sleep up to eight travelers, not just one or two, notes Alex Risser, president of the Vacation Rental Managers Association.

There's no worrying about the rain either. "With a 30-person family, we make up our own entertainment," says Michelle Abril.

That's the best kind.
