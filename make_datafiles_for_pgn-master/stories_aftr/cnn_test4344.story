United Nations (CNN) -- Last year, the U.N. Security Council authorized "all necessary measures" to stop the violence when the nation in question was Libya. It has come nowhere close to that on Syria, where the United Nations estimates more than 5,000 people have been killed since March. Why?

Diplomats say the answer is simple: Russia. Tensions between Russia and the other permanent members of the Security Council have always been a factor. But diplomats say that Russia's conduct in its refusal to condemn Syria, or even negotiate on resolutions in good faith, have reached new lows.

At this point, the only way Western diplomats believe the Security Council will be able to pass a resolution on Syria is with a request for intervention from the Arab League. Russia and China abstained from the vote on Libya after the Arab League and the African Union requested UN involvement in that country.

In Russia's view, NATO overstepped the Security Council's mandate in Libya, and they fear a similar mistake being made in Syria. Though Western diplomats insist they have not proposed anything approaching military intervention, Russia insists that the Syria crisis should be solved internally.

"This is not the kind of issue which can be drowned in expletives," Churkin countered the next day. "You cannot beat a Stanford education, can you?" referring to Rice's alma mater, saying she should be "more Victorian."

Shortly thereafter, Rice's communications director tweeted a picture of Churkin's face superimposed on the Grinch, with the text "rough day at the Security Council." (Churkin later said that he "thought it was a nice joke.")

Despite Rice's high-profile tit-for-tat with Churkin, it is the four European countries on the Security Council, not the United States, that have taken the lead on issues Libya and Syria.

Those countries -- France, Germany, Portugal and the United Kingdom -- have expressed deep frustration at Russia's scuttling of attempts at a resolution.

In December, Russia held the rotating presidency of the council, which gave it significant power to determine the agenda. Diplomats complained of having to fight tooth and nail for even routine briefings.

"Churkin is practicing shoe diplomacy," another senior Western diplomat said, referring to Soviet Premier Nikita Krushchev's famous shoe-banging speech in the General Assembly.

"Russia and Syria are the last two members of the Warsaw Pact, and Russia is behaving in an imperialistic manner," another Western diplomat said.

Churkin does not disagree that the mood is contentious. But he says that the root cause is a "my way or the highway" attitude. He called December the toughest of his five separate month-long terms at the helm of the Security Council.

"There is a lot of nervousness, a lot of expectations that things are going to be done my way or no other way," Churkin said. "That what I need to have, I must have now. ... I think that if this trend were to continue it might seriously hurt the ability of the Security Council to work."

Western Diplomats said Russia had expected the Europeans and Americans to reject the draft out of hand, because it did not include some of the provisions they consider non-negotiable. (And, for example, they say it drew an unacceptable equivalence between violence perpetrated by the government and violence perpetrated by protesters.)

They also complain that Churkin has misrepresented to the media the content of closed Security Council meetings. He claims productive work on the draft Syria resolution, they say, when in fact he has been stonewalling.

They have not held a single negotiation on the text since Christmas, Western diplomats say.

Western diplomats admit that when it comes to Syria, they are at a "dead end." The only way around it -- the "only game in town," as French U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud says -- is the Arab League.

If that report is unequivocal about the Syrian government's culpability -- an outcome Western diplomats admit is a long shot -- then they may have enough political capital to push forward. And in-person briefing from the Qatari prime minister, who has been very outspoken on Syria, or the secretary general of the Arab League, may help to push Russia, they say.
