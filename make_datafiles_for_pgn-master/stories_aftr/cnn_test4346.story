(CNN) -- The Amateur Athletic Union kick-started a child sex abuse criminal probe against its former president when it gave Memphis, Tennessee, police the identities of three of his accusers, a spokesman for the group said Sunday.

According to Sachs, the Memphis police had "no reports from anybody" about Dodd until the Amateur Athletic Union -- also known as the AAU -- gave them the results of their own, nearly month-long investigation last Thursday. The group previously claimed that it alerted authorities last Friday.

This included revealing the identity of a "potential third complaining victim" who was not brought up in the ESPN report, the spokesman said.

Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong has said that his department is probing the claims.

"Although this case has its challenges due to the amount of time that has passed, it will be thoroughly examined," Armstrong said. "And if the investigation reveals the law was violated, the person responsible will be held accountable."

Detailing its involvement, Sachs said the AAU stands by its response -- including its decision to oust Dodd, hire an investigator and then contact authorities.

The AAU got "cryptic, brief" e-mails -- signed only as "shrimp breath" -- on November 7, 8 and 9 -- that "alleged, in a very general way, that Bobby Dodd engaged in child sexual abuse," said the spokesman. And on November 9, the organization got two brief voice-mails along the same lines. There was no name or contact information left in either case.

Those messages were sent to the AAU's compliance and general counsel office, and AAU "officers" were notified on November 11. The board members, several of whom flew into Orlando, convened on the following Monday, November 14, "to confront then-President Bobby Dodd," said Sachs.

In that meeting, Dodd claimed he'd gotten similar phone messages and insisted he was innocent, according to the spokesman, who said he'd spoken with several AAU officers at that meeting.

One of Dodd's accusers, identified by ESPN as Ralph West of Miami, said he was 14 at the time of the alleged abuse. West said he was on a basketball team run by Dodd, who he said would sometimes slip into West's hotel room.

West said he was talking publicly, despite the potential embarrassment to him and his family, not to "gain anything" but because he felt "the guy shouldn't be around kids anymore."

West said Dodd abused him or tried to abuse him six times, including at least once in which he tried "to put his hand in my boxer shorts" while West was sleeping.

West said he tried to find ways to keep Dodd out of his hotel room when they were at out-of-town basketball tournaments, saying he was "afraid to even fall asleep."

"He would push his way in the room and then end up, I'd see, I wouldn't see him, I would hear him, he'd lay at the floor of the bed masturbating," the man said. "And you just lay there horrified. But you don't know what to do. What, are you going to blow the lid off of this at 14 years? All you want to do is pretend it didn't happen and not address it at all. You want to hide and bury it."

Another accuser, whom ESPN did not identify, said Dodd gave him alcohol before taking him to a bedroom and touching him inappropriately.

"The last thing that I can really remember was him carrying me into his bedroom and I can remember him, you know, touching me in ways that I, I didn't uh, I didn't want another man touching me," the man said.

The spokesman also clarified that Dodd told his successor, Stout, that he had colon cancer and needed surgery after his November 14 dismissal. Dodd allegedly asked that he be able to retire for medical purposes -- a request that Stout denied, according to Sachs.

"(Stout) told Mr. Dodd to go focus on your health, go through this surgery and we'll deal with this issue later," said Sachs.

"Bobby Dodd is no longer part of the AAU," said Sachs. "He has no continuing role (or) involvement in their programs. There's no contact with him. Whatever compensation he would have been entitled to -- accrued vacation time -- will be paid, and that's it."
