(CNN) -- From the "Twilight" trilogy to the tearjerkers adapted from Nicholas Sparks novels to nearly every film where Matthew McConaughey takes off his shirt, let's face it: Most cinematic love stories are made for women.

Sound crazy? Stick with me.

There's no doubt that John loves his wife and wants to rekindle the romance, but he can't seem to admit it. But while John proves incapable of communicating his feelings to his wife verbally, an opportunity arises allowing him to prove his devotion to her.

Review: Willis goes through the motions in 'A Good Day to Die Hard'

Midway through the party, a team of terrorists led by the stylish Hans Gruber (a scene-stealing Alan Rickman) interrupts the event and holds most of the attendees hostage. The quick-thinking John eludes their grasp and eventually begins taking down the bad guys one by one in order to rescue his captured wife.

John offers a brand of masculinity and strength that men can look up to (akin to what John Wayne and Clint Eastwood once offered moviegoers). John doesn't back down and he never gives up. The cold and calculating Hans may mock John for his cowboy mentality, his freewheeling spirit and his assumed affection for masculine film actors of the past (like Wayne). But John doesn't care what Hans thinks. John just keeps killing bad guys.

While separated from his wife, John shows his love for her by killing terrorists and trying to protect her. Compare that to Gosling's Noah: When he's separated from the girl he loves, he writes love letters. How does John send messages in "Die Hard"? He writes notes on the sweatshirts of dead terrorists, and in one scene even throws a dead terrorist out a window to send a message to a passing police officer. That's how he communicates.

There is no declaration of love between John and his wife. There is no grand romantic gesture that shows how much he cares for her. As the story concludes, John McClane â€” who has been shot, brutalized and cut by hundreds of pieces of glass â€” has proven his love for his wife by killing all the terrorists who threatened her.

Now that's love.
