But instead of ordering a few lawn signs or volunteering to go door-to-door for the campaign, he put his money where his mouth was.

It is illegal to vote on the election in the United States -- the Maryland Attorney General's office told CNN that instances of betting on an election are rare -- but that doesn't mean betting on an election elsewhere is rare.

Just look across the Atlantic, where most betting institutions in the United Kingdom and Ireland have odds on all things presidential.

International odds makers are giving the upper hand to Obama. Most UK bookmakers this week, aside from a few outliers, give Obama 1 to 4 odds (if you bet $1 and win, you get $1.25 back), while Romney is getting 11 to 4 odds (for every $4 you bet, you get $11 back).

By the way, there are also odds on who would win the 2016 presidential election. Mitt Romney is the favorite, Paul Ryan, Romney's running mate, is a close second and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is just behind Ryan. Donald Trump, the Republican business magnate, is getting 100 to 1 odds.

In the last few days, possibly looking to take advantage of the odds, a sizable amount of money has been coming in for Romney, according to FÃ©ilim Mac An Iomaire, a spokesperson for Paddy Power.

"It is over a million pounds sterling (about $1.6 million) at this stage," Iomaire says of the amount of money that has been bet so far. Everyday, he says, bets of over 10,000 pounds -- or about $16,000 -- have become normal.

In order to set the odds, Iomarie says a group of bookies in Ireland comb through much of the same data that American political watchers read.

"All the latest polls will be looked at. We also do a line in all the states -- so we watch the regional polls very closely," Iomarie said. "Ninety percent of it going in is what the polls are saying."

Intrade is another popular Irish site that allows members to bet on the outcomes of non-sports-related events. Members buy "contracts" that stipulate what they are worth if whatever outcomes happens. For example, at time of publishing, buying one share of "Barack Obama to be re-elected President in 2012" would cost $6.65. By contrast, the same bets for Romney cost $3.38.

According to Intrade, Obama has a 66.3% chance of winning the election. Romney has a 33.9% chance.

Like most betting sites, Intrade does not allow U.S. credit or debit cards to be used on the site -- a way to basically prohibit Americans from betting on the election.

Back at Paddy Power, Iomaire jokes that Americans may not be the best people to bet on their own election.

But in saying that, he acknowledges that understanding the data and the historical trend of economic data can lead to "educated guessing."

"To the large extent, the inclination of academics is to look at systematic patterns in the past and derive what is going to happen in the future," Sides said. "Maybe the information is useful, but then again, that perspective opens up the risk that this time is different.

Bettors like Chris remain strident, though.

"It is a market that is malformed," Chris said. "Whenever there is a malformed market and you know what you are doing, it is a reasonably good place to put your money.
