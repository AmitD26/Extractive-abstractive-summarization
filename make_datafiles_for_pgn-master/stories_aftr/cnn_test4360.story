(CNN) -- Charl Schwartzel stayed on course to achieve his first win since claiming the 2011 U.S. Masters crown as he took a four-shot lead at the halfway stage of the Thailand Championship Friday.

The South African shot a seven under par 65 for a 14 under par 130 total at Amata Spring Country Club.

Daniel Chopra of Sweden carded a 67 for second place with Japan's Masanori Kobayashi a shot further back.

Rising Japanese star Ryo Ishikawa shot a fine 66 for 136 while this year's Masters champion Bubba Watson of the United States and Spain's Sergio Garcia were in the group on 138.

Schwartzel is hopeful of ending his 20-month victory drought, particularly as he has found form on the putting green.

The home hope leads fellow Australians Brendan Jones (71) and first-round leader John Senden, who were tied for second at The Lakes.

In-form Englishman Justin Rose was in a group tied for fifth at three under going into the weekend, while American legend Tom Watson carded a superb 68 Friday to make the cut by a stroke.

Heavy rainfall left the course flooded for the second straight day but organizers hope to get the delayed event started Saturday.

She carded a 67 for 18-under-par at the Emirates Golf Club, but Dutch woman Dewi Claire Schreefel made inroads into her lead with a tournament record 63 to trail by five.

France's Gwladys Nocera was a shot back at 12-under, one ahead of Germany's Caroline Masson and Cindy Lacrosse of the United States.
