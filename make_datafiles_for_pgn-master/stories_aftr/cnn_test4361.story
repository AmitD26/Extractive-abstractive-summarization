The company's improper sales of pseudoephedrine, an ingredient found in cold and sinus medicines, led directly to an increase in methamphetamine production in California, said the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, California.

The company will not face criminal charges; instead it will implement a compliance and ethics program over the next three years, prosecutors said.

CVS changed its sales practices only after it became aware of the government's investigation, officials said.

In 2007, after Mexico banned the sale of pseudoephedrine, Los Angeles County experienced an epidemic of "smurfing", a practice in which individuals make multiple purchases of items containing pseudoephedrine with the aim of getting large amounts for use in meth production, the statement said. CVS, unlike other retailers, failed to prevent the practice, prosecutors allege.

"Smurfers inundated CVS stores in Los Angeles and Orange County, and later stores in the Las Vegas [Nevada] area, to purchase cough and cold remedies, sometimes cleaning out store shelves," authorities said.

CVS pledged to prevent such sales in the future.

CVS has strengthened internal controls and compliance measures, Ryan said in a written statement.
