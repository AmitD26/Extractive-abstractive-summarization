Washington (CNN) -- Bipartisanship is in the eye of the beholder, it seems, as Democrats and Republicans ponder how cooperation between them can improve after the upcoming congressional elections.

The voting on November 2 is expected to diminish Democratic majorities in both chambers and perhaps cost them control of the House. Whatever the final tally, widespread voter dissatisfaction with the hostile political climate in Washington is evident.

Republican leaders say their opposition is a response to a left-leaning agenda pushed by Obama and Democratic leaders that far exceeds what the public wants.

While Obama and some Democrats and Republicans say they hope for better relations after the election, they express different views of what that would mean.

"We're hoping with that comes a greater sense of responsibility," he said.

Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas had a different take, telling "Fox News Sunday" that it is up to Obama to change, not Republicans.

"If the president's going to maintain his ideological stance and try to jam things through to support the left in America, when we're still a center-right country, then we're going to say 'no,' " Cornyn said, adding that Republicans will work with Obama on issues such as job creation, spending cuts and reducing the national debt.

"There is , I think, a fatigue on the part of the American people with the aggressive agenda that, frankly, they don't agree with, but they haven't been listened to," Cornyn said. "They've been lectured to, and they're tired of it. They're going to speak up on November 2nd."

Cornyn's Republican colleague, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, agreed on the CBS program "Face the Nation" that Obama and Democratic leaders "over-reached" in the first two years, which he said rattled the American people.

"I don't think it's about everybody becoming a Republican in the last two years," Graham said of expected GOP election victories next month. "I do believe it's a rejection of an agenda that scares people. The health care bill, the stimulus package, the financial regulation, all the spending was not what people expected from this president."

At the same time, some bipartisanship will occur, Graham predicted.

According to Graham, the Tea Party movement has helped refocus the national political debate on a center-right agenda, but added that conservatives shouldn't get carried away.

"Our Tea Party friends have done us a favor, "Graham said. "But if we talk about doing away with Social Security as part of our agenda, then we're going to lose the public. ... If you get too far right or too far left, you're going to lose the American people."

Gibbs told the NBC program "Meet the Press" that the president will work on strengthening the economy and trying to ensure its future stability, while continuing to push education reform and making sure that health care and Wall Street reforms are properly implemented.

Obama needs Democrats and Republicans to work together to deal with the federal debt, Gibbs said. A bipartisan debt commission is scheduled to report a set of proposals in December.

He made no mention of major issues such as immigration reform and energy reform, which Obama pushed strongly in his first two years. Axelrod, speaking on CNN, said both issues were part of the necessary foundation of reforms for sustainable economic growth in the future.
