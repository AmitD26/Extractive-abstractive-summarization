(CNN) -- One of the busiest travel weeks of the year is upon us.

Q) What exactly are the new TSA rules?

A) When you arrive in the airport security checkpoint, you will be directed to either a traditional metal detector or one of the new advanced imaging technology (AIT) machines. Passengers directed to the AIT machines can instead opt for an "enhanced" pat-down.

A) No. The only noticeable difference may be the presence of the AIT machines, which are larger than metal detectors.

Q) Does every airport have the AIT machines?

A) No. There are approximately 400 AIT machines installed in 69 airports nationwide. The rest of the country's roughly 450 commercial airports still only use metal detectors.

Q) What sorts of images do the AIT machines show?

A) They show a somewhat blurred outline of the passenger's body. Clear facial features are not shown.

A) Yes -- working pilots.

A) There are actually two types of advanced imaging technology -- backscatter X-ray technology and millimeter-wave technology.

Q) Is the use of advanced imaging technology a violation of my rights?

A) It depends who you ask. Several lawsuits have been filed. One public interest research group is seeking a suspension of the body scanning program, arguing that the measures violate the Fourth Amendment and the Privacy Act, among other laws.

Courts, however, have traditionally given wide leeway for airport screening under the Fourth Amendment, according to Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who specializes in American constitutional law.

A) No. Fewer than 3 percent of the flying public are subjected to the enhanced pat-down, according to the TSA. Pat-downs are used primarily on passengers who set off either the AIT machine or the metal detectors, and those who opt out of the AIT machine. A few randomly selected passengers will be subjected to a pat down even if they clear the metal detector or AIT machine.

Q) What's included in the enhanced pat-down?

A) "It just makes good security sense," the TSA says on its website. "The weapons and other dangerous and prohibited items we've found during pat-downs speak to this."

Q) Am I going to be subjected to a pat-down in front of fellow passengers?

A) You can request to have the pat-down conducted in a private room with a passenger witness of your choosing.

Q) Are kids exempt from enhanced pat-downs?

A) Children under the age of 12 requiring additional screening will receive "a modified pat down," according to the TSA.

Q) Will all airports have the new AIT scanning machines in the future?

A) That's the goal.

@highlight

The new rules require passengers to go through a regular metal detector or a new AIT machine

@highlight

If you set off the detector or machine -- or refuse to go through them -- you will get an "enhanced" pat-down

@highlight

The new advanced imaging technology machine is generally considered safe

@highlight

Only 3 percent of the flying public will likely need an enhanced pat-down
