Aleh Kalman had been swimming about 150 feet from the edge of the Nevada Fall on Saturday afternoon when he was caught up in the swift current of the Merced River, the National Park Service reported. The 19-year-old Sacramento resident had gone to the park with a church group, the park service said.

Water levels were too high to search safely Monday, Scott Gediman with the Yosemite National Park Service said.

Searchers looked for Kalman on foot and by helicopter on Saturday but had to stop at nightfall. The grim task resumed Sunday, aided by three dog teams, the park service said.

The Merced River was running about 500 cubic feet per second on Saturday, "a very swift and powerful spring flow of water," the park service noted in a written statement. That had gone up to about 650 cubic feet per second on Sunday.

"Although the park received only 50 percent of normal snow pack, rivers within the park continue to run at high levels this time of the year," the service said. "Additionally, the water remains extremely cold and will be throughout the year."

Yosemite is about 200 miles east of San Francisco.
