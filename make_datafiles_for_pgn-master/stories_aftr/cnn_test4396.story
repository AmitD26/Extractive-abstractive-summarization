Alicia Morgan, in a phone interview with CNN Wednesday, said she called her son last month to say she needed $25,000 to pay off her mortgage, but his assistant called back and told her, "Tracy would do a one shot deal of $2,000."

"I was so upset, I told her to tell Tracy 'Thank you, but no thanks. I am not some person on the street asking you for a handout, I am your mother,'" she said. "And that was the end of that."

His sister, Asia Morgan, said their mother needs his help soon "so she doesn't end up on the streets."

"If her mortgage is not paid by February 23, 2012, her home will go into foreclosure," she said.

In her interview with CNN, Alicia Morgan said her son offered to pay her mortgage after she was laid off from her job last year.

"I faxed him my account number and my mortgage papers," Alicia Morgan said. "I thought he was paying it, but after a few months I realized he didn't pay it off."

His mother said she heard through another relative that her son was angry about publicity given to the story.

"My nephew said that he spoke to Tracy and that Tracy said he wasn't going to pay me because I gave an interview," his mother said. "I never talked to anyone."

"She has asked all of her children for help, but we are no in a position to do so," she said. "We all have jobs, but Tracy is the only one in a position to help."

Tracy Morgan, 43, grew up in Brooklyn, but his mother moved the family to Youngstown in 1995, a decade after he left home, his sister said. He rose to fame as a "Saturday Night Live" cast member and now stars on NBC's hit sitcom "30 Rock."

"We have tried to get in contact with my brother Tracy, but he changes his phone number all the time, so we have no way of talking to him," she said.

"No one did anything to him," she said. "... I am not trying to hurt Tracy. I love my children to death."
