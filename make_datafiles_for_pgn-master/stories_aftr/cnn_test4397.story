(CNN) -- On the day Alisher Usmanov was named as Britain's wealthiest man, his soccer club Arsenal overtook that of one of his "rich list" rivals in the race for a European Champions League place next season.

Abramovich is fifth on the Sunday Times list with an estimated wealth of £9.3 billion (£14.16 billion) -- a drop of two places. His team's fortunes have also been sliding since last year's Champions League success, but the Blues can regain third with victory in Sunday's trip to Liverpool.

The Gunners next face runaway leaders Manchester United, but the final three games are against teams near the bottom of the table.

"We are on a strong run and we just go into the next game and focus on winning that," Wenger told Arsenal's website. "The next game will be Man United so it's a good challenge for us."

Defender Per Mertesacker scored the only goal against Fulham just before halftime, as the home team had former Arsenal midfielder Steven Sidwell sent off for a rash lunge on Mikel Arteta early on -- his second red card in as many matches.

Arsenal also ended the game with 10 men after France striker Olivier Giroud was sent off.

"He went over the ball and, knowing that Sidwell had been sent off before, I had no illusion of the color of the card."

Another club with connections to a man on the rich list took another step towards relegation on Saturday as Queens Park Rangers lost 2-0 at home to Stoke.

Mittal had been Britain's wealthiest man eight years in a row, but has dropped to fourth on £10 billion ($15 billion) -- with £2.7 billion ($4.1 billion) wiped off his value.

His shares in QPR may also be worth considerably less if the club returns to the second division after just two seasons in the EPL, despite having spent large sums on players under Fernandes -- that will happen on Monday if Aston Villa manage an unlikely victory against Manchester United.

Saturday's defeat left the London club level on points with bottom side Reading, who lost 2-1 at Norwich, while Stoke climbed six points clear of the relegation zone after ending a run of six defeats and a draw.

Sunderland's victory -- the club's second since January 23 -- dented sixth-placed Everton's hopes of European qualification, leaving David Moyes' team two points behind Tottenham having played two more matches.
