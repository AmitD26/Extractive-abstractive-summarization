(Time.com) -- Years ago when I was a broke college student subsisting on ramen noodles and off-brand cereal, I used to fantasize that someday, when I had a good job, I would be able to afford to eat incredibly healthily.

But today I still get sticker shock when I go to the grocery store. That's why I was so skeptical when a USDA study released a few months ago asserted that healthy foods are actually cheaper than the heavily processed stuff.

These findings are based on the fact that the old method prioritized price per calorie, giving low-cost junk food an edge over fresh veggies.

But, the report said, "When measured on the basis of edible weight or average portion size, grains, vegetables, fruit, and dairy foods are less expensive than most protein foods and foods high in saturated fat, added sugars, and/or sodium."

However, it's one thing to understand that grains and legumes are a cheaper source of protein than free-range chicken; it's quite another to try to get my meat-loving husband to have rice and beans for dinner every night.

Similarly, gym memberships and personal trainers can be a big monthly expense, but they might be worth it if the only thing you'd do at home with your treadmill or dumbbells is occasionally wipe the dust off of them.

Getting into shape -- and staying that way -- can save you some serious cash in the long run. Lifestyle changes can help stave off diabetes as well as joint replacement and other big medical expenses.

We also do this in my household now, and this kind of planning not only saves me time, but also cuts down on us throwing out unused food.

Thinking ahead makes it easier to budget in pricier selections, like fresh fish or more expensive cuts of meat, and also makes it less tempting to eat out, which can come with a high price tag â€” and calorie count.

Comparison shop. If you like working out at a gym but want to save money, shop around. If the gym memberships in your area are too pricey, explore options at your workplace, local schools or community centers, which often offer free or low-cost activities.

Browse the Internet to see if there are group sports activities, like hiking, biking or running that you may join for free or a nominal cost.

So remember: if you find yourself struggling to slim down and stay motivated from beach season to beach season, it doesn't have to be expensive to make healthy choices, as long as you're willing to put in a little time and effort. By prioritizing, planning ahead and making smart choices, you can maintain your physical and financial well-being.
