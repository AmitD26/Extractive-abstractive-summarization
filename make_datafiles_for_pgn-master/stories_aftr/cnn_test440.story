(CNN) -- Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko hailed exit poll results of Sunday's parliamentary elections, saying the projected outcome gives "a powerful and irreversible backing to Ukraine's path to Europe."

Final poll results are expected later in the week.

"Today's vote is yet another step in Ukraine's democratic journey," the statement said.

Parliamentary elections were called last winter after protests in Kiev caused former President Victor Yanukovych to flee the country, along with some members of Parliament. Poroshenko was elected president in May.

Ukrainian citizens in Russia-annexed Crimea and the eastern areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists did not participate in the elections because of ongoing violence.

Over 6,000 candidates ran for 438 seats in the Parliament. Turnout was a bit over 50%, according to the Central Election Commission.

Three major exit polls showed seven parties getting into the Parliament, mostly pro-European, with President's Block of Petro Poroshenko leading with about 23%.
