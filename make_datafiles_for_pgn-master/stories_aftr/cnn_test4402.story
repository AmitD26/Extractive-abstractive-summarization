LONDON, England (CNN) -- The decision of English Premier League giants Manchester United to ban their players from signing autographs at the team's training ground won't affect the sports memorabilia market significantly, an industry expert says.

"I offer apologies to fans who come to the Carrington training ground looking for autographs, he wrote.

"The problem is that we have had too many opportunists selling on signed merchandise. They are not fans at all," Ferguson said.

The decision comes at a time when the market for replica jerseys and other autographed football memorabilia continues to grow significantly.

A quick trawl of the UK's version of auction site eBay shows almost 16,000 autographed football items for sale. These items include signed jerseys, cards, photos, books and prints. Prices vary greatly, however, a David Beckham Manchester United shirt was selling for Â£300 ($436) on Monday.

"It has definitely been growing, it's big business. In the past, people hadn't realized the price they could get for some of these items.

"The power of the Internet has changed this. However, with more players signing more autographs, the market is a little flooded with the items," he said.

Gallucci said less accessibility to players for some fans shouldn't alter the market too much as the items sourced from official routes were usually the most popular.

More than 90,000 items had been listed in the last three months, and eBay had noticed "a shift in people starting to sell their memorabilia on the site to make money," the spokeswoman told CNN.

In the U.S. market, players in sports such as baseball sometimes only signed autographed items on pre-arranged and contracted deals with memorabilia companies, Galluci said.

All of the top ten items on the list are baseball memorabilia. See the list here.
