(CNN) -- After two days of talks, North and South Korea are inching towards restarting operations at the joint Kaesong Industrial Park.

The manufacturing complex run by North and South Korea, sits just north of the DMZ that separates the two countries. It housed operations of more than 120 South Korean companies and employed 53,000 Northern workers, before souring relations halted operations this spring.

The last remaining South Korean workers left the facilities in May, although work had been winding down amid tensions. Workers left with belongings strapped onto their cars.

North Korea has barred South Korean workers from entering the complex before in 2009 and 2009.

Kaesong is considered to be an important source of hard currency for Kim Jong Un's government as more than hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of goods are produced each year.

Opinion remains divided on the potential restart for Kaesong.

Another editorial published during weekend in South Korea's JoongAng Daily, urged keeping Kaesong, saying that the venture must be kept alive to "solve other inter-Korean problems."

In recent weeks, North-South relations appear to have thawed. North Korea agreed to high-level talks with the South in June, though those talks were called off at the eleventh hour after disagreements about the level of the delegates who would represent each side.

This weekend's talks occurred after North Korea restored a communication hotline with the South, which had been cut off repeatedly over the past four months.
