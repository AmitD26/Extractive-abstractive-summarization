New York (CNN) -- Major League Baseball issued a policy Tuesday afternoon to protect players from discrimination and harassment based on their sexual orientation.

MLB Commissioner Bud Selig and New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman announced the new code of conduct at an All-Star game fan celebration at New York's Javits Center.

The policy aims to strengthen efforts to protect gay players. The code will be given to every Major League and Minor League player and posted in each locker room.

"The Great American pastime of baseball sends a message that no professional athlete, professional or amateur should have to sit on the sidelines or hide out of fear of being mistreated because of their sexual orientation," said Schneiderman. "I commend the commissioner and Major League Baseball for leading the charge for tolerance in professional sports."

In addition, Selig's office will organize training sessions for club and league officials and staff at industry meetings. The next meeting is scheduled for November.

"The new policy is not in response to any specific incident," said Andrew Friedman, deputy communications director for Schneiderman.

In April, Schneiderman announced an agreement to reinforce anti-discrimination policies with the National Football League to "promote a culture of inclusion" and help disseminate posters to all 32 teams in the league.

In 2012, Toronto Blue Jay's short stop Yunel Escobar was suspended three games by Major League Baseball after wearing a homophobic slur on his eye black during a game. In June, Indiana Pacers player Roy Hibbert used the term "no homo" during a press conference. Hibbert was fined $75,000 and issued an apology via Twitter to Jason Collins, who had recently become the NBA's first openly gay athlete.

Human rights organizations welcomed MLB's move and its possible future impact.

"It says to gay fans and any players that might be gay but not out yet that the league is taking their concerns seriously and that it is a safe environment in which to enjoy and play the sport," said Cole-Schwartz.
