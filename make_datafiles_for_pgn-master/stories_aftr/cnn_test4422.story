Red Bull's Vettel increases his lead in the title race to 38 points after Fernando Alonso could only claim fifth in his Ferrari.

The ever-consistent Raikkonen has moved into second spot, one point ahead of Alonso with Hamilton in fourth, still 48 points adrift of leader Vettel.

But he will be heartened by a famous victory, with the Mercedes at last being able to capitalize on their qualifying superiority.

Fearing hot conditions and tire wear, Hamilton had expressed the opinion it would be a "miracle" if he was able to take the checkered flag, but in the reality his 22nd career win was almost untroubled, finishing 11 seconds ahead of Raikkonen.

It was his fourth win at the Hungaroring near Budapest, repeating his 2012 triumph with McLaren.

Hamilton acknowledged how crucial the victory was at the halfway stage of a season to date largely dominated by Vettel in his Red Bull.

"I think this is probably one of the most important Grand Prix wins of my career," he said.

"We have got to work hard but if we can come here and make our tires last we should be able to do it anywhere," he added.

Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg went off near the finish while in ninth place so Red Bull increase their advantage in the race for the constructors' title.
