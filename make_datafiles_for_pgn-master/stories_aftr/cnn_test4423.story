(CNN) -- We're keeping an eye on five high-profile cases this week. We may see a verdict in one (the Whitey Bulger trial), a sentence in another (the Bradley Manning case) and more fireworks in a third (the Nidal Hasan court-martial).

Also this week, the lawyer for a teen whose Facebook post landed him in jail will argue that the case be thrown out. And we wait to see if a grand jury indicts former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez.

'WHITEY' BULGER CASE: Deliberations resume

After deliberating for 28 hours over four days, a federal jury broke for the weekend without announcing a verdict in the trial of reputed Boston crime boss James "Whitey" Bulger.

Bulger, 83, is accused of racketeering, including involvement in 19 killings, and also 13 counts of extortion and money-laundering during a 20-year "reign of terror" that defined South Boston from the early '70s through 1995, when Bulger fled Boston.

Still, Donahue said, "If deliberations go for a long period of time I'm going to start to worry about a mistrial."

BRADLEY MANNING TRIAL: Awaiting a sentence

Lind acquitted Manning of the most grievous charge of aiding the enemy, which carried a maximum life sentence.

But she found him guilty of other counts that include violations of the Espionage Act.

The government is still presenting witnesses during the sentencing phase at Fort Meade, Maryland.

NIDAL HASAN COURT MARTIAL: Quick testimonies

By the end of Friday, they had called 48 of their 80 witnesses in three days, a fast pace enabled in part by Nidal Hasan declining to cross-examine anyone in the first two days.

Hasan is representing himself, but has three attorneys as backup.

The attorneys have asked to drop out of the case, saying they believed Hasan is trying to help the prosecution achieve a death sentence.

But the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, ruled Thursday that they must continue, saying it was "nothing more than their disagreement with Hasan's strategy in conducting his defense."

Fort Hood victims feel betrayed

Justin Carter, a 19-year-old Texas teen, is facing a felony terrorism charge for posting, during an argument about a video game, what he said was a sarcastic comment.

According to court documents, Cater wrote, "I'm f***ed in the head alright. I think I'ma (sic) shoot up a kindergarten and watch the blood of the innocent rain down and eat the beating heart of one of them."

His father said Carter followed the claim with "LOL" and "J/K," indicating that the comment wasn't serious.

Authorities said someone reported the comment, which came about two months after the mass killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, leading to Carter's arrest February 21 on a felony charge of making terroristic threats. In Texas, that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.

On Monday, at a pretrial hearing, Carter's lawyer will ask that the case be dismissed on First Amendment grounds. They say his comments were taken out of context, and that Carter made no real threat because he used the words, "I think."

Investigators want to know if former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez asked his fiance to hide the .45 caliber gun used in the killing of Odin Lloyd.

On Friday, his hometown newspaper, The Bristol Press in Connecticut, reported on newly unsealed search warrants that seem to suggest that his fiance, Shayanna Jenkins, took a lock box from his North Attleboro home to a storage facility.

According to surveillance tapes, Jenkins carried a "rigid object" the size of a lock box from the home into a car. She returned about a half hour later without it.

In the documents, police say Jenkins may either have dumped the gun in the woods or took them to the storage facility in Bristol, where Hernandez had rented a unit.
