A judge postponed the retrial to August 25th.

Mubarak faces charges connected to the killing of protesters during the revolution. He was forced from office in February 2011 following two weeks of mass street protests.

His trial, which was adjourned last month, continued despite the latest upheaval in the country he ruled for 30 years. Protesters calling for a reinstatement of his successor as president, Mohamed Morsy, have battled with security forces for days, leaving hundreds dead.

Six of Mubarak's former security aides last year were acquitted of charges related to the killings, and Mubarak's two sons -- Gamal and Alaa -- were acquitted of corruption charges.

But they, too, were ordered to be retried after Morsy, himself ousted last month, ordered a new investigation last year.

Mubarak has been held since his guilty verdict last year. After months spent in a military hospital, a public prosecutor sent him back to prison in April.

He is also charged with seizing public funds and misusing political influence. In addition, he faces a corruption charge that was not part of the original trial. Mubarak is accused of selling natural gas to neighboring Israel for prices below fair market value.

The ousted autocratic leader spent three decades in charge of Egypt, the most populous Arab country.
