(CNN) -- 2011 has been a year for young people in the Middle East and North Africa.

At the second "One Young World" conference in Zurich, Switzerland, this month, 1,600 under 25s from 194 countries spent three days sharing ideas and hearing from global leaders in business, politics and activism.

One of its recent projects is CrowdVoice.org, a user-powered service tracking voices of protests by crowd-sourcing information.

El Shafei said: "I founded CrowdVoice out of my own frustrations of desperately needing a tool to organize the dissemination of assorted information and current events about topics that mattered to activists worldwide.

"CrowdVoice made its mark with thousands of users when the revolutionary protests began in Tunisia and Egypt."

Entrepreneur, Jordan

Rami Al Qadi, 25, is an entrepreneur and electrical engineer who has designed a wind turbine that works in low wind speeds.

Al Qadi is worried that this year's unrest across the Middle East has made conditions harder for growing businesses, particularly those which depend on tourism.

He wants to see regulations eased for entrepreneurs and an end to corruption in Jordan.

Hamed said: "My main goal is to represent the organization in my country and spread awareness on its objectives."

Hamed was involved in the revolution in Egypt and is keen to help build her nation's future.

She said: "I have seen by my eyes the sacrifices made to this revolution to succeed.

"Therefore, we will work hard to achieve what we paid a great price for: better governance, better social justice, job creation, less corruption and above all a generation who are aware of their rights and duties, so that they can always stand up and fight for it."

Youth employment trainer, Jordan

Abulawi is training co-ordinator for Jordan Career Education Foundation, an organization which aims to give vulnerable and disadvantaged 18 to 24-year-olds a sense of hope and dignity by training them for work.

He said: "My hope is that parents and children fully understand the importance of education and that the numbers of uneducated youth decrease in Jordan.

"I also wish that the 'culture of shame,' where Jordanian youth do not work in certain jobs, is tackled and that the youth become the biggest segment of the workforce in Jordan."

Social entrepreneur, Egypt

Mahmoud El-Refai, 27, co-founded It'sOneHummanity, a global social network for humanitarians that lets them share their work and ideas.

He is also a climate-change ambassador for an international project, an engineering graduate and a corporate strategy officer for Siemens.

El-Refai said: "I'm working on bridging the gap between the private sector, the public sector and the civil society to create projects that can benefit the people at the 'bottom of the pyramid.' I believe that business must be for profit, but profit must also be for purpose."

Graduate student Sarah AbdulRazak, 23, is on the board organizing a "Women As Global Leaders" conference in Abu Dhabi next year.

She is also passionate about education and promoting dialogue between the east and west.

AbdulRazak said: "Young people are the voices and torchbearers of a progressive future, especially in the Middle East where they are currently underrepresented on the global stage."

Inventor, Jordan

Abdel Rahman Alzorgan, 21, and his younger brother Mohammad were named among the best young inventors in Jordan after winning fourth place in an Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in the United States.

The pair's invention was an automated irrigation system they had been working on since they were in elementary school.

Abdel said: "We got a patent for it, so we are known now as the youngest inventors of Jordan. At the moment we are working on five other research projects, mainly to do with environmental solutions."

Alzorgan, now an engineering student, also works on awareness campaigns involving politics, fighting hunger and HIV.
