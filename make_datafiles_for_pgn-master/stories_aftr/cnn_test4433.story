(TIME.com) -- Buildings can earn LEEDS certification for being energy efficient, so why shouldn't they qualify for being good for our health?

While hotels and spas have increasingly marketed wellness environments to attract health-minded consumers, real estate company Delos, which focuses on so-called wellness properties, is pushing the idea into residences. The company recently partnered with Columbia University Medical Center to conduct a four-year review of 4,000 scientific studies relating to health and the environment, including building technologies.

Some properties even contain behind-the-walls features such as UV sanitizers and air filters that get rid of bacteria and toxins.

For now, spaces designed by other developers require a partnership with Delos in order to earn the WELL designation. During this pilot phase, the standards are not public as they are with LEED certification, and the specific criteria — levels of acceptable allergens or other air particles, for example — are only available to developers who agree to meet the specifications in building their space.

The inspiration is in line with hotels that are turning more to wellness principles when designing its rooms and public spaces — a smart decision since health and wellness-related services contribute to an estimated $2 trillion industry annually. Corporate offices are slower to the trend, but are also starting to incorporate more health-focused design and environments, from filtered air to fitness facilities.

Hilton and Hyatt hotels, for example, go to great lengths to accommodate guests with allergies. Both use the PURE certification, which provides allergy-free hotel rooms that boast surfaces — both hard and soft — that are treated to minimize bacterial growth, and in-room filtration systems that remove potential allergens or pollutants. The hypoallergenic rooms claim to be 99% allergen free and are re-certified every six months.

On the fitness side, in 2011, Westin rolled out WestinWORKOUT rooms, which transformed hotel rooms into mini-gyms complete with a treadmill or stationary bike, dumbbells, fitness DVDs, resistance bands and stability balls. Similarly, the TRYP by Wyndham New York City keeps its fitness rooms stocked with an exercise bike and complementary exercise clothes.

"We know that 53% of travelers say that they always or often try to exercise when they're on the road," says Brian Povinelli, Westin's Global Brand Leader. "Our brand mission is to enable our guests to pursue their well-being when on the road. With the brand's dedicated WestinWORKOUT Rooms, hotel guests are able to fit their regular cardio, strength training, or exercise routines into their hectic travel schedules with the added luxury of a private workout at any time."

While some of these programs are undoubtedly marketing efforts to compete for consumers, there is a body of research suggesting that design can make a difference in health. For instance, the University of Tulsa's Indoor Air Program studies ways to improve indoor air quality in homes, schools and workplace environments. Currently, its scientists looking at the differences in various types of flooring to see how each impacts dust collection, cleaning methods and recirculation of settled particles. This particular project is focused on finding healthier breathing environments for students in schools.

Fitness claims are a bit easier to swallow. For its fitness-inspired designs, Delos studied ways to take advantage of living spaces to encourage beneficial physical activities. Some bathrooms in Delos properites, for example, include heated floor stones instead of tile to mimic the therapeutic effects of hot stone reflexology.

Indoor lighting is another important element of the WELL Building certification. Scialla says the challenges real estate has with lighting are pretty extreme. Now that we spend that majority of our time indoors, we lose our natural connections to light, and circadian rhythms are thrown off.
