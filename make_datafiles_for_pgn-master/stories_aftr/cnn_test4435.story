Audrea Gause, 26, was arrested in Troy, N.Y., where she lives, on a Massachusetts fugitive warrant, a statement from Coakley's office said. She is charged with larceny in Massachusetts

The nonprofit -- The One Fund Boston -- began distributing nearly $61 million to 232 eligible claimants starting June 30, according to a release from the organization.

Following a tip received by both the office of the state attorney general and The One Fund Boston that Gause was not in Boston at the time of the bombing, an official investigation began on Gause's claims, Coakley said at a news conference Friday afternoon.

More than 260 people were wounded and 3 were killed in the double bombings, which took place near the Boston marathon finish line on April 15.

There has been some indication that there may be others involved with Gause's fraudulent claims and the investigation is still ongoing, Coakley said.

Gause appeared in Rensselaer County, New York, Court for a fugitive warrant hearing on Friday afternoon, Capt. John Cooney of the Troy Police Department told CNN.

It could not immediately be determined whether Gause had retained an attorney.

Coakley's statement said her office, in conjunction with The One Fund, is reviewing all claims submitted to and paid by the fund.
