(CNN) -- A fast-moving California wildfire that is threatening thousands of structures has roughly doubled in size in a day -- to about 165 square miles -- and is now burning in part of Yosemite National Park, officials said Friday.

The Rim Fire has burned nearly 106,000 acres, up from about 53,000 acres a day earlier, spreading east from Stanislaus National Forest to part of Yosemite, Forest Service spokesman Bjorn Fredrickson said. The fire is only 2% contained.

Although smoke could become an issue in parts of the park, Yosemite Valley -- 20 miles away -- was clear Friday morning because winds were pushing the smoke and fire away, she said.

"(The fire) is in an area that would not affect park operations," she said.

Meanwhile, the fire also is spreading west, threatening the small mountain communities of Groveland and Pine Mountain Lake just outside the Stanislaus forest.

About 4,500 structures are under threat, according to InciWeb, a federal website that collects information from agencies like the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.

"It's crazy, and it has been for five days," Kirsten Lennon, whose home is threatened, told CNN affiliate KCRA. "Your heart's racing a little faster."

Authorities say the Rim Fire started in Stanislaus National Forest, just west of Yosemite, on Saturday afternoon.

The largely inaccessible and steep terrain has hampered firefighters' efforts, according to InciWeb, helping the fire grow nearly unchecked to a size now 1.5 times the area of California's capital, Sacramento.

The fire had destroyed 16 structures as of Friday morning, according to InciWeb. The locations of those structures weren't listed.

California Gov. Jerry Brown declared an emergency in Tuolumne County on Thursday, when the fire's size was reported to be only about 53,000 acres.
