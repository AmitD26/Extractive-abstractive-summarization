" 'Community' has been a show that's always on the bubble [to return] and we decided to bring it back again and see what a fourth season would do for us," Greenblatt continued. "The reason we did 13 episodes [of Community and other shows] is we wanted to get more comedies on the schedule ... which isn't to say we couldn't decide at some point to extend those seasons longer."

As for Harmon's exit, Greenblatt said:

Asked if he would categorically rule out a fifth season, Greenblatt said: "I would love nothing more than 'Community' to have a following on Friday and be able to continue [beyond season 4]."

NBC is premiering several new comedies this fall, including broad and wacky titles like "Animal Practice" and "Guys With Kids," as well as potentially more risky shows like the Matthew Perry therapy sitcom "Go On"and Ryan Murphy's unconventional family comedy "The New Normal."

"We're in this awkward stage," said NBC's entertainment president Jennifer Salke. "Some of our new comedies might seem more commercial to you ... it's kind of an evolving comedy brand."
