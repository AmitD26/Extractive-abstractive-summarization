(CNN) -- Cruising a luxurious superyacht with your own custom-built limousine onboard, ready for offshore jaunts, sounds like an experience fit only for royalty.

Likewise, lounging in your very own salon designed by one of the biggest fashion houses in the world could perhaps come with a lifestyle limited to supermodels.

Sovereign is the brainchild of Gray Design who insist the finer details of the superyacht would please monarchs around the world.

Gray Design specializes in high-end, luxury yachts that often incorporate designer cars. Sovereign is no exception with its sleek lines inspired by a limousine.

"We thought about a typical person on board one of these yachts and asked: how do they travel on land? Well limousine," says Gray Design CEO Eduard Gray. "It's a very unique concept in the yacht world."

The matching custom-built car is an added extra, but regardless if the new owner requests one or not, there will be space on the yacht for a garage to store their wheels whilst they are at sea. If the owner's car are left at home, the garage becomes an ideal area to store all the boat's toys such as jet skis.

Designers say production will start in the coming months. "The plans are so advanced that ship builders can bring production by the end of the year," says Gray. "It's not conceptual anymore; it's gone into the engineering stage."
