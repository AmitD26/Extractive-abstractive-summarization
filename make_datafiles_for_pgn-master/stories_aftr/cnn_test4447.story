(CNN) -- Marcel Kittel won the 10th stage of the Tour de France -- but it was Mark Cavendish who stole the headlines Tuesday.

The Briton was forced to endure a nervous wait following the conclusion of the race with television pictures appearing to show him barging into Dutchman Tom Veelers during a sprint finish.

The Manxman had looked to be in contention as the 197 kilometer stage between Saint Gildas des Bois and Saint Malo approached its climax before clashing with Veelers within sight of the finish line.

The Argos rider suffered cuts and bruises but race jury president Vicente Tortajada Villaroya refused to blame Cavendish for the coming together.

"Veelers had done his job for Kittel, he was tired and he was looking down," the Spaniard told reporters.

Cavendish, who finished third following the incident, maintained his innocence after missing out on a 25th stage win.

"The commissaires are already putting the blame on me," he told reporters.

Cavendish also took to Twitter to defend his actions, tweeting: "Just seen the sprint. I believe I didn't move line. I'm actually coming past Veelers and we touch elbows when he moves. Anyway, hope he's OK.

"I'm really happy to have won but the victory is tempered a bit by the crash. I hope Tom isn't too injured," he told reporters.

"Apparently Cavendish bumped into Tom and he lost control of his handlebars and crashed.

Team Sky's Chris Froome maintained his one minute 25 second lead over nearest rival Alejandro Valverde.

Froome was close to the crash towards the conclusion of the race but escaped with his lead intact.
