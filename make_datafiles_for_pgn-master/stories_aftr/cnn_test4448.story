Granby, Colorado (CNN) -- In my American Quest I am visiting states firmly for President Barack Obama (Illinois), those strongly for Mitt Romney (Utah) and some, like my next train stop, which can't make up their minds. Colorado, is one of these "undecided" states, which have become crucially important.

A look back shows Republicans won eight out of the last 10 presidential elections here, and in an interesting twist, Colorado also picked the election winner in eight of those 10 elections too. The exceptions of course were the Democrat victories of Bill Clinton in 1992 and Obama in 2008. In other words, Colorado stays Republican until it sees a Democrat it likes, and then that man wins the election.

With a large percentage of voters who classify themselves as independent, this year Colorado also has 6% of the electorate who say they are undecided -- the independents and the undecided will make the difference here.

So today Colorado is absolutely split. Of those who have expressed a preference, roughly 47% are going for each candidate and the rest are undecided. But here is the crucial point. Undecided does not mean apathetic. According to Patrick Brower, the former publisher of Granby's local paper, Colorado's 6% undecided will vote; they just haven't decided for whom.

When I tweeted this fact at the weekend (@richardquest) there was a barrage of tweets back. "How could anyone be undecided this close to the election?" was a common thread. After so much debate and discussion, surely everyone has made up their minds? Not here!

On the C Lazy U ranch in Granby, I met one political commentator from the right, one from the left and one in the middle. And I immediately understood the predicament. Colorado is a frontier state; hardy, rugged, mountainous, with winters that are not for the faint hearted. But it is also a fair state, with a liberal tradition on social issues (a proposal to legalize marijuana is on the ballot paper this year). In 2008 they liked the idea of change, and gave Obama a 9% victory. Now that undecided element is in play again and there is confusion about which way it will move.

According to liberal columnist Felicia Muftic's research, "undecideds" eventually stay with the incumbent. Better the devil you know. Her conservative rival columnist William Hamilton told me exactly the opposite. He quoted research showing "undecideds" ultimately go with the challenger.
