(CNN) -- When trash disappears into the dumpster, where does it go?

That's because the catadores (trash collectors) of the ASMARE cooperative are adept at transforming any old disused material into furniture, jewelry or even works of art.

"I have two jobs," explained 39-year-old collector Edimar Ferreira. "I go and collect the trash and then I transform it into art. I make small sofas, wooden benches, tables, and other plastic adornments."

"We have a phrase (at ASMARE): 'o seu lixo e o meu luxo,' (roughly translated as 'your trash is our luxury,')" he cheerily added.

Catadores like Ferreira are a familiar sight in towns and cities across Brazil -- a motley collection of individuals who sift through mountains of street trash or landfill to locate paper, cans, bottles, metals and other types of recyclable materials.

A 2010 estimate by the Business Commitment for Recycling (CEMPRE) association stated that there were roughly one million catadores in Brazil, although only a small number work officially for cooperatives and organizations like ASMARE.

Many are the formerly homeless, ex-convicts or individuals who have stumbled upon hard times, selling what they find to recycling companies.

Arts and crafts

Recruiting the help of local artists and volunteers, ASMARE has run an arts program for the best part of a decade where workers are taught how to transform the recyclable items they find during their daily collections.

Branching out

Yet although it was one of the first to introduce creative programs (as well as claiming to be the first catadore cooperative in Brazil), the Belo Horizonte outfit is far from alone in its aesthetic endeavors.

Other organizations and artists have adopted similarly imaginative tactics in undertaking creative projects with catadores in recent years.

In Sao Paolo, a street project called "Pimp My Carroca" has been adding colorful graffiti to the wooden carts used by many catadores since last summer.

"In Brazil the catadore is often discriminated against because of their origin," Soares said.

Recycling attitudes

Soares also sees the potential to promote the possibilities of recycling across the country.

"Art through recycling aims to arouse people's consciousness to think about what trash is or is not," Soares said. "This new consciousness will help us to promote waste reduction.
