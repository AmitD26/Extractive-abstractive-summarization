1. Dubai pardons woman jailed after reporting rape

A 24-year-old Norwegian woman says she was raped by a colleague in a Dubai hotel following a work party -- but after she went to police, she was convicted and sentenced to 16 months in jail on charges of having unlawful sex, making a false statement and illegal consumption of alcohol.

A shallow, powerful 5.9-magnitude earthquake tore through China's Gansu Province, killing at least 89 people and injuring hundreds more, according to state media.

The Bulgarians cited evidence that the military wing of the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite group was involved in a terror attack last year that killed five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian bus driver. In Cyprus earlier this year, a court found a Hezbollah member guilty of assisting in the planning of an attack on Israel. Lately, its fighters have sided with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country's civil war.

The designation, which a spokeswoman for Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni called "correct and just," would freeze the assets of Hezbollah entities.

The wheelchair-bound Ji Zhongxing, 34, set off a homemade explosive inside a Beijing airport on Saturday after he was stopped from handing out leaflets "to get attention to his complaints" outside the arrival hall, according to Xinhua news agency.

Ji said on his personal blog in 2006 that he had been beaten by security guards outside a police station in 2005 after carrying a passenger on his motorcycle -- a charge the police denied. He was paralyzed after the incident and petitioned for official compensation.

Ji was hospitalized after he detonated his explosives. No other people were injured and flights at the airport were not affected.
