Indeed since the tournament started in 1994, only once has the International Team prevailed, and the U.S. has won four in a row.

The U.S. featured six players in the top 10 in the rankings, including world No. 1 and PGA Player of the Year Tiger Woods. The International Team, by contrast, had one -- Masters champion Adam Scott.

By day's end, it was 3.5 to 2.5 for the U.S., a slender advantage.

"It's awfully fun partnering the No. 1 player in the world," Kuchar said in a televised interview.

The U.S. fell behind as Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley lost to Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel 2 and 1 before Scott and Hideki Matsuyama halved with Bill Haas and Webb Simpson.

Jason Dufner and Zach Johnson eased past Branden Grace and Richard Sterne 5 and 3 to level the match.

In the decider, Steve Stricker and Jordan Spieth edged Ernie Els and Brendon de Jonge.

Stricker's short putt at the 18th gave the U.S. the lead heading into Friday's foursomes.
