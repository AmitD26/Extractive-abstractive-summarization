Corey Dunton was arrested and charged with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon, and will be charged as an adult, according to New York Police Detective Kelly Ort.

Megan Cutcher, a San Francisco resident visiting New York City, was having a drink with relatives at a nearby restaurant when the gunfire started.

"We sat down at one of the outdoor couches with a heater and ordered a drink," Cutcher said. "Right after we ordered, we heard three shots. Initially, it just sounded like a pop gun, but then people started screaming, and we realized it was more serious."

She grabbed her mother and pushed her under the table.

"We were at most 10-15 feet from the ice," she said. "Luckily, the couches we'd been sitting on blocked us from the view of the shooter."

"I was able to calm down a bit, though my heart was racing," she said.

Police ordered them to stay put while they searched the area. About an hour later, they got an all-clear to use a particular exit.
