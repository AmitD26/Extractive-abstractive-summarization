The human rights group said al-Khawaja's wife and daughter spoke with him briefly after the court session, which was the first time they had been allowed to see him since April 9, when he was arrested and beaten.

They said that they could see a number of injuries to his face, and that he told them he had suffered four fractures to his face, including one to his jaw that required four hours of surgery, the rights group said.

"It appears that Abdulhadi al-Khawaja's jailers tortured him during the month they held him in incommunicado detention," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.

"Torture or ill-treatment is a serious crime, and Bahraini officials who did or authorized this treatment need to be held accountable," Stork said.

To give time for defendants to prepare their defenses or appoint their lawyers, Bahrain's National Safety Lower Court postponed the resumption of their trial until May 12, the rights group said.

Bahrain's police and military have operated under a "state of national safety" since March 15.

Before Sunday's court session, Bahrain's military public prosecutor, Col. Yusif Rashid Feleyfel, formed a committee composed of public prosecutors who questioned the 14 suspects, the state-run Bahrain News Agency (BNA) said.

The agency said the defendants are accused of crimes that include "organizing and managing a terrorist group for the overthrow and the change of the country's constitution and the royal rule," "the seeking and correspondence with a terrorist organization abroad working for a foreign country to conduct heinous acts against the Kingdom of Bahrain," "an attempt to overthrow and change the country's constitution and royal rule by force," funding a terrorist group, insulting the army, "broadcasting false news and rumors" that threatened public security, "inciting the hatred of a certain sect of people," and organizing and participating in rallies without having obtained the proper permits.

Two other detainees entered court with limps, the rights group said. "Sources told Human Rights Watch that when the defendants asked to speak about the abuse they allegedly experienced in detention, security forces forcibly removed them from court," it added.

"One person who claimed to have seen him said he was at that point unrecognizable as a result of apparent beatings in detention," it said.

And BNA called the reports "fabricated, politically-motivated news."

Human Rights Watch noted that Bahrain is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which prohibits torture, and that Bahrain has ratified the Convention Against Torture.

Bahrain is an American ally and home to the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet.

The Al-Khalifa royal family is Sunni Muslim, but two-thirds of the population are Shiites. In recent years, younger Shiites have staged violent protests to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption, and many Shiites say the country's constitution has done little to improve their condition.
