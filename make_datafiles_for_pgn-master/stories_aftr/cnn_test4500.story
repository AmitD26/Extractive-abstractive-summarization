Foster's old day job as a jingle writer proved to be great training ground for creating punchy hooks. The Los Angeles-based group is now up for a pair of Grammys: Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group for their smash single "Pumped Up Kicks" and Best Alternative Album for their debut CD, "Torches."

But counting a couple of hard rock icons as fans isn't as random as one might think. Lurking beneath the shiny bubble-gum surface of Foster the People lies a dark theme or two -- particularly in "Pumped Up Kicks," in which a teen shooter tells potential victims they'd "better run, better run, faster than my bullet."

CNN: I hear Bono is a fan.

Foster: Yeah, the last time we played in Dublin, we ended up at Bono's house and had dinner with him and got to hang out with him for a few hours. We just talked about music and art and poetry and just all the things that you maybe expect Bono to talk about. We walked away and were really inspired.

Cubbie Fink: I missed the Bono experience. It was on our day off in Ireland, and I just turned my phone off and kind of relaxed. I ended up turning it on in the afternoon and seeing 25 missed calls and a hundred texts saying, "Hey, we're going to the BBQ. Come with us." I missed it.

Foster: But you did get to watch a rugby game, didn't you.

Fink: Soccer.

CNN: Are you critical when you hear your songs on the radio?

Foster: I think now I just kind of turn the station off when the stuff comes on. I was hanging out with a girl in New York, and we were in a cab, and "Pumped Up Kicks" came on, and she told the cab driver, "Hey, can you turn this rubbish off?!" It's like, "Thank you. She's reading my mind."

CNN: Did you feel like outsiders in high school?

Foster: I experienced bullying a lot. I was an only child, and I was kind of a small kid with a big mouth, and so I always got myself in trouble. So I grew up kind of having to scrap. And I grew up in Cleveland. It's pretty blue collar, and kids know how to fight there, so that was a real thing, for sure.

CNN: What's inspiring you guys these days?

Foster: I've been thinking a lot about the political state of where we're at right now. There's a lot I'm not happy about and would love to talk more about it. I think that musicians have a voice that is sometimes louder than anyone else's voice, in a sense.

Also, doing charity work and humanitarian work is something that we've been really into on this last tour. We've teamed up with the Do Good Bus, which followed us around. We've done something with local charities in every city that we've stopped in, so I think going into the (next) record, we'll see where things are at. But we're also a new band, and we don't want to get too bleeding heart too early. I think you have to keep it about the music for a while before you start preaching too much.

CNN: What do you have up your sleeve for Foster the People's second record?

Foster: We're going to try to continue to push the envelope. A lot of what we've learned touring this year is that the percussion element of what we do live is something that we'd love to bring into the studio and do more of on our second record. And just pushing the envelope with the electronic music and also working on some classic songwriting, which we haven't really put our much of yet. I like classic soul, so we'll see. It's going to be interesting.

CNN: Before Foster the People took off, you all had some odd jobs.

Mark Pontius: We were delivery boys at one point, funny enough, delivering coffee and cheese to Larry King sometimes just down the street. We all had weird, odd jobs, and living in L.A., struggling to be a musician is tough sometimes, and you just want to give up. But you gotta stick to it.
