He was 85.

His followers believe he has supernatural powers. However, critics have accused him of fraud and sexual abuse, allegations he has denied.

The guru claimed to be a reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi, one of India's greatest spiritual figures, who died in 1918.

Sri Sathya Sai Baba was hospitalized last month in his southern India hometown of n Puttaparthi.

Authorities have tightened security around the town since his condition started worsening.

In a hospital bulletin, doctors did not use the word death to announce his passing.

"His teachings were rooted in the universal ideals of truth, right conduct, peace, love and nonviolence," he said. "I express my sincere condolences to the millions of his followers, disciples and well wishers."

The guru has set up various health, education and charity organizations.
