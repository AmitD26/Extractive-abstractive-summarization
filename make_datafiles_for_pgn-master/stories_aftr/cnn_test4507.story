Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Television producer Stephen J. Cannell, known for his work on shows including "21 Jump Street" and "The A-Team," died Thursday, his publicist said. Cannell was 69.

He created, wrote and produced several iconic TV series, starting in the 1970s with "The Rockford Files."

Viewers may best remember the trademark closing for Cannell's productions, which showed him at a typewriter tossing a sheet of paper over his shoulder.

Cannell authored 16 novels, including the "Shane Scully" series.

He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Marcia, three children and three grandchildren, the family said.

He formed an independent production company, Stephen J. Cannell Productions, in 1979, which gave him control and ownership of his shows.

His studio is developing feature film versions of several of his hit TV shows, including "21 Jump Street" and "The Greatest American Hero." "The A-Team" movie was released in theaters last summer.
