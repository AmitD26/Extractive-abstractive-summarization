(CNN) -- After the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, hundreds of thousands of cards, letters, drawings, stuffed animals and other sentimental items poured into Newtown from throughout the world in a show of support.

Moreno started an initiative called Embracing Newtown which will make use of the massive amounts of material that turned up starting in January at the town's municipal center. She wanted to ensure that well wishes were preserved.

Moreno enlisted the help of more than 100 volunteers to sort through the piles of mementos. The items were incinerated, with the ashes, or what Moreno called "sacred soil," to be used in the making of bricks to serve as the foundation of a future memorial honoring the 26 who lost their lives.

The incarceration occurred in garbage facility that allowed volunteers to be present, Moreno said.

Four tractor-trailer cargo containers hold the incinerated mementos, Moreno said.

"You will be in my dreams tonight," says the writing on one drawing on embracingnewtown.com, with a list of the names of 26 who were killed on December 14, 2012 and the image of a sleeping child.

Another letter states, "Not one kid will be forgotten."

The letters came from every state as well as dozens of countries.
