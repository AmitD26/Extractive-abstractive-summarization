London (CNN) -- At an age when most of us were still mastering how to tie our shoelaces, Benjamin Grosvenor was working on his piano arpeggios and legato fingers.

The British former child prodigy is now barely out of his teens, but already has a reputation as one of the most exciting and distinctive pianists in the world today.

"There was always a piano in our house because my mother was a piano teacher and we had an upright which was there from when I was born. But I don't have any strong first memory of my interaction with it," he recalls.

According to his mother, he says, he "didn't have any interest in it at all" in the piano aged five and only resumed playing a year later after he discovered that his friends were taking lessons.

Grosvenor likes to relay memories of his formative years in competitive terms: He admits that he didn't care much for the music as a child, but rather saw playing the piano as a "challenge" that needed "overcoming."

Indeed, such are the physical demands of regular practice that he describes himself as an "athlete." But, today, his passion for playing is driven by a profound belief in the power of music.

"The ability it has to communicate emotions to people. I think that is what it's all about," he says.

Grosvenor's fans certainly believe in his ability to transmit emotions. A "romantic pianist, almost from another age ... He jumps inside the music's soul," is how British newspaper The Times described him recently.

Tellingly, Grosvenor says he spends almost as much time developing an emotional bond with a piece of music as he does physically practicing the notes at his piano.

Instead, Grosvenor often develops an interpretation of a piece of music in his head, "away from the piano."

For one so accustomed to regular public performance since childhood, Grosvenor still wrestles with debilitating nerves.

"I have been trying to picture the contours of an image of a valley I once saw, something completely irrelevant to what I'm about to do and just to look over it and try and picture all the small details -- and I think that helps to calm me down," he says.

And yet despite this extraordinary ongoing success, Grosvenor -- who just graduated from the Royal Academy of Music in London -- still sometimes wonders if he's made the right career choice.

It's a sobering thought, so how does Grosvenor maintain the force of his convictions?

"It is never playing the piano that is the problem -- it is the outside pressures. It is the pressures of the career and that is something to remember. You go through periods where you feel like all the work is piled on top of you but there is always an end to that and you just have to get through it ... It is usually alright in the end."
