(CNN) -- The Leipziger Strasse in central Berlin looks like almost any another main traffic artery in the world these days. It's four lanes in each direction, and high rise buildings with nondescript shops on the ground floors line the sidewalks.

But this used to be one of the main streets of Communist East Berlin, where the East German regime showcased its arsenal during military parades. It was also the place I spent five years of my childhood from the late 1970s.

"It was a war of the airwaves much more than it was a war with weapons, because there was always this competition between East Germany and West Germany," my dad recently told me when we visited our old house at Leipziger Strasse 66.

"They broke into our flat, but also into our office," he said, describing the Stasi's methods. "They took pictures. And sometimes they wanted to show me that they were in. That I got the impression that I am being observed."

They tried to gather any sort of information they could on my dad. The Stasi also used directional microphones and, of course, many informants who tried to make contact with our family and those working for the ARD office in the Schadow Strasse in East Berlin. The files that the Stasi gathered were later made available to the public. When my dad went through his, he was amazed.

"It was a total observation," he said. "They wanted to know everything to try and determine what kind of guy I was, because they thought all Western reporters were spies."

He later discovered that all of our neighbors around the house we lived in were secretly reporting to the Stasi. There were some situations where it was pretty obvious that people were acting as informants, or "Unofficial Employees" as the Stasi called them. But it was impossible for Western journalists to know the full extent to which they were being shadowed.

The daily work was a cat and mouse game. The East German regime went to great lengths to try and prevent people in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany's official name) from watching Western TV. And they also did everything they could to stop East Germans from talking to West German reporters.

When the team arrived, Stasi agents were already waiting, and they tried to stop them from talking to Heym. The crew did what almost every TV crew does when confronted with government goons who want to stop them from doing their work: They started a long conversation while the cameraman secretly kept filming, and the Stasi people grew increasingly uncomfortable as the situation went on.

As time went on, the East German government's restrictions grew tighter and tighter.

Being a West German family living in East Berlin, we were allowed to pass through the Berlin Wall to West Berlin anytime. The children actually went through the Wall every morning to get to school and kindergarten. My parents have never forgiven us for purposely losing our identification cards whenever we didn't feel like going to school. That meant we were stuck in the East, and that my dad would have to fly to West Germany to get new IDs for us.

The constant harassing and spying also made life extremely difficult for my mother, who was doing an amazing job trying to raise me, my brothers Christoph and Benjamin and my sister Vanessa. My dad had promised her a glamorous life as the wife of a foreign correspondent with stints in Paris or New York. Instead she found herself first in Moscow from 1970 till 1977, and then in East Berlin.

It didn't help that my siblings and I did a lot to bring our parents into embarrassing situations. My father remembered how he once got a call because his children had stolen a border guard's hat and thrown it around the inside of a bus. On another occasion we threw balloons filled with water from the 13th floor of our building and hit an East German "Volkspolizist," as the regular police were called.

"One of the questions that was asked in the police report was whether the balloons were filled with warm or cold water," my dad recalled with a smile on his face as we stood outside the apartment building.

I take great pride in the fact that my dad played such a prominent role opposing German division, and that he and my mother never gave up and always stood tall and strong. No matter how repressive, intrusive and abusive the East German regime was, it never broke the will of The Tiger.
