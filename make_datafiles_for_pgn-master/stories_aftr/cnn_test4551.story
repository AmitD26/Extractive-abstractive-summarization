(CNN) -- The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is an enormous tragedy for the families of the victims.

It is excruciating to live through the pain, helplessness, shock and anger. It is as hard to regain some degree of normalcy.

I know because I've been there. In 1985, my beloved father died on the Japan Airlines Flight 123 that crashed outside of Tokyo, killing more than 500 passengers and crew. It's one the largest plane accidents in the history of aviation.

But the truth is that while you may hold out hope, the world is presuming they are gone forever. You have to accept it and move on.

Here are some steps that helped me recover from my loss. Perhaps it could be of help to the families of Flight 370:

1. Grieve. Allow the pain to be released. Cry, punch the pillows, share stories, do what you need to let the feelings out. Let the emotions flow.

3. Eat as healthy as you can.

4. Get rest, even if you can't sleep well, take some down time.

5. Move. Walk, exercise, play a sport, dance, do something physical so that the feelings can be dissipated.

8. Help someone who may be in a worse situation than you. In my case I saw that a couple of American families didn't make the trip to Japan. I sent them notes to let them know that I prayed for their loved ones, and that everyone was very kind and respectful in the whole search process.

From disaster I've learned to be strong and flexible, and to seek assistance when I need it. With faith and courage I can make a positive difference in other people's lives. During the course of my life, I've been fortunate to reach many of the goals I had set. I know that my dad was there, guiding, supporting and inspiring me the entire time. He smiled with pride with each new milestone that I crossed.
