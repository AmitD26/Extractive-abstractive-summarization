(CNN) -- On a record attendance day at the Monte Carlo Masters tennis event, the king of clay held court.

World No. 1 Rafael Nadal began his quest for a record-extending ninth triumph at the principality tournament with a 6-4 6-1 victory over Russia's Teymuraz Gabashvili.

A capacity crowd of 14,600 fans packed into the Monte Carlo Country Club, where Nadal won eight successive titles between 2005 and 2012.

Nadal came within a point of going a double break down in Wednesday's opening set, but he recovered to wrap up victory in resounding fashion.

Next for Nadal is a third-round tie with Italy's Andreas Seppi, who emerged victorious from a marathon encounter with Spaniard Pablo Andujar that lasted two hours and 48 minutes.

"I'm very happy now that I'm doing well," said fourth seed Federer, a three-time runner-up in Monte Carlo. "But, of course, I also expect this from myself. So I'm just trying to keep up that rhythm. I feel free physically and in my mind. I'm eager to play, I'm eager to practice.

"I want to play good points. I'm no longer afraid that the rally will last too long. This was getting in the way of my game last year, whereas now I can really enjoy myself."

Federer has been usurped as Switzerland's top-ranked player by Stanislas Wawrinka, who won the first grand slam title of his career at January's Australian Open.

"I practiced perfectly before," said the 29-year-old, who next faces Spanish 15th seed Nicolas Almagro. "I expected a more difficult or more complicated first round against him.

"Now the clay court season is just starting and I'm always very pumped up for this particular moment of the year. I'm aware of my strengths, and I know that I must practice a lot and prepare well."
