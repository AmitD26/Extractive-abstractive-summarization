London, England (CNN) -- The release of confidential U.S. diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks achieved many things: making a star -- and wanted man -- of its main protagonist Julian Assange as well as redrawing the world's foreign policy map.

But also hidden among the cables are stories that reveal an often overlooked phenomenon: dictators, governments and leading industrialists being drawn to football's cultural and political power like moths to a flame.

Myanmar's junta considered buying Manchester United

Myanmar's de facto leader General Than Shwe was almost talked into buying one of the world's most popular football clubs, Manchester United, for $1 billion by his favorite grandson Nay Shwe Thway Aung.

In the end, such an investment only months after nearly 150,000 people were killed by Cyclone Nargis, was deemed inappropriate.

"The grandson wanted Than Shwe to offer $1 billion for Manchester United," the cable explains. "The senior general [Shwe] thought that sort of expenditure could look bad, so he opted to create for Burma a league of its own."

According to a cable in June 2009 called "Cronies Launch New Soccer League", select businessmen were told that [General] Than Shwe had "chosen" them to be the owners of the new professional soccer teams.

The opening sentence of one cable emanating from the U.S. embassy in Sofia says it all. "Since the fall of Communism, Bulgarian soccer has become a symbol of organized crime's corrupt influence on important institutions."

Accusations of match fixing and illegal betting have led to attendances in the league to plummet as Bulgaria's football fans desert a game which they feel has now become a symbol of corruption. Bulgarian football is, according to the cable, a dangerous thing to be involved in.

Questions on corruption in Bulgarian football sent to the Bulgarian Football Union by CNN have so far remained unanswered.

One WikiLeaks cable entitled "Cocaine Bust: Minister of Transportation Sacked" from August 2008 refers to a bizarre incident when an aircraft with over 700 kilograms of cocaine was found abandoned at Lungi airport. The minister for transportation, Ibrahim Kemoh Sesay, was fired after a close relative, national football team coach Mohamed Sesay, was arrested in the scandal.

Mohamed Sesay is currently serving a five-year jail term.

"He was team coach for the 2010 African Cup of Nations qualifiers," Sorie Ibrahim Sesay, spokesperson for the Sierra Leone Football Association and a distant relative of both men, told CNN.

"This was a man instrumental in getting funds for the federation because of his political influence with the government ... but we had this problem and he was relieved of his duties."

President Ahmadinejad personally sacks the Iranian national coach

A cable from June 2009 titled "Iran's First Fan: Dissatisfaction with Ahmadinejad May Extend From the Soccer Pitch to the Ballot Box," reveals the extent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had draped himself around the national team to improve his popularity.

Ahmadinejad's faith in football was such that he believed the team had to win a vital qualifier against the UAE two days before the presidential election because he "'cannot afford a loss on the eve of the election in such a tight race."

In the end Iran beat the UAE 1-0 at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran thanks to an Ali Karimi goal. The elections ended in bloodshed a few days later. Karimi led the team onto the pitch for Iran's final, crunch game against South Korea wearing a green armband, allegedly to show solidarity with the Green Revolution raging back home, proving that presidential patronage doesn't guarantee obedience. The team drew 1-1 and never made it to South Africa.

A recent Human Rights Watch report detailed just how bad the situation is in Eritrea, with its semi-permanent state of conscription and reports of political prisoners being held in starvation conditions in underground prisons.

"Only the coach and an escorting colonel reportedly returned to Eritrea. (One wonders why, given their likely fate.)," the cable said. "[President] Isaias [Afewerki] has previously claimed the CIA was luring Eritrean youth abroad; if the soccer team has in fact defected, he will undoubted try to twist logic in some way to blame the United States."

President Afewerki denied that the team had disappeared, but 11 of the 12 players arrived safely in Australia, claiming political asylum. But, rather ominously, it looks like it will be a while before the [former] Red Sea Boys will see their families again.

"[President] Isaias [Afewerki] is clever, very good at operational security, and two decades younger than Mugabe."

Al Wihdat -- once described as Palestine's unofficial national football team by Yasser Arafat -- represents the Jordanians of Palestinian origin who make up as much as 70% of the population. Al Faisaly represent the Hashemite Jordanians, who see themselves as the "true" Jordanians and fear becoming a minority in their own country. Often the simmering hatred explodes during Jordan's biggest derby match.

"The game exposed the growing rift between East Bankers [Hashemite Jordanians] and Palestinians in Jordan," the cable concluded. "The King's silence on the event is noteworthy, as is a reluctance among our contacts to discuss the issue."

A few days after the cable was released the issue once again made international headlines when 250 Wihdat fans were injured during riots when Wihdat beat Faisaly 1-0. Al Jazeera reported that police beat several fans to death. The government has since opened an enquiry into the violence.
