(CNN) -- A man accused of killing his wife while she frantically spoke to a 911 operator bought marijuana candy just hours before the deadly shooting, police said Thursday.

For nearly 13 minutes, Kristine Kirk told 911 she feared for herself and their three scared children. She screamed when her husband went to the family safe and grabbed a gun.

Then "the screaming stopped," Denver Police Detective Mark Crider wrote in a search warrant affidavit. And Kristine Kirk, the detective wrote, was "never heard from again."

When they arrived at her house, investigators found her dead on the floor with an apparent gunshot wound to the head.

The affidavit says Kristine Kirk sounded "panicked" but does not specify at what point in the 911 call her tone changed.

After authorities arrested Richard Kirk, the affidavit says, he started "rambling to himself" and told an officer "that he was the strongest in the Church of Latter Day Saints and he had killed his wife." At the time, police believed he was under the influence of a controlled substance or prescription medication "based upon his speech patterns, his inability to focus and his pupils," the affidavit says.

At a court hearing Wednesday, Richard Kirk was ordered held without bail on an accusation of first-degree murder.

In response to questions about the incident, Denver Police Chief Robert White told reporters Thursday he had opened an internal review of why it took officers more than 12 minutes to respond, CNN affiliate KUSA reported.

"We want to know how long it took our officers from the time they were dispatched to get to that particular call," he said.

Investigators will look at the time it took operators, dispatchers and police officers to handle the call, he said.

"We are going to look at all nuances in this situation. What, if anything, went wrong from our perspective? What we can do to mitigate instances like that in the future?" White said, according to KUSA.

A dispatcher has been placed on leave pending the investigation into the incident, the CNN affiliate reported, citing police officials.

Kirk admitted that he killed his wife -- "without questioning," another police document says -- when an officer put him in the backseat of a patrol car, the probable cause document says.

CNN's Michael Martinez, Mariano Castillo, Stefan Simons, Kara Devlin and Dottie Evans contributed to this report.
