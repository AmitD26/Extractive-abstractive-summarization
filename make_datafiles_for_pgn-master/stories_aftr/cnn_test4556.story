In doing so, he put paid to the chances of Sweden's Henrik Stenson snatching the top spot in the rankings.

Stenson had earlier finished seventh behind McIlroy and needed Scott to finish lower than 13th to claim the status.

But there was no danger of that as the 2013 U.S Masters champion rolled home several clutch putts in his four-under effort.

"It's so satisfying in so many ways to get it done," Scott told the PGA Tour official website. He had been four-over-par early in his first round before battling back through the field.

The 25-year-old McIlroy also trailed for much of the four rounds on the famous West Course, being seven shots behind tournament leader Thomas Bjorn going into the final round.

But Bjorn, who opened with a superb 62, finished with a round 13 shots more for a 75 to open the door for the likes of McIlroy.

"I played well, I played solid but I struggled Friday," McIlroy admitted afterwards.

The on-off relationship had been followed as keenly in gossip columns as it had on the sports pages, but the announcement, coming shortly after the wedding invites had been sent out, had created a cloud of publicity that stubbornly followed McIlroy around Wentworth.

"There is no right way to end a relationship that has been so important to two people ... I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had. I will not be saying anything more about our relationship in any setting."

McIlroy later admitted that focusing on golf helped him forget about his personal issues and as the week went on he found top form.

His final round, included an eagle and six birdies, the final two on the 17th and 18th to post a 14-under total which could not be matched.

Scott and 2013 PGA Championship winner Dufner will also be hoping to carry their fine weekend form into the second major of the season in search of their own second triumph at golf's highest level.
