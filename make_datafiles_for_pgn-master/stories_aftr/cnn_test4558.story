BEIJING (CNN) -- Thousands of passengers were stranded Tuesday morning after dozens of early morning flights were either canceled or delayed due to a thick, dark cloud of smog that rolled through the Chinese capital.

The U.S. Embassy, which reports pollution levels on its Twitter feed, said the accumulation of air particles was "beyond index" for most of the morning, which means the pollution exceeded the scale used to measure it.

Last month, Beijing's Capital International Airport canceled more than 200 incoming and outgoing flights and delayed more than 125 others because of smog.

Analysts have blamed the thick haze on rapid urbanization and industrialization.

Pollution is more acute because of the sheer size of the city's population (17 million) and the rapid speed of its economic growth, experts say.
