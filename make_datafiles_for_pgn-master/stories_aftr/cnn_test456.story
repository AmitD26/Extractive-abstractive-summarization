Below, Warninger explains Portland's bright style.

Warninger: A lot of people like to support local fashion designers here, so what I find is people will invest in a designer piece and the rest of the outfit will be thrifted. People are very conscious of where they spend their money here.

CNN: What is unique about the style?

Warninger: This "mash-up" of a mix between local designers and thrift finds. It may be emerging in other cities, but Portland is doing it to an extreme.

CNN: Have you seen any trends emerging from that style?

There is also a new trend for colorful tights. The rest of the outfit will be toned down, grays and blacks, with a very bright tight. There is some crazy neon tight action going on here!

It's not all country in Nashville

CNN: Where do people shop in Portland?

Warninger: There are a lot of nice boutiques in Portland that carry the local designers, like Frances May and Una. Adam Arnold and a lot of the designers have their shops by appointment only as well.

Some of the designers that come to mind are Holly Stalder, Elizabeth Dye, Anna Korte, Kate Towers, Nom & Ada, as well as Project Runway's Leanne Marshall, Gretchen Jones, Seth Aaron (Henderson) and Janeane Marie (Ceccanti).

As far as thrift stores go, there are tons here. I would say there's some in each neighborhood.

San Francisco style: It's unforgettable

Basically if it makes me look twice, in a good way, then I stop them.

Typically, I have found that the people who are stylish here tend to go where artists have always gone, and that would be the coffeehouses. I call it my "coffeehouse tour" while scouting and I usually go through about eight shots of espresso.
