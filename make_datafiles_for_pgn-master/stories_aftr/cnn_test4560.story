(CNN) -- Police are still searching for an autistic teen that has been missing since he was last seen on video running out of his Long Island City, New York, school three days ago.

Surveillance video shows 14-year-old Avonte Oquendo of Queens running out the door of Center Boulevard School in Long Island City at 12:38 p.m. Friday. Police say Oquendo is autistic and cannot verbally communicate.

"This is just the hardest thing to have your child disappear, and you cannot bring him home with you," Fontaine said.

"He is supposed to have one-to-one supervision at all times," Fontaine said through bouts of tears. "He has the mental capacity of a 7- or 8-year-old."

The New York City Department of Education issued a statement saying, "We are working closely with police who are conducting an active investigation."

The school is not commenting.

Police say Oquendo was last seen wearing a gray striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers. He is 5 feet, three inches tall and weighs 125 pounds.
