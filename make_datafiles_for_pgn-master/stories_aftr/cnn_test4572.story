Fer's 77th minute effort gave Louis van Gaal's side the lead before Depay rounded off a late counter attack to seal the win.

Chile's first defeat of the tournament condemned Jorge Sampaoli's side into second place.

Both teams will find out their fate on Monday night with Brazil, Mexico and Croatia fighting it out to qualify from Group A.

After a forgettable first half, it was the Dutch which found its rhythm with the impressive Arjen Robben causing Chile all sorts of problems.

But it was the introduction of substitutes Fer and Depay which made the difference.

Fer had only been on the pitch for two minutes when he sent a thumping header past Claudio Bravo in the Chile goal after meeting Darryl Janmaat's fine free kick.

"It was a very good game to watch," Robben said in a television interview following the game.

"There was a lot of passion on the pitch, we defended really well, I am proud of the way the team defended.

"I think we did a great job and this is not where we want to stop. It is a fantastic result and a fantastic performance and we don't want it to end here.

"We need to change our mindset as we want to move forward."

Australia 0-3 Spain

In the group's other game, David Villa brought down the curtain on his international career by firing Spain to its first victory of the World Cup.

The 32-year-old was in tears after being taken off after 57 minutes of the contest and watched on from the bench as Fernando Torres added a second.

Juan Mata fired home a third with eight minutes remaining to seal the win.

Australia, which lost all three games in the tournament, finishes bottom of the group, three points behind Spain.
