Exactly a year ago, the famous grass-court grand slam experienced one of the weirdest days in its history as former champions Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova were knocked out and no less than seven players withdrew injured.

This year, however, defending champion Andy Murray sidestepped a potential banana skin with an effortless 6-1 6-1 6-0 victory over world No. 92 Blaz Rola.

"I played well today," said the world No. 3, who next plays Spanish 27th seed Roberto Bautista Agut. "He's just come out of college and broken into the top 100 so it was tough for him but he's got a good game."

"I felt like that cost me a little bit at the French Open," he added. "If you can finish matches as quickly as possible it definitely helps in the long run."

Second seed Novak Djokovic had a few more problems in his second-round match, finally overcoming veteran Czech Radek Stepanek -- who beat Murray at Queen's Club this month.

The Serbian world No. 2 triumphed 6-4 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-5) in three hours 17 minutes to set up a clash with Frenchman Gilles Simon, who beat Robin Haase of the Netherlands in straight sets.

"He's 35 years old but he's moving very well. Grass is probably his most preferred surface. He performs really well on the big stages as you saw," added Djokovic, who lost the French Open final against Rafael Nadal this month.

Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky sent out a warning by sensationally repeating his "Wacky Wednesday" antics.

Last year, Stakhovsky was a shock winner against Federer, saying afterwards: "I can definitely tell my grandkids that I kicked the butt of Roger Federer."

Spain's seventh seed David Ferrer also succumbed to grass-court giantkilling, losing 6-7 6-0 3-6 6-3 6-3 to 2009 junior Wimbledon champion Russian Andrey Kuznetsov, who next plays Argentina's Leonardo Mayer.

Australian Open champion Li Na ticked off a 6-2 6-2 victory against Austrian Yvonne Meusburger, and the Chinese star will next play Czech Barbora Zahlavova Strycova.

The 2011 Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova dropped just two games as she eased past German Mona Barthel, and the Czech will next face five-time winner Venus Williams -- who advanced to the third round with a 7-6 6-1 victory over Kurumi Nara.

Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, a finalist in 2012, swept aside Australian Casey Dellacqua 6-4 6-0 while former No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki also triumphed.
