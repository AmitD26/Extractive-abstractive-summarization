It's a compelling image, but it captures only a feeble percentage of the diversity and excellence that imbues one of the most incredible countries in the world.

Here are 10 things Mexico does better than anywhere else.

Plenty of cultures do ancestor worship.

But who else turns the commemoration of their dearly departed into an annual fiesta of art, food and community?

Every ofrenda includes pictures of the deceased, food, drinks, skull-shaped candies, candles and cempasuchil, the Aztec marigold or flower of the dead.

The belief is that souls of children come back to earth to visit family and friends on November 1 and the souls of adults do the same on November 2.

Day of the Dead festivals take place across Mexico. Three of the most elaborate are held in San Andrés Mixquic (in Tláhuac, Mexico City), Patzcuaro, Michoacán and Janitzio, Michoacán.

Horn sections

Whereas most countries tend to save their horns for parties and special occasions, however, Mexico kicks out the brass jams on a daily basis.

It all comes down to bandas, the heart of both traditional and popular genres of Mexican music.

Bandas are typically comprised of 10 to 20 musicians who play brass instruments, woodwinds and various percussion.

Tequila

Mexico's national liquor is a worldwide bar standard, with exports to 96 countries.

Tequila is meant to be sipped and savored, like fine whiskey, which, as any Mexican will tell you, the best tequila can compete with.

You can get a taste of the top-shelf stuff on the Tequila Trail, which includes some of the country's most renowned distilleries.

Mexican parties are notorious for going berserk in the blink of a bleary eye.

Wake up, guzzle water then inhale some spicy chilaquiles, carnitas (pork) or barbacoa (sheep) tacos with hot sauce and plenty of revitalizing grease -- maybe slam a light breakfast beer if you're in really rough shape -- and you'll be back making requests from the band by nightfall.

Double entendre (Albur)

But albur is so important in Mexico that there's a national tournament to crown the best alburero.

The current champ is Lourdes Ruiz, who's won the competition every year since 1997, defeating men and women. She even teaches albur courses.

Still not convinced Mexicans take double entendre more seriously than anyone else?

What other country has a day devoted to the subtle intricacies of its language?

Diplomado de Albures Finos (Course of Fine/Classy Albures) classes are held at the Galería José María Velasco (Peralvillo 55, colonia Morelos, Tepito, Mexico City); free admission; participants receive a diploma.

Nothing says "Mexican Catholic" like a reverence for the country's seemingly endless manifestations of the Virgin Mary.

Our Lady of Guadalupe is the most venerated Virgin in Mexico, maybe the world.

The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City is also one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Mexico, reportedly the most visited Marian shrine in the world.

Each December 12, about 5 million pilgrims from across Mexico visit the Basilica to thank the Virgin for her favors or to ask for a miracle.

Quick lunches

Known around the country as Vitamin T, tacos, tortas, tamales and tostadas are part of the everyday life.

In 1958, Telesistema Mexicano produced "Senda Prohibida" ("Forbidden Path"), the first Mexican telenovela (soap opera).

Fifty-six years later, its successor Televisa has produced a whopping 740 telenovelas.

A man and woman fall in love but, for tragic reasons, can't be together. After overcoming obstacles they finally get married.

Fifteen years after exporting its first soap opera, "Los Ricos Tambien Lloran" ("The Rich Cry Too"), Televisa has found a rich market outside Mexico.

Of all countries that export soap operas, Mexico ships out the most, carving niches in other Spanish-speaking countries, as well as China, the Philippines, Israel and Saudi Arabia. (Link in Spanish.)

Televisa isn't the only network producing successful telenovelas.

Polite lies

Instead -- and unfortunately for those unfamiliar with the rules of courtesy here -- we've developed a talent for white lies that allow us to say yes to fulfilling any request.

White lies can be as clichéd as "the dog ate my homework" or as morbid as "my beloved great aunt has suddenly developed pancreatic cancer."

But the granddaddy of polite lies is "ahorita."

When a Mexican tells you they'll do something "ahorita," be prepared to take a seat, because the wait can be long.

Think of ahorita as the Mexican art of procrastination -- it's been passed from generation to generation -- a term that can mean anything from "in 10 minutes" to "in three weeks."

Ahorita's cousin in crime is "I'm on my way."

This really means, "I'm on my way to finishing this TV show, maybe getting off the couch, calling my sister, taking a shower, grabbing a snack and actually leaving home to meet you."

You've been warned -- we're great at it!

Not all tequila is for slamming -- the best stuff can compete with a fine whiskey and should be savored

Tacos, tortas, tamales and tostadas -- no lunch ever came quicker, or more satisfying, than one provided by Vitamin T
