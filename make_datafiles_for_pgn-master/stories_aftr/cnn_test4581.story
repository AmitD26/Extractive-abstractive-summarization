Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed a bill Friday that provides $600 million in emergency funding to help secure the U.S.-Mexico border.

Among other things, the bill provides for roughly 1,500 new law enforcement agents, new unmanned aerial vehicles, new forwarding operating bases and $14 million in new communications equipment.

Obama argued that the new law would facilitate cooperation along the border between the U.S. and Mexican governments, and asserted that it would make "an important difference" in the push for comprehensive immigration reform.

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters Friday that the measure would have a substantial impact in terms of reducing the "trafficking of people, drugs, currency and weapons."

She also fired back at Republican critics of the White House's border control efforts, declaring that "the administration had already devoted more resources to the southwest border than at any point in American history."

The bill is funded in part by imposing higher fees on personnel companies that bring foreign workers into the United States.
