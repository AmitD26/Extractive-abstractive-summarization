Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The principal of a high school, which lost 244 students and 10 teachers in the deadly Sewol ferry disaster in April, has been removed from his post, according to the local education office.

"I cannot reveal detailed reasons for his removal because it is personal information, but it is regarding the Sewol accident," said an official with the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education.

"The decision was made a while ago, but was carried out only recently because the focus was on dealing with the accident," said the education official.

Overall, 12 people remain missing and 292 died in the Sewol incident.

Three days after the Sewol ferry sank, the vice principal of Danwon High School, who had been rescued from the vessel, was found dead after apparently hanging himself. Kang Min Kyu, 52, had expressed regret in a note that he had survived while so many others had died.
