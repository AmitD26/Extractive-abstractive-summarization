Haifa, Israel (CNN) -- On a cool January morning, Israeli ambulances sped to the site of a simulated terrorist attack in Haifa, the country's largest port city. In keeping with the script for the long-planned civil defense exercise, emergency workers responded to a suicide car bomb with one element the country has not experienced in the dozens of real terrorist bombings over the years: this simulated attack dispersed nuclear materials, a "dirty bomb" laced with radioactive Cesium 137.

While life went on around them in an otherwise normal day, paramedics rushed the "victims" to area hospitals, where doctors and nurses in protective gear moved to decontaminate and treat their injuries. Elsewhere, authorities assessed the public health effects and the psychological impact on the public of hearing the words "nuclear" and "bomb" used in the same sentence referring to an attack close to home.

It was not a simulation of an atomic bomb, but of a "radiological dispersal device," a much less destructive conventional weapon with some nuclear materials in the mix -- enough to spread a small amount of radiation and a great deal of panic.

In Jerusalem, Uri Margalit, a 57-year-old salesman, says he doesn't think Israel will attack Iran, but concedes that the uncertainty of what might happen has made him and his friends nervous. "Everybody's a little afraid," he admits. Others, like Hanna Ofner, are less pessimistic. "I count on the government to do the right thing," she says, adding that she believes Europe and the U.S. understand just how risky a nuclear-armed Iran would be for the entire Middle East and the rest of the world.

Polls show the public is divided about whether or not Israel should attack Iran to keep nuclear weapons out of its hands. Given that Iran's leaders have openly proclaimed their wish to see Israel destroyed, most Israelis believe a war will happen. Some Israelis tellingly confess they have restocked their bomb shelters with fresh water and other supplies.

If the conflict with Iran does escalate into open warfare, the widespread expectation is that Hezbollah, a close ally of Iran, will attack Israel from Lebanon, while Hamas, another friend of Tehran, will do the same from Gaza. The U.S. believes Hezbollah alone has an arsenal of about 50,000 rockets and missiles, some capable of reaching practically all of Israel.

While the radiological drill did not garner a lot of attention, there was another exercise -- one that did not happen -- which made large headlines.

It came as some comfort that President Obama just told Time Magazine that he "will take every step available to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon." Israelis hope that will be achieved without the need for war, but they believe it is a near certainty that a military operation against Iran would result in attacks against Israel by Iran's allies. Just in case, they are preparing for any conceivable scenario while carrying on with their daily lives and hoping for the best.
