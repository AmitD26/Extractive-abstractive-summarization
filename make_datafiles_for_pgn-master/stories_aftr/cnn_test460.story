(CNN) -- Sri Lanka, the teardrop-shaped island that in 2009 emerged from more than a quarter century of civil war, has staked claim as one of Asia's most exciting new destinations.

With the beaches of Negombo and Galle on the West Coast and World Heritage-listed ancient cities, Sri Lanka is experiencing a tourism boom.

As the country's tourism offerings have grown more sophisticated, so have its hotels. Here are a selection of the best.

It's only 20 minutes from the capital Colombo, but stand on the balcony of Reefs Edge and you'll feel like you're on a deserted island.

The view of the Indian Ocean is obstructed only by palm trees, affording guests front-row seats to blood red and beautiful sunsets.

A velvet green lawn runs 20 meters from the hotel to the beach, where sun beds and wicker domes beckon layabouts and drinkers of cocktails.

Though it has only 22 suites, Reefs Edge has the look and feel of a large hotel.

Complete with a day spa, gymnasium, steam room, seafood restaurant and a separate 250-seat banquet hall shaped like Noah's Ark, Reefs Edge takes the edge off a vacation in Sri Lanka.

St. Lachlan

Twenty minutes north of Reefs Edge, Negombo is Sri Lanka's most popular beachside town, thanks to its proximity to the international airport.

The interior speaks colonial cool: it has 10-foot-high doors with giant brass knockers, richly varnished shutters and teak furniture everywhere you look, with antlers and indigenous artwork accentuating the walls.

Little wonder -- it's run by Harpo Gooneratne, commonly known as Sri Lanka's first DJ and popular restaurateur.

Heritance Tea Factory

Take Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and replace the chocolate with tea. Now convert it into a luxury hotel.

The result is the Heritance Tea Factory, a resplendent four-star hotel set at 2,000 meters above sea level in the rolling green tea-growing region of Sri Lanka's southern highlands.

Latticed with green and red metal and brass, the hotel's museum-like lobby is wallpapered with historic photographs. It's centered around an atrium that houses the factory's original steam engine.

At the rock's base lie a series of pools and cisterns. They're interlinked by an underground conduit network that works as well today as it did when it was built 1,500 years ago.

Matching its sophistication is Vil Uyana, a luxurious ecolodge set in a wetland a 15-minute drive from Sigiriya.

Edging a mauve green lake brimming with birdlife, the swimming pool and lobby lead to a colonial-chic restaurant upstairs bookended by six-meter-high stone walls that are a nod to Sigiriya's ancient architects.

In 2008, while visiting his father's family in Colombo, British advertising executive John Balmond snuck off for the weekend to the Kalpitiya Peninsula a two-hour drive to the north.

Today there are 42 properties on the peninsula, including Palagama Beach, owned by Balmond and designed by Cecil Balmond (designer of London Olympics Orbit).

Pledge3

Sri Lanka's most sophisticated hotel is Pledge3, a five-star oasis of luxury and retro style in busy Negombo.

Every corner of this boutique hotel screams cutting edge design.

The 12 suites are spread across two floors surrounding an internal flagstone courtyard.

The courtyard leads to an open-air restaurant where the decor -- cherry red support beams and white leather couches -- is as eccentric as the Japanese-Sri Lankan-Mediterranean fusion menu.

Beyond it lies a tropical garden centered by a saltwater pool where attendants with the reflexes of Wimbledon ball boys attend to guests' every beck and call.
