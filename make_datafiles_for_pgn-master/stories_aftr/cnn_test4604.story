Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean, 16 of which offers hotels and resorts for tourists. With a population of around 87,000 people, Seychelles has the smallest population of any African state.

Here are five places, in descending order of honeymoon-likeliness, that have been touted as potential royal rendezvous.

1. North Island

Following Seychelles Tourism Minister Alain St. Ange's admission that the couple is spending their honeymoon on the tropical island, German real estate magnate Farhad Vladi told German newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt that he rented North Island to the couple.

North Island, one of the Inner Islands of the Seychelles archipelago, is occupied by 11 villas made by Balinese and Tanzanian craftsmen.

Each of them is equipped with plunge pools, gazebos and private butlers, but the most profligate of them all is the 8,000-square-foot Villa 11, which is almost twice is large as the island's other villas, and comes with circular-flow swimming pool and a private cinema.

Given Wills' love of the wild, he will also love the resort's conservation policies. Before the island was sold to the Maier family during the 1970s, the island was colonized by pests and alien plant species left over from its days as a coconut plantation. Indigenous trees and birds have been re-introduced these days.

Cost: An average honeymoon for two costs £3,220 ($5,280), whereas renting all the island's villas costs a staggering £43,000 ($69,700) -- a price tag that doesn't seem to faze Brangelina, Posh and Becks, JK Rowling and Liz Hurley, all of whom reportedly holidayed there.

Likelihood of a Will and Kate honeymoon: 6/10

Some tabloids like Usmagazine.com are speculating that the royal honeymoon will include a "nostalgic excursion to Desroches Island."

In August 2007, following a temporary break-up, the couple spent a week in Desroches Island Resort, which is only accessible by plane from the main island of Mahe. The experience was romantic enough for them to decide to soldier on with their relationship.

Cost: Rates of a beach suite per night starts at €1,100 ($1,580) per person for one night during high season.

Before word got out that the couple had chosen North Island, most thought they had gone for Fregate Island Private. With only 17 villas, Fregate is almost as exclusive as North Island.

Their spa, perched on top of a cliff, uses oils and pastes made from island-grown ingredients.

The island also claims to have rejuvenated the populations of Seychelles Magpie Robins, Seychelles Whiteye, Aldabra Giant Tortoises, Seychelles Terrapins on the island. Conservation efforts continue today.

Cost: Rates for a one bedroom villa starts at €2,950 ($4,230) per person per night during high season.

4. MAIA Seychelles

Likelihood of a Will and Kate honeymoon: 2/10

Here's why: it's regarded by some as the first top-notch resort to appear on the main island of Mahé, its native Seychellois cooks meals with the wow factor (bat curry, anyone?), and its La Prairie spa is regarded by Tatler as "the most spoiling set-up in Seychelles."

Its 4.8-hectare garden was named the best in Africa in 2008.

Rates: Villa rentals start at €1,590 ($2,280).

5. Cousine Island

Likelihood of a Will and Kate honeymoon: 1/10

Guests are encouraged to volunteer in the resort's conservation projects, from tree-planting to monitoring endangered sea turtles. Endemic plants take up 95 percent of the island's vegetation.

But it's not quite as opulent as some of the other resorts available to the couple, so we have this one down as an 'if all others fail' entry.

Cost: Individual Villa rental costs €1,200 ($1,720) per night, and the entire island can be rented out for €4,500.
