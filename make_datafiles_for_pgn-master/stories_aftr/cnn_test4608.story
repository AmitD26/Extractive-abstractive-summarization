The "Hangover" video shows Psy taking Snoop on a ridiculous guided tour of what he does best -- hardcore drinking, Korean-style. This involves endless bomb shots, hanging out at a jjimjilbang (Korean bathhouse), throwing up and karaoke with strangers -- with one particularly surreal scene of Snoop, Psy and and two Korean women blithely skipping through an amusement park, presumably drunk.

True to the premise, Psy told CNN he was actually hungover when the song came out.

Promotions for the new song kicked off Sunday on Jimmy Kimmel, with the unlikely trio of Kimmel, Psy and Snoop heading to a local karaoke bar in Los Angeles and bringing the house down with their yodeling.

We asked Psy to talk about his hot new collaboration.

Psy: My manager Scooter Braun put me in touch with him at my request. When I first wrote this track, I thought that Snoop's slow rapping would fit perfectly with my rapping on this track, so I asked him to put me in touch with Snoop and it's how it all happened.

CNN: Where was the video filmed and who chose the locations?

Psy: I initially told him that the shoot would be very relaxed and that he would only be in five scenes to entice him to come to Seoul and shoot the video. He ended up being in more than 20 scenes in more than 10 different locations within those 18 hours.

CNN: Why did you decide to go with a different director this time?

Psy: I co-directed this video so technically it's the same director, but my co-director [Cha Eun-taek] was different from that of "Gangnam Style" and "Gentleman" [co-directed by Cho Soo-hyun] because the type of the song is different -- electronic dance music versus 808 hip hop -- and I also wanted my fans to experience something different.

CNN: What surprised you about working with Snoop Dogg?

Psy: We all know how diligent Snoop is. He is all about working hard every time -- haha. I am just joking. I was very surprised working with him because he ended up shooting 20 different scenes in a short time -- it was a tough schedule, but he was a total pro and I appreciated it so much.

Psy: I really did not have a chance or time to celebrate because I immediately flew to LA for the Jimmy Kimmel Live appearance and other promos.

CNN: What are some events/concerts/collaborations coming up for you?
