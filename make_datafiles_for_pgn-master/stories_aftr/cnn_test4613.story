(CNN) -- An Arizona mayor is comparing a Border Patrol proposal to put razor wire on portions of the U.S.-Mexico border fence to building the Berlin Wall.

"We've had a black eye because everybody is using the border as a political issue," Nogales Mayor Arturo Garino said.

"Tucson Sector Border Patrol is considering a proposed deployment of concertina wire in the Nogales area," Border Patrol spokesman Brent Cagen wrote in an e-mail. "Currently this proposal is still under review. Specifics concerning this proposal are unavailable at this time."

Should the U.S. be more like Mexico?

Victor Brabble, public affairs manager for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Garino's concerns will be taken into account before a final decision is made.

Nogales City Councilman John Doyle, a Nogales native, echoed Garino's opposition to the proposal and said he was shocked to learn about it.

"We've always been the home of the brave, and now we are living in fear," he said.

Nogales officials will meet with Homeland Security personnel this week to continue reviewing the proposal, which is being considered as a deterrent to would-be illegal crossers, Garino said.

Garino also grew up in Nogales and said he thinks the best deterrent is increased manpower. Agents should be reassigned from checkpoints and interior bases to the border, he said.

"Bring the Border Patrol to the border and have them do their jobs."
