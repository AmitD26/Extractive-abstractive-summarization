Washington (CNN) -- Herman Cain on Tuesday vehemently denied all sexual harassment allegations against him and said he had no memory of the first accuser to publicly describe claimed misconduct by the Republican presidential hopeful.

"They simply didn't happen. They simply did not happen," Cain insisted of the accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior, and at least one incident of alleged sexual groping, when he was head of the National Restaurant Association from 1996 to 1999.

At a news conference he held to respond to the latest accusation, made Monday by Sharon Bialek, a Chicago woman who once worked at the restaurant group, Cain described her as a "troubled" woman put up to making false allegations by forces trying to derail his presidential bid.

"As far as these accusations causing me to back off and maybe withdraw from this presidential primary race? Ain't going to happen," Cain said.

Saying he didn't remember Bialek or the alleged incident, Cain added, "I have absolutely not acted inappropriately with this woman or anyone else in my entire life."

News reports identified one of the woman as Kraushaar, director of communications at a bureau within the Treasury Department who worked at the restaurant association from 1998-99.

Kraushaar's lawyer, Joel Bennett, said Tuesday that she complained of "multiple incidents over multiple days" in 1999 "that constituted sexual harassment."

In addition, Bennett challenged Cain's contention that he was unable to remember what Kraushaar had accused him of doing 12 years earlier. The restaurant association said at the time that it investigated the accusations and Cain denied them, Bennett noted.

Kraushaar said she would like to organize a joint press conference some time in the near future with some of the other women. "There is safety in numbers," she said. "It is important that it happen in one conference."

Bennett told CNN that Gloria Allred and Bialek have agreed to participate.

Cain was introduced at the news conference by Georgia attorney Lin Wood, who said the candidate is having to respond to hearsay, not admissible evidence, in the "court of public opinion."

The woman, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said she spoke extensively with her friend about Cain's conduct in 1998 at the time the accuser was allegedly being harassed by Cain while both worked at the restaurant association.

According to the woman, the accuser worked in government relations for the restaurant association in 1998 and told her it was well-known that Cain behaved badly.

Bialek said earlier Tuesday that a reason she came forward with her account of Cain's alleged misbehavior 14 years after the fact was encouragement from her 13-year-old son.

"He said, 'Mom, I think you need to do the right thing. I think you need to tell on him,' " Bialek said on CNN's "American Morning." "That confirmed it for me. If my son is saying it, I want to be the role model for him and other kids growing up."

Bialek said Cain told her, "You want a job, right?" but stopped when she protested.

"I respected him. I looked up to him. And it just was shocking to me that he would use that power in such a way," Bialek said.

She didn't file a complaint at the time because she no longer worked for the association, said Bialek, who also denied wanting any money for going public, despite a bankruptcy stemming from costs related to her late mother's medical bills.

Cain vigorously dismissed the claims in an appearance on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" Monday night.

In a written statement, campaign spokesman J.D. Gordon said there was "no record, nor even a complaint filed" to support Bialek's accusation.

Bialek's bombshell came as Cain was in his second week of battling the sexual harassment allegations that have overwhelmed his front-running campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

Cain has come from far back to join former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney atop the polls, and his campaign said it raised $2 million in the week since the sexual harassment accusations first surfaced in an October 30 report by Politico. By comparison, the campaign raised $2.8 million in the three-month quarter from June through October.

"It takes incredible courage for an individual to come forward," as Bialek has done, Murkowski said. "So it does cause me to wonder exactly what is out there. I am concerned."

"She knows that's not something I would do," he said.

Cain, a favorite of tea party conservatives, has risen to the top of the polls after strong performances in several debates and the release of his "9-9-9" tax plan, which sets flat 9% rates for corporate and income taxes and creates a 9% national sales tax.

"He needs to be upfront, forthright and get this story behind him," said Bob Vander Plaats, a leading Iowa Republican activist. The ongoing allegations, he adds, are a "test of Cain's leadership" and "a tipping point for his campaign."

Cain will be in Iowa on November 19 for an event sponsored by Vander Plaats called the Family Leader Forum. An expected 2,500 potential caucus-goers will be in attendance, and Cain will probably have to address the issue in some form.
