(CNN) -- Minimum wages are on top of the political agenda in many countries.

U.S. President Barack Obama's proposal to raise the federal minimum wage from the current $7.25 to $10 per hour seems blocked by Congress, but individual states and cities are raising minimum wages within their jurisdictions -- Seattle's mayor, for example, proposes a new $15 minimum.

Even the free market redoubt of Hong Kong introduced a national minimum wage in 2011.

The main argument against the minimum wage is that it destroys jobs, harming those it sets out to help. But evidence suggests that this is often just a scare story.

This experience and other studies have shifted the expert opinion on the minimum wage.

Few dispute that there comes a point at which minimum wage is so high that it destroys jobs. But this does not happen at the current levels of minimum wages in many countries.

Moreover, the incentive to work rises as wages rise for low-skill workers.

Most workers earning are not in sectors where they would be facing international competition so prices rise a little bit.

And many low-paid workers are in an vulnerable economic position and are paid less than the value of what they produce.

So yes, the minimum wage does help low-paid workers -- it raises their earnings without harming their job prospects. It helps to reduce poverty.

Many people earning minimum wage, such as students, are not living in poor households.

And many poor households do not contain minimum wage workers.

Indeed, the poorest households are those with no-one in work.

So why the push for higher mimum wage?

But it seems likely we may be about to find out.
