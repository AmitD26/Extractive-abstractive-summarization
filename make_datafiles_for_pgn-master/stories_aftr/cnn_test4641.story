Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Nearly 60 Bahraini activists turned out Wednesday in downtown Manama calling for the release of hunger striker Abdulhadi al-Khawaja.

His daughter, Zainab al-Khawaja, stood at the front of the crowd and accused the government of torture.

Police pushed protesters out of the marketplace, known as the Souk, and used stun grenades in an attempt to clear the crowd.

In June, Bahrain found him and seven other Shiite opposition activists guilty of plotting to overthrow the country's royal family.

Zainab al-Khawaja said last week that her father was having trouble breathing and was harassed by hospital staff and security guards.

The United Nations last week urged Bahrain to consider transferring the detainee, who holds Danish citizenship, to Denmark on humanitarian grounds, but a judicial panel has said al-Khawaja does not meet the conditions to be transferred into Danish custody, according to the Bahrain News Agency.

On Wednesday, al-Khawaja's hunger strike entered its 70th day.
