(CNN) -- As Jarod Tonneson went into a bathroom during the Denver Broncos game this past Thursday night, his father, Paul Kitterman, waited outside.

When Tonneson came out of the restroom on the second level of the stadium, his dad wasn't there.

Tonneson went back to their seats in section 230. No sign of him.

There was no cell phone to call. Kitterman, 53, doesn't particularly care for them.

It wasn't like Kitterman to just take off.

"He wouldn't leave Jarod for all the money in the world," Tia Bakke, one of the friends who went to the game, said Monday night. "He had plans the next day. He had things he wanted to do."

Kitterman doesn't have any health problems, Bakke said.

According to CNN affiliate KUSA, Kitterman also didn't care for credit cards and was carrying about $50 in cash.

Kitterman was a passenger for the two-hour drive from Kremmling to Denver, KUSA reported.
