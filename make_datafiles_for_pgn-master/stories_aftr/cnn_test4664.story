(CNN) -- "Gosh, I wanna be that guy again," Jeff Baxter would think when he remembered how it felt to be in shape.

The 66-year-old teacher wasn't exactly accustomed to the extra pounds he was carrying around. He had been a marathoner before what he calls "bad teacher habits" crept into his life.

As a high school teacher in Kansas City, Kansas, he often skipped breakfast and lunch because of his schedule. Then he would consume between 5,000 and 6,000 calories after 6 p.m. each night.

"I had a 25-inch neck, a 66-inch waist," he told CNN affiliate WIBW. "I couldn't shop at normal stores."

The breaking point

His family was walking up a small hill on the way to a community pool. Baxter took one look at the incline and knew he couldn't make it. He watched his family disappear into the distance.

Baxter knew he needed to make a serious change, but after several previous failed attempts at dieting he needed a lasting solution.

He had the procedure in January 2011.

Today, he typically eats oatmeal for breakfast, a turkey wrap for lunch and lean meats with vegetables for dinner.

Combining smarter eating habits with regular exercise, Baxter lost 70 pounds in the first six months after his surgery. He walked every other day at first, and now he alternates between walking and running.

"When my children saw me for the first time, their jaws dropped," Baxter said.

The shock was even greater when he returned to school the following semester.

"My students were wowed," he said. Many of his students even joined him during his Sunday afternoon walks. "We became each other's cheerleaders."

The support he received from his class and family perpetuated his momentum.

By the spring of 2013, Baxter had lost an awe-inspiring 270 pounds. These days, he's proud to say he weighs around 180 pounds.

"He's always been a great teacher," his wife, Connie, agrees. "I just think he has more energy to do more with his talent."

Just three years after he was strongly considering retiring, Baxter's newfound zest for both life and teaching made him the 2014 Kansas Teacher of the Year.

Now retirement isn't in his plans at all.
