(CNN) -- Authorities in Portage, Wisconsin, worked Sunday to evacuate residents as a levee along the Wisconsin River approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the Midwest last week.

"Emergency vehicles including police, fire and EMS will not be able to reach residents," the statement said.

By 4 p.m. (5 p.m. ET), it was unclear how many residents remained in their homes, said Kathy Johnson, the deputy director of the county's emergency management department.

"Anyone in there right now won't be able to come out," she told CNN.

A Red Cross shelter was opened at a nearby church to accommodate displaced residents.

The Wisconsin River crested Sunday at 20.4 feet -- nearly 3.5 feet above flood level, according to the National Weather Service, putting major pressure on the 120-year-old Caledonia-Lewiston levee system.

Officials with the Department of Natural Resources have been monitoring the levee all week and working to repair any problem areas, but Matthews said Sunday that "this is one problem we have not been able to contain and it's getting worse."

"This is a 120-year-old relic," Matthews said. "It's made of sand. ... A modern levee that our engineers would be familiar with would be constructed of steel and concrete. So if it does fail we really quite frankly don't know the extent and scope of what might happen."

The river is expected to begin gradually falling Sunday evening before dropping below flood stage by Wednesday, the weather service said.

In Northfield, Minnesota, authorities called late last week for large scale sandbagging in an effort to protect homes and businesses from the rising Cannon River Canal, according to iReporter Peter Holland.

CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said Sunday that there's no immediate end in sight to the flooding.

CNN's Don Lemon contributed to this report.
