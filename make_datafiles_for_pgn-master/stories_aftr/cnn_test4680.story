Washington (CNN) -- Between the Ebola threat, fears about ISIS, a slow economic recovery and little enthusiasm for President Barack Obama or Congress, it's hard to believe that many Americans feel good about anything.

But an overlooked piece of data in a recent CNN/ORC poll revealed a surprising number of Americans are upbeat despite the seemingly constant onslaught of bad news.

When asked, "how are things going in the country today," 50% of respondents said things were going either "very well" or "fairly well."

Of course, that's not an overwhelming vote of confidence in the state of the union. And, indeed, 49% of people in the same survey felt the country was in bad shape.

In some ways this relative equanimity may not be as surprising as it may seem at first blush. For some time, researchers have seen a brightening mood in the country about the economy. And despite breathless concerns being voiced in several quarters that the existence of several Ebola patients would transform the U.S. into a sequel of the movie "Contagion," the public has not become very worried about the disease.

According to Keating Holland, CNN's polling director, the percentage of people who feel good about the current status of the country, "has been ticking up the last few times we asked the question. It went down when the ISIS crisis started and before the Syrian airstrikes started. That tells me that people were worried about ISIS, but they became less concerned when the U.S. started taking some sort of action."

The optimism isn't much help to Democrats heading into the midterm elections weighed down by unhappiness with Obama. Majorities in the same CNN/ORC poll still disapprove of his handling of the economy, foreign affairs and health care policy. Half of those surveyed also disapprove of his handling of terrorism.

And the sanguine mood can also be ephemeral, changing from week to week as different news events impact the sense of calm. For example, the CNN/ORC poll was conducted before the death of Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who was hospitalized in Dallas with Ebola and the news that one of the health care working tending to him also contracted the disease.

The varying results could be explained in the difference in the question's wording.

"There have been times in American history -- and this may be one of them -- when people feel things are ok right now, but there are good reasons to be concerned about what may happen in the future," Holland said.

Despite continued turmoil in the Middle East, prices at the pump are set to be at their lowest level since 2010, according to gasbuddy.com, which tracks prices in North America. The website says 10% of the country's gas stations are pricing a gallon of regular gasoline under $3.00.

"One economic indicator you see once every few minutes while driving around your neighborhood is the price of gas," said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "It registers with people when that improves and I believe it feeds into consumer confidence and polling results."

"Gasoline is magical," says Tom Kloza, senior oil analyst for gasbuddy.com. "Everybody knows what they pay for it."

Optimism isn't helping Democrats heading into the midterms.

Poll shows this is only the seventh time since 2004 that at least 50% said they felt this good.
