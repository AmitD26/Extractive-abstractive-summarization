(CNN) -- After Brazilian midfielder Douglas Costa said he was "afraid" to return to Shakhtar Donetsk, the Ukrainian club located in a war zone announced that it would play its home games elsewhere.

Shakhtar begins its league campaign with a "home" game Sunday against Metalurh Zaporizhya.

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine were already running high but further escalated after MH17 was shot down near Donetsk in eastern Ukraine Thursday.

"We will play all of our home games at the Arena Lviv so far," Shakhtar manager Mircea Lucescu told the club website after Tuesday's win over Dynamo Kiev in Lviv in the Ukrainian Super Cup.

"The team liked the city and the atmosphere here was great."

Lucescu didn't know when the team would resume home games at the Donbass Arena, which, like the Arena Lviv, staged games during Euro 2012, co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland.

Shakhtar president Rinat Akhmetov, meanwhile, said that if the players didn't come back, they would "suffer" while insisting the club would keep them safe.

Captain Darijo Srna dedicated Tuesday's win to Shakhtar's fans.

"I do not know what to say. My heart hurts, my soul hurts. But we still try to show our football, the Shakhtar type. Trying to give a festival to all the fans of Shakhtar.
