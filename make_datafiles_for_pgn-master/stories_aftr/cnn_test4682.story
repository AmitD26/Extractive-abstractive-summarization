(CNN) -- A group of fans who support Russian soccer giant Zenit St Petersburg has unveiled a manifesto urging the club not to sign black players.

The Landscrona group posted the "Selection 12 manifesto" on its website Monday, prompting the club to issue its own statement to CNN emphasizing its policy of diversity and tolerance.

The Brazilian striker's arrival has caused problems within the squad, with Zenit captain Igor Denisov dropped to the reserve team after complaining about Hulk's arrival and the wages he commands.

In a detailed letter on its website, Landscrona stated their opposition to Zenit signing any players who are black or gay.

Zenit responded with a statement, sent to CNN World Sport, stating the club does not "support archaic values."

It read: "FC Zenit has always been distinguished by its tolerant approach to players of various nationalities and confessions, and has always had diversity in its side.

"Zenit invites players to the team exclusively thanks to their sporting qualities and achievements, not based on their nationality or skin color. The club's policy is aimed at development and integration into the world football community. We do not support archaic values.

"We continue to be sure that fighting all manifestations of intolerance is the only principle for development of our club, football, and sports as a whole in the world."

It is the latest racism controversy to blight European football in recent months.

Meanwhile, In the English Premier League West Ham vowed to ban for life any fans found guilty of anti-Semitic chanting during their match at Tottenham in November.
