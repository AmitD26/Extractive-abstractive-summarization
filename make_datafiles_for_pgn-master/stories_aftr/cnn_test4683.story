(CNN) -- Ensuring a bustling aviation hub runs like clockwork is a challenging endeavor at the best of times.

Doing so under a blizzard of thick snow, ice and freezing fog can only intensify the battle against the clock.

Faced with these winter extremities for almost half the year, Oslo Airport has recruited a secret weapon to help meet its scheduling commitments -- the TV 2000 snow-blower.

Weighing in at a mammoth 40 tons and with a price tag of just under $2 million, the giant snow-plow can clear a three kilometer runway in as little as 15 minutes.

There are only four such devices in the world, he added, and Oslo Airport has snapped up two of them.

Employing such advanced weather management systems make sense for an airport situated just a few hundred miles from the Arctic Circle.

"We have winter six months a year, and we need to be able to handle winter operations more or less like summer operations," Nilsen says.

"This requires good planning, it requires a lot of resources, good procedures and a lot of training.

The TV 2000 is a key weapon in the fight to keep flights on time but, as Nilsen intimates, there are a host of other snow-clearing devices and tactics employed at Oslo Airport.

This includes a rigorous de-icing process for aircraft and runways as well as a fleet of giant plows that follow the TV 2000 to clear the snow blown off runways.

An extra 90 people meanwhile are hired by the airport just to assist with snow clearance during winter months.

As soon as "the first flakes fall down we will drive out ... and (begin) the snow cleaning," he added.

Few sites are exposed to the elements with such regularity, yet almost all find it hard to compete with Oslo's record on punctuality.

By comparison Oslo has only ever had to cease operations because of heavy snow twice since opening its doors in 1998.

On both occasions operations were up and running again after a matter of hours -- although Oslo Airport is considerably smaller than those in London, Paris and Frankfurt.

"(But) we know that one winter will always play different from the previous ones so we (will always) learn something new," he added.
