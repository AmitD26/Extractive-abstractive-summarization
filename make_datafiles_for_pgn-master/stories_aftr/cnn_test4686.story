P26 sounds like a line in a spreadsheet.

The generous researchers at Vietnam's Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program have agreed to let CNN's readers suggest and then vote on a new name for P26, who was recently released back into the wild after being rescued from the black market.

Suggest a name by commenting below. You can up-vote the names in the thread you'd like to be considered. I'll ask readers to vote on five of the best (non-profane) and most popular names next week.

P26 will assume whatever name you pick.

Pangolins like P26 are endangered, and they're thought to be the most-trafficked mammals in the world. As I found out on a recent reporting trip to Southeast Asia, activists fear that they could go extinct before most people so much as realize they exist. They're shipped around the world for their scales, which are used in traditional medicine, and for their meat, which is a delicacy and status symbol in Vietnam and China.

On my trip to Indonesia and Vietnam in February, I met P26 and other rescued pangolins at the vastly underfunded rehabilitation center in Vietnam. The group operates on $27,000 a year, its manager told me. That's for seven employees at two national parks. I also went undercover to talk with mafia-type pangolin traffickers and poachers.

My take-away is that celebrity would bring the pangolin a form of protection. As long as it remains an obscure and little-known creature, it's easier for pangolin bosses to keep packing up these animals by the tons and shipping them to market. And it's also easier for restaurants to sell pangolin and consumers to justify buying it. Pangolins are remarkable animals: Their tongues are longer than their bodies; they hang from trees by their tails; they're pretty much invincible to predators in the wild.

"With other releases the animal has happily come out the box and started investigating the area. P26, however, was lot more nervous," Louise Fletcher, who's handling his release, wrote on a blog where she documents the pangolins' journeys. "It is bad practice and stressful to tip the box or lift the animal out. Better just to leave it open and let them climb out by themselves. So, instead, we stood back and waited, but he still did not want to leave."

He was still in the box when they left that night, she said. The next morning, however, she was relieved to find the box empty. The researchers are monitoring P26's movements with a radio tracking device that's attached to one of the scales on his tail.

By March 24, P26 had left the den site -- a good sign -- but then "dug himself further under the roots of the tree," as if to hide, Fletcher wrote in an e-mail. "Hopefully now he will begin to become more familiar with the surrounding area."
