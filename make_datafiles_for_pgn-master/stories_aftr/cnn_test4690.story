Rice, who spoke on NBC's "Meet the Press," was among U.S. leaders saying they want to see a unity coalition government in the country after President Viktor Yanukovych fled Kiev, the capital, and a unanimous vote in Parliament removed him from power.

"The United States is on the side of the Ukrainian people," Rice said. The people expressed themselves peacefully, she said, and Yanukovych "turned on" the people by using violence against them.

A former Soviet republic closely allied with Russia, Ukraine is home to many people who speak Russian and identify with Russia.

David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, recently returned from Russia and reported from the country for many years. On "Fareed Zakaria GPS" on Sunday, Remnick said that Putin considers Ukraine and Russia "linked by blood."

A partition of Ukraine would "not be acceptable," McCain said.

"The Ukrainian people will determine their own future. They want to be Western. ... They do not want to be Eastern," he said.

If he were Putin, he said, he would be nervous about the protest movement happening in Ukraine.

Appearing on "Fox News Sunday," Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said he spoke with former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko on Saturday just after she was released from prison following a unanimous vote in Parliament.

Durbin said she assured him that she's "looking for a peaceful resolution to the problems in Ukraine, to follow the constitution and the law."

Obama "needs to up his game and send a clear, unequivocal, public message to Putin not to interfere in what is happening in Ukraine," Ayotte said, "to let the Ukrainian people determine their future, to ensure that there is no interference in their sovereignty."

"We have to combine our efforts with the European Union to help Ukraine move forward in a peaceful democratic way. We have to put the pressure on Putin to stop his efforts to undermine this natural evolution towards democracy," Durbin said, adding that he thinks Yanukovych "has always been a puppet of Moscow."
