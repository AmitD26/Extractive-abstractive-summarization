In the four and a half page letter, Bush proposes an economic plan that he believes are the stepping stones to make the country "the most economically and socially mobile country in the world," once again.

Kristy Campbell, Bush's spokeswoman, confirmed to CNN that the letter was sent in an effort to raise awareness about the current state of the education system, which should not be interpreted as a political sign.

"Gov. Bush raises money for his education work throughout the year and the letter is not related to any decision about his political future," she said.

Campbell said that the governor will consider running and expects to make a decision later this year or in early 2015.

The Des Moines Register said that Iowans had told them that they had never received anything from Bush or his foundation before. However, Campbell said the mailers are being sent across the country, not just to Iowa Republicans.

In several bullet points, Bush lists the need for immigration reform, simplifying tax regulations, and other policies, half a page before touching upon the "failing education system."

While the mailer does ask Iowans to donate for his cause, Bush's disclosure of his vision for only adds fuel to the rumor mill about whether he will run in 2016.
