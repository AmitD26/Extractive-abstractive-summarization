(Mental Floss) -- We've all seen it: that one lonely bag on the baggage claim track at the airport that goes around and around with no owner in sight. What happens to it if no one shows up?

Well, it might end up at the Unclaimed Baggage Center in Scottsboro, Alabama. That's where you can visit a store that takes up an entire city block and find everything from the expected (clothing, toiletries, books) to, well, the unexpected.

4. A Naval guidance system -- Yep -- a piece of equipment worth $250,000 was lost and never claimed. The people at the Center decided to be good sports and return the expensive GPS to the Navy.

6. A full suit of armor-- Unlike the Egyptian artifacts, this guy was merely a replica of a 19th century piece. Still, I bet to this day, there's a guy out there who continues to tell the story of the time he lost a suit of armor at the airport.
