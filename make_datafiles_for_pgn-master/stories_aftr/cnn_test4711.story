The Workers' Party, founded in 1945, is North Korea's political party and is considered one of the country's most crucial institutions alongside the military.

According to KCNA, flowers were presented at the shrine in Kim's name, but the most senior official to attend was Hwang Pyong So, North Korea's second most important leader, who recently attended the closing ceremony of the 17th Asian Games in South Korea.

Analysts are puzzled and speculation is running rampant about why Kim has been out of the public eye.

He had been seen hobbling earlier in the summer, prompting theories ranging from weight gain to gout. There have also been questions about the possible meaning behind his absence: Is he genuinely sick, or are there machinations within the North Korean power circle?

"Whenever someone doesn't show up in the public, we tend to speculate something of a power struggle," said Han Park, author of "North Korea Demystified."

Because not much is known about North Korea's internal politics, observers scrutinize public functions and ceremonies to see who appears and who does not.

"We're always operating on this incomplete info," said Joshua Stanton, a North Korea observer who created the website One Free Korea, which is critical of the regime.

Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge

South Korean official: Kim probably near hospital

South Korea's defense minister told reporters in Seoul on Friday that he "has reason to believe that Kim Jong Un is probably staying in one of his homes" near an exclusive hospital in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, with his wife and sister.

It wasn't immediately clear why the defense minister said he thought Kim was staying near the hospital.

The sources downplayed Kim's absence at Friday's tribute and said there was nothing to substantiate speculation that other members of the regime had marginalized him.

"We don't believe fundamentally there is anything afoot," a second senior U.S. official said. "There is nothing affecting our policy choices in any way."

With its top leader missing in action, North Korea has extended its diplomatic efforts with the outside world.

One of its officials said the regime was ready to restart the six-party nuclear talks, which include Russia, the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. It has also reached out to the European Union and South Korea.

High-ranking Pyongyang officials visited South Korea on Saturday, but just days later, the two countries were exchanging fire at a disputed maritime demarcation line.

The mixed messages reflect Pyongyang's "state of constant and ever-shifting cost-benefit calculation to maximize its national self interests," said Jasper Kim, founder of the Asia-Pacific Global Research Group.

"Every move North Korea makes is a negotiation attempt to see which states will accede and offer something of value in exchange for some level of stability. This has and always will be North Korea's dominant negotiation strategy."

Longest absence

Before this absence, his longest disappearance from public view as Supreme Leader was a 24-day period between June 7 and July 1, 2012. His second longest absence ever was for 29 days between July 28 and August 27, 2011 -- while his father was still alive, NK News said.

CNN's Elise Labott, Paula Hancocks, KJ Kwon, Michael Martinez, Brian Todd and Dugald McConnell and journalist Jung-eun Kim contributed to this report.
