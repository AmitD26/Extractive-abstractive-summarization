(CNN) -- To some, it may sound like a strange way to spend a vacation.

At the colorfully named St. Louis Cemetery Number 1 -- the city's oldest -- visitors see only above-ground tombs.

Some are magnificent while others stand in various degrees of ruin.

One intriguing figure said to be buried here is voodoo priestess Marie Laveau (1794-1881), who held sway over her wealthy white clients as well as the Creole faithful.

La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires, Argentina

A public cemetery since 1822, it was only when the wealthy of Buenos Aires moved to this area that the elaborate above-ground mausoleums became common. The cemetery is home to a roll call of famous Argentineans, from presidents and military leaders to scientists and writers.

Highgate Cemetery, London

In the 1830s, parish cemeteries in central London became a health hazard, leading parliament to authorize seven new cemeteries in outer London. Highgate Cemetery was dedicated in 1839.

Guided tours are available for the East and West Cemeteries -- a tour is the only way to get into the latter.

Was there ever a Highgate vampire? Readers can draw their own conclusions about reports in the 1970s and subsequent investigation by the British Psychic and Occult Society.

Central Cemetery, Vienna

Designed to accommodate expected population growth, the Zentralfriedhof opened in 1874 on the outskirts of Vienna. It's "central" in terms of significance, not location.

Home to 3.3 million souls, many visitors nonetheless focus on its connection to Vienna's musical history. Composers Beethoven, Brahms and Strauss lie in rest here, while Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has an honorary monument in Group 32a, his actual grave being in another cemetery.

Notable people buried here include Confederate general Hugh Mercer, novelist and poet Conrad Aiken and singer-songwriter Johnny Mercer, who wrote lyrics for Hollywood movie songs, including "Moon River."

The Jewish section has a memorial to victims of the Holocaust, whose ashes were brought here from a Nazi labor camp.

Bonaventure's fame grew when a sculpture of the so-called Bird Girl from the cemetery was featured as the cover of the 1994 book, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."

Adjacent to the World Heritage listed 16th-century Novodevichy Convent, the Novodevichy Cemetery is said to be Moscow's third most popular tourist site.

Inaugurated in 1898, it grew in importance from the 1930s when the remains of many Muscovites, including writer Anton Chekhov, were transferred from small cemeteries that were being demolished. It's now used only for the burial of significant people.

Among a host of famous Russian singers, writers, scientists, cosmonauts and generals buried here lie Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and Boris Yeltsin, first president of the Russian Federation.

They may be dead and buried but "residents" of Waverley Cemetery, set high on the clifftop above Bronte in Sydney's east, have spectacular ocean views.

While its sculptures and architecture are fascinating, there's much to notice about the names on the graves. Among the 80,000 interments since 1877 are literary figures who helped define Australia's character, including Henry Lawson and Dorothea Mackellar.

Père Lachaise, Paris

At the Cimetiere du Pere Lachaise, home to a million souls, lies the grave of Jim Morrison, whose visitors leave tokens of love. A crowd gathers at Chopin's grave, which is adorned by a statue of the muse with a lyre. There are kisses for Irish playwright and novelist Oscar Wilde. The list of the famous goes on.
