(CNN) -- Regardless of whether or not you're religious, you can't help but feel a sense of awe when coming face to face with the grand statues that devout throughout the ages have built in honor of their deities.

And these monuments just keep getting bigger.

The Nepalese government recently unveiled the world's largest trident -- a religious statue depicting Shiva -- at a Hindu temple in Dang.

The trident is made from five different minerals, weighs more than six tons and stands 12 meters (42 feet) tall.

Lord Murugan Statue (Selangor, Malaysia)

This statue, measuring 42 meters (137 feet) in height, is said to be the world's tallest depiction of a Hindu deity.

Incidentally, it's just meters away from what must rank as one of the world's strangest statues -- a five-legged bull.

Christ of the Abyss (Key Largo, Florida)

This 2.6 meter (8.6 foot) submerged bronze statue of Jesus Christ in Key Largo, Florida is one of three created by Italian artist Guido Galletti (the others can be found in the waters off Grenada in the Caribbean and in the Mediterranean sea near Italy).

This enormous statue -- the world's largest seated outdoor bronze Buddha -- took 12 years to complete.

It's located next to Hong Kong's Po Lin Monastery, regarded as the territory's center of Buddhism.

Beneath the Buddha are three floors that are said to contain the remains of Shakyamuni, the sage on whose teachings Buddhism was founded.

There is also an enormous carved bell that's rung every seven minutes, symbolizing the release of 108 kinds of human vexations.

Leshan Giant Buddha (Sichuan, China)

Construction of the Buddha, which forms part of a UNESCO-listed site, started in 713 AD, though it wasn't finished until 803.

Funding ran out and Haitong killed himself in despair, but when a local governor decided to undertake completion of the project, Haitong's wish came true -- though not quite in the way he intended.

During construction, so much rock was removed from the cliff face and deposited in the river below that the water became shallower and easier to navigate.

Laykyun Setkyar (Monywa, Myanmar)

Myanmar's Laykyun Setkyar is one of the largest statues in the world, with a height of 116 meters (380 feet).

Construction of the statue, which depicts the Gautama Buddha, started in 1996 and finished in 2008.

This 30-meter (98 feet) Brazil icon weighs 635 tons and was constructed between 1922 and 1931, although the concept for such a statue was first brought up in the 1850s.

It has lightning rods on the arms, head and hands -- on average, it's hit by lightning 12 times every summer.

On Sundays, visitors can climb to the upper section of Cristo de la Concordia for breathtaking views from observation decks located inside the arms.

Sendai Daikannon (Sendai, Japan)

This gleaming white statue located in Sendai, Japan, is the sixth tallest statue in the world and depicts a Japanese Bodhisattva, or enlightened being.

An internal elevator allows visitors to access the higher sections.

Travel tip: The statue faces Sendai station, which is in the center area of the city, so if you ever get lost simply follow the statue's gaze to the center of town.

Located just meters from Bangkok's Grand Palace in the Wat Pho temple complex, this reclining Buddha measures 15 meters (49 feet) high and 43 meters (141 feet) long.

Visitors are invited to make a wish as they place a coin in each of the bowls. All donations go towards maintenance of the Wat Pho temple.
