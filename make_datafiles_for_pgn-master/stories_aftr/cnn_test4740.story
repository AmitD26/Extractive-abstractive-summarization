Theater. Art. Fashion. Shopping. Nightlife. Meals you'll never forget (and that can be meant, now, in a good way.)

Like every glittering metropolis, however, it can be easy to miss the highlights amid all the noise and haste.

London has several international airports and all are serviced by public transportation into central London in around an hour and a half.

By far the most comfortable way to get from the airport into the city is by using a car service.

Great rooms, great views

For Old World style, Claridge's is a top choice.

Its opulent art deco interiors have played host to stars like Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant.

If the diversions of Soho aren't enough, the hotel has its own movie theater and bowling alley.

The hotel's Iconic City View Room offers floor-to-ceiling windows that allow you to gaze across the Thames River at St. Paul's Cathedral, Big Ben and The Gherkin.

Best meals

London is teeming with competitive foodies and the best restaurants are often filled weeks in advance -- it's wise to book ahead.

Michelin-starred Gymkhana is an elegant "Raj-era India" place to sample high-end Anglo-Indian -- a kind of adopted national cuisine in the UK.

The menu changes regularly but Ottolenghi says roasted aubergine is a must -- it's always on the menu and currently with nutty almond yoghurt, pickled chili and paprika toasted almonds.

Night owls who like views as fancy as the food should try Duck and Waffle, on the 40th floor of a skyscraper near London's hip East End. It's open 24/7.

For traditional English with a twist there's Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hyde Park.

The celebrated restaurant serves big flavors inspired by recipes from the UK's daddy of molecular gastronomy.

All the big international brands are represented in London and there are plenty of high-end department stores, but the best-kept secret is the city's boutiques, which show off the wealth of homegrown fashion.

For immaculate tailoring with eccentric touches, both men and women head to British institution Paul Smith's newest shop in Mayfair to invest in their business wardrobes.

You can nail the style with a few pieces from Albam in Soho. There's the New Slim Jean made with Japanese selvedge denim or the Scottish Virgin Wool Shawl Neck Sweater.

But you haven't shopped in London until you've been to Liberty.

A department store with the feel of a boutique, it stocks high-end cosmetics, designer sunglasses, jewelry, vintage handbags and home wares, as well as an impressive selection of items from international and British designers.

Among these are the Oxblood Liberty Print rucksack and the Barbour Olive Hooded Game Parka.

Best selfie spots

The obvious places remain the best.

For the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, you'll get the best shot by walking halfway across Westminster Bridge, which crosses the Thames.

For a stunning picture of yourself next to St. Paul's Cathedral, go to the Millennium Bridge, which runs between the cathedral and the Tate Modern art gallery.

If you can round up a few friends, there's always the crossing at Abbey Road, where you can recreate the iconic 1969 Beatles album cover and appear on the new Abbey Road Studios Crossing Cam.

Neighborhoods in a nutshell

Covent Garden

The charms of this theater, shopping and eating district are hard to beat.

For shopping, you can head for the narrow streets near the tube station or see if you can score a last-minute ticket at the Royal Opera House.

Bloomsbury

The heart of London's academic district is a stone's throw from the West End.

Leafy and grand, full of garden squares and Georgian terraces, this is where you'll find The British Museum and The University of London.

It's also culturally significant, giving its name to the Bloomsbury Group of artists, the most famous of whom was Virginia Woolf.

Notting Hill

A few tube stops west of central London, this well-heeled area around Westbourne Grove and Ledbury Road is full of boutiques and cafes, while Portobello Road, lined with charming terraces of pastel-colored houses, has an excellent antiques market.

The mix finds its full expression each August at the Notting Hill Carnival, the largest street fair of its kind in Europe.

Decent souvenirs

There's no need to go home with a pair of Union Jack boxer shorts or a gold-edged plate with a picture of Kate and Wills in the middle.

London's many art galleries all have shops attached and are a great source of presents and souvenirs that are tasteful and different.

At the Tate Modern shop, you can pick up a reproduction of a 1950s Matisse exhibition poster ($40) or a tea towel printed with a Turner landscape ($12).

Alternatively, the award-winning Snowden Flood shop specializes in well-designed souvenirs.

Highlights include a beautiful Regent's Park Scented Candle, perfumed with oak, bay and rosemary oils, or a Tower Bridge dinner plate.

Former CNN International producer Mairi Mackay is an award-winning Scottish journalist who splits her time between London, Tel Aviv and Jenin in the West Bank.
