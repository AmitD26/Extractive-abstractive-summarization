The Ferguson, Missouri, police chief insisted Thursday that he won't step down -- despite continued unrest months after one of his officer's fatally shot Michael Brown and high-level talks that could lead to his exit.

"I'm going to stay and see this through," Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN.

Government officials say that Jackson's future is part of talks involving local, state and congressional officials. Part of that discussion centers on what severance package the chief might get, as well as who would manage the Ferguson police department instead of him.

But Jackson gave no indication Thursday that he'll leave voluntarily, saying he plans to stay as long as the city manager and council support him.

The Justice Department is investigating Ferguson police. Investigators are looking at the department's use of force over the years; analyzing stops, searches and arrests; and examining the treatment of people detained at the city jail, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said.

Some officials have expressed a desire to dissolve the entire department and turn over law enforcement to St. Louis County police.

Jackson has found fault with Holder's remarks.

The police chief also defended the handling of the sometimes violent protests in the wake of the shooting.

"There was firebombs thrown. There were shots fired, for several nights in a row, shots fired at police officers and vehicles. And through all of that, the tactics that were used resulted in no injuries to any protesters or police officers. So, that's actually something to be quite happy about," Jackson said.

Apology

He acknowledged that the incident had sparked a larger conversation about societal issues, saying Ferguson and the surrounding areas have "much work to do."

"Overnight, I went from being a small-town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism, equality and the role of policing in that conversation. As chief of police, I want to be part of that conversation. I also want to be part of the solution," he said.

Later that day, he waded into a crowd at a protest and apologized again.

Some people seemed satisfied by his apologies, but not everyone was eager to hear from him.

One man shouted into a bullhorn, "If you are not resigning tonight, go home."

What's next?

Part of why he wants to stay, Jackson said, is because he finds it painful to watch what's happening in his community. He said he wants to help heal it.

Although the department has done a lot around the issue, police need to work harder on minority recruitment and retention, the chief said.

Ferguson is a predominantly black community with a mostly white police force. At the time of Brown's shooting, only three of the city's 53 officers were African-American.

Police can also put more of an emphasis on community-oriented policing and problem-solving, Jackson said.

Asked whether those sort of changes will be enough to restore calm, the chief replied: "What's enough is sort of dependent on what's the right thing to do, and that's what I'm focused on."

But he knows the issue is much bigger than one person.

"I'm just one of the players. This is going to take the entire community," Jackson said.
