He worries about the village behind him. Sheref ad-Din holds one of the holiest shrines for the Yazidis. ISIS militants are only two miles away.

Just months ago, he lived a peaceful life in Germany.

"I came back because my people are here. ISIS are terrorists. I came to defend my land, my family and my religion," he tells CNN by phone, speaking in Arabic.

Shesho's troops, in many ways, are fighting an existential fight.

Yazidis are one of the oldest religious communities in the world, with a population estimated at only 700,000. They have suffered persecution through the ages. Many Muslims consider them devil worshipers.

Yazidis captured by ISIS have been forced to convert to Islam. Gruesome reports have emerged of Yazidi women being enslaved, raped and sold off by ISIS members while men and boys are executed.

Who are the Yazidis and why does ISIS want to kill them?

He came to 'defend,' not to 'fight'

"I decided to defend Sinjar, not to fight. They decided to fight," Shesho says of ISIS. "We defend our land and our holy places. I have lived in Germany for 24 years and have always abhorred killing and fighting."

Shesho's troops receive weapons and humanitarian aid from the Kurdish regional government. Kurdish forces airdrop food and weapons. U.S. airstrikes on ISIS also have helped, but Shesho says it's not enough.

At one point, Shesho's five sons fought ISIS alongside him in the mountains. Three have returned to Germany. Yassir and an older brother, Haydar Qassim Shesho, remain.

His mother and brothers are in a German town of 50,000 called Bad Oeynhausen, in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

The family fled Iraq in 1990, when Saddam Hussein ruled the country. They went to Germany and eventually became citizens.

Yassir was 2.

"When I'm in Germany, I'm grateful that I'm able to be there. But if it comes to it, then I'm ready to die here," he says.

"I actually wanted to be here from the beginning because I just couldn't bear to witness the suffering of the Yazidis. ... How our honor is tainted, how our families and wives are being captured," Yassir says.

"To go from luxury to war is not pleasant, but you gotta do what you gotta do."
