An Israeli soldier was killed Sunday in a shooting along the Israel-Lebanon border, according to the Israel Defense Forces.

Later, around midnight, as soldiers in the area conducted an investigation, "suspicious people" were identified and "due to a threat, precise shots were fired at the suspects identified as Lebanese soldiers, and one suspect was hit," an Israel Defense Forces statement said.

Earlier Sunday, a spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, had said that a "serious shooting incident" was taking place along the Israel-Lebanon border.

It was not immediately clear who was shooting at whom, Andrea Treneti said then. Commanders from both sides were talking to the head of the UNIFIL mission to establish what happened.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's office issued a statement deploring the shooting and calling for restraint on both sides. Israeli and Lebanese forces are cooperating in the investigation, the statement said.

The soldier was shot while driving along the border near Rosh Hanikra, according to the IDF.

UNIFIL has been in southern Lebanon since a 1978 conflict with Israel.

Cross-border fire has been rare since the Israel-Hezbollah war.
