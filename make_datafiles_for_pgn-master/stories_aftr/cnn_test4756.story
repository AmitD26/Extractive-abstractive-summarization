Washington (CNN) -- From Race to the Top to "Waiting for 'Superman,' " Americans have been talking about public education reform -- and arguing about how to do it.

Organizers said they came to voice their displeasure with the Obama administration's education reform policies.

After the march, the U.S. Department of Education released a statement: "Reforming America's education system to prepare students to compete in the global economy is one of our country's greatest challenges. While there are different opinions on how best to do that, we all agree that the status quo isn't working. All of us -- the federal government, principals, teachers, students and parents -- need to get much better, much faster."

So, to better understand the motivations of the marchers, CNN caught up with three participants to find out what brought them to Washington.

The teacher turned organizer: Sabrina Stevens Shupe

Sabrina Stevens Shupe, a 25-year-old former teacher from Colorado, remembers the exact moment she first understood algebra, at age 20.

"Despite being a high-achieving student, it was always so abstract to me in school. But years later, there I was, designing a knitting pattern, and suddenly I got it, and it all became relevant to me," she said.

Then she was told to stop teaching that way and focus instead on the skills most essential for state tests.

"And I thought, 'I can't stand by any longer and let this madness continue,'" she said.

Despite a history of glowing evaluations, her contract was not renewed. She believes it was a retaliatory action for taking a stand against the school's emphasis on narrowed curriculum and test preparation.

After blogging and speaking publicly on the issues, Stevens Shupe became one of the march's central organizers last winter. She helped the organization's online presence through blogs, Twitter and Facebook, which helped mobilize people from around the country.

"We were able to forge a coalition out of isolated groups and individuals, and bring people together from every corner of the country in order to demand a different path forward, a permanent seat at the table," she said. "Before the March, many of us felt demoralized and alone. But now, we recognize that we are part of something larger. And I am so proud to be a part of that."

Once a teacher, now a mom and blogger: Rachel Levy

Levy's decisions to become a writer -- she maintains three blogs, including one about education -- and take a break from teaching were prompted by the same factors that motivated the march.

"I was wasting far too much of my and my students' time trying to please the testing and data collection gods rather than help children really learn," she said. "But I also realized I had young children and I wasn't yet sure of how to be the teacher or parent I wanted or needed to be."

Why one good teacher decided to quit

After the rally, Levy wondered about what the next steps would be.

"I thought it was a powerful, inspiring event, but I wish I'd seen more people there, especially from nearby states," she said. "I live relatively close to D.C. and close to my state capitol. That means I have an obligation as a citizen to take advantage of my proximity to political power. Why were there not more public education stakeholders from D.C., Maryland and Virginia?"

The teacher and filmmaker: Amy Valens

Valens' own version of activism began a few years ago, when she and her husband produced a documentary film, "August to June," about a year in the life of an elementary school.

She wrote in a blog entry that she sent the film to U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and received a form-letter response suggesting her school might want to apply for a grant if it had made significant gains.

Valens takes a long view of the march.
