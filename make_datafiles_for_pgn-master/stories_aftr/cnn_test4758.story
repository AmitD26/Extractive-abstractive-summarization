"It's the place to make money," explained Aynura Askerova, a Russian who has lived in the southern Chinese metropolis of Guangzhou for four years.

Work as a fashion model has taken Askerova across China and the rest of Asia, but "now it's time to find a real career," she said last month, in an overly-illuminated hotel conference room in the city's China Marriott Hotel.

The events have been a honeypot for job-seeking expats, particularly since the global economic crisis of 2008. While economic growth in China has slowed in the last year, the 7% to 8% predicted growth is positively booming compared to Europe and the United States, leading many to believe their prospects there might be better than at home.

However the perception that expats, particularly from western countries, can just walk into a job or career in China is now out of date.

That can include language skills and being willing to spend more than just one or two years in the country, he added.

"That side of the workforce there's almost an oversupply of junior end candidates," said Lance. "So it's hard for expats to compete. Without Mandarin or local language skills I'd say it's almost impossible."

Nick Cucinella, CEO at CareerBuilder China, advises graduates to have a CV in both English and Chinese, even if they don't speak the language, and that taking the initiative and targeting prospective employers and Chinese companies is the best path to a job.

"Not many people do that, but if they do they will be very well received. Too many just use jobs sites and search engines," he said.

Big infrastructure projects in China mean that recruitment companies are seeing a desire for experienced architects and design engineers, plus a strong demand for those in the pharmaceutical industry, as local and international companies invest in R&D facilities in the country.

"Chinese companies  realize they have to offer more than just a job, but show that the city is good place to live, raise children and there's enough going on," said Cucinella.

If the employers he recruits for have a wish-list it is usually for a Chinese national who has gained many years of experience studying or working abroad.

These "haigui," or sea turtles as they are called in China, hit the employment sweet spot with "both the cultural connection and the language skills," according to Lance.

For those expats at the Guangzhou event swimming against the rising tide of competition, employing a number of techniques is necessary to make it in China -- local connections being one of the most useful.

It's worked for Askerova, too. With business partners she met in China, she has been able to register a trading company in Hong Kong alongside developing a modeling career.
