(CNN)Tiger Woods' season took a turn for the worse when he was forced to withdraw from the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines just 11 holes into his first round on Thursday.

A 14-times major tournament winner, Woods pulled out of the San Diego event when back spasms became such a problem that playing partner Billy Horschel had to pick up his tee for him on several occasions.

The PGA tour website quoted him as saying that a delay to the start of his round in San Diego, caused by foggy weather, had been behind the back problems that forced him out.

"I had a good warm-up session [before the weather delay], but then we stood out here, I got cold and everything started deactivating again.

"It's frustrating that I just can't stay activated. That's just kind of the way it is."

Horschel expressed his sympathy, saying: "It's unfortunate, because I consider him a friend and I want to see him get back to his level of play that we all know he can.

"If he can just stay healthy and be able to work on it, I think we would see the results."

In November, Woods -- who has not won a major since 2008 -- was in the spotlight for his angry response to a parody interview by veteran Golf Digest writer Dan Jenkins.

The second golf course created by his design business is due to open at Bluejack National, Texas, later this year.

In an exclusive interview, he told CNN: "My goal is to design a limited number of distinct and memorable golf courses."
