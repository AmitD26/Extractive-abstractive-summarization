President Barack Obama says he's postponing executive action on immigration until after November's elections because it would be "more sustainable" then.

"The truth of the matter is that the politics did shift mid-summer because of that problem," he said.

"What I'm saying is that I'm going to act because it's the right thing for the country," Obama said. "But it's going to be more sustainable and more effective if the public understands what the facts are on immigration, what we've done on unaccompanied children and why it's necessary."

The decision to postpone means any political repercussions for trying to reform the immigration system by himself would come after the congressional midterm contests.

Obama still "will do something before the end of the year" on the issue, a White House official told CNN on Saturday.

But he decided to delay any move to "take this issue away from those who would use it to score points as a kind of grandstanding issue," the White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

"President Obama's decision to delay executive action to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants until after the election is of little comfort to people like myself who believe in the rule of law," said Brown, who faces Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in November.

House Speaker John Boehner said Saturday there was "never a 'right' time" for the President to take action by himself.

The Democratic National Committee blasted the Republican criticism.

"The GOP, the party that has blocked meaningful comprehensive immigration reform at every turn and sued the President for acting, is now outraged that he hasn't taken steps that many in their party deemed impeachable offenses," the committee said in a statement.

The website of one group, United We Dream, displayed a message Saturday that Obama "has further cemented his legacy as the #DeporterInChief by delaying the usage of his executive authority to stop the deportation of millions of immigrants."

Cristina Jimenez of United We Dream said: "The President's latest broken promise is another slap to the face of the Latino and immigrant community."

An estimated 11 million or more immigrants are living illegally in the United States, many of them for years or even decades. The Obama administration has deported or turned back more than 2 million people.

The legislation would have required immigrants illegally living in the country to register with the government, pay a penalty, learn English and begin the process of applying for legal status. It had the backing of the business community, organized labor and religious organizations.

However, House Republicans refused to consider the Senate bill, which Obama and Democrats claim would pass if put to a vote.

Democrats want to remove the legal uncertainty for as many of the undocumented immigrants as possible, allowing them to continue living and working here so they can eventually gain legal status and possibly full citizenship.

What Obama has been considering

So far, some 660,000 young people have taken advantage of the program, according to a report by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. That's 55% of the 1.2 million who were immediately eligible.

Advocates said the administration also has been considering expanding the program to cover the parents of U.S. citizens or all undocumented parents.

Many Republicans have called for immigration reform that includes tighter border controls. Before for August recess, the Republican-controlled House passed a bill that would have prevented Obama from granting new deferrals -- or even renewing previously granted ones -- under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
