Warm, floral breezes skip across the remote and spectacular Hawaiian Islands, home to some of the world's most beautiful beaches, lush rainforests, lava-laced volcanoes, and more.

iReporter Adrienne Papania, of Cincinnati, Ohio, recently returned from an island-hopping Hawaiian getaway. Papania, 58, and her sister, brother and sister-in-law jumped between Oahu, Kauai, Maui and the Big Island.

The group stayed mostly in oceanfront two-bedroom condos. Their experience at Kahana Village in Lahaina, Maui, was particularly welcoming, complete with a festive Mai Tai party with live Hawaiian music.

Don't-miss experiences

Oahu: Hike up Diamond Head Crater -- It wasn't an easy trek for us, but the views once we arrived were breathtaking.

Kauai: Helicopter tour of the island -- You can't get to some parts of the island very easily without hiking, so the ride provides a panoramic view of what we would not have seen.  This trip was very much worth the money!

All islands: Fabulous sunsets

First impressions. Did they change?

Travel Snapshots: Natural beauty shines in Aloha State

For me, the most significant lasting memory (and it's hard to pick one) was the Black Sand Beach.  It was something I had never seen before, and it was just beautiful beyond words.

Scenic; distinctive; adventure-filled. (And I'll throw in beautiful!)

I would highly recommend [Blue Hawaiian Helicopters]. I was very apprehensive about the idea of a helicopter ride and even took a motion sickness prevention pill just in case. But our pilot, Dawn, who was a former Coast Guard pilot, did a great job.

The ride didn't come cheap, but it was a ride of a lifetime! We all agreed we would do it again, maybe on the Big Island next time.

Our favorite meal was in Hilo on the Big Island at a place called the Hilo Bay Cafe.  We had macadamia nut-crusted scallops, and they were absolutely delicious.

Our favorite drinks were at the luau in Old Lahaina on Maui, where they served a tasty frozen lava flow. You use rum, coconut rum, strawberries, banana, pineapple juice and coconut cream. It's a recipe we hope to replicate at home soon!

The whole night was a great experience, starting with receiving our gorgeous fuchsia/white plumeria leis; watching the natives display their craft skills around the perimeter of the venue (making jewelry, woodworking, weaving palms into flowers and animals, making poi, etc.); watching the removal of the pig from the imu; a great meal; and finally the show.
