Christianity is a religion frayed over the centuries into many denominations. On Sunday, Pope Francis and the head of a major one vowed to heal one of the church's oldest splits.

"I want to assure each one of you here that, to reach the desired goal of full unity, the Catholic Church does not intend to impose any conditions except that of the shared profession of faith," Francis said.

Sunday's celebrations marked the feast of St. Andrew, the founder of the Eastern Church. He was also the older brother of St. Peter, the founding father of the Catholic Church .

In his part of the call for unity, the Orthodox leader alluded to attacks by radical Islamists on Christians.

Over the past decade, first al Qaeda and then ISIS have forced Christians to flee Iraq and Syria.

Religion is also splitting Turkey. Opponents fear its conservative government will weaken the secular identity of the post-Ottoman Empire.

Instability rages at its border, with ISIS and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, announcing their intention to take over large swaths of territory for their self-proclaimed Islamic State.

Fourth pope in Turkey

Francis is the fourth pope to travel to Turkey, following in the footsteps of Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI.

On Friday, the first day of his visit, Francis called for religious tolerance and dialogue to counter extremism in the Middle East, as he met with Turkey's leaders.

"Fanaticism and fundamentalism, as well as irrational fears, which foster misunderstanding and discrimination, need to be countered by the solidarity of all believers," he said.

The world is morally obligated to help Turkey care for the great number of refugees it has taken in, Francis said.

Erdogan criticizes Islamophobia

In an address given in Francis' presence, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan highlighted what he said was a disturbing trend of increased racism and Islamophobia in the West, while Islamist extremism wracks parts of the Middle East.

The world must come together if it wants to combat terrorism, he said.

The Turkish leader also suggested the West should not turn a blind eye to abuses committed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad while it pursues ISIS.
