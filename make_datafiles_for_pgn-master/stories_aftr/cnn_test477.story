"Michael has left the [hospital in] Grenoble to continue his long phase of rehabilitation," read the June 16 statement from Schumacher's long-time manager and the family's spokeswoman Sabine Kehm.

"He is not in a coma anymore," added the statement, which was oblique enough to be left open to interpretation.

As the months have stretched on since the accident, so has the reluctance to openly discuss the state of Schumacher's health within the sport's inner circle.

Felipe Massa, who drove alongside Schumacher at Ferrari, has been to visit his former teammate in hospital on more than one occasion.

Red Bull's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel has been cautious about making public statements on the health of his former mentor.

In Austria, the German broke his silence to reflect on the conflicting feelings of continuing his day job in F1 while the sport's seven-time world champion faces an even bigger challenge than the high-risk world of motor racing.

"It's very positive to hear but, like I said, it's been many, many weeks and months since the incident and obviously you find yourself busy in Formula One thinking about a lot of things.

"Sometimes it's crazy to imagine or realize that Michael is still in hospital and still fighting,

In a sport of strategy, where risk and outcome are calculated in hundredths of seconds, the uncertainty and lack of knowledge about Schumacher, a global star, has hung like a pall over the sport.

Interest in Schumacher's state of health is so intense that stolen medical files that may belong to the German have been offered for sale.

In the immediate aftermath of the accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel, neurosurgeons operated on Schumacher twice to remove blood clots and reduce swelling on his brain before placing him in a medically induced coma.

Last month, it was announced he was out of the coma and would continue his recovery at the University hospital in Lausanne close to the family home in Switzerland.

"The first months are dominated by questions of survival. Gradually as the weeks and months go by those questions of survival turn into questions of the quality of survival.

"It's a rollercoaster and if Michael Schumacher's rollercoaster takes him and his family somewhere happy then they will have been to places that will have been pretty unhappy on the way there.

"But I know they will have been buoyed by all the support that has been voiced."

Hamlyn speaks from a very public, personal experience following his successful high-profile treatment of brain-damaged boxer Michael Watson.

Hamlyn, who operated to remove a blood clot on Watson's brain shortly after his collapse and then guided his slow and painful recovery, is credited with saving Watson's life.

"If I was using that language I would be suggesting that there had been some improvement and if you see improvement you may see more," he explained. "I would take that as a hopeful sign.

"My reading of what I've seen in the press is that Michael has made it through the current cut and he's still in the game."

Hamlyn believes the boxer's training as a world-class sportsman aided his long physical and mental recovery -- and the same principles can also be applied to Schumacher.

"The thing about supreme athletes like Michael Watson and Michael Schumacher is that they have extraordinary physical reserves," Hamlyn said.

"Injuries that would carry away most people are things they can get past."

Watson underwent numerous operations at Hamlyn's hand but the surgeon credits the boxer's tenacity and indomitable spirit with his recovery as much as medical intervention.

"I think that does come from the sort of tenacity, reserve and determination that you have to have if you're to get to the top of any world sport.

"Providing the right environment for recovery is actually very difficult and specialized. You have to continually stimulate and draw people on.

"You have to keep changing the challenge, just moving it a little bit further forward so they relearn and regain their abilities as best they can.

"When you talk to individuals who've survived, they never gave up. The families never gave up. That's a tough thing to do year on year."

Nico Rosberg has recently commented to the German media that he witnessed Schumacher's famous mental resolve throughout three years as his Mercedes teammate and hopes this will guide the former champion through the next stage of his rehabilitation.

"Nico said he knows what a fighter Michael can be," explained Sturm, who reports on F1 for Tagesspiegel and Spiegel Online in Germany.

"If there is somebody who can really fight back and get into life, it is probably Michael."

"One day, some months into this business, Muhammad Ali came to see him at the hospital," recalled Hamlyn.

"Ali, who was pretty ill already by then with Parkinson's disease, went up to the end of Michael's bed, said words to the effect of 'Hello champ' and held out his fist.

"Michael's eyes not only opened but focused on him, and this enormous smile appeared across his face as he realized who it was who had come to see him -- and it was at that point that I knew that things went in, got processed and could come out.

"It was at that point that you know that people have the capacity to relearn, and to recover.
