If the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 caused a rift in China-Malaysia relations, the two countries appear to have put it behind them.

According to Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, China's Ambassador to Malaysia sought to distance these "radical views" from his country's official position. They "do not represent the views of Chinese people and the Chinese government," he was quoted as saying.

In a press conference Saturday, Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein made it clear China will be an accredited member of the investigation team. A few days earlier, he spoke about Malaysia's duty to keep its Asian neighbor informed about all progress.

Trade partners

Ramon Navaratnam, former Secretary General of the Malaysian Ministry of Transport, said he did not expect trade between the two countries to deteriorate, despite the initial protests by some of the Chinese families of missing passengers on MH370 in Beijing.

Navaratnam, who has authored several books on economics in Malaysia, said the business environment would not change unless the governments decided otherwise.

Lee Hwok Aun, an economics lecturer at the University of Malaya, agreed bilateral trade is not expected to fall off as Malaysia's primary exports to China consist of electrical components and raw materials such as crude rubber and palm oil -- critical to China's own economy.

"Tourism may suffer some minor setbacks initially but exports won't change much as China needs raw materials," said Lee. "It's much harder to organize a boycott of component imports and China too wants a steady supply chain."
