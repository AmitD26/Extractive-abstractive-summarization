The successor to Nintendo's troubled Wii U may be on the way.

"For the time being, our focus is on the Wii U hardware, but Nintendo as a whole has groups working on ideas for new hardware systems," he said, via a translator, in an interview with The Associated Press. "While we're busy working on software for the Wii U, we have production lines that are working on ideas for what the next system might be."

'Mario,' 'Zelda' creator says give the Wii U time

Things got so bad that there was speculation Nintendo would abandon hardware entirely, instead focusing on developing popular franchises such as Mario and Zelda for other consoles.

In the  AP interview, Miyamoto focused on more positive recent news for the company.

And there have been reports, via the Sony email hack, that a "Super Mario Bros." feature film may be in the works.

While the Wii U was released a year earlier than last year's PlayStation and Xbox updates, it's unlikely gamers will see a new Wii in 2015.
