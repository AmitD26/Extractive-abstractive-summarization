Cosby, 77, has not faced a judge or jury, let alone been convicted, regarding any accusations. At least 10 women now have raised allegations against him.

On Friday, Cosby told Florida Today he wasn't going to respond to "innuendos," referring to the women's accusations.

Stories of Cosby's purported misdeeds have been around for about a decade, but they recently got new life when another comedian took aim at him.

Singer said there are plenty of attorneys who are ready to help victims file lawsuits against rich, powerful men. He blamed the media for the rise in the number of women who recently have alleged Cosby assaulted them or was sexually aggressive.

The media is violating its own reporting standards by rushing the women's stories to air or print, he said.

For decades, Cosby was thought of in glowing terms as a perceptive comedian, upbeat pitchman and genial father figure. His public personality made him more than rich -- it made him a role model, admired for his support of education and his no-nonsense talks on parenting and achievement.

In recent weeks, that persona has been countered by another, much more sinister image, one Singer vehemently disputes.
