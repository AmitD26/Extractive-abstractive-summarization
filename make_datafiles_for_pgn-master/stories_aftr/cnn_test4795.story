(CNN)Shortly after the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War, paralyzed veteran Tomas Young spoke with me about why he intended to end his life.

He spoke with me by phone as a pump at his side helped him inject painkillers. His speech was so distorted that I had difficulty understanding him. He sent me photos showing how long and thick his hair and beard had grown. He said he seldom left his bed and that he popped a dizzying assortment of more than 30 different pills every day.

Young's ordeal began in 2004 when two rounds from a sniper's AK-47 severed his spinal cord.

Tired of suffering, Young penned a scathing letter in 2013 to former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney. He laid out the painful circumstances of his life and blamed the former administration for the many casualties of that war. He said he would refuse his feeding tube and allow himself to die.

But he didn't die then.

The Uncounted: War's true toll

Donahue said he had been waiting almost 10 years to hear what he heard on the phone Monday.

I learned of his passing on Veterans Day. Appropriate, I thought, for as controversial as Young had been, I believed he remained true to his convictions.

Cuellar told me then she was frightened at the prospect of losing her husband, but that she always returned to thinking about how difficult it was for him every single day.

"There will be time to mourn when he dies," Cuellar told me. "Until that day, I will love and cherish and celebrate him and try to make each day as loving and happy and comfortable as possible for him."

And she did.

In a video posted on YouTube Tuesday, Young's sister-in-law, Amanda Young, captured his 34 years of life -- from a baby who put a gleam in his mother's eye to a companion for his brother Nathan; from a young man who felt compelled to serve his nation after the terror attacks of 9/11 to a wounded veteran who became a poster child for those who opposed the U.S. role in Iraq.

Young returned home from war a broken man. He is now free from his pain.

Young was a self-avowed atheist, but somehow I could feel him smiling down at his friends, glad that they were remembering him as a nice guy.
