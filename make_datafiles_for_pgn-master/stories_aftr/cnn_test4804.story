"Man oh man, I have seen some bad things in the last two weeks of my life," he posted on Facebook last month from the Liberian capital of Monrovia.

"How unpredictable and fraught with danger life can be. How in some parts of the world, basic levels of help and assistance that we take for granted completely don't exist for many people."

The 33-year-old freelance cameraman for NBC News started feeling achy and tired Wednesday, and he quarantined himself. A  day later, a test at a Doctors Without Borders facility in Monrovia  confirmed that he had Ebola.

Anxious parents

Mukpo was among a team working with Dr. Nancy Snyderman, the agency's chief medical correspondent.

In an interview with NBC's  "Today" show Friday, his mother said he'll leave for the United States on Sunday. NBC News has said the entire team will return aboard a private charter plane.

"The enormous anxiety I have as a mother ... is the delay between now and him leaving on Sunday," Diana Mukpo said. "The State Department has been fantastic. They've been compassionate. I can only hope and pray that his symptoms don't worsen."

"Obviously, he is scared ... he has been filming what's happening in Liberia for two weeks and seeing the death and tragedy,"  Dr. Mitchell Levy said. "And now it's really hit home for him. But his spirits are better today."

Your Ebola questions answered

Before working for NBC, he wrote for a series of other international media, including Al Jazeera and Vice News.

Team to be put in isolation

The rest of the medical team does not have any symptoms, but when the team members return to the U.S., they will be quarantined for 21 days -- the disease's incubation period -- as a precaution.

Ebola has killed more than 3,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and the United Nations says those numbers are vastly under-reported.
