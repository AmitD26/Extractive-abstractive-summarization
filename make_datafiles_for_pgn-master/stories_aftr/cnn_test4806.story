(CNN) -- Fierce battles between Yemeni government forces and Shiite Muslim rebels in the country's northwest have displaced tens of thousands of people, creating widespread humanitarian concerns, aid agencies said Thursday.

The agency has been working to get refugees out of conflict zones and to provide them with safe drinking water, sanitation and critical supplies. The number of displaced could total as many as 150,000, Veneman said.

Getting assistance to those in need has been difficult, a government official said Wednesday.

"The government is cooperating with international relief organizations, with the U.N.," said Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni embassy in Washington. "Internally we are doing all we can to ensure that civilians are not hurt and to minimize the collateral damage."

In mid-August, Yemen laid out cease-fire terms to the Houthi rebels, which included removing checkpoints, ending banditry and destructive acts, handing over all military equipment and weapons, and offering information on the fate of six kidnapped Europeans who disappeared in June, SABA, Yemen's official news agency reported.

Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh is also faced with a separatist movement in the country's south and a growing threat from al Qaeda.

Al Qaeda in Yemen has been a growing concern for the United States.
