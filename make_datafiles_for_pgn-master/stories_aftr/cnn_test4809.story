The Wolf of Wall Street vividly remembers he was so stoned out of his mind at that mahogany-laden restaurant with the imposing edifice, while savoring a bottle of 1945 Chateau Lafite Rothschild, running up a $30,000 tab in one night.

After all, it was just dinner.

Throw in a steady stream of salaciousness with stunning strippers and call girls, ungodly quantities of Quaaludes, cocaine and assorted excesses that rivaled Sodom and Gomorrah and you have something close to describing Jordan Belfort's life. Or what was his life.

"Once I scuba dived on four Quaaludes and passed out at the bottom of the ocean, you know, 60 feet under, and somehow made it up alive," he recalled in a 2008 interview with a degree of both relish and self-loathing.

These days, the hoopla is on land.

Belfort's millions were based on a huge lie, a massive "pump and dump" stock scheme at the firm he started called Stratton Oakmont. It wasn't on Wall Street, but in Lake Success on Long Island.

Looking back on those parties, Belfort told us in 2008, "On Wall Street, it's like boom. You just jump to the top of the heap and it's just mind-boggling, and that's what really turned me on. And then of  course, you know the thousand-dollar suits, the gold watches and the drinking at lunch, and the cocaine at the end of the day. ... It was almost like adult Disneyland for dysfunctional people."

Greed as Belfort knew it, he says, is not good.

"The greed's good to a point until it reverses on you and makes you into a monster. You know, there were times I look back at the way I acted and some of the things I did -- I was a monster."
