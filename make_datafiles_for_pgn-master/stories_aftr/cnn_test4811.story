Yaya Toure has retained his title as African Player of the Year after fighting off the challenge of Didier Drogba.

The 29-year-old, who helped guide Manchester City to the English Premier League title last season, enjoyed a stunning year with the club.

"I have a lot of emotion," he said after getting onto the stage in Accra, Ghana. "I think this night is so special for me."

The 29-year-old has now equaled the achievements of Senegal's El-Hadji Diouf by winning the award twice in a row.

The 34-year-old, now playing in China with Shanghai Shenhua, was an integral part of the team's European Champions League triumph as well as its FA Cup success.

But it was Toure, who helped City win its first league title in 44 years, who won the vote, with Song of Barcelona coming third.

Meanwhile, Zambia was named as the National Team of the Year following its incredible victory at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Manager Herve Renard took the Coach of the Year accolade after leading Zambia to the title following his side's triumph over the Ivory Coast on penalties.

The 34-year-old collected the prize for the second time having also won it back in 2008.
