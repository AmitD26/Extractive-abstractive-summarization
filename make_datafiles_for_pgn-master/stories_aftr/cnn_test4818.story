The building is home to Maryhouse, a daytime homeless shelter. Connie Frank is the executive director and it's her job is to connect the women with social services. Many of them need help finding nighttime shelter, counseling and food.

For Frank, the Women Infants and Children program is a key service.

"It's a wonderful program, an essential program, to feed these families," she said. "Baby formula, for example, is very expensive, and while we encourage women to breast feed, often they can't. Breast feeding moms need extra calories, and many of the women we serve can't get those extra calories while they are homeless, even if they are on food stamps."

Last year, 1,250 children came to Maryhouse -- a 29% increase. "It would make me sad to see fewer women eligible for WIC," Frank said. "It just adds to the long list of services that have been cut the past two years."

This spike in demand at Maryhouse and other social service programs across the country comes as House Republicans want to cut WIC by 10% as part of the 2011 federal budget plan passed last week, despite objections from Democrats and WIC advocates.

A spending plan must be approved by March 4 to avoid a government shutdown.

Even if the Democratic Senate and Obama agree to WIC cuts, WIC has been running a surplus in 2011, and that money could be used to fill any funding reduction.

"Participation didn't increase as much as was expected," Neuberger said. "Food prices ended up being lower than what was anticipated. And both because of the participation and lower than expected food costs, there are funds left over from 2010 that are available to be used."

If WIC is cut, it would be the first time the program has ever been reduced solely because of ideological reasons, according to Neuberger.

"The question going forward is whether that commitment will be adhered to."
