"I'm her mother. I'm going to support her. It's my job to do it. Any mother would do it," Winkfield said in an exclusive interview with CNN's The Lead on Monday. "I just want her to have more time. There are so many stories of people waking up in her situation."

Doctors at Children's Hospital & Research Center in Oakland, California, have said 13-year-old Jahi McMath is brain dead and won't wake up.

McMath was declared brain dead December 12, three days after the surgery.

Fisher is expected to testify on the case in a closed hearing Tuesday, according to court documents.

And he encouraged both sides to work together.

"This is a very, very charged case. The stakes are very high. There is a young girl involved, and I think it would suit both parties well if you would speak with each other about how we are going to get through the next few days," Grillo said.

Winkfield told CNN Monday that she's seen recent improvements in her daughter's condition. A hospital monitor suggests her daughter is trying to breathe on her own, she said.

"They told me without your brain, you can't take your own breath," Winkfield said. "Well, she's trying, so that means something's working."

Winkfield said the memory of watching her daughter bleeding profusely after the surgery remains seared in her mind.

The hospital hasn't done enough to explain to her what went wrong, she said.

"We are sorry that Jahi McMath suffered tragic complications from her complex surgery," he said. "Our hearts go out to the grieving family and community about this sad situation. We look forward to the independent expert's evaluation of the patient."

Douglas Straus, an attorney for the hospital, told the judge that McMath couldn't be brought back to life.

"This is obviously a tragic situation," he said. "A young lady has died and no one takes that in a callous or uncaring manner, but she is dead."

Winkfield, meanwhile, said she still has faith.
