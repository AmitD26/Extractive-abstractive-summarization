The president of the World Bank has called for a concerted global effort to help Syria's refugees, saying the international community has failed to formulate an adequate response.

On the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jim Yong Kim told CNN's Richard Quest that the situation was a "humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions, and right now we are not responding effectively."

The UNHCR says more than 2 million Syrians have fled their homeland since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, with most taking refuge in the neighboring countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. Reports have found many refugee children living without a father, and some without parents altogether.

Kim said the response to the crisis had failed due to a lack of funds, but also due to a lack of leadership and concerted effort.

His organization was "happy to lead" the effort, he said.

There were encouraging signs that some in attendance grasped the long-term economic benefits of investing in health and education.

"People are now understanding that education is going to determine the competitive abilities of a country into the future, but still many finance ministers are looking at the short term. They're looking at it as an expense," he said.
