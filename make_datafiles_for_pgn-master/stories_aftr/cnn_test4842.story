The attack shows that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is responding to a weeks-long government offensive with "open warfare," an official said on condition of anonymity.

"AQAP is taking the battle to the capital," said the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media.

There was conflicting information about the nationalities of those who were killed Monday. Three Yemeni Interior Ministry officials said two French nationals died and another French national was injured. But the two high-level sources said a French national and a Yemeni security officer were killed, and a foreigner of an unconfirmed nationality was injured.

The attack came more than two weeks after Yemen's government launched a military offensive against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and amid an uptick in violence in the capital. Since Sunday, two military officers have been assassinated in Sanaa, authorities said.

"This military campaign has opened a Pandora's box, and things will only get worse, but it had to happen," the official continued. "This is a decisive battle, and either we win or they win."

U.S. Special Operations troops have played a role in the offensive, in part by flying Yemeni forces to a remote, mountainous spot in southern Yemen. But no Americans took part in combat, a U.S. official has said.

The French Foreign Ministry didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
