(CNN) -- It's an entirely preventable disease, and when diagnosed early, it's easily treatable. Yet Malaria still claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year.

"I decided to look at what is the most needing product in Africa at the moment. And malaria, malaria is big," says Uys.

Merging science and business

The best think about Uys' test is the price: they cost roughly 30 cents each, a fact Uys takes immense pride in.

"You don't need skilled labor to use it: prick (your finger), run the test and wait for results. There's a lot of diamonds in the rough (is Africa), a lot of potential, and diseases and epidemics are killing off this potential. So it has a knock-on effect that is important."

Saying 'No' to drugs

Uys has turned his attention to another scourge affecting his community: Drug use.

"On the Cape Flats, there was a big problem of drugs abuse," he recalls.

Now, as the founder of his own biotech company, Uys created a test capable of detecting a range of drugs, including amphetamines, benzyls, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroine and morphine. The idea first came to him when, following a survey of users, he identified the correlation between drug use and eye movement. Following this revelation, Uys had a light-bulb movement that would take his product development to the next level.

"We get five to 10 megapixel cameras on mobile phones. I thought to myself: 'imagine developing an app for your phone where you can actually test your kids for drugs by using the flash as a light stimulus. The camera can capture the movement and calculate the speed of your eyes and action, or (tell) if they're dilated or constricted."

Uys is still working on the prototypes for his Oculus ID pupil scanner, but he hopes the product will be ready to go into the market in coming weeks.

"And me coming from Belhar, I didn't go to Harvard, didn't have a rich dad who could buy me what I wanted -- I had to work for everything. I had to work and study. I used to pack fish when I was a student. And that motivated me to work harder," he says.
