(CNN) -- There are plenty of country songs about how to be a man. One way is to face the music, and two country crooners did that on Thursday.

Herdon went first, in interviews with People Magazine and Entertainment Tonight. His revelation inspired Gilman to do go public as well.

But an encounter with a journalist also prodded him to spill the beans before someone else did. The reporter bumped into Gilman in a public place and snapped a photo of him -- with his partner.

"It was in that moment that I knew that I'd rather it be from me than you reading it somewhere else," Gilman told fans. He also feared being ripped over his sexuality in an article.

Country and LGBTQ

At age 26, he's had a long career, having rocketed up the charts at age 11 with his then silky, pre-voice-change alto pipes, according to his biography on AllMusic.com.

"I knew something was wrong when no major label wanted to sit down and have a meeting and listen to the new stuff," he said.

"Today, I get to tell the world that I'm an out, proud and happy gay man," he told "People." But he's worried how fans will take the news.

He may find out in just three days, when he performs at the "Mother Church of Country Music," the Ryman Auditorium.

It's home to the Grand Ole Opry.

Herndon is playing a Christmas charity bash for children in need along with Charlie Daniels, Phil Vassar, Andy Griggs and Jamie O'Neal.

Herndon, 52, is hopeful he won't face outrage, because he thinks attitudes are changing in the country scene.

"I felt so proud of my city," he said. "I hope that trend continues; I pray it does."

Faith and fear

As a child, Herndon, a devout Christian, was stricken with fear over his sexual feelings.

He started coming out to family members in his 20s. But the "What Mattered Most" singer, who had a number of hits in the 1990s, kept the news close to the vest.

It wasn't until he attended a Tony Robbins seminar in 2009 that he decided to become more public, he told the magazine.

"I realized I had an incredible story that could possibly help someone's son or daughter or grandchild's life not be as difficult as mine has been," he said. "Maybe they wouldn't have to go through as much pain and suffering. It's time to tell my truth."

Some of the conflict between Herndon's sexuality and his faith bled through a song he published last year -- "Lies I Told Myself." A sign with the word "Equality" has the most prominent place in the music video.

"Yeah, praying's just a waste of time, so why even start," the last verse begins. "The good Lord ain't got time for guys like me. Forgiven's something you won't ever be."

One of the lies he told himself, he said to "Entertainment Tonight," was that he can't be gay and be in country music at the same time.
