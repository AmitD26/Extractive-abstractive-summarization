(CNN)Look out. The bragging war between two of the world's busiest airports just got more intense.

For the first time in a decade, Chicago's O'Hare topped Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson in total flights by more than 13,000, according to new stats from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.

The score for 2014: Chicago, 881,933; Atlanta, 868,359.

"Chicago reclaims its place" as the "world's busiest airport," Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement Thursday, crediting new airline routes, newly relocated businesses and the city's strong economy.

But Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson remains No. 1 in annual passenger traffic. Spokesman Reese McCranie said the airport is projected to top 96 million passengers for 2014, compared with O'Hare, which handled 66.7 million in 2013. That put O'Hare in fifth place globally for passengers.

So really, which airport is the busiest? Which is more challenging for an airport? Handling more airplanes -- or more passengers?

- Atlanta tends to have more sunshine than Chicago, which may cut weather delays and cancellations.

"So when you have that, of course that means you don't have as many takeoffs and landings," McCranie said.

Emanuel said the victory comes from Chicago being "the top metro area for foreign direct investment" and its "record growth in international tourism."

From a traveling consumer perspective, traditionally, passenger traffic has been the key stat when talking about the "busiest" airports.

In 2013, ACI said Beijing ranked No. 2 in passengers, with 83.7 million.

London's Heathrow ranked No. 3 in 2013, but ACI says Dubai is poised to surpass Heathrow in international passengers in 2014.

The rising passenger traffic at Dubai's airport shows how aviation's "nucleus" has moved eastward in the past decade, resulting in double-digit growth rates, said Dr. Rafael Echevarne, ACI economics director. Airlines, he said, are scheduling more fights out of Dubai that use wide-body, long-haul planes that carry more passengers.

As for airport takeoffs and landings in 2013, it ranks globally like this (after Atlanta and Chicago):

3. Los Angeles; 696,443

5. Denver; 582,653

6. Beijing; 567,759

"We'll let them hold the mantle this year," said McCranie. "We'll come back swinging next year, and we'll see what happens."
