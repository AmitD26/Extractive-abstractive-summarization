Washington (CNN)Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan fully reversed his anti-abortion position and came out as pro-choice in an op-ed published on Tuesday.

"I have come to believe that we must trust women and families — not politicians — to make the best decision for their lives," he said.

After running for Congress on a pro-life platform in 2002 and initially voting with Republicans on the issue, Ryan, who is Catholic, has shifted leftward on abortion. In recent years, he's drawn criticism from pro-life activists that once supported him for voting to protect public funding for Planned Parenthood and access to contraception.

And while he's won re-election to his heavily Democratic district with comfortable margins nearly every cycle since 2002, Ryan's pro-life stance could have been an obstacle for him in a Democratic Senate primary in the swing state.

Indeed, Portman himself has shifted on a key social issue since he was elected in 2010 with Tea Party support. He came out in favor of gay marriage in 2013, also in a newspaper op-ed, citing his experience with his gay son as partial inspiration for the shift.

Ryan, however, dismissed speculation that his change of heart was politically motivated.
