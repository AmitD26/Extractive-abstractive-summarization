Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani says the controversy surrounding the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, does not exemplify a larger national problem.

"93 percent of blacks are killed by other blacks," Giuliani said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "We're talking about the exception here."

"What about the poor black child that is killed by the other black child? Why aren't you protesting that?"

In response, Dyson called Giuliani's comparison "a false equivalency."

"White police officers wouldn't be there if you (speaking to Dyson) weren't killing each other 75% of the time."

The former New York mayor, who has been credited with greatly reducing crime in the Big Apple among poorer areas, insisted that the focus of the nation should pivot towards reducing crime among the black community.

Giuliani received significant blow-back from Dyson, an African America who told Giuliani his remarks "reinforce the problematic perspective that prevails in the culture."
