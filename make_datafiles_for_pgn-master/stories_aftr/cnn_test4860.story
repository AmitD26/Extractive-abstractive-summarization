Hours after President Barack Obama said the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American teen in Florida requires national "soul searching," a lawyer for the man at the center of an investigation said the shooting had nothing to do with race.

Sonner said Zimmerman and his wife served as mentors to two teenage children of an African-American woman. Though funding was cut for the program, the couple continued their efforts on their own, taking the 13-year-old girl and 14-year-old boy on outings to a mall, a science center and a basketball game. They also helped in a fundraiser for an African-American church, the lawyer said.

"I do not believe that's the indication of a person who's a racist," Sonner said. "I don't see anything that indicates to me that he's a racist."

Although a grand jury is scheduled to convene April 10 to look into the case, authorities have declined to arrest Zimmerman, sparking a national debate over Florida's "stand your ground" deadly force law amid concerns about racial profiling.

The family of Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, said he has been wrongly described as a racist.

Obama spoke out publicly Friday for the first time on the matter. "When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids," Obama told reporters in response to a question. "And I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together -- federal, state and local -- to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened."

"But my main message is to the parents of Trayvon," Obama said.

And he obliquely addressed the racial component of the case, saying it struck home for him because, "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."

The teenager's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, said in a statement that it was "humbling" that Obama had talked about their son. "The president's personal comments touch us deeply and made us wonder: If his son looked like Trayvon and wore a hoodie, would he be suspicious, too?"

Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt the day he was killed.

The case unfolded when Zimmerman, who was patrolling his gated community, saw Martin walking in the neighborhood. Zimmerman called 911 and reported what he described as a suspicious person. Moments later, several neighbors called the emergency number to report a commotion outside.

Sonner said the injures "were from Trayvon Martin, I assume."

Sonner said he has advised his client to keep a low profile. "I believe his life is in danger," said Sonner.

Police have taken the gun used in the shooting and are holding it as evidence, he said.

Case sparks dialogue on racial inequality

Heated debate has erupted over whether Zimmerman used a racial slur during the 911 call, which was released this week.

The case has prompted a Justice Department investigation, which is in the fact-finding stage.

Whether Zimmerman used such language before shooting Martin is key, according to CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

"It's extremely, extremely significant, because the federal government is not allowed to prosecute just your ordinary, everyday murder," he said. "Two people fighting on the street is not a federal crime. However, if one person shoots another based on racial hostility, racial animus, that does become a federal crime."

Rallies and protests also continued Friday.

Miami-Dade County Public Schools issued a statement saying Martin's mother asked students to focus instead on signing petitions, attending rallies and praying.

"Our most important mission is to provide a safe learning environment for students, and so we are asking them to respect the wishes of Trayvon's mother by celebrating his memory not through walkouts, but through reflection and civic participation," Superintendent Alberto Caralho said.

Demonstrations were planned over the weekend in South Carolina and Virginia and Monday in Sanford and Atlanta.

Shooting renews debate over 'stand your ground' laws

Toobin: Does Florida law let killers go free?

Since the law's adoption, the number of justifiable homicide rulings in Florida has nearly tripled, according to the state Department of Law Enforcement.

"We foretold that this would happen while we debated this law and a lot of us voted against it," Florida state Rep. Christopher Smith told CNN on Friday. "They turned a blind eye to it. But now that America's looking at Florida, now people are starting to react and starting to really recognize what we were saying back in 2005 in the Florida House."

But a co-sponsor of the law, Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, said the law was not at fault. He credited the statute for a "serious decrease" in violent crime.

He said one good outcome of the killing may be clarification over how the law ought to be applied. "Maybe we do need some direction," he said. "Maybe we need to give direction to Crime Watch."

Police chief steps aside 'temporarily'

"We have to start from ground zero," he said.
