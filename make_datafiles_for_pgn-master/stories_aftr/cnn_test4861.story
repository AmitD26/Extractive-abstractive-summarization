When electronics pioneer Atari rushed a game based on the 1982 Hollywood blockbuster to market for its then-dominant home consoles, it was a flop, compounded by the fact that the infant industry was hitting its first slump at the time.

So Atari literally buried the project, dumping truckloads of unsold games in a desert landfill in New Mexico. And amid a decade of entertainment-industry disasters bookended by the movie "Heaven's Gate" and Milli Vanilli, the "E.T." game quickly faded into urban legend.

"Riiiight," you say.

"Urban legend CONFIRMED," Larry Hryb, one of the creators of Microsoft's Xbox gaming platform, reported via Twitter from the dig site. Microsoft's Xbox Entertainment Studios is one of the backers of the planned documentary, tentatively titled "Atari: Game Over." Hryb also tweeted a photo of the first cartridge to be dug out.

"This was a write-off dump," said Vendel, the co-author of a 2012 book on the company. Atari was being hit from all sides by a saturated market for arcade games, competition from other companies making games for its famous 2600 console and by a large volume of returns from retailers -- a problem it had never before faced and wasn't prepared to handle.

"Poor sales, the video game crash, 'E.T.'s' not a great game -- the whole thing kind of snowballs together, and then you find Atari is dumping cartridges in the desert," he said. "That's how this whole myth kind of self-generated."

"I've been carrying this thing, the theoretically worst video game of all time, for 30 years now," he said. "It was a game that was done in five weeks. It was a very brief development. I did the best that I could, and that's OK."

But seeing the cartridges emerge from the desert dust was a rush for Warshaw, who's now a Silicon Valley psychotherapist.

"Something that I did 32 years ago is still creating joy and excitement for people," he said. "That's a tremendously satisfying thing for me now."

By that time, Atari was collapsing. About the time "E.T." hit the shelves, a poor and badly delayed earnings report spooked investors, "and everybody started running to go sell," Vendel said. At its peak, it employed about 11,000 people; it was shedding employees by the thousands in 1983, and had only about 900 left by the time it closed down.

None of the "E.T." cartridges unearthed over the weekend was playable, Warshaw said. But he said there may be as many as 750,000 of them in the landfill, with many successful titles mixed in with the "E.T." games.

"It was the end of the first product life cycle, and nobody really knew what they were doing," Warshaw said. Now, manufacturers are designing their next systems even as their new ones start shipping to stores.

"It was a very wacky company, but that's one of the things that made it amazing place to work," said Warshaw, who's come to embrace the game's infamy.
