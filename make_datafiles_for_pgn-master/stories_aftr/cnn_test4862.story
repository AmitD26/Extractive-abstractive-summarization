Paton Walsh described his experiences -- including meeting a group of children who played in a makeshift graveyard and hid under cushions to protect themselves from ISIS shelling -- in an ask me anything chat on Reddit.

Paton Walsh: "The kids in their cushion shelter is always tough. I also remember a bomb shelter some kids made -- two years ago now -- in a refugee camp in Bab al Salama. They were literally digging a cave with their hands.

Q: "Hi Nick, amazing report from Kobani - how long were you there and how did you get in?" asked SuzanneLavery.

Paton Walsh: "It is complicated. Anyone attempting entry should spend weeks thinking about it, and not file until out. Day to day, you need the full invitation and hospitality of the Kurds to operate in any way."

Q: "Did you feel safe under the Kurds care and hospitality?" asked monhen.

"How does your personal understanding and experience being there, seeing things, and working there differ from what is ultimately reported? Perhaps it doesn't? Or, maybe it does? In either case, I am curious to hear your thoughts. And, thanks for taking the time to do this AMA!" asked rurd.

Paton Walsh: "It's the same. There isn't some process by which we see and feel a lot of things that we then ignore and follow a preordained script. You see what we do. I know that's hard to believe in this social media age of micro-digestion, but it's true."

Q: "Did you interview any ISIS members?" asked shouldbeworking23.

Q: "Thank you and your team for being professionals and risking your lives for the story. Did you meet any foreign nationals fighting for the Kurdish side? Is there any truth to the reports of ISIS getting resupplied from the Turkish side of the border? How effective do you think are the allied airstrikes on ISIS? And last but not least, have you ever touched Wolf Blitzer's beard? Again, thank you." asked Rihannas_forehead.

Paton Walsh: "No, no foreign nationals. We were told there may be some, but saw none.

The coalition airstrikes are being effective in terms of denying ISIS the chance to take all of Kobani. The strikes have also meant ISIS have had to pour in and lose fighters and equipment. They can't finish the fight off, though. That will take better equipping for the Kurds.

Q: "Hey Nick. What do you see as the best solution for the situation in Syria right now? Any ideas how to remove Assad from power (if that is even the best way to go about reaching some level of peace)?" asked ceclimber22.

Q: "What are your thoughts on the CIA ISIS torture videos released yesterday? Do you think the videos will provoke ISIS to expedite their attacks on U.S. soil? Also, from your perspective, how concerned should we be in regards to ISIS growth? The news reports they're growing rapidly was this evident during your time in Syria?" asked Britney_Lewin.

Paton Walsh: "ISIS grew most rapidly when they were not on the global radar, and then when they ran into Iraq, taking Mosul. Since then, their victories have been incremental. They haven't had the huge storming win they need for recruitment -- the constant forward motion that many analysts say makes them attractive to future recruits. They are growing in terms of infrastructure and organization perhaps, but not geographical reach -- if you exclude a handful of pledges of allegiance in other countries that are symbolically worrying, but not game-changers."

Q: "Does ISIS/ISIL actually consider the term 'Daesh' as offensive? I have only seen the one report by "residents" in Mosul saying that the fighters and leadership see it as offensive. Will renaming them, across all fronts, actually do anything? Thanks!" asked zib_al-jihad.

Q: "If you could tell the American public just one thing about ISIS, what would it be?" asked oHolo.

Paton Walsh: "A decade of policies in the Middle East helped create them. You need to help find and fund the solution, or it will become a problem on your soil, not just the Middle East."
