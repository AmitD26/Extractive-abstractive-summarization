Called the "STRIP Act," for "Stop TSA's Reach In Policy Act," the bill was introduced by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, on Thursday in response to a series of alleged strip searches by TSA officers.

The TSA denies that strip searches were conducted.

The bill, which has 25 co-sponsors, would prohibit airport screeners from using the title "officer" and would ban them from wearing a metal badge resembling a police badge or a uniform resembling that of a federal law enforcement officer unless they receive law enforcement training.

At the time, the association representing federal law enforcement officers opposed the badges, saying that they would mislead the public into believing the screeners had traditional police powers. Transportation security officers are unarmed, do not have arrest powers and cannot use force, the association said.

But the association on Friday opposed the changes.

The union representing screeners called the bill an insult.

"Every single member of Congress should be supporting federal employees, not trying to demean them," said John Gage, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.
