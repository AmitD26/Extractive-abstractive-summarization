(CNN)An uncle of a Jordanian pilot captured by ISIS in Syria and threatened with beheading has appealed to the terrorist group to release its prisoner.

ISIS should set Moaz al-Kassasbeh free in order to gain more sympathy in the region, AlRawashdeh said.

"Otherwise, they will get the anger of the whole people of Jordan and the anger of the whole world," he said.

ISIS had pushed Jordan to bring a convicted terrorist, Sajida al-Rishawi, to the Turkish border by Thursday evening. The Jordanians didn't, so governments and relatives were still waiting Friday to see whether ISIS followed through on its threat to kill al-Kassasbeh, followed by the beheading of a Japanese journalist, Kenji Goto.

Another of the pilot's uncles,  Fahed Al-Kasasbeh, said the family hasn't received any information from official sources. And there has been no proof of life from ISIS.

Al-Kassasbeh's father, Safi, made a similar appeal for his son's release Thursday, after the sunset deadline.

Jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al-Rishawi for the pilot. But Jordan's key condition is proof that al-Kassasbeh is still alive.

"At this point, we want to emphasize that we have asked for proof of life, and we have not received anything as of yet," government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said Thursday afternoon, about an hour before the purported deadline.

The lack of proof of the pilot's health is concerning, but Al-Kasasbeh said the family had received some information from "unofficial sources" that was comforting.

But hope is fading.

"Given the fact that ISIS has executed every hostage that they have publicly produced on a videotape except one British hostage, it does suggest that ISIS is not that interested in serious negotiations and is principally interested in the ability to get a lot of attention for its cause," said Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst.

Thursday's deadline was the third that ISIS set in less than a week.

The first deadline passed a week ago Friday. Grim proof soon followed: An image of Goto holding what appeared to be a photo of Yukawa's headless body.

Goto apparently was spared.

Wednesday night brought yet another deadline: deliver al-Rishawi to the Turkish border by sunset Thursday, or al-Kassasbeh and Goto would die.

The relentless back-and-forth has raised hard questions about whether ISIS is truly negotiating, and whether Jordan made a mistake to try.

CNN's Kareem Khadder, Barbara Starr, Anderson Cooper and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.
