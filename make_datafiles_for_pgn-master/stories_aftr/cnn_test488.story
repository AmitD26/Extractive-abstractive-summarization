(CNN) -- From New York to Los Angeles and dozens of cities in between, protesters flooded the streets to denounce a Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson.

A day after the country learned that Wilson wouldn't face criminal charges for killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown, at least 130 protests sprouted up across the U.S.

Some demonstrations blocked bridges, tunnels and major highways. But unlike the violence that erupted in Ferguson on Monday night, the Tuesday night protests were largely peaceful.

Atlanta

"Fight the power," Chuck D and Flavor Flav shouted over the speaker. "Fight the powers that be. ..."

About 300 people tried to follow the duo's advice. As helicopters circled above, black college students, white urban hipsters in skinny jeans, middle-aged socialists and black militants in berets gathered for a raucous rally to vent their anger.

One demonstrator wore a T-shirt that read, "Racism isn't over but I'm over racism."

Atlanta, birthplace of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., also saw emotional reaction Monday night when about 200 students gathered at Morehouse College to hear the grand jury's decision. A collective gasp rippled through the crowd when it came.

Some of the students at the historically black men's school looked at one another in disbelief, others started to tear up and a few stared ahead as their jaws dropped.

Oakland, California

Perhaps the greatest concentration of turmoil Tuesday night was in Oakland, where vandals smashed the windows of a car dealership and looted several businesses, including a T-Mobile cell phone store.

Some also set several bonfires in the city. One row of bonfires stretched across a road, blocking off access, footage from CNN affiliate KPIX showed.

Some people were seen adding more items to the fires.

"I just want to help bring about change. ... Sometimes I am profiled based on my race," said the protester, who is black. "I think this is progress. ... Now we're going to make sure things are going to change."

'A thousand Fergusons across America'

Protesters also briefly blocked one of the entrances to the Lincoln Tunnel on Tuesday evening, but then headed off to the city's West Side.

And demonstrators gathered outside the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, Officer Sara Faden said. She said the protesters demonstrated peacefully.

"We have detained people. We don't have any property damage to speak of," Officer Jack Richter said. "We are letting (the people) exercise their constitutional rights."

Boston

Mayor Marty Walsh estimated about 1,000 protesters took to the streets Tuesday night.

The gathering was largely peaceful.

"It's a beautiful thing to see," demonstrator Daniel Jose Older said.

Denver

Officers tried to prevent demonstrators from marching onto Interstate 25. Most protesters dispersed peacefully, but a "small group" refused and grabbed officers.

Officers used pepper spray, and three people were arrested, police said.

Dallas

About five protesters were arrested after marching on Interstate 35, CNN affiliate WFAA said.

About 200 demonstrators gathered at Dallas police headquarters before marching onto the interstate, the affiliate said.

Washington

Minneapolis

The Star Tribune newspaper reported that the driver of the car honked at protesters before knocking a few people onto the hood of the vehicle and apparently running over the woman's legs. She was hospitalized with "very minor injuries."

The time period symbolizes the average time that passes in America before another young black man is shot by a police officer, security guard or "self-appointed vigilante," project member Charlene Carruthers told the Chicago Tribune.
