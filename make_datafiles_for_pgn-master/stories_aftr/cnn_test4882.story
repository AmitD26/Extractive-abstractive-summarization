The battle for control of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, is shifting in favor of Iraqi and tribal forces fighting ISIS militants, Iraqi officials said Monday.

Iraqi forces, with the help of coalition airstrikes, have pushed back ISIS militants and have retaken territory lost after ISIS fighters launched a coordinated assault on the city Friday.

A fierce battle has been raging since Friday just 1,000 feet from the government complex of Anbar province that houses the regional government and security headquarters. Officials say that ISIS has retreated farther away and the fighting is less intense.

At least 41 people have been killed including security forces, tribesmen and civilians since the fighting began Friday, officials said.

Iraqiya state TV has been reporting that the strategic towns of Jalawla and Saadiya, located a few kilometers apart, have been retaken by Kurdish Peshmerga forces, Iraqi military and police and Shiite militias.

They retook Baiji refinery, the country's largest refinery that was lost to ISIS in June.
