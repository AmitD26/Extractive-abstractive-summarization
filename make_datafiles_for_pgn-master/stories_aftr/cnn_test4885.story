New Delhi, India (CNN)There's no shortage of politicians in India. But the capital of the world's largest democracy appears set to hand over the reins of power to an activist.

Now, the two stand as rivals to rule the state of New Delhi, the center of India's politics.

Prime minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has handpicked Bedi, a former policewoman, as its candidate for the city's chief minister. In this, it sidestepped old, political loyalists.

In New Delhi, the BJP is faced with stiff competition not from career politicians but from Kejriwal's two-year-old Aam Aadmi (Common Man's) Party or AAP. The upstart group of activists stunned the country's politics when it surged to a close second place in city elections in 2013.

"This time, it has taken the pulse of voters. It has fielded Bedi, an activist without a political record, as its face in the capital. This completes the setting by pitting an activist against an activist. One of them is going to make it," said K.G. Suresh, a New Delhi-based political commentator.

Critics labeled him a quitter for resigning prematurely. And his party flopped in last year's national elections.

Still, Kejriwal remains a darling of a large section of New Delhi voters divided along layers of economic classes facing day-to-day problems in the congested city, observers say.

His AAP has promised 500 new schools, 20 new colleges, greater investment in public transport and tens of thousands of new public toilets in the city of more than 17 million people.

During those demonstrations, Bedi rose to prominence after her scathing attacks on politicians and flag-waving made her a central figure. Then, hundreds of thousands of Indians hit the streets to protest endemic graft and called for cleansing the nation's political system.

As the candidate for BJP, Bedi faces a close contest against Kejriwal.

But the Congress party appears out of the picture and headed for its worst-ever defeat in New Delhi, according to opinion polls released this week.

The upcoming election in India's capital megacity is also billed as a popularity test for prime minister Modi. His grand rise to national power last May is often called the Modi wave. The prime minister has received praise for his reform-minded initiatives and impressive oratory.

At the same time, his BJP and affiliate Hindu groups have come under fire for sporadic Hindu-Muslim clashes over the past few months in parts of the country.

Also, Modi's party is in a minority in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament. That limits his efforts to push his economic agenda.

Winning states in the coming years is therefore crucial for Modi's government as regional lawmakers play a key role in electing the upper parliament members.
