The huge undertaking would be the first of its kind, Holloway said.

The call for an audit comes as investigators look into a January 12 fatal accident that happened near the L'Enfant Plaza Metro Station in Washington. An electrical malfunction inside the tunnel caused train cars to fill with smoke. Passengers who were trapped inside said they struggled to breathe. One female passenger died.

The findings in Washington raised concerns there could be similar problems in other transit systems across the country.

Transit networks with significant portions of their tracks underground will be the focus of the audit.

New York City's MTA, Washington's WMATA, Atlanta's MARTA, San Francisco's BART, Los Angeles's MTA, Boston's MBTA and Philadelphia's SEPTA would be included.

In a letter, board members called on the Federal Transit Authority, a division of the Department of Transportation, to conduct the examination of tunnel ventilation systems as well as written emergency procedures for fire and smoke.

The FTA has not yet decided if it will investigate.

The agency said it "has not yet determined how an audit of this nature would be conducted or the potential impact such an audit would have on the transit riding public."
