Djokovic comfortably defeated Stan Wawrinka 6-1 6-2 in Friday's semi-final but was overcome with a fever overnight.

"Unfortunately I am not to be able to play in the final in Abu Dhabi tonight. I've been sick today with a fever and I'm not fit to play," read a message from the World No 1. relayed on the MWTC Facebook page Saturday.

"I love being a part of this tournament and I'm really disappointed not be able to take my chance of winning the trophy here again.

Murray later picked up the trophy on court before the third place playoff between Rafael Nadal and Wawrinka.

The Scot had been in fine form himself this week, overcoming Feliciano Lopez on Thursday before trouncing world No. 3 Nadal 6-2 6-0 on Friday.

The result marked the first time Murray had beaten a top-four player since he triumphed in the 2013 Wimbledon final against Djokovic.

Djokovic is set to appear in the Qatar Open in Doha next week while Murray will travel to Australia to compete for Great Britain in the Hoffman Cup.
