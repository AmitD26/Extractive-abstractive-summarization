The humanitarian aid group Doctors Without Borders said it was halting its work in detention centers in Misrata because detainees are "tortured and denied urgent medical care."

In a statement, Amnesty described "widespread torture and ill-treatment of suspected pro-Gadhafi fighters and loyalists," a reference to those who fought for the regime of leader Moammar Gadhafi until his ouster and death.

"The torture is being carried out by officially recognized military and security entities as well by a multitude of armed militias operating outside any legal framework," Amnesty said in a statement.

Interim Prime Minister Abderrahim el-Keib, in a televised addressed Wednesday evening about the state of affairs in Libya, said a plan was in progress to take over prisons partially.

Libya's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammed Shalgham, told the United Nations on Wednesday that Libya does not approve of any abuse of detainees and was working to stop any such practices.

"Five men in plain clothes took turns beating and whipping me. ... They suspended me from the top of the door by my wrists for about an hour and kept beating me. They also kicked me," one said, according to the human rights group.

MSF said some of the patients its personnel have treated were tortured again after being returned to detention centers.

"Some officials have sought to exploit and obstruct MSF's medical work," said Stokes, the general director.

"Patients were brought to us for medical care between interrogation sessions, so that they would be fit for further interrogation. This is unacceptable. Our role is to provide medical care to war casualties and sick detainees, not to repeatedly treat the same patients between torture sessions."

The detainees with torture wounds includes former fighters in the conflict, "but also people who have been accused of theft," Stokes said.

Libya faces challenges in building a new nation

Pillay said the International Committee of the Red Cross had visited more than 8,500 detainees in about 60 places in Libya between March and December.

The majority of the detainees are accused of being Gadhafi loyalists, Pillay said Wednesday.

She said the issue is part of the difficulties Libya is having in law enforcement and security as the country transitions from Gadhafi's rule.

"The lack of oversight by the central authorities creates an environment conducive to torture and ill-treatment," Pillay said.
