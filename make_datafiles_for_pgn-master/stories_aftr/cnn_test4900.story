In the latest sign of his resolve to fight widespread official corruption, Chinese President Xi Jinping presided over a leadership meeting Monday to expel four senior members from the ruling Communist Party, including a retired top general of the two million-strong People's Liberation Army.

Gen. Xu Caihou, a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission that runs the world's largest standing army, was found to have accepted bribes, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Xu was also a member of the country's elite decision-making body, the Politburo, before retiring in late 2012.

The official probe into Xu, 71, started in March and Party investigators have found evidence of him and his family members receiving money and gifts from others, according to Xinhua. Xu's case would be handed over to prosecutors for a court martial, making him the most senior military leader to face corruption charges in recent memory.

'Tigers and flies'

Zhou Yongkang

State media has reported official probes into many of Zhou's family members as well as former associates in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and southwestern Sichuan Province -- three places Zhou once ruled. If announced, Zhou would become the highest-ranking official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic.

'Corruption endemic'

Longtime China observers, however, point to the limits of President Xi's war on corruption.

"Corruption is so widespread and so endemic that campaigns are just not going do it," said Frank Ching, a Hong Kong-based commentator and columnist on Chinese politics. "Something has to be done about the system."

"There have been public calls for a law to require officials disclosing their assets. There has been no indication that they are going to do that. In fact, a number of people calling for this law have ended up in prison," he added.
