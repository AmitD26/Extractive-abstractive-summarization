(CNN)Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams didn't just blur the lines, they crossed them, a California jury ruled this week.

Their song "Blurred Lines" ripped off the Marvin Gaye soul classic "Got to Give It Up," jurors found, ordering the performers to pay millions for copyright damages and infringement.

Marvin Gaye's:

Tom Petty stands his ground: Young British pop sensation Sam Smith's 2014 tune "Stay With Me" has a riff in the chorus similar to that of the 1989 Tom Petty hit "I Won't Back Down." Reports say the two settled out of court, and the official credits now list Petty as a co-writer of the Smith song. Petty says there are no hard feelings.

Not free to do whatever you want. Some fans of the Beatles spoof band the Rutles noticed what they thought were similarities between the Oasis hit "Whatever" and the Neil Innes tune "How Sweet to be an Idiot." Headlines suggested that Innes was going to sue Oasis, but in a 2013 interview, the songwriter said it was the music publisher EMI who took action and settled out of court, giving a quarter of the monies from "Whatever" to Innes and a quarter to EMI. Innes later winked at the incident in the opening notes of the song "Shangri-La."

Neil Innes, 14 years earlier:

Not so fine: One of the most famous copyright disputes in music history targeted former Beatle George Harrison's song "My Sweet Lord," which was found to have copied "He's So Fine" by the girl group the Chiffons. Harrison was ordered to pay nearly $2 million and was quoted as saying he never made any money off the song -- but he struck back with "This Song," a hit about the incident. It included the line: "As far as I know, it don't infringe on anyone's copyright."
