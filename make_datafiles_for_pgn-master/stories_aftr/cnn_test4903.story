(CNN)A  Los Angeles police officer wanted on murder charges "should be considered armed and dangerous," according to authorities.

According to witnesses, shots were fired in the predawn hours Saturday after a struggle between a shooter and a victim before a compact car was seen rushing off.

Investigators looking for clues discovered an abandoned car about three blocks away from the scene that belonged to Solis.

The LAPD is helping them look for him. Solis, who is still in his probationary phase, was off duty when the killing happened and has not reported back since.

Police have not said how Solis may have been involved in the killing, CNN affiliate KTLA reported.

"He was just sweet," Sandra Soto told KTLA. "He was my best friend."

CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.
