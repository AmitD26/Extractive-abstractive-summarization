Now, the man who was told he might never walk again is coaching his team in the state playoffs.

Turk is the head basketball coach at West Oso High School in Corpus Christi, Texas. His team just clinched the district championship after an undefeated district season and are playing in the Texas State Basketball playoffs. It's an impressive run for his first season as head coach -- and an inspiration to his young players.

Turk has been obsessed with basketball since he was a boy growing up in Indiana. When he was 5 years old, he learned to read by studying the sports pages with his grandfather. By the time he was 13, he was dreaming of playing for the Indiana Pacers.

He woke up paralyzed.

He was rushed in an ambulance to the hospital. For two weeks, he was completely paralyzed from the waist down and had temporarily lost some of his eye sight.  After numerous tests, Turk was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis, a rare disease that causes inflammation of the spinal cord.

Turk and his family were facing the harsh truth about what his quality of life would be like. He had to cope with the fact that he may not walk again.

"Most patients do not recover well," said Turk. He spent the next 66 days in the hospital.

Miller and Turk spent the next couple hours discussing each of their stories.

Turk attended Indiana State University, where his dream to play college basketball turned into dreams of wanting to coach. In 2004, he met Coach Ronnie Arrow, the head basketball coach at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, at a summer basketball camp and later worked for Arrow as the school's director of basketball operations.

"When you first see him, you may think he can't do what others can," Arrow, now retired, told CNN. "But he gets the job done no matter what."

The forced sabbatical led him to wonder if he really had a future in coaching.

"I knew my resume was competitive," he said. "I knew my passion for the game wasn't exceeded by anyone." He began to wonder if "having a cane and an unusual gait" would prevent him from ever coaching.

In the two years when he didn't have a team to coach, he studied other coaches' methods and sought their advice on how he could improve.

In his dreams, he can still play basketball. In reality, he has fallen down in practice, and during games. There isn't much room on the sidelines to walk up and down, and he often trips over his athletes' feet.

"It hurts me that there are things that I cannot physically demonstrate -- a lot of the footwork stuff with stops, turns and jumps."

But his players don't seem to mind.

"We don't notice his disability, we see him as a great coach," said starter Creighton Avery. "He is always positive and inspires us."
