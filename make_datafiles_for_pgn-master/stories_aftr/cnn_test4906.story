Clinton aides and department officials stressed this week that the former secretary of state did not violate State policy when she exclusively used a private email account for government work. However, it is currently unclear whether Clinton broke a State guideline dating back to 2005 that suggested "normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an (authorized information system), which has the proper level of security control."

The department official was careful to say that the people reviewing the documents are "not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of Secretary Clinton's 55,000 pages of emails."

Clinton's use of private email was never hidden from anyone, according to a former State Department official. The former secretary of state sent thousands of employees message from that account and in her four plus years at the State Department, nobody raised a red flag and say that she couldn't conduct her email communication in the manner she was conducting it, the former official adds.

Clinton's exclusive use of a private email system has quickly ballooned this week into a controversy for the presumed Democratic frontrunner for president in 2016. Experts have said it doesn't appear Clinton violated federal laws, but that hasn't stemmed the issue that has become more about bad optics and politics.

"I want the public to see my email," her tweet said. "They said they will review them for release as soon as possible."

The State Department acknowledged Clinton's request after the tweet, and a senior official said the review could "take several months."

And while State officials said their review will focus on what can be released, the inquiry will also have to determine what is not suitable for dissemination given its sensitivity. If the department has to withhold documents, questions are likely to be raised about whether Clinton broke State Department guidance for transmuting sensitive but unclassified materials.

"We just don't know what would happen in that situation, there are so many variables and factors, I just really don't want to speculate," Harf said.

The New York Times reported on Thursday that Clinton's closest aides at State were well aware that Clinton communicated using a private email address. "Neither career foreign service officers nor State Department lawyers suggested that Mrs. Clinton use a department email address," the Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the inner workings of State Department under Mrs. Clinton.

Clinton's spokesman failed to comment to CNN questions about those revelations by the Times.

The questions around Clinton's email use have captivated political watchers over the last week and allowed Republicans to cast Clinton in a similar way they did her husband, former President Bill Clinton: As a secretive politician pushing the boundaries and rules and regulations.

At the time, Clinton was using her own personal email account to conduct official business.

In addition to directives from State, federal guidelines from Clinton's four years leading the department do not appear to outlaw the exclusive use of personal email devices.

The National Archives and Records Administration, the government agency that regulates the Federal Records Act, issued guidance in 2009 -- the same year Clinton took over at State -- that allowed agency employees to use personal accounts as long as they ensured "that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system."

It wasn't until 2014 - when President Barack Obama signed an update to the Federal Records Law - that a timeline was set up to mandate how quickly emails had to be turned over by people who used personal devices.
