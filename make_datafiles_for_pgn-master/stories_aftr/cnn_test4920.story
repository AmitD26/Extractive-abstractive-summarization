(InStyle.com) -- We asked five stars for their innermost thoughts on perfume, then chose the season's best new scents

What was your first perfume?

273 by Fred Hayman. I wore it when I was a teenager. My mom used to wear it, and I stole it. (Fred Hayman 273, $55/2.5 fl. oz.; fragrancenet.com)

Getting ready, curling my hair, putting my makeup on, going out to a party. And my mother, my childhood, my house.

What does your house smell like?

Vanilla. Warm and sweet. I have a lot of Diptyque candles around the house. Even when I'm away, I have someone burn them. I like having the scent in my pillows. (Diptyque Opopanax candle, $55; bergdorfgoodman.com)

What other scents do you like?

My favorite scent is my mother's cooking: her yams and her soul food. They smell like love, like being full and happy.

I like [anything by] Creed. (Creed Original Santal, $110/1 fl. oz.; neimanmarcus.com)

Emmy Rossum

Lancôme Trésor. It still reminds me of watching her get ready to go out at night. (Lancôme Trésor, $81/3.4 fl. oz.; lancome-usa.com)

What was your first perfume?

Can you let us in on some of your all-time favorites?

Angel Men. It's masculine and very appealing without being too strong. (Thierry Mugler Angel Men, $102/3.4 fl. oz.; bloomingdales.com)

Which kind of smells are you attracted to for soaps, shampoos, lotions and home fragrances?

I like traditional Johnson's No More Tears baby shampoo and Kérastase products. I like vanilla and pomegranate for soaps. My favorite candle is Jo Malone Wild Fig & Cassis.

Always, especially during intimate kissing scenes! I wear something that is sensual but not too obvious.

What was the first scent you wore?

If you got a whiff of it right now, what memories would it trigger?

It would be seventh grade and not having enough disposable money. It would be Fiorucci, a shirt tied in a knot at the waist, and the Yankees. It would be fighting with my brothers and sisters before school and my mother yelling at me, and not finishing my homework on a Sunday night.

Do you wear fragrance every day?

Where do you apply it?

I love walking into a closet and smelling lingering aroma, so I always spray my clothes. And at the end of the bottle, when the atomizer no longer reaches the tiny little dribble that is left, I unscrew the top and pour the remainder onto a T-shirt or my dress.

What's your favorite men's scent?

I really love Old Spice and Guerlain Vetiver for men. (Guerlain Vetiver, $74/4.2 fl. oz.; saks.com)

What home fragrance do you love?

There's nothing better than a blue Rigaud candle. (Rigaud Chèvrefeuille candle, $75; gracioushome.com)

Do you wear perfume every day?

Not if I'm just in sweatpants around the house. But if I go out, I always squirt something on. It completes the look.

Are you always attracted to the same kind of scents?

You're the face of Estée Lauder Pleasures. How would you describe that fragrance?

What perfume did your mom wear when you were a kid?

She wore Quadrille by Balenciaga, and they don't make it anymore. I always go online trying to find bottles [stashed] in someone's basement to give to her as a present because she's almost out of it.

No, but when I was pregnant I couldn't tolerate the smell of anything, whether it was garlic, orange juice or perfume.

Now do you avoid scents that might overwhelm little noses?

I just don't overdo it. A little spritz goes a long way.

What scent do you love on men?

Ocean water. I like natural scents.

It's a white-flower fragrance with a lot of tuberose, which is my favorite flower. It's fresh and sexy in a fashion-y way. I think it's a happy smell. (Intimately Beckham, $42/1.7 fl. oz.; ulta.com)

Does it remind you of anything?

White flowers remind me of my grandmother: timeless and gorgeous. Everything I wear I would like to think of as timeless as well. I still wear dresses I bought 10 years ago.

So you like florals?

I love rose, tuberose and orange blossom. I'm a real girlie girl -- I love perfume, makeup and hair products. I think I know how girls want to smell.

Do you wear different scents for different moods?

How involved was David in creating the fragrance?

David and I both love Miller Harris. (Miller Harris Feuilles de Tabac, $120/3.4 fl. oz.; bigelowchemist.com)

What was your first fragrance?

Coco Chanel. If I smelled it today, it would take me back to being 14, just when I was first really getting into fashion. (Chanel Coco, $110/3.4 fl. oz.; at Nordstrom)

What scent did your mom wear?

Any other favorites?

I love Jo Malone's grapefruit smells. And I have to say, nothing looks better in the bathroom than a bottle of Chanel No. 5 -- that's the ultimate. E-mail to a friend
