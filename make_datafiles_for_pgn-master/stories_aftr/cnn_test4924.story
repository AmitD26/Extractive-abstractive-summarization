Strollers, playpens, toys and diapers take up a lot of space, but a lot of parents still had organized trunks.

To uncover the secret contents of the average American trunk and cargo hold.

I spent two weekend afternoons at the Empire Center in Burbank, California, with my camera and notebook, approaching shoppers as they arrived or departed. I identified myself as a reporter for AOL Autos, and asked if I could see what they had in their trunk, and maybe take a picture. I hoped that I'd be able to see a trend in trunks. AOL Autos: Small cars with room in the trunk

The raw data  My decidedly unscientific study yielded some interesting results. First of all, I discovered that even in a big city (Burbank is a suburb of Los Angeles), people are exceedingly nice if you are respectful and forthright.

About 80% of the people I approached were kind, open and helpful, and gladly opened their trunks for a glance. The 20% who refused were either in a rush, guarded or shy -- but they were still remarkably polite.

The second surprising thing was that the vast majority of trunks and cargo holds were clean and uncluttered. I really expected to discover overstuffed trunks, full of cast-off items and flea market finds. But even the most fully-used storage areas were tidy and organized.

For the non-athletic, the most common item I saw was the collapsible chair. One family had an entire beach setup in their trunk: four collapsible chairs, a beach blanket, a sun umbrella and an empty cooler, all neatly tucked against the back wall. They said that they always wanted to be ready for a beach day, should the opportunity arise.

The conclusion

After two days pounding the asphalt, I'm pleased to report that I actually uncovered some useful information and some fun trivia.

1. Less junk in the trunk equals less weight, and less weight can mean greater fuel efficiency.   2. Under certain circumstances, shifting content in your trunk can adversely affect handling.   3. An empty trunk provides space for that roadside find or warehouse store bargain. How else are you going to get that pallet of pickled asparagus spears back to your garage?

Here are a few tips that I picked up from the best (and worst) of trunks:

3. Vacuum your cargo space whenever you wash your car so that whatever you put in your trunk doesn't get dirty and dusty.

4. Keep a few reusable shopping bags in your trunk so that you always have them when you get to the store.

5. Be sure to carry a few essential tools -- screwdrivers, wrench, tire-changing tools, a rubber mallet, etc. -- for emergency repair.

•. A machete, an axe and a hammer, wrapped in a colorful sheet (I didn't ask any questions).

• A pair of old-school quad roller skates.

• An ice scraper (odd because the temperature was 97 degrees in the shade) -- and we never get frost in Southern California.

• Nothing. I can guarantee that this is the one thing you'll never find in my trunk.
