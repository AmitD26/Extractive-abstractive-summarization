(CNN) -- Hundreds of people filled a college auditorium Wednesday to pay their last respects to an El Reno, Oklahoma, woman slain along with her four children last week.

Rust's white coffin was placed in front of the podium, flanked by the smaller caskets carrying her children.

"I've preached a lot of funerals, but none like this one," said the Rev. Gerald Van Horn.

He told mourners that God is near and feels their pain but acknowledged that Rust and her children "will be greatly missed."

The bodies were found January 12 in Rust's apartment in El Reno, about 30 miles west of Oklahoma City.

According to the document, each of the victims was suffocated and strangled. Crime scene investigators said each body had ligature marks around the neck.

He was arrested in Hamilton County, Texas, officials said. A spokeswoman at the Canadian County, Oklahoma, Sheriff's Office said Durcho was being held in the county jail after waiving extradition.

The affidavit says Durcho told the woman "that the children were at their grandmother's residence ... while he and Summer worked out their relationship problems."

Rust's mother, Susan Rust of Carson City, Nevada, said Durcho was unemployed and had been living with Rust and her children.

Authorities in Texas said Durcho was arrested after a state trooper attempted to stop his car because the trooper suspected that the driver was drunk. When the trooper ran the license plate on the car, it matched the tag number of a vehicle sought by Oklahoma police.
