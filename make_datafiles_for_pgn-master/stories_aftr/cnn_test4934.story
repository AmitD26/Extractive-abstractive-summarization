(CNN) -- Chronic seizures can present a risk for adolescents, whose bodies and metabolism are changing.

Jett Travolta was the elder of John Travolta and Kelly Preston's two children.

"Literally dozens of different disorders can cause seizures: genetics, stroke, brain tumor, lack of oxygen, low blood sugar, drugs, even certain medications," said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent.

"Seizures during adolescence can get better or worse or stay the same," he said.

And the risk of seizures is higher for children with disabilities such as autism and cerebral palsy, Shinnar said.

An autopsy of the actors' son was completed Monday, and the body was cremated that evening, the funeral home source said.

Jett was found unconscious in the bathroom Friday while on vacation with his family. Michael Ossi, an attorney for Travolta, told CNN last week that Jett had a seizure that morning at the family's home in a resort area. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital and pronounced dead on arrival, according to local police.

"It tells us more about what did not happen than the ultimate cause of death. It rules out brain injury, bleeding on brain, skull fractures, rules out heart problems due to Kawasaki disease, which is the disease the Travoltas say their son suffered," he said.

"I was obsessive about cleaning -- his space being clean, so we constantly had the carpets cleaned. And I think, between him, the fumes and walking around, maybe picking up pieces or something, he got what is rarely a thing to deal with, but it's Kawasaki syndrome," Travolta said of his then-2-year-old son.

Dr. Cam Patterson, general cardiologist at the University of North Carolina and a genetics expert who follows Kawasaki disease, told CNN, "There is no real good link at all between Kawasaki disease and cleaning products.

"Kawasaki disease is due to an abnormal immunnologic response, probably to an infectious agent or infection we don't yet understand," Patterson said. "There is nothing that links environmental toxins to this problem."

Someone with Kawasaki could have seizures for one of two reasons, but they would be rare, he said.

The next step would have been to conduct more tests, by taking toxicological tests and brain examinations to see what could have caused the seizure.
