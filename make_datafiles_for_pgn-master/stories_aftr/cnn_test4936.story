(CNN) -- "Hannah Montana: The Movie" is exactly what it purports to be, no more, no less: a two-hour version of a "Hannah Montana" TV episode.

Miley Cyrus stars as Hannah Montana -- and Miley Stewart -- in "Hannah Montana: The Movie."

Hannah's popularity becomes too much for Miley Stewart (Cyrus). Miley retreats to Tennessee, learns what really matters, performs some songs and kisses a boy, and everything turns out all right in the end.

Peter Chelsom -- whose checkered career includes the terrific "Funny Bones" and "Hear My Song" as well as the bomb "Town & Country" -- handled the direction.

So, not a bad Easter weekend -- and it will conclude (more or less) with the final round of the Masters golf tournament.

Miley Cyrus will probably not be there. She's got some wholesome singing to do.
