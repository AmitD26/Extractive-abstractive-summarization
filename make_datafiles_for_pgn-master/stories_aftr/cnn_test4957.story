Michael Jackson's personal chef Kai Chase appeared on CNN's "Larry King Live" Thursday night.

Chase said she was downstairs preparing lunch for Jackson -- being sure to wrap it in Saran wrap because the singer liked his meals served room-service style -- when Dr. Conrad Murray called out for her. Murray is the central focus of a federal investigation into the singer's death, a law enforcement official told CNN on Wednesday.

Around noon or a little after, Chase said, "Dr. Murray comes down the stairs. There was a stairwell that leads into the kitchen. And he's screaming: Hurry! Go get Prince. Call security. Get Prince."

Chase said Jackson's daughter, Paris, started crying and calling out for her father as people in the home came to realize how serious the medical situation was.

"We started crying and we all come together in unity in a circle and we started holding hands. And we started praying," Chase said.

The chef said she was not allowed into the upstairs quarters of the home, but she had seen Michael Jackson downstairs on Wednesday, June 24. Nothing she saw the day before cause her alarm.

"The third day I was there, when I came back, he had told me, 'You know, they're killing me. They're killing me because I'm working too much. I'm rehearsing too much.' "

Between 1 and 1:30 p.m. June 25, Chase said security asked her to leave the home, and she never saw Michael Jackson being transported to the hospital. She didn't learn of Jackson's death until later that day on the radio.

Chase said that Murray was in the house often in June and she attributed the doctor's frequent presence to Jackson's rigorous rehearsal schedule for an upcoming series of concerts in London, England.

In his interview with Chase, King pressed for details of evidence of drug use by Jackson:

King: Did you notice oxygen tanks, because if it was Diprivan and they have to measure ... your blood pressure? They also need oxygen tanks if you're giving that drug. Did you notice them?

King: Where were they?

Chase: I would see Dr. Murray carrying the oxygen tanks down in the mornings.

Chase: No. I didn't see him that morning. I saw him in the afternoon, but other mornings.

King: He would carry them down?

King: They were portable oxygen tanks?

She said detectives came to her home right after the death but did not ask her about her name being on any prescriptions.

"I don't know what make of it," Chase told King.

Chase, who said she's been a professional chef for about 14 years, said she's seen the Jackson children since June 25.

Chase said she said no evidence that Michael Jackson was a poor eater. In fact, she said just the opposite was true from her observations.

"He ate very well," she said. "He ate organic and fresh. He [was] into the health foods and juices and things of that nature."

• On Katherine Jackson, Michael's mother: "I saw the interaction with them when I went to the home. ... They love their grandma, you know. It's a beautiful bond that they have together."

• On Jackson's ex-wife having visitation rights to her children: "I think Debbie Rowe should see and raise her children."

• On Jackson's planned London shows: "We started talking about bringing, you know, video games and stuff to the private jet. And it was just, you know, he was very excited about going on this -- doing this tour. This is his comeback."

Life in the Jackson household -- from Chase's account -- was a loving and cheerful one and that he loved his three children.

"You know, I would bring ... the lunches and set them on the table and they'd all come in and sit, close the door and they'd dine privately. And you would just hear laughter and story-telling and just beautiful things. Those were his babies."
