(CNN)  -- Arturo Gatti, who was found dead in a Brazilian hotel room in suspicious circumstances, is revered by boxing fans for his trilogy of thrilling and brutal fights with Micky "Irish" Ward.

Arturo Gatti fought to the limit of his endurance in many epic bouts.

Almost unbelievably, he fought on and despite being floored in the sixth dominated the rest of the fight to win on a unanimous decision.

Despite Gatti's winning the WBC junior welterweight crown the following year by beating Gianluca Branco of Italy to the vacant title, his storied wins over Ward proved to be the high point of Gatti's career.

He made two successful defenses of the title against lightly-regarded opponents until running into Mayweather in June 2005.

It proved a big fight too many, as he was slowed by body shots and cut a sorry figure as he was stopped in the sixth round.

Moving up to welterweight, Gatti won a warm-up fight before losing to Carlos Baldomir in a world title bout.

It ended a 49-fight career with 31 knockout and nine defeats. His first world title had come with victory over Tracy Harris Patterson, the adopted son of heavyweight great Floyd Patterson, to claim the IBF super featherweight crown.

Gatti later married Rodriguez, and they have a one-year-old son. She has been arrested in connection with his death.
