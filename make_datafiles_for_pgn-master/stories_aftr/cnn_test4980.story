Nineteen of the 30 private sellers the undercover investigators dealt with failed the integrity test, according to the report.

There were no arrests and no lawsuit were filed.

"Closing the gun show loophole has nothing to do with the Second Amendment," Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a news conference Wednesday. "It is basic law enforcement, plain and simple."

He said he does not want to shut down gun shows but to change the law.

"We believe anyone who breaks the law should be arrested, prosecuted and punished," the National Rifle Association said in a statement supplied to CNN. "Instead of working with law enforcement to bring those who may have broken the law to justice, Mayor Bloomberg chose to use this information for a press conference. Bloomberg's priorities are clearly media first, justice later."

But Bloomberg has support from some in Washington, including Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey.

"This investigation reveals how easy it is for criminals and even terrorists to purchase firearms at gun shows and is further proof that we must close the gun show loophole," Lautenberg said in a written statement.
