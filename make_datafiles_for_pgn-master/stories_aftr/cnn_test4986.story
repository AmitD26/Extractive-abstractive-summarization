(CNN) -- Hundreds of inmates using pipes and shanks as weapons trashed a California prison, burning a courtyard, ripping beds to shreds and tearing bathroom sinks from walls, a new video of the weekend riot's aftermath shows.

A dormitory is trashed after a riot at the California Institution for men, in Chino.

The riot erupted Saturday night and raged until Sunday morning, injuring 250 inmates. Fifty-five inmates were taken to hospitals with serious injuries, including stab wounds and head trauma.  Watch the aftermath of the violence Â»

"The prison is still under a state of emergency," George Kostyrko, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation told CNN, which means no visitors were allowed and the prison could not take any new inmates.

The decision to lock down the Chino prison and nine others in southern California was still in effect Tuesday.

A housing unit was heavily damaged by fire. Prisoners broke windows and pulled down pipes to use as weapons, Kostyrko said.

The facility has seven units, each of which houses about 200 inmates.

In one of the torched dormitories, burned red prison uniforms were strewn everywhere, the floor was covered with ankle-high ashes, windows were shattered and there was a large hole in the roof.

In the mounds of trash that littered the floor of the dorm, a rusty foot-long pipe could be seen.

Chino is about 35 miles east of Los Angeles.
