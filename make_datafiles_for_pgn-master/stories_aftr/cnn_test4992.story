Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The optimism once held by many Americans has been "beaten out" of them amid a lagging economy, threat of terrorism and two ongoing wars, according to a professor at Emory University.

"All of those things ... have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be," says Patrick Allitt, a British citizen who teaches American history.

Allitt spoke with CNN about his perspective. Below is a transcript of that conversation, which has been edited:

CNN: How would you describe the change in America since you first came to America?

Allitt: It's certainly true there are far more media than there used to be ... that devote a lot of time to people who are dissatisfied. In other words, if somebody's happy, that isn't news. It's certainly news when they become dissatisfied in some way or they have some kind of problem to deal with. In that sense, I suppose there's an inherent bias in favor of bad news.

But I think it's more than that. I've spent most of the last 30 years in the company of academics, who also tend to be pessimistic people. They tend to have very high ideals for America. When they see it doesn't live up to its ideals, it makes them disappointed and sometimes embittered. So it may be that, if I spent more time with less educated people, I wouldn't have this sense quite so acutely.

Allitt: Even before this recession began, I guess it was in October and November 2008 when things really started to go bad. Already by then, I was having a feeling that the general national optimism was less emphatic than it used to be.

In the first five or six years of the last decade, there was this feeling that things were going wrong, particularly that the wars were grinding on interminably and that it was very difficult to prevail. It wasn't the same kind of decisive conflict as World War II where you're fighting against a nation-state and you can clearly detect when you're winning. The dispersal of the enemy and the very shadowy character of terrorism tends to be very depressing to confront. You have to maintain a high degree of vigilance and sometimes you have to take comfort in thinking what's extraordinary is what didn't happen; there wasn't another major attack.

CNN: If we are in this funk as you describe, is there anything wrong with that? And how do we emerge from it?

Allitt: The one thing I've always admired about Americans is their willingness to be self-critical. I do think you could take the view that the very fact that so many Americans are willing to scrutinize their own behavior and their nation's behavior is a sign that they do have these high ideals and they want to live up to them.

So in that sense, you can take an optimistic view, even of pessimism -- that sooner or later, the sheer attention to it is going to cause people to recover.

But I do think there are generational trends in American life. People who were brought up in the 1930s during the Great Depression -- the image of it stayed with them for a lifetime. ... In the same way, I expect the kids who have grown up in the last few years are also going to carry the marks of this with them through life. They'll come into conflict with their own children who have different generational experiences. It's impossible at this stage to say what's going to happen next. ...

CNN: You kind of hint about this in your piece: Maybe you're just going through a midlife crisis and that's why you might have this view.

Allitt: I think that's possible, but I think I'm describing something more real than that. My job is to study the American people in the past; but also to some extent in the present. I really do feel this kind of change has come about. But you can't quantify it. You can't say 8 out of 10 people are optimistic -- or at least if you try to you're really giving a false sense of definiteness. So what I'm trying to do is capture a mood and compare it to a mood that I saw previously.

... I still feel there's an enormous amount of hope and potential and capability here, so I don't share the feeling of gloom, which I see in the people around me.

CNN: Describe the "Avatar" analogy for me?

CNN: Have you started receiving hate mail yet: Hey, Brit, get the hell out of our country?

Allitt: No, not at all.

CNN: Any final thoughts?

When I was growing up in Britain, nobody talked about equality. It's a very hierarchical society in Britain, and everyone has their own place within the hierarchy and others are below them -- and then, what you've got to do is stay in your place.

So it felt very liberating for me to come to America. Although obviously, this isn't a society where everybody is equal in practice. But at least this is a place where everybody tries hard to make sure that every kid really does have the opportunities to make the most of their own abilities.
