The final toxicology results show no alcohol and no drugs other than zolpidem, the generic name for Ambien.

"Moments after the accident occurred, I told police that it was possible that I may have inadvertently taken a sleep aid instead of my daily thyroid medication," Kennedy said in a statement released Wednesday.

Police found Kennedy, 52, daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy and ex-wife of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, behind the wheel of her damaged Lexus SUV on the morning of July 13.

At a court hearing on July 17 in North Castle, New York, Kennedy pleaded not guilty to charges of driving while impaired.

The judge released her under her own recognizance.

She submitted to both blood and urine tests after the accident.

Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the district attorney's office in Westchester, declined to comment Wednesday, citing a pending case.
