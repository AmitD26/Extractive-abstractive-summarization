(CNN)  -- Novak Djokovic left the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court to jeers and catcalls after his U.S. Open quarterfinal victory over Andy Roddick on Thursday night.

The Flushing Meadows crowd was enraged by comments the Serbian made in his post-match interview in which he criticized home favorite Roddick in no uncertain terms.

Djokovic had been angered by apparently light-hearted remarks made by Roddick in which he accused the world number three of feigning injuries.

"That's not nice, anyhow, to say in front of this crowd that I have 16 injuries and that I'm faking," Djokovic blurted out after his four-set victory.

"He's either quick to call a trainer or he's the most courageous guy of all time."

The remarks certainly acted as motivation, but he owed his 6-2 6-3 3-6 7-6 victory to uncharacteristic serving errors by eighth seed Roddick.

"You know what? I honestly don't feel like they were super-tight doubles," Roddick told the Associated Press.

Roddick was also asked about his verbal squabble with Djokovic and immediately apologized.

Both men spoke in private after the incident and Djokovic was also contrite in his post-match press conference.

"He made a joke and it was a misunderstanding, so I don't blame it on him," Djokovic said.

"Maybe I exaggerated and reacted bad in that moment. I apologize."

Federer -- bidding for a 13th major title, one shy of Pete Sampras' record -- beat qualifier Gilles Muller 7-6  6-4 7-6 earlier on Thursday, again looking less than convincing in extending his own record by reaching the semifinals at an 18th consecutive grand slam tournament.

The men's semifinals and women's final are all scheduled for Saturday, but tournament organizers have seen forecasts calling for about 12 hours of rain and wind at up to 35 mph that day.

So they began the process of negotiating with TV networks and preparing contingency plans, including weighing the possibility of announcing Friday that no tennis would be played Saturday, and that the men's final would be shifted from Sunday to Monday.

In the women's semifinals on Friday, two-time champion Serena Williams faces Dinara Safina, and Jelena Jankovic meets Elena Dementieva.
