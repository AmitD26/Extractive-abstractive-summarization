The individuals were identified as Army Spc. Christopher Paul Kilburn based at Fort Riley, Kansas, and civilian Micah Noel Goodier of Palm Beach, Florida.

Kilburn, who was on AWOL status from the Army, has been charged with desertion, a release from the air base said. He is being turned over to Army authorities, and additional charges are pending, the air base said.

The pair were stopped early Monday evening at a gate at the base, which houses the headquarters for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Senior Airman Katherine Holt said.

A search of the vehicle after they were detained revealed three handguns and three "rifle-style" weapons, Cohen said.

The investigation was ongoing, he said.

The incident was not being investigated as a terrorist threat, Cohen said.
