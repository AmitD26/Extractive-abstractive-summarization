Khawaja, who was born in Islamabad but moved to Australia at the age of four, said he was "shocked" at being selected for the two-Test series, which was moved to England due to safety concerns in Pakistan due to last year's extremist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team bus.

"I was a bit shocked, I had a feeling I was close but that could mean absolutely nothing," he told Cricket Australia's official website.

"The feeling didn't really sink in straight away but I've told my family and they're really excited."

Khawaja, who is also a fully-qualified pilot, was named in a strong 14-man Australian side for the series which begins on July 13.

The 23-year-old made headlines in 2008 when he became the first cricketer of Pakistani-Australian background to play first-class cricket in Australia, making his debut for New South Wales in an inter-state match against Victoria.

"Usman Khawaja has been selected on the back of some very strong Sheffield Shield performances," Hilditch said in a statement on Cricket Australia's official website.

"Ben Hilfenhaus has successfully returned from injury during the current Australia A series in Queensland," Hilditch said.

Left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Johnson and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin have also been included after both recovered from elbow injuries.

The two Tests between Australia and Pakistan will take place at Lord's in London on July 13-17 and Headingley in Leeds from July 21-25.
