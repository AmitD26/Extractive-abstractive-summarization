(CNN) -- A world record was set recently in Houston, Texas. It wasn't the world's fastest quarter-mile run, the world's largest pumpkin or even the world's heaviest man. It was, however, as stunning to witness: the world's largest senior citizen Wii bowling tournament, as confirmed by Guinness World Records.

The event, put on by TexanPlus -- the Houston area's largest Medicare HMO -- drew more than 1,500 supporters and 600 senior bowlers to break a record but also to have fun and dish out a little bit of Texas-style competition and a side helping of health information.

One booty-shakin' grandma even showed off her victory dance after she Wii-bowled a strike.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, falls are the leading cause of injury-related death in seniors.

A fall -- or, worse, a broken bone that limits a senior's mobility -- can be the start of a downward spiral that ends up taking a life, says Dr. Sheldon Zinberg, founder of a senior fitness center called Nifty After Fifty.

"Those, for example, who have hip fractures are likely not to be alive two years from now," Zinberg said. "Fifty percent of them never get out of a nursing home."

If you're a senior and Wii bowling isn't up your alley, there are plenty of other steps you can take to prevent falls.

According to the American Association of Family Physicians, seniors can reduce their likelihood of falling by making changes in three key areas.

Make sure your home is safe

Remove objects that may get in your way as you walk, install night lights and handrails in bathrooms, and call friends or family members to take care of small projects that require the use of step-stools or ladders.

Get your body in shape

As for the Wii bowlers, all the participants -- winners and runners-up -- reported that they were happy they came.
