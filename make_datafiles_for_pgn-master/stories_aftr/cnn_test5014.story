NBA Commissioner David Stern said Monday that team owner Dan Gilbert's words, "though understandable, were ill-advised and imprudent."

In a letter posted on the team's website Thursday, Gilbert called James' decision to play for the Miami Heat a "cowardly betrayal" and a "shocking act of disloyalty."

Stern also criticized civil rights leader Jesse Jackson for comments he made saying Gilbert's letter showed a "property-owner's mentality."

Before deciding to join the Miami Heat, James, a reigning two-time NBA MVP, looked at several teams, including New York, Chicago and Cleveland.

He said it came down to one thing.

"The major factor was the best opportunity to win now and to win in the future." James said.

He led the Cavaliers to the NBA finals in 2007, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, but never reached the finals again, despite Cleveland management bringing in supporting stars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Antawn Jamison.
