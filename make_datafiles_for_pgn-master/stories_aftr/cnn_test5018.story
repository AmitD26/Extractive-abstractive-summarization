"That part of the case will be investigated by NYPD. We will be in touch  with Manhattan detectives who will be investigating the murder (of the EMT)," Brooklyn District Attorney spokesman Jerry Schmetterer.

The case involving the EMT -- Jason Green -- and a pregnant woman occurred in Brooklyn last December 9.

The woman, Eutisha Rennix, was working as a waitress at a cafe when she collapsed. Rennix's coworkers said Green and a fellow EMT were in the cafe when Rennix collapsed but  the two EMTs reportedly told the co-workers to call 911 and left the cafe without aiding the stricken woman.

Following the incident, the fire department suspended the two EMTs  without pay for but were reinstated shortly thereafter, EMT spokesman  Robert Ungar said Sunday.

Green, 31, was shot outside a downtown Manhattan nightclub at about 5 a.m. Sunday. Police said that Green was shot once in the face and was pronounced dead at a hospital.

No arrests had been made as of Sunday afternoon, and NYPD homicide Detective Richard Tireli said that "the investigation is ongoing."

Meanwhile Brooklyn authorities said Sunday their investigation into Rennix's death was continuing.
