U.S. officials said they have received conflicting reports as to whether Joseph Steven Proctor, 32, fired at the Mexican military first.

A woman who answered the telephone at his New York address and who identified herself as Proctor's mother said she was waiting to hear from U.S. officials as to what happened. The woman, who was crying gently, declined to give her name.

Asked if she had heard reports that her son had fired at the Mexican military, she answered, "I've heard that. I don't believe that."

The woman said she did not know how Proctor died.

"I need their information," she said. "I want to find out what happened."

The state of Guerrero, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast, is home to Acapulco, a popular tourist destination.

CNN's Laurie Ure and Arthur Brice contributed to this report.
