Boyle will perform three times at Bellahouston Park in Glasgow on Thursday, Sept. 16, the Scottish Catholic Media Office said. She will also sing with the 800-strong choir at the open-air Mass there.

In the pre-Mass program, Boyle plans to sing the hymn "How Great Thou Art" as well as her signature song, "I Dreamed a Dream," the tune from the musical "Les Miserables" that shot her to fame in April 2009.

"To be able to sing for the pope is a great honor and something I've always dreamed of -- it's indescribable," Boyle, a Catholic, said in a statement. "I think the 16th of September will stand out in my memory as something I've always wanted to do. I've always wanted to sing for His Holiness and I can't really put into words my happiness that this wish has come true at last."

Boyle said her late mother was at the same Glasgow park when Pope John Paul II visited in 1982.

The pope's visit will be the first state visit to the United Kingdom by a pontiff, according to the British Foreign Office. John Paul's trip in 1982 was officially a pastoral visit, while Benedict's is considered a papal visit.

Boyle wowed audiences and judges on the TV show "Britain's Got Talent" last year when she unexpectedly belted out the "Les Miserables" classic. The jaw-dropping performance earned her a string of global TV appearances, legions of fans, and a record deal.

Though she was runner-up in the show's final, her debut album, "I Dreamed a Dream," was a blockbuster, becoming the most pre-ordered CD in history on Amazon.com.
