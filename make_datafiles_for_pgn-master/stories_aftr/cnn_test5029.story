(CNN) -- As criticism of his war on organized crime mounts, Mexican President Felipe Calderon is under increasing pressure to introduce a new security policy.

Calderon, who announced a crackdown on cartels shortly after taking office in 2006, has asked his country's congress to approve fresh measures to help in the fight. Police reforms are a key target of his administration.

"Our primary objective is to ensure that no matter who governs or which party he belongs, the Mexicans are protected by an honest and professional police, by an effective and transparent justice system," Calderon told his nation's security council when he announced the proposed reforms in June.

But taking a new tack in the controversial drug war may be difficult for Calderon, as vocal politicians express their skepticism. The president's political future -- and Mexico's security -- hang in the balance.

Calderon, whose term ends in 2012, has proposed a plan to eliminate more than 2,000 local police forces, combine them with state law enforcement agencies and unite them under federal control. He and his top security officials have argued that the move will better combat corruption and crime.

While some lawmakers support the reform, others are critical of the current strategy, which has the Mexican military as the principal enforcers of public security.

"The big question for us in congress is, 'how long we will have armed forces at the forefront of the fight?'" lawmaker Carlos Navarrete said.

But some Mexican politicians have said they are skeptical that such reforms will do much to combat corruption.

But with persistent public perception about drug cartels gaining ground, Calderon has a tough battle to fight before his term ends in 2012.

A top official in Mexico's opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party has said the war on drugs cannot succeed if it remains a "fight of firepower between criminals and the state."

Mexico's government must create jobs and improve education to help fight drug trafficking, Sen. Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera said.
