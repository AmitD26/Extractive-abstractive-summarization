McLaren reported on their Web site that Button was "very comfortable and confident in the car" as he completed 108 laps in his third test with the team ahead of the final sessions in Barcelona next week.

"Both drivers will spend alternate days in the car evaluating the new bodywork and aerodynamic components ahead of the season-opener in Bahrain on March 14," McLaren said.

Renault's new signing Robert Kubica was second fastest in Saturday's sessions, completing 117 laps in long runs in the R30.

Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was sixth, while Webber was back in eighth after his RB6 could manage only 88 laps after an engine failure.

Meanwhile, struggling new team Campos hope to be on the grid in Bahrain after confirming that shareholder Jose Ramon Carabante has now taken a controlling stake.

The Spaniard has appointed former Force India boss Colin Kolles as team principal of an outfit which has just one confirmed driver, Bruno Senna.

"I would like to thank Bernie Ecclestone, who worked tremendously to support our efforts to keep the team viable," Carabante told F1's official Web site.
