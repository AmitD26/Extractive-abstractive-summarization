(CNN) -- If you were to ask a group of Quakers or Mennonites whether it's OK for police or soldiers to use rubber bullets against rock-throwing children, you wouldn't be surprised if they said, "Absolutely not!" They are well-known for their commitment to pacifism.

But what if you were to put the question this way: "When soldiers are firing against demonstrators, would it be better if they used rubber bullets rather than metal?"

"Obviously it is," they would probably say, "But they shouldn't be firing at all in the first place!"

But this different answer is not a sudden change of mind on the part of the Catholic hierarchy. It is the answer to a different question.

The pope was not asking himself whether it's OK to use condoms.

It's obviously better to do it with a condom because, as the pope pointed out, the person is obliged in that situation not to risk infecting a partner or being infected.

Though the Roman Catholic Church has always been clear in its position on the immorality of intercourse outside of marriage, Pope Benedict has done us all a favor by observing publicly that the use of a condom in such circumstances can be understood as a sign of a burgeoning moral awareness.

It is this issue of responsibility that has always been the sticking point.

Intercourse between husband and wife should always be open to conceiving new life; therefore, contraception was considered wrong because it was seriously unnatural. The problem is that all condom use came to be thought of as absolutely wrong, not just wrong in marriage.

However, church authorities have usually avoided the more complex explanations -- no "maybe," no "in certain conditions." That's because they believe that the public just wants a simple "yes" or "no" -- and preferably a "yes." They fear that anything other than an absolute "no" will be interpreted as an absolute "yes." And, it should be added, they have unjustly censured highly qualified moral theologians who have dared to say "maybe."

The pope's statement only seems new. Since the 1968 encyclical letter Humanae Vitae, which reaffirmed the teaching that artificial means of contraception was not acceptable in a marriage, Rome has been trying to hold the line by refusing to deal with "what if ..." and "perhaps."

In the Catholic tradition, it has always been assumed that those inevitable questions would be dealt with in private conversation between priests and people. Yet for many, that big public "no" made them hesitate to engage in such conversations, and the Catholic Church has not shown itself adept at handling the public debate about condoms and HIV.

When the pope commented during his African journey last year that condoms were not the solution to AIDS in Africa, he was seen to be just giving the same old knee-jerk Catholic moral response, so out of touch with reality.

Yet his comment was based on other observations of a social and scientific nature, and it is to this that he returned briefly in the interview which has caused such a stir.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan Madigan.
