(CNN)  -- Ethiopian distance running legend Haile Gebrselassie has shocked the world of athletics by announcing his retirement.

The 37-year-old dropped out of Sunday's New York City marathon with a knee injury then told reporters he had run his last race.

"I never think about to retire. But for the first time, this is the day," he said. "Let me stop and do other work after this."

He was the star attraction in New York, but pulled out in obvious pain on the Queensboro Bridge while in the leading group at 16 miles.

His compatriot Gebre Gebremariam triumphed on his marathon debut to win in two hours eight minutes and 14 seconds.

Another Kenyan, Moses Kigen Kipkosgei, was third.
