Hamilton's lap time of one minute 40.888 seconds put him clear of Red Bull duo Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber, who finished second and fourth respectively, with Fernando Alonso -- the favorite to take the 2010 crown at the season-ending race -- third fastest.

Who needs to do what to win the F1 drivers' title

The 25-year-old had to battle with his Ferrari counterpart as they traded fast laps, but it was the 2008 champion who eventually got the better of the Spaniard.

"Of course, it will be tough, because the Red Bulls tend to pull out half a second in the third round of qualifying, but our pace is closer to theirs than it's ever been.

The first practice session was dogged by unexpected rain on the track until the skies cleared and the driver's enjoyed a disruption-free second session.

Webber was almost half a second slower than the British pacesetter and knows he will need to improve over the course of the weekend if he is to win his first title.

It was a decent start to the weekend for 23-year-old Vettel, who will more than likely need maximum points from Abu Dhabi to avoid the disappointment of finishing runner up for the second season running.
