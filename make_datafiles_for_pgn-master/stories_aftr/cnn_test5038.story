Beijing, China (CNN) -- China on Tuesday continued its diatribe against Japan over the arrest of a Chinese fishing captain and demanded his immediate release.

On Monday, his 14 crew members returned to China. The Japanese coast guard freed the crew members after completing an investigation, a coast guard official told CNN.

Their detention angered Beijing, which repeatedly summoned the Japanese ambassador, demanding their release.

Beijing says the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countries' claims. The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources that go with them -- is a flashpoint in the Asia-Pacific region.

"Chinese people have expressed strong indignation to this, and this fully embodies the Chinese people's resolve to defend national sovereignty," Yu said. "The islands has sovereign rights, and no one can change that fact."

Word of the fishermen's arrest has led to irate reactions from some of the Chinese public, as seen in online posts.

"So far, we haven't heard that anyone is injured, and we haven't got any result of the investigation," the embassy added.
