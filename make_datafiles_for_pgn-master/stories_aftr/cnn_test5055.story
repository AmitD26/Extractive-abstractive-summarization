London (CNN) -- The mother of a British girl whose murder spurred legislation to protect children says her phone was targeted by a private investigator working for the now-defunct tabloid that led the campaign for the new law.

Sara Payne, whose slain daughter was the namesake of Sarah's Law, said Thursday that police have confirmed unspecified "details" on a list kept by private eye Glenn Mulcaire, one of the central figures in the scandal that took down the 168-year-old News of the World earlier this month.

Sarah's Law, which went into effect in 2008, allows parents to look up the records of convicted pedophiles. The News of the World led the crusade for the law for a decade and provided a mobile phone for Payne, the paper's ex-editor said Thursday.

Payne wrote a column in the paper's defense in its final edition, arguing the News of the World "has often been a force for good" and pointing out that earlier claims that it had hacked her phone "turned out to be untrue."

In Thursday's statement, Payne's representatives said police had informed her during an earlier probe of the allegations that Mulcaire did not have her information -- but a subsequent review found that he did.

News International, the now-shuttered tabloid's corporate parent, said Thursday that it "takes this matter very seriously and is deeply concerned like everyone."

"As the facts are established, the Company and the independent Management and Standards Committee will take all appropriate actions, including cooperating fully with any potential criminal enquiries or civil proceedings which may arise," it said.

And Rebekah Brooks, the former News of the World editor and News International chief who has been arrested as a result of the scandal, called the revelation "abhorrent and particularly upsetting as Sara Payne is a dear friend."

Brooks was arrested and released on bail a week after the tabloid closed. She has not been charged with a crime, however, and her lawyer says she is not guilty of any offense.

CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Laura Perez Maestro and David Wilkinson contributed to this report.
