Certain products are definitely OK to rent. Like a car. Or a tuxedo. Or the cheapest room at a Motel 6 when you find yourself strolling down I-85 at midnight with no pants.

Things are weird at home.

But a Los Angeles-based company caught the internet's attention this week for renting something completely unexpected: wives.

The company's founder, Juliette Bresnahan, says most of her clients are actually women. So, who the hell knows?

So I did.

Rent-a-Bay: A self-service garage in Kent, Washington, Rent-a-Bay is where you can work on your own vehicle with the same professional conveniences of a mechanic. It's a good idea, but there's also a 100% chance I would kill both myself and others in the process of changing a spark plug.

Rent-a-Dreads: This one sort of blew me away, for it has nothing to do with leasing a temporary dreadlock weave like the words might suggest. It's actually a term used in regards to female sex tourism. In the Caribbean and Central America, male sex workers are often referred to as Rent-a-Dreads.

In America, a male sex worker is simply known as "Dave with access to Craigslist."

Rent-a-Friend: This site claims to have "Friends from around the world available for hire," perfect for anyone who just needs a buddy. Some of the activities they say people are using Rent-a-Friend for are sporting events, wine tasting and hot air balloon rides.

"Hi. I'm Gary. Would you like to ride in a balloon with me?"

Rent-a-Goat: This is just what it sounds like. You rent a goat and then let it eat unwanted plants and weeds. But, really, I just want to get one for my dog.

Their slogan is "For those jobs that never get done!" which leads me to believe they specialize in renting out alcoholics who like watching football.

"My Rent-a-Husband was just as advertised! The garbage disposal is still busted, and he left the toilet seat up. Would definitely use again. Five stars!"

Rent-a-John: If you live in the Carolinas and need a temporary outdoor toilet that doubles as a sweat lodge, these guys have you covered.

Rent-a-List: Put that coffee down! This lead generator aims to help people in sales find potential customers to sign on the line that is dotted. A ... B ... C ... Always Be Cluttering people's inboxes.

Rent-a-Midget: Lacking morals? Having a party? Looking for alternative entertainment? You're in luck.

Rent-a-Negro: Back in 2003, damali ayo -- who, officially, doesn't capitalize the first letters of her name -- created this (now-defunct) website as a form of "Web-art-performance" based around the fact that she felt like a "professional black person" to her white friends.

Through Rent-a-Negro, she created a special mock rental form so white people could request services such as touching her hair, teaching them how to dance and speaking with their racist grandmother.

She eventually turned her art experience into a book called "How to Rent a Negro."

Because that's what I need on my shelf.

Rent-a-Pet: This led to several articles about renting animals. On that note, my dog is now available for quincea√±eras.

Rent-a-Quote: Turns out, this is a term used to describe someone who will shamelessly provide a comment to the media on pretty much any topic. Usually, this person's motivation is money and/or exposure.

I enjoy both. Call me.

Rent-a-Ruminant: Ruminants are mammals that eat plants and then barf out the cud. Thus, we have yet another service for renting out goats. I wonder if my new friend Gary knows about this.

Rent-a-Van: It appears Enterprise strategically cornered the Internet market for when you absolutely, positively need an all-white windowless van. They're perfect for driving slowly down sorority row while breathing heavily. Chicks dig that.

Rent-a-Wheel: This is the "largest rent-to-own custom wheel and tire retailer in the nation." Excellent. I've been thinking of tricking out my Saturn.

So, if you want to rent a yurt lodge somewhere in America, Yurt Lodging will help get you there. Because we all want a round room at the end of the day.
