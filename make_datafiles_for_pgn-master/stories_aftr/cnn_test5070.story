(CNN) -- Southern California residents and recovery crews continued their cleanup efforts Saturday, two days after powerful winds downed power lines, damaged structures and caused other devastation.

The National Weather Service issued the warning -- which means that conditions are favorable for fire to grow rapidly if it ignites -- through Sunday morning due to gusty northeast winds and low relative humidity.

The effects are still being felt. Southern California Edison, for example, had 77,400 customers still without power as of 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET) on Saturday, said Alexander. And the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power reported in an online news release that, as of 3 p.m., about 7,000 households in its coverage area still didn't have electricity.

Those numbers, while significant, mark a major drop from those reported several days ago. More than 200,000 of the Los Angeles utility's customers didn't have power at one point, while Edison had about 250,000 in the dark, said Alexander.

Communities along the San Gabriel Mountain foothills, where he lives -- including Monrovia, Sierra Madre and La Canada Flintridge -- suffered especially extensive damage in Edison's territory. Alexander said that the utility had more than 500 personnel out working and urged residents to steer clear of power-lines for their own safety.

Los Angeles County also had "several hundred personnel spanned out across" the county to deal with fallen trees and clear out debris, said Spencer. That includes 50 county public works personnel alone in the hard-hit city of Pasadena, with the spokesman estimating they would be there for at least a week.

One positive, aside from gusty if not likely damaging winds, is that the weather appears to be cooperating. In Pasadena, conditions are forecast to be sunny or mostly sunny, with day-time highs in 60s and nighttime lows in the 40s, all next week, according to the weather service.
