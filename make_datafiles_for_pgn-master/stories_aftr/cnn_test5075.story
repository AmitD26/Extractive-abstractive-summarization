(EW.com) -- So long, Reege.

Philbin made the announcement during today's show. "Friday, November 18 is my last day," Philbin said, adding, "But don't worry, the show goes on."

Philbin said of his retirement from the show at the time, "There is a time that everything must come to an end for certain people on camera, especially certain old people." The Emmy-winner joked on Tuesday, "Last January I made the announcement that I'll be moving on. But I never gave you an exact date. So I'm pushing it back five years. Just kidding."

While no new co-host has yet been named for Philbin's right-hand woman Kelly Ripa (we here at EW had some suggestions of our own, however), the two discussed finding a replacement. "Kelly will be trying out new co-hosts, just like we did 11 years ago when we found her," Philbin said, kidding that Ripa would be looking for a "new young hot" male co-host.
