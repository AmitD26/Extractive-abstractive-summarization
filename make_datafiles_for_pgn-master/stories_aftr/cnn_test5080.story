(CNN) -- Speculation about the future of American Airlines has been swirling for months. Still, many travelers were stunned Tuesday to learn that the carrier and its parent company have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

CNN airline and aviation correspondent Richard Quest weighed in on some of the basic questions about the airline's decision.

Why has American Airlines decided to make this move?

Richard Quest: They're doing it for one simple reason: The American Airlines cost base is considerably higher than United, Continental, and Delta, which merged with Northwest. Those other airlines did go through Chapter 11 during (past) recessions and they managed to slash their costs.

There's no doubt it is a dramatic development for a company that has several billions of dollars in cash. It has good strong hubs.

If I have a ticket now or for six months from now, should I be worried?

Quest: There is no danger that American Airlines is going to stop flying. Let's be absolutely crystal clear about that.

Horton told me he hopes the Chapter 11 will last less time than the others, the average being 16 months.

Are any changes coming to the airline?

Quest: The people who I think perhaps will be watching and be concerned are American's employees. No changes immediately, but longer term, they can expect to see some significant changes in their benefits and in their conditions of employment.
