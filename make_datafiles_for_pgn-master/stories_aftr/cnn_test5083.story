He is among 15 people who died from Listeria monocytogenes in what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998.

The bacteria was traced to Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms' fields in Granada, Colorado. As of Monday, the outbreak had affected people in 19 states.

Beach and his wife Monette bought the tainted cantaloupe at a Homeland grocery, where the store motto says: "the best is fresh."

Monette heard him struggling to pull himself up off the floor.

She hobbled into the room with her cane and saw her husband of 67 years unable to speak, unable to get up.

One of Beach's six daughters, Brenda Hathaway met her father at the emergency room. Beach told her he didn't want Monette to see him this way.

On the evening of September 1, medical staff tried to intubate Beach but he began hemorrhaging from the mouth and nose, the court documents said. Soon after, he died.

She was told then that her father had tested positive for Listeria.

What you need to know about Listeria

Frederick, meanwhile, glued herself to her computer, determined to learn more about the illness that killed her father.

The Beach family's angst led to a lawsuit filed against Jensen Farms. Frederick said she hopes the lawsuit will help strengthen food safety laws.

"It's a terrible thing to lose someone you love to something that could be prevented," she said. "I pray that it's over. I hope nobody else has to lose a loved one."

Battling the bacteria

In Littleton, Colorado, Jeni Exley's parents, Herbert and Elaine Stevens, were getting ready to celebrate 60 years of marriage on September 8.

They still had a good life together. Despite his age -- 84 -- he felt spry enough to take the dogs out for a walk in their Littleton neighborhood. He let Elaine do most of the grocery shopping and cooking but he could make his own sandwiches for lunch.

How to keep your food safe

In early August, Elaine came home from the nearby King Soopers market with half a Jensen Farms cantaloupe. She didn't buy the whole thing -- it was only the two of them. Besides, she liked to able to see through the cellophane and decide if it was ripe enough.

She and Herbert both ate the lush fruit. Herbert started to feel sick, just like William Beach.

Four days before Beach was rushed to hospital in Oklahama, Stevens couldn't get up from the toilet in Colorado. He had a fever of 103 degrees and felt nauseous.

Elaine called an ambulance which ferried her husband to Littleton Adventist Hospital. Unlike the Beach family, Stevens' daughters learned after a few days that their father was infected with Listeria.

Exley, 55, like Frederick, went online to learn more about the bacteria that had sickened her father. Health officials, after questioning Elaine about what the couple had eaten in the last few weeks, determined that Herbert Stevens was a part of the latest outbreak.

After antibiotic therapy, Stevens was transferred to a nursing home. Exley arrived on her parents anniversary with chocolate milkshakes in hand. But her father wasn't feeling well. He was sent back to the hospital when his condition worsened.

Stevens eventually regained some of his strength. He was sent to a skilled nursing facility to recuperate on September 19, the same day that the Food and Drug Administration announced it had found Listeria monocytogenes in samples of Jensen Farms' Rocky Ford cantaloupes.

He uses a walker now to move around; all his body functions seem affected, Exley said.

"I think it is amazing that he even survived," she said. "I am surprised he is not one of those people who died."

The Stevens are also suing Jensen Farms in hopes of recouping some of their medical costs.
