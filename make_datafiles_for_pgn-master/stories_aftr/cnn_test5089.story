Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai put pressure on Pakistan on Wednesday to help investigate an unprecedented attack on Shiite Muslim worshippers in Kabul a day earlier, saying his country would pursue the probe "with all the power we have."

A militant group based in Pakistan claimed responsibility for the bombing, which killed at least 56 people on Tuesday, the Shiite holy day of Ashura.

"To kill children on Ashura is to be an enemy to humanity. To kill Muslims on Ashura is to be an enemy to Islam," Karzai said, calling the massacre "unique in Afghan history."

"We will follow it very seriously and will definitely pursue it with the government of Pakistan, because it relates to our lives and the lives of these children lying in the hospital," the youngest of whom was a boy one and a half years old, he said.

Four people also were killed in a Tuesday explosion at a roundabout on a busy street in Mazar-e Sharif, the provincial capital of Afghanistan's northern Balkh province, police official Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai said. Another 21 were wounded in that attack.

It was not immediately clear whether the attack in Mazar-e Sharif was linked to the attack in Kabul.

The U.N Security Council condemned both attacks "in the strongest terms" in a statement Wednesday and urged Afghanistan to hold those responsible to justice, as well as expressing its condolences to the victims.

At least 19 people, including women and children, were killed when their bus hit a roadside mine Wednesday, said Daud Ahmadi, a spokesman for the governor of Helmand province.

He said he did not know whether the civilians were the target of the roadside mine planted by the Taliban.

A spokesman for the Afghan Embassy in London said Karzai had been due in London late Tuesday from Germany but was instead flying back to Afghanistan.

Megan Ellis, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Kabul, said Wednesday that an American was among the dead. She added that consular officials were in touch with the family, who would need to consent to the release of further details.

A man identifying himself as a spokesman for Lashkar-e-Jangvi al Almi, a group with links to al Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban, made the claim of responsibility in a call to Radio Mashaal, a Pashto-language station in Pakistan sponsored by the U.S. government.

The group is an offshoot of the powerful Lashkar-e-Jangvi, which has a record of high-profile suicide bombings in Pakistan, including the attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in 2008.

Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. Hussein's death in battle in Karbala, Iraq, in 680 is one of the events that helped create the schism between Sunnis and Shiites, the two main Muslim religious movements. Shiites are a minority presence in Afghanistan, which is predominantly Sunni.
