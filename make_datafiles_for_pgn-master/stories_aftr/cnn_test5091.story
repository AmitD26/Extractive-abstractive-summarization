Members of his political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, and former U.S. diplomat also say the crash raises suspicions of foul play.

The prime minister left a hospital Saturday, a day after his wife, Susan, was killed in the collision, officials said.

The source with the prime minister's party said Tsvangirai will return to Zimbabwe on Wednesday to attend the funeral of his wife.

It comes only weeks after the start of a power-sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival, President Robert Mugabe.

Tsvangirai's political party said Friday that it was too early to tell whether the crash was anything other than an accident.

But on Saturday, MDC members told CNN that Tsvangirai thought the crash was deliberate.

"(A) police escort would have warned oncoming vehicles of a VIP arriving. I think authorities must understand the omission.

"We hope that this omission will be rectified, that the prime minister must be given the protection that ought to be accorded to a prime minister."

Biti said the MDC would launch its own investigation.

Analysts say the crash raises suspicions of foul play. One former U.S. diplomat called for an outside investigation, saying it was not the first time one of Mugabe's political foes had been killed or injured in a car crash.

The MDC reached the agreement with Mugabe in September after months of angry dispute that included violence. More than 200 deaths, mainly opposition supporters, were reported leading up to and after the election.

"I'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure," said Tom McDonald, the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001. "President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it's sort of his M.O., of how they get rid of people they don't like."  Watch more on the fatal crash Â»

"So when I hear that Tsvangirai was in an accident, it gives me pause," McDonald said.

Now an attorney with the Washington law firm Baker Hostetler, he urged a full independent investigation.

"It's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things," he said.
