Beijing (CNN) -- The "heaviest rain in six decades" in the Chinese capital of Beijing has left at least 37 people dead, the state news agency Xinhua reported Sunday.

During the storm, traffic was paralyzed for hours, with drivers and pedestrians stranded throughout the city. Many streets were flooded with water levels sometimes as deep as 13 feet (4 meters).

Thousands of emergency responders were deployed and divers had to be brought in to search for anyone trapped.

Officials said almost 2 million people were affected by the rainstorm and the economic losses have exceeded $1.5 billion.

Drowning is the leading cause of death, taking 25 lives, Xinhua reported. But six people were killed by collapsing houses, five were electrocuted, and one was hit by lightning, the agency reported, citing the municipal government.

The average rainfall Saturday was 6.7 inches, but one suburban district recorded 18 inches, Xinhua said.

Authorities have identified 22 bodies so far, the agency reported.

Many complained that authorities seemed ill-prepared despite heavy rain having been forecast days in advance. Critics said there was no emergency broadcast system deployed, no government shelters and no special hotlines.
