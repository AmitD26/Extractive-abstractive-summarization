(CNN) -- Not in a long time has the pre-Super Bowl chatter been so dominated by one player's body part.

At media day Tuesday, Gronkowski said he wasn't sure if he could play Sunday.

"I don't know yet," Gronkowski said. "I am not really worried yet if I am playing or not. We're going day by day. I am taking new steps every day. I am feeling better every day. That is a positive sign. I want to be out there with the team obviously. "

Gronkowski tallied 17 touchdown catches this season - an NFL record -- and is a match up nightmare for any defense.

The dominating conversation about Gronkowski's status is reminiscent of the lead up to the Super Bowl game in 2005 when then-Eagles wideout Terrell Owens miraculously came back from a severe ankle injury to play in the game.

Seven years later, the Pats are hoping to do it again.

"Gronk is in the training room every day trying to get ready," Brady said. "He wants to be there. He's going to work his butt off to be there."

"Hopefully that ankle hurts a little more than everyone expects it to and he is not as versatile as he has been," Tuck told ESPN. "You talk about the talent that he is, he had probably the best year for a tight end ever."

No matter what the Patriots do on offense, the key for the Giants lies with their defense, pundits say. The Giants beat the Patriots in 2008 Super Bowl, throwing cold water on the Pats' undefeated season.

In that game, the Giant's ferocious defensive line rushed Brady and sacked him five times.

"No one has been able to figure that out all year," said Brady, referring to the Giants' defensive line this year. "They can rush the quarterback really well and hopefully we can slow them down somehow. They are ready to go and ready to take my head off."
