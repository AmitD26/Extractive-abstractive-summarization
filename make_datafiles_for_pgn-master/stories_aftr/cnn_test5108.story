(EW.com) -- Awww. No offense to high school volleyball player Shannon Magrane (I totally just teared up watching her famous baseball dad's proud-papa reaction to her highlight reel), but I'm glad someone went home last night. After Top 12 contestant Jermaine Jones was disqualified on Wednesday, I thought the whole week might be a wash.

Randy dismissed Shannon immediately following her "sing for your life" rehash of "One Sweet Day" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men, but earlier in the episode Ryan Seacrest confirmed that the judges will get to use a "save" in this season's horse race. Any time from now until the Top 5, our steamy "Neighwatch" lifeguards Randy, J. Lo, and Steven can rescue a contestant from the big bad sea of possible elimination.

Remember last year, when the judges used their season 10 save on Casey Abrams two weeks before presumed frontrunner Pia Toscano was eliminated? I can see them holding out on this year's get-out-of-jail-free card unless Jessica Sanchez is in danger.

Hmm, what else? Pretty uneventful show, to be honest. I did appreciate that this week's ridiculous Ford Music Video, which took place in a "haunted house" (Ryan could barely get that out without guffawing), could easily have doubled as an ad for Hi-C's Ecto-Cooler. (Products from a Year Well Before Most of the Idols Were Born.) Way to keep the theme of the week going, anyway.

Oh, I was also pleasantly surprised by Demi Lovato on her single "Give Your Heart a Break." She was just stomping all over that stage, grooving with her guitarists who were very excited to be rocking out on a Demi Lovato song, and pausing at just the right times to bask in the spotlight and dramatically toss around her miles of weave. I thought she sounded great. My vague impressions of Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez had merged over the years into one tiny, sequined, gelatinous blob prior to this. So now that I've confirmed they're two different people, I'm pretty sure I choose this one! Demi truly won my heart with that silver fringed scarf. ("DWTS" premiere in three days, y'all.)

Okay, what are your thoughts on the Top 11 results? Were you surprised that Percy Sledge uses email? Would you award J. Lo's dress a sparkly gold star? It's not like she needs another one!
