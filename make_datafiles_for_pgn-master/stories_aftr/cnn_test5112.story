Buemi will provide back-up for Red Bull's current pairing of double world champion Sebastian Vettel and Australian Mark Webber.

"It's good to remain with Red Bull for another year and have this opportunity with the world championship-winning team," Buemi told the sport's official website.

"I would prefer to be driving at the races of course, but working with Red Bull on the development of their car and providing them with feedback throughout the season is the next best thing."

The 2012 Formula One season will begin with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 18.

Despres won the 184km stage to Fiambala in Argentina by one minute 41 seconds from Coma and now has a 9:51 lead over his fellow-KTM rider.

In the car section, Qatar's defending champion Nasser al-Attiyah lost more than 20 minutes after his Hummer overheated, with Mini driver Krzysztof Holowczyc of Poland winning the stage.

The result means Peterhansel now leads Holowczyc by 4:18 in the standings while al-Attiyah has dropped to eighth place overall, over 50 minutes down on the leader.
