(CNN) -- With frizzy hair still standing to attention, North Korea's Kim Jong-Il drops dead, narrowly missing the nuke button as he slumps face-down onto his desk.

Welcome to the world of Patrick Chappatte -- a cartoonist whose knack for summing up major global events in a few simple brush strokes this week saw him become the first ever non-American to win the Overseas Press Club of America's international cartoonist award.

Such "graphic journalism," says Chappatte, is often the most effective way of telling a story in a digital age where people are bombarded with information from all directions.

"I personally feel the need to report and I feel that cartoons will help us in a world that is overwhelmed with videos and images where we're dealing with so much information every day."

Among the dozen or so cartoons for which Chappatte is being honored is "Ground Zero of the Revolution," a striking example of graphic journalism for which he traveled to Tunisia to record the story of Mohammed Bouazizi, the man whose suicide sparked the Arab Spring uprisings.

Born in Pakistan to a Swiss father and Lebanese mother, Chappatte says he became an international cartoonist because he was an avid reader of newspapers in the numerous countries he grew up in.

Chappatte then landed the IHT job in Geneva just a few days before the attacks of September 11, 2001, an event which tested his ability to "convey the feeling of America and the sense of the moment."

He must have done something right because, as he points out with typical deadpan humor: "They kept me."

"When you look at it and say, that's exactly it! That's the best compliment people can give me."

This is no easy task, particularly when the internet exposes cartoons to global scrutiny, as was the case in 2005 when the Danish newspaper Jyllens-Posten sparked controversy and demonstrations throughout in the Muslim world by printing a cartoon of the prophet Mohammed.

"That was the 9/11 of editorial cartooning," says Chappatte. He says he is wary about causing outrage with his own work.

"The internet is full of possibilities in the language of cartoonists. You can do animated stuff and you can do multimedia stuff -- a whole new range of creativity."
