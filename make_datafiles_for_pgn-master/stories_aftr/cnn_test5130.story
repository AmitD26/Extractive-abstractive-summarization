A look back at key moments in Houston's life, as well as her last days:

August 9, 1963

Houston is born in Newark to gospel singer Cissy Houston. Her cousins include Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick; Houston's godmother was "Queen of Soul" Aretha Franklin. Houston honed her vocal skills as a child at New Hope Baptist Church, where her mother was director of sacred music.

"Whitney's mother and cousins nurtured her passion for gospel music since birth," according to a biography on Houston's website. "As a teenager, Whitney was already singing on the scene in New York."

1983

March 1985

June 1987

Houston's second album, "Whitney," is released and entered the Billboard album charts at No. 1, according to Houston's website. The nine-times-platinum album contains four No. 1 singles and establishes Houston as the only artist ever to have seven consecutive No. 1 hits.

Houston's third album, "I'm Your Baby Tonight," is released, selling some 8 million copies worldwide.

July 18, 1992

Houston marries R&B singer Bobby Brown.

Houston appears with Kevin Costner in "The Bodyguard." The film's soundtrack, featuring Houston's smash hit -- a remake of the Dolly Parton single "I Will Always Love You" -- went 17-times platinum, making it the biggest-selling motion picture soundtrack album in history. "I Will Always Love You" becomes the biggest-selling commercial single in history.

March 4, 1993

Houston gives birth to her daughter with Brown, Bobbi Kristina Brown.

1998

Houston releases "My Love Is Your Love," which earns her a Grammy but does not match the performance of her previous albums, according to Biography.com.

Reports about Houston's struggles with drug addiction, health problems and her rocky marriage with Brown begin to surface. Album sales drop off, and her voice begins to show signs of wear.

2002

2004

At some point, Houston's mother, Cissy Houston, steps in. Houston told Oprah Winfrey in a 2009 interview that her mother arrived on her doorstep with sheriff's officers and a court order for drug intervention.

Houston enters rehab and takes a long hiatus.

Houston and Brown separate. They divorce the following year, and Houston receives sole custody of Bobbi Kristina.

February 8 and 9

February 9

Houston attends a pre-Grammys party to celebrate singer Kelly Price's nominations. At one point, she joins Price on the stage and sings a hoarse rendition of "Jesus Loves Me." (Price said Monday that Houston was not behaving erratically and "I didn't see someone who was high" although she said Houston did drink champagne. Photos of Houston leaving the party appeared to show her sweaty and somewhat disheveled, although Price attributed her "messy" appearance to partygoers' singing and dancing until the wee hours of Friday morning.)

Investigators are aware of Houston's partying at the hotel and other venues the night before her death, a source close to the death investigation told CNN.

February 15

The anti-anxiety medication Xanax was among prescription drugs found in the room, a source close to the death investigation says. Houston's family members and staff confirmed she used the medication, the source says, but investigators don't know whether she took it the day she died. No Valium or other drugs classified as benzodiazepines, or sedatives, were found in the room, according to the source. Medicine and pill bottles found in Houston's hotel room are currently undergoing basic testing, but nothing so far indicates anything criminal occurred, the source says. Officials are trying to speed up toxicology testing.
