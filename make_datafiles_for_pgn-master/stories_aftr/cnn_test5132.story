She was fined 20,000 baht (US$628) and given an eight-month prison sentence -- suspended for a year pending her good behavior. The court cut the original one-year sentence because of her "useful" testimony to the court.

Chiranuch had faced 10 charges under the 2007 Computer Crime Act -- which includes lese-majeste offenses -- for statements posted by others on Prachatai between April and November 2008. She could have faced 20 years in jail.

"The verdict is acceptable but I cannot say I'm totally satisfied as I'm still being convicted," she told CNN by phone after the verdict.

Panel calls for overhaul of royal law

International rights groups such as Human Rights Watch believe the law criminalizes the expression of peaceful opinions.

"Thailand's lese-majeste laws are being overused and abused," said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at HRW.

"The government's assault on internet service providers sends a chilling message to webmasters and internet companies that they either censor other people's content or face severe penalties."

His death provoked outrage among many in Thailand. According to the Post, hundreds of protesters from the red-shirt movement -- generally loyal to ousted Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- placed funeral wreaths, red roses and lilies at the hospital. At the city's criminal court, they tied black ribbons on fences to protest against his jail term.

Various banners condemning lese-majeste, or Section 112 of the Criminal Code, were also flown.
