The setup is sturdy. Rudd and costar Jennifer Aniston play George and Linda, sharp-edged Manhattanites who can barely afford their tiny living quarters -- known as a "micro-loft," in Realtor-speak -- even when George brings home a salary from his hated corporate job.

None is more appealing — and full of crap -- than the alpha male called Seth, played with goofy gusto by Justin Theroux.
