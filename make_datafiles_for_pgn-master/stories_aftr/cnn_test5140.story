British model Lily Cole, now 19, shot to fame in 2003 at the age of 15. She attracted attention for her thin build.

The new rules were proposed after a panel of experts in the UK began investigating health problems among models in the wake of the size zero debate. However, the guidelines fall short of banning stick-thin girls from the catwalk.

The panel said models under 16 were particularly vulnerable. It mentioned the risk of children being sexually exploited when they were made to represent adult women.

"The panel has set out an approach designed to protect vulnerable young workers in an industry which appears to be glamorous but which has hidden risks and that for all practical purposes is largely unregulated and unmonitored," Kingsmill said.

"During our investigations members of the panel became increasingly concerned as we heard more details about the working conditions faced by many models and the vulnerability of young women working in an unregulated and scarcely-monitored work environment.

The panel ruled out weighing all models because it had been ineffective in other countries, PA said. However, they want more information on whether a minimum body mass index (BMI) requirement of 18.5 should be introduced for London Fashion Week models. This approach has already been adopted by Madrid fashion week.

Agencies should arrange medical checks including screening for eating disorders when they first put a model on their books. This should be followed by annual check-ups, the panel said.

Recent controversy over skinny models was sparked in August 2006, when Uruguayan model Luisel Ramos, 22, died of heart failure after not eating for several days.

Her death was followed in November by that of Ana Carolina Reston, a Brazilian model who suffered from anorexia. The debate about the U.S. size zero was caused by celebrities dieting down to the super-thin size. E-mail to a friend
