(CNN) -- Two of South America's most famous clubs reached the semifinals of the Copa Libertadores after late drama in their last-eight matches on Wednesday.

But Silva's late strike sealed a 2-1 aggregate win for Boca and Julio Cesar Falconi's team will play Chile's Universidad de Chile or Paraguay's Libertad in the semifinals. That tie is level at 1-1 ahead of Thursday's second leg at Universidad's Estadio Nacional in Santiago.

Fluminense's coach Abel Braga was disappointed to see his team eliminated after dominating the second leg.

"It was incredible. Our keeper had a very quiet night, they only attacked one time and it was a goal," Braga was quoted as saying on FIFA's official website.

Vasco, based in Rio de Janeiro, went close on several occasions before Corinthians -- one of Brazil's most successful clubs --delighted home supporters with Paulinho's match-winning header after 87 minutes.

Velez hold a slim 1-0 lead heading into the second leg in Sao Paulo.
