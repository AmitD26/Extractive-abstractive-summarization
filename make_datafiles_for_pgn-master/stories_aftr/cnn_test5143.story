Chicago (CNN) -- Jurors deliberated a full day without reaching a verdict Thursday in the trial of a man accused of killing the mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew of entertainer Jennifer Hudson.

William Balfour, Hudson's former brother-in-law, faces charges of first-degree murder, home invasion, residential burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer has argued that there is no forensic evidence linking him to the killings.

Heated closing arguments Wednesday set a tense tone in the courtroom before the judge sent the 12 jurors into deliberations.

After showing autopsy photos of the victims, Bagby pointed toward Balfour.

"It's time to hold him responsible," she said.

"They have failed to prove their case," Balfour's attorney Amy Thompson said Wednesday during her closing argument, her voice rising. "He is on trial for his life."

Thompson argued that police homed in on Balfour rather than conducting a full investigation.

No DNA evidence points to Balfour, said Thompson, who also questioned police work in the case, describing a set of keys that she said surfaced on an evidence list a month after the slayings.

But prosecutors argued that physical and circumstantial evidence links Balfour to the killings and described as "absurd" defense claims that police may have planted evidence or been part of a conspiracy to frame Balfour.

"The circumstantial facts of this case are drowning this guy in guilt," he said.

Bagby said in her closing argument that Balfour had threatened to kill the family of Julia Hudson, Jennifer Hudson's sister.

"If you leave me, I'll kill you. I'll kill your family first. You'll be the last to die," he had said, according to Bagby.

Balfour is accused of fatally shooting Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and the singer's brother, Jason Hudson, 29, in their Chicago home in October 2008. The body of Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found three days later in an abandoned vehicle.

In her closing argument, Bagby said Balfour shot Hudson's mother as she tried to defend herself with a broom.

"He shoots a 57-year-old grandmother in the back. He shoots a 29-year-old man in his sleep. He shoots a 7-year-old twice in the head," McKay told jurors. "The family, the community, the city, the country demand justice."

Hudson, who was on hand through the trial, was called as the prosecution's first witness. She broke down in tears several times on the stand as she recalled her family.

"Where he was, I tried not to be," she said.

In a recent interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, Hudson reflected on the life of her mother.

Recent milestones include penning a memoir detailing her struggles with her weight; being cast as Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie, in an upcoming movie; releasing a new album; and singing a well-received tribute to Whitney Houston at the Grammy Awards in February.
