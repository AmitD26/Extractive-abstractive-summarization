The Obama administration plans to impose fresh sanctions against Iran's petrochemical industry, diplomatic sources familiar with the plans said Friday.

U.S. sanctions already prohibit American companies from doing business with Iran.

The goal of the new measures is to bar foreign companies from doing business with Iran's petrochemical industry by threatening them with being banned from U.S. markets,  the sources said.

On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors issued a resolution expressing "deep and increasing concern about the unresolved issues regarding the Iranian nuclear program." But the U.N. agency's resolution did not threaten action to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.

The Obama administration is facing increased pressure from Congress to turn up the heat on Iran, including sanctioning the Iranian central bank.

U.S. officials have said the administration has been reluctant to cut off the central bank out of concern it could drive  up oil prices and hurt the U.S. economy.

But the diplomatic sources said the U.S. has discussed some possible sanctions on the bank by limiting some financial transactions, but not cutting it off completely.
