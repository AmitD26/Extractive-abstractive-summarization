(CNN) -- Third seed Roger Federer has crashed out of the Rogers Cup in Montreal, after losing 7-6 4-6 6-1 to Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Thursday.

Tsonga's triumph on Thursday was his third career win over Federer, and he was pleased with his level of performance in the match.

"[This] is the match I played best," said Tsonga reflecting on his previous encounters with Federer. "I really played good tonight. I was opportunistic. I didn't miss any opportunities I had. I was able to break before he did. I'm very happy the way I won this match."

Eighth seed Almagro advanced courtesy of a straight-sets 7-6 6-3 victory against Tsonga's compatriot Richard Gasquet.

Monfils, seeded fifth, battled back from one-set down to overcome Djokovic's Davis Cup teammate Viktor Troicki.

The Frenchman Monfils saved three match points on his way to a 3-6 7-6 7-6 win.

American number one Mardy Fish beat Ernests Gulbis 4-6 6-3 6-4 to set up a match with Stanislas Wawrinka in the next round, who defeated South African Kevin Anderson.

Seventh seed Tomas Berdych is also safely through after dispatching of Croat Ivo Karlovic 6-3 7-6 (7-2).

The final round of 16 match saw Janko Tipsarevic defeat Rafael Nadal's conqueror Ivan Dodig 6-1 6-4.
