(CNN) -- The Russian Football Union (RFU) has appointed Fabio Capello as the new national team manager. The former England coach will be hoping to revive the fortunes of a promising Russian squad after a disappointing Euro 2012, where they crashed out at the group stages.

Capello is expected in the Russian capital on Wednesday or Thursday.

Capello told the Italian news agency ANSA that he was "happy and proud" to be taking charge of the Russian national team.

"I'll be happy if my work with the Russian team will go the right way. The cooperation with this team is a great challenge for me as Russia is a great country."

World Soccer Magazine's executive editor Keir Radnedge told CNN the Russian national team "wanted international pedigree, they felt this was important."

"They felt he qualified England for two major tournaments and he got them through the group stages. He's now got the international tournament pedigree he didn't have before he got the England job."

"There has been talk that if he gets them through the next two years then he could go on to the hosting in Russia. It is important for the Russians to build their own kudos on the world stage. They've gone to so many tournaments and started like world beaters and really fizzled out halfway along the course."

Capello's first game in charge will be against Northern Ireland on September 7 when Russia begin their campaign to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
