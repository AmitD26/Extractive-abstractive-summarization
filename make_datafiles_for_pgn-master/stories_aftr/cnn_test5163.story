Australia also has a shock jock commercial radio broadcaster and his name is Alan Belford Jones. His dislike of the prime minister is as legendary as his typically adoring, right-wing retiree listeners are loyal.

The two have been involved in an almighty collision that is proving commercially and politically disastrous for Jones and a likely polling gift for Gillard.

If not her hair, then her distinctive drawl, physical attributes, and dress style have attracted negative comment in mainstream press and on social media, along with her de facto relationship with Tim Mathieson, a former hairdresser who is now in real estate.

Having ruled the airwaves for more than two decades with a very large, if aging audience, Jones has enraged and offended much of Australia. He took aim at the most tender and raw of emotions: the prime minister's palpable grief at the recent death of her beloved father, John Gillard, after a long illness.

"The old man died a few weeks ago of shame," Jones told a gathering of the Sydney University Young Liberals a week ago.

Jones has led several anti-carbon tax rallies and he has said that the prime minister should be better known as Ju-LIAR. He has suggested the guillotine be brought back to deal with her and that she be thrown to the sea in a chaff bag. Later he claimed that Gillard, along with a handful of other female political leaders, was "destroying the joint."

Jones claims his attacks on Gillard are squarely aimed at her policies, but some commentators, and Gillard herself, suspect that his barbs have more to do with her gender. His claim that Gillard's father died of shame was the last straw for campaigners on social media, many companies that advertise on Jones' show and some regional radio stations that buy his daily show.

Condemnation from the prime minister's Labor Party was swift. The leader of the opposition Liberal-National Party Coalition, Tony Abbott, a staunch friend of Jones, issued a brief statement, saying "Alan's remarks regarding the PM were completely out of line." "It's good that he's recognized this and apologized for them," he added.

Abbott now faces intense political pressure to go further and prevent Jones from attending any Liberal Party functions. It has been a difficult few weeks for the Coalition leader who, just a few weeks ago, was riding high in the polls. He has battled a perception that he has difficulty relating to women. He stands accused of being a misogynist himself over an alleged incident 30 years ago in which he's alleged to have punched the wall behind a female candidate after she won a student council election. Abbott denies the incident ever happened.

What impact the Jones affair will have on his polling is yet to be seen. While many commentators believe the Gillard's decision not to speak with Jones, on or off air, could result in a lift in the polls, others think if her cabinet supporters protest too loudly, the gains will be lost.

A reader poll in one newspaper showed an overwhelming desire for Jones' employer, the Macquarie Media Network, to sack him. And, at the time of writing, more than 100,000 people had signed an online petition calling for his dismissal.

Commentators say that it's unlikely he'll go. Jones is the company's fourth largest shareholder and as stockbroker Roger Coleman told the Crikey website: "His key listeners are over 55, they are right wing. They agree with him that Julia Gillard is a bitch and witch. There is no mismatch between him and his listeners."

Although the advertisers will likely return to the country's highest rating broadcaster, they might at the very least have cause to question Jones' dictum that it is women who are "destroying the joint." Gillard may prove the polls wrong too and end up running the joint for another three years after the 2013 election.
