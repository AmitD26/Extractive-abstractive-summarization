That's because in the world of political theater, nobody likes a ham or a know-it-all, said Melissa Wade, a debate professor at Emory University.

So Romney should keep that whiteboard full of facts and figures under wraps. And Obama should keep the lecturing to a minimum.

"It's the generation of Twitter and Facebook and efficient language choices are persuasive," Wade said.

Both candidates are considered skilled debaters -- Romney's campaign called Obama a "universally acclaimed public speaker," and Romney was lauded for his performance during the Republican presidential primary debates. However, there's a lot more to effective debating than clever rhetoric.

10 questions you would ask at the presidential debate

Delivery, tone and body language -- almost as much as substance -- convey a lot to would-be voters, political experts say.

Over the next three weeks, voters will have plenty of opportunities to watch the political posturing unfold. Wednesday night's debate in Denver is the first of three between the president and Romney.

The first debate focuses on domestic policy, so exchanges are bound to be lively, debate experts say.

Also, "Look for inconsistencies ... things they have or have not said before," he said.

Vice President Joe Biden and Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, will face off once on foreign policy matters. And like their top-of-the-ticket counterparts, the veep candidates also have some habits to watch out for.

According to an ABC News/Washington Post national poll released Monday, 55% of likely voters say they think the president will win the debate, with 31% saying the former Massachusetts governor will be victorious. The findings on this question from the new survey are in line with a CNN/ORC International poll conducted right after the Democratic Convention last month, where likely voters predicted by 59% to 34% that Obama was more likely than Romney to prevail in the October showdowns.

Romney debate challenge: High stakes, lowered expectations

However, there's still plenty of room for surprises.

"The mistakes the presidential candidates have made over the years are numerous. Poor body language has been a common blunder. As much as candidates focus on perfecting the substance of what they say before the cameras, a large number of Americans are really most interested to see how they say it," CNN contributor and history professor Julian Zelizer wrote for CNN.

Despite weeks of preparation and practice with debate sparring partners, candidates often revert to nervous tics under the harsh glare of spotlights. During a 2008 debate, Sen. John McCain paced on stage; in 1992, President George H.W. Bush glanced at his watch; and in 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon was sweaty and cast furtive glances.

Both Obama and Romney have similar habits -- "tells" that signal that they're nervous.

"Romney is more aggressive, he talks with his hands more and is more animated. That's not a good thing," Wade said, adding that at times Romney seems irritated when pressed. "He's a smart man ... but because he is not fully consistent in his message, it shows in his face."

"The best thing he could do is shove those hands in his pocket," she said. "Even if he were to put one hand in the pocket it would calm ... his body and face down."

Why debate is crucial for Obama, too

The town hall format -- such as the one scheduled for October 16 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York -- is Obama's nemesis. It offers a looser, more classroom-like setting, one in which the former law school lecturer tends to slip into the role of an academic.

Getting ready for Wednesday's showdown

But there's also a psychological disadvantage to this, said SIU's Graham.

"When seated, the candidates become less aggressive," he said.

Even things like height differences alter perception and the types of gestures a candidate should use, Wade said.

"Most of the presidential primary debates were the standard format of the line of humans behind lecterns. It generates some power dynamics in size difference," she added. "We associate height with power. It's a subtle stereotype that goes on."

At 6-foot-1 and 6-foot-2 respectively, Obama and Romney are on an even footing.
