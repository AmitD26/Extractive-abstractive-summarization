(CNN) -- Delta Air Lines has pre-emptively canceled approximately 500 Christmas Day flights, a company spokesman said Friday, as it and other U.S. airlines work to get ahead of a storm that's threatening the East Coast.

Delta also has joined Continental, United, American and AirTran in waiving penalties for travelers who have to reschedule their trips over the weekend.

The mid-Atlantic and Northeast could see combinations of rain, sleet and snow, with the heaviest amounts of precipitation in highest elevations, CNN meteorologists said. Still, forecasters on Friday noted considerable uncertainty as to the shape, the direction and the strength of the system.

In parts of West Virginia, light snow starting Friday night was expected  to give way to a "prolonged snow shower event" on Saturday night into  Monday, the weather service said. Two to five inches could fall every 12-hour period in  mountainous areas.

The New York metropolitan area has a 40 percent chance of precipitation, which was expected to start after noon and fall as snow. While the accumulation there was expected to be fairly minimal, the weather service noted that a shift in the storm's track could mean "significant wind-driven snowfall to the entire region."

In addition, winds could gust as strong as 50 mph for eastern Connecticut and New York's Long Island.

United Continental Holdings Inc., parent company of United and Continental airlines, said that "customers scheduled on flights to, from or through the impacted areas may reschedule their itinerary with a one-time date or time change, and the change fees will be waived."

Mike Trevino, a United Airlines representative, confirmed that United will issue a waiver for customers traveling Saturday through Monday to areas affected by weather.

"Customers will not be charged a change of ticket fee. No flights have been canceled in advance of the storm," he said.

Delta is offering customers whose flight plans may be affected by winter weather across the Southeast and East "the ability to make one-time changes to their travels schedules without fees. Delta's weather advisory encourages customers to consider postponing or rerouting their travel to avoid possible inconvenience from expected flight delays."

The cities are Atlanta, for travel booked for Saturday and Sunday; and Baltimore, Boston, Newark, New York and Washington for travel booked for Sunday and Monday.

AirTran is also waiving penalties for passengers traveling to and from Atlanta from 2 p.m. Saturday to noon Sunday, and on Sunday and Monday for some cities "as long as travel is completed within three days from the date of the original scheduled departure date or five days after the original scheduled departure date, based on space availability, without fees or fare adjustments."

The locations are Allentown, Pennsylvania; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Baltimore; Boston; Buffalo, New York; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; New York City; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Portland, Maine; Richmond, Virginia; Rochester, New York; Washington; and White Plains, New York.
