(CNN) -- A U.S. soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan villagers in a shooting rampage could face the death penalty if he is found guilty in a court-martial.

"That's how much we seem to matter to the prosecutors and the general," quipped Browne.

"We understand that decision, but we think it's totally irresponsible of the government and the Army," Bales' lawyer said.

Bales' wife, Karilyn, has called the accusations "completely out of character of the man I know and admire."

In a statement released Wednesday, she wrote, "I no longer know if a fair trial for Bob is possible, but it very much is my hope and I will have faith."

She and their children visit Bales every weekend, and "for a few hours I can see and feel the love that flows" between them, she added.

Afghan authorities have pushed for swift action.

"He committed a mass killing crime, and we would like the court in the United States to implement justice and punish him according to the crime," Ahmad Zia Syamak, a spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai, told CNN last month.

But Browne said prosecutors may regret hastily moving the case forward.
