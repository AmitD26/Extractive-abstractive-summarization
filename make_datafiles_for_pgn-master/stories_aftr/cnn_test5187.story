(CNN) -- Machinery problems at a drug manufacturing plant prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to warn patients of a possible mix-up affecting various prescription pain medications and over-the-counter drugs.

The FDA is advising patients who use certain prescription medications produced by Endo Pharmaceuticals to visually inspect their pills. And consumers who have select bottles of Excedrin, Bufferin, NoDoz and Gas-X, produced by Novartis, are being told to discard or return the products in a voluntary recall that started Sunday.

"Due to problems that occurred when these products were packaged and labeled at the site, it's possible that tablets from one product may have been retained in the packaging machinery and then may have carried over into the packaging of another product," said Dr. Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products, Office of New Drugs, Center for Drug Evaluation of Research for the FDA.

The prescription opioids could have ended up in the bottle of another prescription drug or over-the-counter products, although "the risk of pills ending up in the wrong bottle is a rare event," according to the FDA.

There have been no reports of adverse events due to this problem, Cox said.

The products listed there: Opana ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride) extended-release tablets CII; Opana (oxymorphone hydrochloride) tablets CII; oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets CII; Percocet (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen USP) tablets CII; Percodan (oxycodone hydrochloride and aspirin, USP) tablets CII; Endocet (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen USP) tablets CII; Endodan (oxycodone hydrochloride and aspirin, USP) tablets CII; Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets CII; and Zydone (hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen tablets, USP) CIII.

Patients who have questions should contact Endo Pharmaceuticals or their doctors, he advised.

"The likelihood of finding a wrong pill in an opioid pain medication is low," he said. "Patients should not be alarmed. These steps we're recommending are additional steps we are recommending to further reduce an already low likelihood of medication mix-up."

"We are not aware of any patient having experienced a confirmed product mix-up and there have been no adverse events attributable to a product mix-up. We believe the likelihood of product mix-up reaching a patient is remote," according to the company.

The over-the-counter items involved in the Novartis recall include Excedrin and NoDoz products with expiration dates of December 20, 2014, or earlier, as well as Bufferin and Gas-X products with December 20, 2013, or earlier expiration dates.

Novartis had suspended operations at, and shipments from, the Lincoln, Nebraska, facility. The company said this was done "to accelerate maintenance" and make other improvements, adding that it currently "is not possible" to determine when the plant will reopen.
