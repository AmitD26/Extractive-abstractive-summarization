Travelers can tuck into skirt steak tacos at Bonfire, a Todd English restaurant in Terminal B of Boston's Logan International Airport.

RESTAURANTS

Boston: Bonfire, Logan International Airport

Todd English continues to expand his empire with the third outpost of his South American-inspired steak house, Bonfire, at Terminal B. Grilled chicharrones (crispy pork in chimichurri sauce) and skirt steak topped with chipotle aioli and avocado crema are standouts. bonfiresteakhouse.com.

London: Plane Restaurant, Heathrow Airport

Gordon Ramsay's first airport restaurant opens this month in Terminal 5. In addition to a Michelin star-worthy menu (braised pork cheeks with honey and cloves and brioche French toast with treacle-cured bacon in the mornings), travelers can opt for special "picnics"-to-go. baa.com.

A cross between In-N-Out Burger and McDonald's, Max is a family-run Swedish fast-food chain that dates back to 1968. Now it has brought its brand of trans-fat-free, made-to-order Swedish burgers and crispy fries to the capital's airport (Terminal 4). For those trying to stay fit while on the road, there's the Delifresh menu, including a chicken burger served with fresh fruit salad. max.se.

BARS

Denmark has experienced an artisanal beer resurgence in the last few years with the opening of 25 new microbreweries. Ushering in a new era is the Nørrebro Bryghus, whose owner Anders Kissmeyer recently opened a branch between terminals 2 and 3 (before security). Always on tap: four different Danish seasonal, handcrafted beers served at its stainless-steel bar. cph.dk.

New York: Vino Volo, JFK

This contemporary wine bar recently launched a fifth airport location at American Airlines' Terminal 8. The dimly lit, cream- and brown-tinged venue stocks bottles from around the world, including little-known vintages from the Hudson River Valley. vinovolo.com.

Singapore: Post Bar, Changi Airport

Taking design cues from its namesake older sibling in the Fullerton Hotel, the just-opened Post Bar in Terminal 3 mixes traditional and modern design elements (retro Artichoke lamps; an illuminated honey-onyx bar). The best part? It's open 24 hours a day. fullertonhotel.com.

When it came to designing new lounges for Geneva Airport, Swiss Air stuck to what it knows best -- being Swiss. More than 10 tons of limestone from the Jura Mountains were used in the construction, the menu consists of national dishes such as älplermakkaroni (Alpine-style macaroni-and-cheese), and the chocolate leather chairs and sofas were produced by Vitra (though designed by Londoner Jasper Morrison). swiss.com.

Los Angeles: Oneworld, LAX

San Francisco-based Gensler Architects (currently at work on JFK's new JetBlue terminal) have created a 15,000-square-foot eco-lounge that evokes a contemporary California-cool vibe, with sea grass-resin panels, chiseled limestone walls, B&B Italia chairs and walnut-wood partitions. First- and business-class passengers can freshen up in one of nine shower suites. lawa.org/lax.

Passengers at the new Lufthansa first-class lounge in Munich can expect red-carpet treatment: in-lounge security and separate passport control (no long lines), and a chauffeured Mercedes-Benz S-Class or Porsche Cayenne to take travelers directly to their aircraft. The two-story, 9,000-square-foot lounge also includes a white-marble and oak bathroom with three showers, a Jacuzzi and Dr. Hauschka products. lufthansa.com.

Among the 30-plus new shops at Terminal 5 will be an 11,000-square-foot Harrods. The outpost of this shopping institution plans to stock high-end labels such as Anya Hindmarch, Pucci and Luella when it opens in March. baa.com.

SPAS

Hong Kong: OM Spa, Hong Kong International Airport

British Airways passengers at Terminal 5 need just 15 minutes to be fully reinvigorated. London-based Elemis has partnered with British Airways at their new lounges (or, as BA calls them, "galleries"). The four signature treatments (including a scalp, hand and foot massage, and a facial) start with a lime-infused compress and take place in a state-of-the-art heated massage chair. elemis.com.
