Six people, including a minor and a bus driver, have been arrested in connection with the rape that occurred in New Delhi this month.

Throngs of people have protested for days, demanding more protection for women and punishment for those behind the assault.

The woman was airlifted to Singapore earlier this week after she was treated for injuries in a New Delhi hospital.

Singapore doctors said she died "peacefully" early Saturday, surrounded by her family and Indian embassy officials.

The victim's body was returned to India, where it was cremated Sunday in a private funeral, Home Ministry spokesman K.S. Dhatwalia said.

"Damini" is also a 1993 Bollywood film whose lead female character fights for a housemaid, a victim of sexual assault.

The Times of India calls her Nirbhaya, which means "fearless."

Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, wrote on Twitter, "To our friends in India: we share your outrage over an act of unimaginable cruelty against one of our sisters. RIP Nirbhaya."

Attackers assaulted the woman and her male companion on a bus December 16, robbing them of their belongings before dumping them at the side of a road, police said.

The male companion was eventually discharged from a hospital.

Last week, police said the woman recovered enough to give a statement to a magistrate from her hospital bed. But she had more surgery to wash out infection in her abdomen, her doctors said.

The death spurred an outpouring of sadness and calls for action to ensure change and punishment of her rapists.

Fearing massive protests following the death, police tightened security in the capital and barricaded some sites of previous rallies.

Authorities said demonstrations are only allowed at Jantar Mantar observatory and the Ram Lila grounds.

Police banned protests in Raisina Hills and closed roads leading to the area, fearing a possible repeat of the furious, large-scale demonstrations that occurred last weekend. Ten metro stations also were ordered closed, authorities said.

Additional protests were planned Sunday in several cities, activists told CNN affiliate IBN.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered his "deepest condolences."

Reported rape cases in India -- where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- have increased drastically over the past four decades, from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures.

New Delhi alone had 572 rapes reported last year and more than 600 in 2012.

"The government needs to act now to prevent sexual assault, aggressively investigate and prosecute perpetrators, and ensure the dignified treatment of survivors," said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for the organization.

The Indian government announced plans Thursday to "name and shame" convicted rapists by posting their names, images and addresses on official websites, according to the Times of India.

CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report from Atlanta.
