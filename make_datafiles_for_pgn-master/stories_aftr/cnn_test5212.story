(CNN) -- The United Nations is asking countries and donors around the world to send urgent aid to the victims of the flooding in Pakistan, one-fifth of which is now under water.

That's part of the reason, said Alex Wynter of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

In Haiti, about 3 million lives were disrupted and more than 200,000 people died in the massive January earthquake.

But the enormous scale of Pakistan's tragedy has been hard to grasp.

The death toll has not been nearly as high as it was in those previous disasters. Ironically, that may be a reason why aid has been slow to come in.

"The public is not as shocked by a disaster if the death toll is lower, so we are trying to really push this emergency into the headlines so people understand the enormity of it," said Maurizio Giuliano, spokesman for OCHA in Pakistan.

"The slow onset of the emergency meant that nobody knew the real scale at the beginning. It is a picture which is still evolving," he said.

The United Nations asked for $460 million to cover six million Pakistanis over the next three months, but has only raised one-third of that so far.

In Haiti, the United Nations received $286 million in just three days. Its request for $1.2 billion for three million Haitians over a six-month period was fulfilled within a couple of weeks, Reader said.

Farzana Shaikh, an expert on Pakistan for the London-based Chatham House think-tank, blamed the country's reputation on the international stage for the low donor turnout. Many people associate Pakistan with Islamic militancy.

"Pakistan is seen to have done the international community the disservice of aiding and abetting terrorism, and this perception has almost certainly influenced people's willingness to dig deep into their pockets," Shaikh said.

There are also perceptions that Pakistan is mired in corruption and that money donated in the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake disappeared into a black hole.

"Unless Pakistan can show that it can be transparent, the international community will be wary of pumping in the kind of money that it needs at the moment," Shaikh said. "In the meantime, many more thousands of people in Pakistan will die as a result of these floods."

Haiti was smaller -- and closer to America. Americans felt a moral responsibility to help and dug deep into their pockets. What was Haiti's gain has been Pakistan's loss, said Waleed Rauf, country director in Pakistan for the humanitarian agency CARE.

He called it Haiti donor fatigue. In the middle of a recession, to boot.

He urged people to think of it this way: Take the effects of Hurricane Katrina in the four coastal states and multiply the misery. Over and over again.
