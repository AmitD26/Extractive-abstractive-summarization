Authorities started transporting ballot boxes from polling stations around the country to the main tally center in Tripoli, said Nuri Khalifa Al-Abbar, chairman of Libya's High National Election Commission. Tallying began at polling centers Saturday night.

Some preliminary results could be announced Sunday or Monday, he said, according to the state-run LANA news agency.

Libyans turn out big in historic election

Celebrations in Tripoli began Saturday and continued overnight after the parliamentary vote, which many saw as the African nation's first steps to building a free and democratic nation.

The city's main square -- once called Green Square for Gadhafi's political philosophy but now known as Martyr's Square for all those who fell in last year's revolution -- became a focal point for the celebrations, with cars packing the square and surrounding streets.

Families and young men were driving, waving flags and honking horns, many to the tune of the revolutionary chant "raise your head up high, you are a free Libyan."

The last time Libya held an election was almost half a century ago and for many people, the act of casting a ballot was novel after 42 years of Gadhafi's autocratic rule.

United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated the Libyan people on the election and also hailed the electoral staff for "well-conducted and transparent" polling.

More than 3,500 candidates stood in the election for a 200-seat national assembly. The winners are expected to be announced by the end of next week.

More than 13,000 soldiers were on the streets Saturday, but not all went smoothly.

In the eastern city of Ajdabiya, five polling centers opened but four others on the outskirts did not.

Friday, anti-aircraft fire hit a Libyan air force helicopter transporting ballot boxes from the eastern city of Benghazi to nearby areas, the Interior Ministry said. One person was killed. It was unclear who was behind the attack.

This was one of several anti-election incidents staged by Libyans in the east who see an unequal distribution of seats in the national assembly. The 200 seats are allocated by population, reserving 100 for the western Tripolitania, 60 for Cyrenaica in the east, and 40 for the south.

The parliamentary vote is a litmus test for post-Gadhafi Libya. The new national assembly will be tasked with appointing a transitional government and crafting a constitution.
