(CNN) -- F1 history will be made in Friday's first practice at the Italian Grand Prix when Ma Qing Hua takes to the Monza track for HRT.

Qing Hua will become the first Chinese driver to compete in an official F1 competition when he takes over from India's Narain Karthikeyan for the session.

"I'm excited, but also calm about it because I've been training hard in the past months to be prepared when the opportunity presented itself."

Qing Hua acquired his FIA super license, which allows him to compete in F1, during a test earlier this year at Silverstone.

He has previously competed in Formula Renault, A1 Grand Prix and Formula Three as well as winning last year's Chinese Touring Car Championship.

"Without a doubt, this is a very important step which comes with great responsibility, but we consider he's prepared to take it on."
