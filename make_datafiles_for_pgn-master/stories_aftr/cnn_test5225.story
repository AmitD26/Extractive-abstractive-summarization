(CNN) -- Dramatic satellite images show large deposits of sediment in coastal Louisiana, the receiving end of the massive flooding on the Mississippi River.

The sediment gush has a down and up side in region known for its seafood and delicate wetlands, a federal official said Friday.

"We live in historic times," said Phil Turnipseed, director of the USGS's National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette, Louisiana.

Wetland seasonal flooding "is essential to the health of coastal wetland ecosystems," according to the USGS. Extreme flooding that has occurred this year has delivered high amounts of sediment and nutrients.

The sediment will hurt the oyster harvest in the brackish waters of Lake Pontchartrain, essentially a bay, Turnipseed told CNN.

Flooding in the Atchafalaya basin has not been as severe as expected after officials opened the Morganza Spillway, but Turnipseed acknowledged it has affected residents.

Across Louisiana, officials are still coping with the crisis.

For the Atchafalaya wetlands, the flooding is a plus because it will create desperately needed land, Turnipseed said.

"If the marsh grasses could sing, they would be singing praises," the official said.

Officials are undergoing the laborious of measuring and analyzing the sediment.

Federal authorities, meanwhile, are in the process of closing portions of the Morganza Spillway as the swollen Mississippi River recedes. The spillway was opened May 14 to prevent the Mississippi from flooding New Orleans and Baton Rouge.

The Corps of Engineers has closed five of 12 bays, public affairs specialist Ricky Boyett told CNN on Friday afternoon.

The Corps said much as 1.2 million gallons (172,000 cubic feet) per second had been pouring through the spillway, which diverted water through the Atchafalaya basin, but that number was down to 120,000 cubic feet per second later in the week.

The high water has caused some flooding down the Atchafalaya. But the water levels "continue to be lower than anticipated" throughout the basin, Corps spokesman Ken Holder said this week.

The river remained about five feet above flood stage Friday afternoon at Bayou Sorrel and about six feet over flood stage at Morgan City, on the approaches to the Gulf. But it was more than five feet lower at the town of Krotz Springs and about two feet below flood stage at Butte LaRose, about 20 miles south of the spillway.
