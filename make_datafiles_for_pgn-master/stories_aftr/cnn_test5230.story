(Ars Technica) -- After months of rumor roundups and speculation, Apple's iPad mini has finally been announced—and the 7-inch tablet market has just heated up. This growing product category now has more to offer than Android devices with differing UI skins and varying components—or that BlackBerry PlayBook that's not selling too hot.

To help you out, we've put together this roundup of 7-inch tablets that are slated to arrive soon or are already available for purchase. If you're the "TL;DR" type, scroll down to the bottom and check out the comparison chart for a quick cheat sheet.

Google Nexus 7

Kindle Fire HD

Nook HD

Acer Iconia Tab A110

Acer isn't new to the tablet game. Its Iconia Tab series includes the 10.1-inch A500 and A700 tablets, but the A110 marks the company's second foray into the 7-inch product category. The A110 will come with a Tegra 3 processor and run Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, though it will be limited to a 1024×600 display—a major fumble in a tablet world overrun by competing devices with higher resolution displays. It also features a microSD expansion slot and micro-HDMI, but for $229—one of the more costly of the 7-inch tablets in this roundup—the A110 will need to offer a lot more than expandable storage to stay a player in the game.

iPad Mini

It comes in different flavors (16GB for $329, 32GB for $429, and 64GB for $519), so onboard storage isn't an issue, and you can purchase an LTE-capable model for $130 more—a feature that a majority of the tablets featured in this round-up do not offer. But the $329 base price is significantly higher than the competition, and the 1024x768 display resolution isn't much better than the Acer Iconia and pales in comparison to that of the Nook HD's 1440x900 and the 1280x800 Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HD.
