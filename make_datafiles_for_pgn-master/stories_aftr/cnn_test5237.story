Goals from Gonzalo Higuain, Mesut Ozil and Cristiano Ronaldo wrapped up the clinching victory for Jose Mourinho's men at San Mames.

Mourinho has now won league titles in Portugal with Porto, England with Chelsea, Italy with Inter and Spain with Real, who broke Barcelona's three-year La Liga reign.

"This one has been the toughest. I've won seven league titles overall and I know what it feels like," Mourinho told the club's website.

Argentina's three-time world player of the year now has 68 goals in 2011-12, going past the mark Germany legend Muller set in 1972-73 for Bayern Munich.

It took Messi's tally in La Liga to 46, two more than Ronaldo, but his efforts have proved in vain.

But Argentina striker Higuain settled nerves with a fine strike before Ronaldo played in Ozil for a second to make it 2-0 at halftime.

Early in the second half the Portugal star netted his 44th in the league this season with a close-range header, and Bilbao's last hopes of salvaging something from the game ended when Javi Martinez was sent off for a second yellow card.

At the finish Mourinho was hoisted high by his players as they celebrated the club's first championship since 2008.

"We have to celebrate this championship. We have to continue working after tomorrow because next season will also be tough and we have games to play still in this campaign," the 49-year-old said.

"This team deserves even more emotion and affection, and I expect the Bernabeu to give it to them in our match against Mallorca."

In Serie A, Juventus' lead was cut to a single point after being held to a 1-1 draw by 10-man Lecce.

Sulley Muntari put Milan ahead in the San Siro and Robinho sealed a vital victory in injury time.

In other action, Inter Milan's Champions League chances receded with a 3-1 loss at Parma which left the 2010 European titleholders three points behind Napoli and Udinese in the race for third place.
