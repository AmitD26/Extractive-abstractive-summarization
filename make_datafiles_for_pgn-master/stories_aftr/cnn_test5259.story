(CNN) -- Now, this is a weird one.

On Wednesday, Manti Te'o was a well-liked college football star. A day later, he was the butt of the latest Internet fad -- posting pictures of yourself with your arm around an imaginary girlfriend.

They call it "Te'oing."

Notre Dame said Te'o was the victim of an "elaborate hoax."

Meanwhile, the story became overnight social media sensation, spawning a seemingly endless discussion of the whys and hows of the baffling case.

And while none of those commenters claimed to have any inside knowledge, the Heisman Trophy was front and center in many of those theories.

"Manti Teo faked having a girlfriend for Heisman Votes!!!!!" tweeted Cliff Harris, one of many outraged fans to voice the sentiment.

Others said such a plan would need years of impractical planning.

"He'd also have to have known that he would have played really well the exact game that she "died." He'd also have to be (unfazed) by it all. He'd also have to have the ability to lie straight-faced. I just don't think he is that smart or sneaky."

Asked to comment on the echo chamber online, George said, "I can't believe that it could be."

He added, "If it turns out that this was done for recognition and to get publicity for the Heisman, that would be despicable, deplorable."

The Heisman is a carefully choreographed mating dance.

Even before a season starts, universities erect billboards and create media strategies to announce to the world that they have an athlete worthy of the game's most prestigious trophy.

Timeline: How the story unfolded

And Te'o's heart-wrenching tale of determination in the face of two tragedies -- the death of his grandmother and his girlfriend within hours -- had all the elements.

It reached its apex on September 15 when he led the Fighting Irish to a 20-3 thrashing of Michigan State. He credited the deaths in propelling him in the game in which he had 12 tackles, the most he had all season.

Sports fans lapped it up. He was a hero with a halo.

Now, he's the butt of jokes and the center of swirling questions about whether he or someone else is behind the hoax.

Opinion: Does Te'o story make you laugh or cry?

Deadspin said it had traced the hoax to a former classmate of the woman whose face appears in the Twitter profile of Te'o's alleged girlfriend.

The woman, according to Deadspin, had no knowledge of the hoax but said she recalled the classmate asking her to send him photos of herself similar to those used in the profile.

However, Te'o tried to clear up some of the speculation with a statement Wednesday.

"This is incredibly embarrassing to talk about, but over several months I developed an emotional relationship with a woman I met online," he said. "We maintained what I thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone, and I grew to care deeply about her.

"It doesn't add up. Obviously the explanation, it bears further explanation," Haugh said.

"I think you want to hear from Manti Te'o himself beyond the statement. Because if he is truly a victim of a cruel hoax, as Notre Dame put it, then he has nothing to hide."
