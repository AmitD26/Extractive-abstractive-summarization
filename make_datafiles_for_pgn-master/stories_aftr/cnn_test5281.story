(CNN) -- An eastern Pennsylvania police chief who went on profanity-laced video rants against those who disagreed with him on gun laws has been suspended for 30 days without pay.

The punishment wasn't for his diatribe though.

Thousands of gun-rights activists descended on the town of 750 for the meeting, openly sporting firearms, CNN affiliate WPMT reported.

Then, he added in all uppercase letters: "HEY BOXER, MALLOY , HANNON, YOU'RE COWARDS, YOU'RE HACKS, YOU PRETEND TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION,YOU SICKEN ME !"

For her part, Mayor Hannon said the police chief has her backing.

They went viral, generating a heated online debate that appeared to gain renewed traction last month when he posted a backhanded apology.

In the videos, Kessler rails against liberals for attempting to curb gun rights and Secretary of State John Kerry over his support of a recent U.N. arms treaty. At one point in the video, he dares Kerry to come and take his guns.

Kessler has been the town's police chief for 14 years "without a mark against him," Hennon said.

Kessler, an outspoken gun rights advocate, has a history of making provocative statements. He has been featured in a number of online videos discussing his views, given numerous interviews and helped organize gun rights rallies.

The police chief also has claimed in a number of interviews to be the founder of the Constitutional Security Force, a gun rights advocacy group. In the video, Kessler wears a T-shirt with CSF emblazoned on it.

On the CSF Web page, Kessler is identified as the group's president and is featured in his Gilberton police uniform.

The latest videos have been picked up and copied on YouTube, with titles such as "America's scariest police chief" and "Patriot police chief."
