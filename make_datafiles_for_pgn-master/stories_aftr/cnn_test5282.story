(CNN) -- "It's just interesting how sometimes you cross paths with people in your life," reflected Katharine McPhee in a 2012 interview with CNN. The words continue to ring true for the actress and "American Idol" alumna.

Over the past two years, McPhee has been working with the nonprofit organization, Malaria No More, to save the lives of children half a world away. It all started when a chance connection brought McPhee from the California coast to the poor, landlocked country of Burkina Faso in West Africa.

"We were sort of losing connection with her ... and she e-mailed back, saying, 'I am so sorry. I have been sick with malaria more than once this year,' " McPhee said.

McPhee knew she had to help.

McPhee and the team from Malaria No More traveled to West Africa in 2012. She finally got to visit the school she helped build years earlier, but the team's main mission was to distribute mosquito nets and educate people in Burkina Faso and Ghana on malaria prevention.

"The message is that this is a disease that nobody should be living with, and if they do get infected, it's curable. They just need the right resources."

"Every trip you go, every dollar you send, every organization you get involved with, you can make a difference," McPhee said.
