(CNN) -- Hosts Brazil claimed top spot in Group A at the troubled Confederations Cup with 4-2 win over Italy in Salvador Saturday.

Demonstrators have taken to the streets to highlight the cost of Brazil hosting next year's World Cup and the 2016 Olympics against a background of sub standard public services and corruption.

Police fired tear gas to attempt to disperse protesters, who had gathered despite a televised appearance late Friday by President Dilma Rousseff, who had promised changes.

Mexico beat Japan 2-1 after two goals by Manchester United's Javier Hernandez.

Before the match in Salvador at the Arena Fonte Nova, Italy coach Cesar Prandelli had advised his squad to stay inside their hotel because of security fears, but only limited protests were reported there.

Neymar proved a thorn in Italy's side from the start and was behind a flurry of attacks in the first minute.

But the rest of the half proved scrappy until the home breakthrough in added time.

Neymar whipped in a free kick and after Fred's header was palmed clear by Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, Dante pounced to slot home the rebound.

Italy surprisingly equalized in the 51st minute as Mario Balotelli cleverly flicked on a long ball with a backheel and Emanuele Giaccherini charged forward to score.

But parity lasted just four minutes, Neymar winning a free kick on the edge of the area and stepping up to beat Buffon with a precise strike.

It was the Barcelona-bound star's 23rd goal for Brazil and sixth in his last seven games, continuing his superb form at the Confederations Cup.

Balotelli had a penalty appeal denied before Fred showed his strength to thump home the third in the 66th minute.

"We beat a strong Italian team and I think this shows we are on the right road, even if there are a few things we need to improve," Scolari told AFP.
