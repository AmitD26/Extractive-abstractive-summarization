Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- "Smoking hot" was how many observers described Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard's blistering attack on sexism and misogyny in the bear pit of Australia's Parliament on Tuesday.

For 15 minutes Gillard tore into Abbott before the Australian House of Representatives, the expression on his face going from a wry smile to embarrassment.

Instead, she unfurled two years of pent up rage at the coalition leader for what she described as his own sexist, misogynistic attitude toward her and women generally.

Shock jock targets Gillard

The prime minister then presented her evidence.

She reminded Abbott of his response to a question about lower female representation in positions of power: "What if men are by physiology or temperament more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command?" She then cited his statements that "abortion is the easy way out" and "what the housewives of Australia need to understand as they do the ironing ..." during a debate on the recently introduced carbon tax.

"I was offended too," Gillard continued, "by the sexism, by the misogyny of the Leader of the Opposition catcalling across this table at me, as I sit here as prime minister, 'If the prime minister wants to, politically speaking, make an honest woman of herself,' something that would never have been said to any man sitting in this chair.

"I was offended when the leader of the opposition went outside in the front of Parliament and stood next to a sign that said 'Ditch the Witch.'"

The prime minister had refused to comment on the controversy. Yesterday she broke her silence:

"I indicate to the leader of the opposition, the government is not dying of shame, my father did not die of shame. What the leader of the opposition should be ashamed of is his performance in this parliament and the sexism he brings with it," she said.

Not long after Abbot's motion narrowly failed in a parliamentary vote, with the prime minister victorious, Slipper resigned his post.

Britain's Guardian applauded Gillard for pulling no punches but noted the prime minister "isn't quite the stuff of feminist fantasies" because she has repeatedly refused to support same sex marriage in Australia.

From the journalists permanently reporting from the Australian Parliament, there were many questions -- in particular why the prime minister welcomed Peter Slipper's resignation over his bawdy and offensive text messages but was unprepared to sack him?

She made the wrong choice, wrote Hartcher. The prime minister chose power over principle in deciding not to support the sacking of the house speaker and in so doing, "The prime minister gained nothing and lost a great deal," he added.

Australia now has a female prime minister, a female speaker of the House -- elected after Slipper resigned -- and a female governor-general.

Just another day in Australian politics.
