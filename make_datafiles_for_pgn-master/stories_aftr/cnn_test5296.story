The room was occupied at the time by four people -- two of them children.

The Children's Aid Society of Brant is investigating the welfare of those children, Brantford Police Sgt. Cheney Venn told CNN.

Though it's against the law to own a python in Brantford, no arrests have been made and no charges have been filed; nor have any names have been released by authorities.

The pythons ranged in size from 1 foot to 4Â½ feet, and they were stored in several plastic storage bins.

They were seized from the Bell City Motel by the county's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, according to executive director Robin Kuchma.

She said in an e-mail they have since been sent "off to a rescue where those who are experienced can care for them."

An exasperated employee who answered the phone at the Bell City Motel pleaded to be left alone before hanging up when reached by CNN Friday night.
