In a Sunday interview on Russian television, Lavrov said Washington was threatening to sink the deal unless the resolution was drawn up under Chapter VII of the U.N. charter, which would authorize the use of force against Syria if it doesn't comply. As Syria's leading ally, Russia has opposed threats of military action.

Lavrov said the Americans "are interested in proving their superiority, and this is absolutely not the objective that drives us -- to solve the problem of chemical weapons in Syria."

Russia on Syria - No more 'nyet?'

"What our team at the U.N. is focused on right now is working through the details of a U.N. Security Council resolution with the strongest possible enforcement mechanism," the official said. "We're not going to litigate the details of a potential resolution in public."

U.N. weapons inspectors reported Monday that the nerve agent sarin had been used in the attack. Though the inspectors did not assign blame, Washington said details of the report pointed toward troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as the perpetrators.

Lavrov and his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State John Kerry, laid out a framework for Syria's disarmament on September 14. Kerry and Lavrov spoke again Sunday to reiterate "the importance of working together on implementation of their agreement in Geneva," the senior State Department official said.

The plan calls for Syria to submit a comprehensive declaration of its chemical arms within one week. The OPCW said Saturday it had received the list from Syria. The plan then calls for international inspectors in position to secure that arsenal no later than November. Veteran weapons inspectors have said securing and destroying the Syrian stockpile could take huge numbers of people, including hundreds of inspectors and thousands of troops to provide security.

But Lavrov said Sunday that he didn't see the need for a large contingent of troops to back up the inspectors, and said Moscow was ready to stand guard "along the perimeter of areas where the experts will be working."

In Syria, meanwhile, a Russian Embassy official said two people were hurt when a mortar shell struck the Russian mission in Damascus, the state news agency RIA Novosti reported. RIA Novosti quoted the unnamed official as saying the strike was "apparently an accident."
