Over 100 elegant wooden vessels, their white sails billowing like giant quills, will cruise the Mediterranean in one of the biggest vintage yacht races in the world -- the Régates Royales de Cannes.

Forget throbbing engines and high-tech satellite gear. These multimillion dollar boats hark back to an era when sail ruled the waves, built from designs dating back centuries.

For the love of sail

If Bonati's words seems dramatic, then perhaps it's a reflection of competitors' devotion -- and huge financial investment -- in these vintage vessels.

"You can find a modern yacht anywhere. But for the crews taking part, these boats are really attractive because they're so unique."

Hailing from every corner of the globe, many of the classic yachts have a rich history, with the oldest built in 1896 by renowned Scottish designer William Fife.

Race of a lifetime

The event is divided into three categories according to the age of the yachts -- those built before 1950, those built before 1975, and those built after 1975 but using classic designs.

"These boats are really heavy," said Castellanet. "When they're launched they take a long time to stop and turn around."

"Unlike modern yachts, they don't have hydraulics, so sometimes it takes 10 guys pulling on the same rope."

The roaring twenties were a golden era for the French Riviera, with the crème de la crème of European society holidaying -- and sailing -- at the pretty seaside town of Cannes.

In 1929 the first Régates Royales was born, in honor of Christian X, King of Denmark. World War Two put a temporary halt to the event, until it was re-launched in 1978.

Fast forward 35 years and the prestigious regatta now attracts 40,000 visitors each year.

However, this year will also be an emotional event, with the death of Cannes Yacht Club president Jean-Claude Montesinos earlier this month. Castellanet paid tribute to Montesinos' sense of humor and huge enthusiasm for the race.

It is that same enthusiasm which sees thousands of crew members taking part, despite there being no prize money. Rather than staying in ritzy hotels, many sleep on board the yachts.

"It's not about prize money. People do it for the spirit of the race."
