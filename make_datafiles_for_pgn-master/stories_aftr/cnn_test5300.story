(CNN) -- A charter bus bound for a casino overturned on an interstate highway in Los Angeles County on Thursday morning, injuring 46 people, officials said.

Most of the injuries were minor to moderate, Saul Gomez of the California Highway Patrol told CNN. Several trauma patients were airlifted by helicopter.

Witnesses were still being interviewed, and it was too early to ascertain a cause of the wreck, he said.

Pasadena's Huntington Hospital had three patients, including an 86-year-old man with chest injuries and rib fractures, hospital spokesman Kevin Andrus said.

Three hospitals in the Citrus Valley Health Partners system had a total of 20 patients, all of whom were listed in mild to moderate conditions, spokeswoman Annette Macias said.

CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.
