Washington (CNN) -- Politics is full of second chances.

Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford -- now U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford -- is living proof. Former Rep. Anthony Weiner is trying to travel the same road to political redemption. And now add former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer to the list, as he embarks on a similar journey.

A Republican political strategist thinks it reflects a lower opinion of politicians.

Spitzer, who resigned in 2008 after revelations he spent thousands of dollars on prostitutes, launched a petition campaign Monday to become New York City comptroller.

"I made significant errors. I stood up, accepted responsibility, resigned. It's now been five years, I hope the public will extend its forgiveness to me," the Democrat said Monday morning on radio's "The Bill Press Show."

"I think it is a land of forgiveness, of people in their natural goodness (who) understand the fact that...we sin, we pay a price and hopefully continue," added Spitzer, who served two terms as New York State attorney general before winning election as governor in 2006.

Spitzer, who needs to gather the 3,750 signatures by Thursday to get into the September primary ballot, would be on the same Democratic ballot as Weiner, who is running for mayor and would have the quickest redemption.

Opinion: Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace

Spitzer, who since stepping down has been a commentator for various news outlets including CNN, disagrees with the Weiner comparison, and said he's not on a quest for redemption, but instead stressed that he's motivated by what he said are personal pleas from New Yorkers urging him to get back into public service.

Republican Sanford's political career appeared dead after he finished out his term amid repercussions of admitting to an extramarital affair in 2009. But he won redemption in a special election in May to fill a vacant congressional seat in the state's 1st Congressional District, which he represented before serving as governor.

The media loves a comeback story, if only because it allows them it an opportunity to revisit what brought down that politician in the first place. And redemption stories resonate with the public.

"It all comes down to how well the scandal is handled, voters assessment of relevance to doing the job, and choosing the right time for re-entry into the political arena," he said.

Spitzer to run against madam

"It used to be an iron law of politics that no divorced person could be president. Then Ronald Reagan proved that wrong," said Begala, who was a top political adviser to President Bill Clinton and a senior adviser last year to a super PAC that worked for President Barack Obama's re-election.

"Ultimately politics is about voters' lives, not politicians -- if voters think someone can make a difference in their life, they will overlook personal shortcomings," he added. "But the key is not to make the campaign about the politician's need for redemption, but about voters' need for jobs."
