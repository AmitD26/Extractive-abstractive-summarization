In Memphis there's only one person called "the king:" the late Elvis Presley.

The grandsons of the Queen of England visited Memphis to see their friend, Guy Pelly, tie the knot with native Memphian Elizabeth "Lizzy" Wilson, CNN affiliate WREG reported.

She's the granddaughter of the man who founded the Holiday Inn chain. Her new husband is a London nightclub owner.

On Saturday, royal fans lined the road leading to the the Memphis Hunt and Polo Club, where the wedding was held, to catch a glimpse of the princes.

"I'm a big Prince Harry fan!" Darla Chapman told WREG. "I'm single! I heard he's single!"

On Friday they paid a visit to Presley's home, Graceland, the Memphis version of Buckingham Palace.

"It was pretty awesome," local Nicholas Pegues said of the visit. "A once in a lifetime event!"
