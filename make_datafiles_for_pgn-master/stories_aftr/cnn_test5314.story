Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lamar Odom's lawyer on Wednesday entered a "not guilty" plea for the basketball star on a driving under the influence charge, a court spokeswoman said.

The judge set a pretrial hearing for 8:30 a.m. November 8. Odom's lawyer did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment.

"I've made a couple (of mistakes) and I may make a couple again, but hopefully they won't be as big as this one," Odom told reporters then.

Khloe Kardashian, who married Odom in 2009 after a 30-day courtship, tweeted about her frustrations when rumors surfaced days before his arrest that her husband was addicted to pain medications.

Odom and Kardashian have starred in their own show, "Khloe and Lamar," which aired on the E! network.

Odom is a free agent who has played in the NBA for 14 years, for the Los Angeles Lakers, Dallas Mavericks and, most recently, the Los Angeles Clippers.

CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.
