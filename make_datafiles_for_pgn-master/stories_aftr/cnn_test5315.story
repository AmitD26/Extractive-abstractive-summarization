The case brings to eight the number of people charged in the case, NYPD spokeswoman Annette Markowski said.

Lien's wife and 2-year-old daughter were in the vehicle with him. Lien has not been charged.

The chase that followed ended in traffic. Police say Lien's windows were smashed. He was dragged out of the SUV and beaten. He was treated and released from a hospital.

A judge set bond for Douglas at $25,000, according to the district attorney's office.

The beating went viral after a video of the incident was posted online.

Of those arrested, at least three have been indicted by a grand jury. Three NYPD officers are under investigation for allegedly waiting several days to tell their superiors they were at a rally where the SUV driver was beaten and kicked.
