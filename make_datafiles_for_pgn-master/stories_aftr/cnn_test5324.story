(CNN) -- Tennis' year-end championships are supposed to showcase the top eight players in the world but Monday's opening matches in London took a backseat to another butting of heads between the two biggest names in the sport.

Federer and his attacking game flourish under a roof -- he was unbeaten on indoor hard courts for two years from late 2010 -- and the 17-time grand slam winner boasts a career winning ratio of over 80% when playing inside.

Nadal has never won the ATP World Tour Finals while Federer has on six occasions, with four of those coming indoors -- Houston in 2003 and 2004 proving the exception.

Playing the tournament in such fashion is a natural extension of the European "indoor swing" that begins in the middle of October.

Prior to London, Shanghai staged the year-end showpiece on an indoor carpet and then on an indoor hard court from 2005 to 2008.

The last time it was contested on a surface other than hard or carpet was way back in 1974, on grass in Melbourne, and Nadal insists it is time for a change.

"I know it's not going to happen for my generation," Nadal, who stepped down as vice-president of the players council last year, told reporters on Monday.

"A good player has a chance to qualify for the (World Tour Finals) four or five times in his career, so if during this four years you have a different surface every year, a minimum one time he will have the chance to play on his favorite surface."

In an interview with CNN last week, Andre Silva, tournament director of the World Tour Finals and the ATP's chief player officer, said changing surfaces would make for an "interesting concept" but presented some problems.

"Even in the same place it would be pretty unique if you have all of a sudden one year on a hard court in London and the next year on a clay court.

"But it's hard for players to switch surfaces. I think guys who haven't played on clay for six months wouldn't be comfortable going back to a surface they haven't experienced in six months.

"I'm not opposed to it but I just think it becomes hard because of the logistics."

When asked about the issue by reporters, Novak Djokovic -- the third most successful active player in the men's game -- didn't "know what to say rightly."

The Serbian, however, said the championships shouldn't be held in the same city for more than three years.

London's stint will hit seven seasons come the end of its term in 2015 and Silva said there was "definitely" a possibility of a further extension. Federer told CNN he wasn't opposed to the idea.
