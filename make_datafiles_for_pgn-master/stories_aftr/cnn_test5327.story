(CNN) -- Karley Marquet and Annie Kendzior said they enrolled at two of the nation's most prestigious military academies to serve their country and become military officers. Instead, they claim, they were raped -- and their military careers are now over.

In a lawsuit filed in U.S. Federal Court on Friday, the women claim the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, and the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, ignored "rampant sexual harassment."

The suit claims former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the former superintendents of the two academies and the current secretaries of the Army and Navy are "personally responsible" for failing to "prevent rapes and sexual assaults at the Naval Academy and West Point."

"When I was accepted, it was kind of overwhelming," she says. "You can't imagine having that structure and discipline but at the same time having people look at you like, 'Wow, you're doing something great for our country.'"

But Marquet said her dream of becoming an officer was shattered in January 2011, her second semester at West Point.

It was then, Marquet, said, that an upperclassman she knew showed up at her door late one night to talk "girl troubles."

"I kind of felt cool that an upperclassman wanted to be friends with me and was seeking my advice," Marquet recalls.

"I just remember getting more and more intoxicated and my judgment really started to become impaired. ... I remember him turning off the lights and me asking, 'What are you doing?' And then he proceeded to rape me."

Marquet said she woke up disoriented, in physical pain, afraid to come forward.

"I was scared it was going to ruin my career," she said, "I was scared if I said anything, there would constantly be a target on my back."

"The reason I ended up telling someone is because I didn't want that to happen to anyone else," Marquet said tearfully.

"All of their graduates from the soccer team went on and became pilots and Marine officers," Kendzior said. "It just sounds like those women are so powerful and so well-respected, and I wanted to be that woman."

So in the fall of 2008, Kendzior headed off to Annapolis. She said her goal was to fly F-18s but it wasn't long after arriving at the academy she realized that wasn't going to happen.

But Kendzior said she had way too much to drink, so when a fellow midshipman offered her a place to crash, she accepted.

"I was like, 'OK, you know, it will be fine. I trust you. You're an upperclass," Kendzior remembers, "Because that's what they teach you, to trust your upperclass."

"At one point in the middle of the night, I did come to and he was on top of me," Kendzior said. "And I remember saying 'No,' but I just passed out again.

Kendzior said, she too, was afraid to come forward.

Marquet and Kendzior said they believed their cases were being investigated.

Marquet remembered investigators meeting with her parents about her case. "They promised my parents that if he wasn't going to jail, they could at least get him kicked out of West Point with the evidence they had," she said.

But both women said their alleged perpetrators were never punished and are still in the military.

Marquet and Kendzior are not alone. Reports of sexual assault at West Point, the Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, are up nearly 60 percent, and according to the Department of Defense, of the 65 reports investigated, only one resulted in a court-martial.

"I think that's part of the syndrome that we're dealing with, which is that once a decision is made that somehow this prosecution is not going to move forward then you basically turn on the victim who brought that complaint," Panetta said. "That syndrome is what we have to break out of."

According to the lawsuit, "as a result of the rape," Marquet became "depressed and suicidal." She said she was unable to handle the stress of seeing the alleged perpetrator every day, so she resigned from West Point.

Kendzior said she also became suicidal. She was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and according to her lawsuit, was then "forced to leave the academy."

"I know that with at least one person coming forward there will be others who want to come forward and say something," Marquet said.

Similarly, Kendzior said, "I want to encourage other women to report as soon as possible because then they might get their perpetrators put behind bars, which is where they should be, which is where they deserve to be."

West Point and the Naval Academy told CNN they were unable to comment on the allegations due to privacy issues. Both women have requested copies of their case files to learn more about why their alleged perpetrators are still in the military.
