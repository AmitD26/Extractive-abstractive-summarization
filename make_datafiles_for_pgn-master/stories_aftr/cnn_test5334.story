Kane is used to laughs and incredulous looks when he mentions his name. But the random guy at a bar who sang his name to the tune of "I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am" stands out among the bad jokes.

"It was funny for the first half-hour, and then the more he drank the louder he got," said Kane, 38.

"I feel a modicum of responsibility, the pressure of carrying on this torch that has been passed to me, and passing it onto another generation," he said.

George or Alexander?

But Mehrabian, who has studied how people perceive names, argues it's too personal of an approach. He tells parents to consider how an average person would respond to a name. He has crafted a system for rating a name's attractiveness based on whether people perceive someone with that name to be caring, loyal, humorous, adventurous, successful or to have other traits.

Take George, for example. It's an "established name," Mehrabian said, but "there are names with a lot more positive connotations."

"Maybe at some point he'll be called Alexander," Mehrabian surmised of the young prince.

Cases like these are exactly why Mehrabian reminds parents of the practical purpose of a name: It identifies a person.

"It kind of defeats the most fundamental function of naming when you name the child after the father, grandfather and great-grandfather," he said.

When names cause confusion

Kane's double name almost cost him a diploma.

"Because I had William on the books and I went by John, half of my high school credits were in each name. I almost couldn't graduate because there were two records."

While that was a one-time mistake, Kane is frequently confused with his father, William John VII. It's caused some issues over the years, like getting partly blended credit reports and receiving an AARP card when he was 31. But there are some perks, he says, like the time he used his father's boarding pass so he could take his place at a wedding. Bonus: No ticket cancellation fees!

Despite the modern-day inconveniences of sharing a name, the father-son duo say that seeing the name repeated in the family tree helps them stay connected with the past.

"I feel that I need keep the name unblemished in honor of those who have carried it before me," he said.

The younger Kane is proud of his name and says he would like to continue the tradition.

"In an era of parents naming their children Magnus, Lion, Breeze, Marlowe, Clover, Blue and North, I have to say that should I have a son of my own, I will undoubtedly campaign my future wife to bestow on him the mantle of William John the 9th."
