NEW YORK (CNN) -- If you're Iranian, you probably know both and Akbar Ganji and Googoosh. You also know that 30 years ago they had as much in common as Rush Limbaugh and Madonna. The story of how they came together this week on a street corner in Manhattan for a hunger strike is a glimpse of the evolution of the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and the far-reaching impact of Iran's current opposition movement.

"All my friends did," Ganji said. "Back then everything had to be about the revolution."

In February 1979, Ganji's wish came true. The shah fell from power. In his place came the father of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

The two very different roads traveled by Googoosh and Ganji began to converge in the mid-1990s. That was when Ganji started becoming disillusioned with Iran's theocracy. This wasn't what he had in mind, he says, when he struggled for freedom and change in 1979. As a journalist he described Iran's leaders as fascists and dared to accuse high-ranking officials of murdering political dissidents.

Ganji left Iran for the United States after he was released from prison in 2006. Soon after he arrived, he says, he got a call from the singer whose records he'd trashed more than 25 years before. Googoosh was already living in exile in the States.

"I don't want to go into details of what she said," Ganji said. "It was personal. She just wanted me to know that I was in her thoughts during my time in prison."  Watch Googoosh and Ganji talk about the hunger strike Â»

When Googoosh arrived on Wednesday, her fans mobbed her. One woman wrapped a green scarf around her shoulders.

"As an artist I have a voice, and I can ask the world to help our people," Googoosh told CNN.

Two Iranians with nothing in common 30 years ago now struggle for the same cause.

"No, I don't think anybody expected this," Ganji said.

The hunger strike ended Friday evening, and Ganji called it a success. He said the hunger strikers also vowed to oppose any future appearance at the United Nations by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
