New York (CNN) -- More than two-thousand college-bound students applying to Fordham University received an e-mail Wednesday night informing them they had been accepted to the school, when in fact their status was still unresolved, Fordham University says.

"Congratulations once again on your admission to Fordham," the e-mail read.

The e-mail was sent to thousands of prospective students who had applied for early admission to New York's Fordham University, said Bob Howe, senior director of communications for Fordham.

Five-hundred were ultimately not admitted, while the rest were deferred until March or had incomplete applications, Howe said.

Walker was wrongfully accepted to Fordham's Lincoln Center campus as a musical theater major.

"The fact that they accepted me and then denied me was really painful," Walker said. "My dad was really upset about it. It wasn't the fact that I was denied, it was the fact that they sent a denial after an acceptance."

The inaccurate e-mail was mistakenly sent by a member of Student Aid Services, a third-party company that serves as an undergraduate admission consultant to Fordham, said Mary Fallon, a Communications Consultant for Student Aid Services.

Student Aid Services said the mistaken acceptances were a result of human error and there is no indication of a computer glitch that could lead to errors in any of the other 700 secondary schools it provides services, Fallon said.
