"Suarez lost a duel with Azpilicueta ... and now he's doing an acrobatic swimming pool jump to try to get the penalty, because he's so clever because he's in the area where the Liverpool supporters are behind," Mourinho insisted at his press conference.

"But (referee Howard) Webb is 10 meters away. And I think the only mistake Webb did was not to give him a yellow card."

Suarez has a reputation of going to ground too easily, but this season the Uruguayan has been a reformed man -- being named interim captain by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers -- following last season's eight-match ban for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic.

"The player is amazing," acknowledged Mourinho, who has yet to suffer a home league defeat in his two spells at Stamford Bridge. "He does everything to win and Brendan is doing a fantastic job on him because he's changed. There's no doubt that he's changed.

"But when the situation is like this and you are losing comes the nature of the player, the wild nature of the player or the cultural nature of the player.

Eden Hazard leveled with a superb curling effort, and Eto'o poked in a 34th-minute winner from Oscar's low cross.

"He should've been sent off," Rodgers said of the Cameroon striker. "I know we scored from it, but that was a wild challenge, where he's raked down his knee and down his shin and didn't even get a yellow card.

"Luis will always provoke a challenge from defenders, that's why he's world-class. What he probably doesn't expect is to provoke a challenge from someone who's not involved in the contact.

The team leading going into the new year has won the title for seven of the past nine years, though Arsenal was one of the exceptions in 2007-08, dropping back to third.

The London side was missing record signing Mesut Ozil and top scorer Aaron Ramsey for Sunday's trip to in-form Newcastle, but battled to a vital 1-0 victory thanks to Olivier Giroud's eighth league goal this season.

The France striker glanced in Theo Walcott's 65th-minute free-kick to inflict Newcastle's first league defeat since October.

"There is something in the team that is special on the mental front," said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.

"We have many times been questioned, but we have shown that at West Ham, where we were 1-0 down, we have shown that again today, where we were a bit backs-to-the-wall in the last 15 minutes.

Arsenal's win allowed London rival Tottenham to move up to seventh place above Newcastle with a 3-0 win at home to 12th-placed Stoke, as Spain striker Roberto Soldado netted a penalty before Belgium midfielder Mousa Dembele and England winger Aaron Lennon added the others.

Everton climbed above Merseyside rival Liverpool into fourth with a 2-1 win at home to ninth-placed Southampton, as on-loan Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku struck the 74th-minute winner -- the Belgium international's ninth in the league this season.
