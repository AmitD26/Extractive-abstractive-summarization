Baltimore (CNN) -- When Geremen Teklehaimanot came into the Baltimore Medical System office Thursday hoping to renew the same sliding-scale health policy that he had last year, he got more than he bargained for.

In August of this year, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services gave out $67 million in Navigator Cooperative Agreements. The grants pay to train, support and certify advisers, also known as patient navigators, who work out in the field and on the phone. The navigators partner with local medical systems to help people figure out how the new Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplaces work.

"That's wonderful," he said. "Just wonderful. Let me show you something."

"See, it says I'm almost in," he said.

This week the sheer volume of interest overwhelmed the Maryland site. All across the country there were reports of long wait times at other state and federal sites.

Elliott is the official navigator team leader for the nonprofit HealthCare Access Maryland. Maryland will get about 300 certified navigators who will be essential during open enrollment.

Middleton-Lawson met Elliott for the first time Thursday. Dressed head to toe in bright pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Middleton-Lawson literally did a small dance of joy when she learned a navigator was in the building.

"Answer 'yes' to one of these," Elliott told Teklehaimanot as he filled out forms. Elliott's calm demeanor and reassuring tone visibly seemed to put Teklehaimanot at ease.

Elliott used to be a teacher. She misses her special needs students, but finds this navigator work fulfilling.

"It's helping people who are willing to learn, and it's helping people who are in dire need of health care," Elliott said. "With this program it will definitely give them a peace of mind."

"Mostly, the angry callers just want to be heard," Elliott says. "So, we listen to those too."

Most of the questions the navigators get involve the cost. With subsidies, the Department of Health and Human Services estimates the majority of people should be able to find coverage for $100 or less a month. Even a bare-bones policy covers preventive care like immunizations, mental health, rehab and other services.

"Even though they have jobs, some of them still don't have insurance," Elliott said. "A lot of my friends are calling me and saying 'OK, where do I need to go? What do I need to do? Can I come to your house?' We are at a place in life where you have a job, but you can't afford to buy a health plan. I think this is going to be a really good thing because now it's going to be really affordable to people."

Toward the end of his visit, Teklehaimanot's smartphone still hadn't connected with the Maryland marketplace. He hasn't signed up for a new plan yet, but he does have more information. He has until December 14 to sign up if he wants his family to have coverage starting January 1.

For many, signing up for a new policy may take several conversations or several website visits.

"I know there's some general frustration right now with the online part," Elliott said. "I'm confident though we'll work the kinks out, and regardless, I know they will be happy once they get all the benefits. It can be life-changing."
