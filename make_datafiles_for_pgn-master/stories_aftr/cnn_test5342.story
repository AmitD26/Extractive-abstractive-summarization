Patchogue, New York (CNN) -- In the December chill of Long Island, Joselo Lucero stands on the spot where seven teenagers attacked his brother and another Hispanic man five years ago as part of the pastime they made out of hunting and beating up Latinos.

Lucero points to a patch of grass near the Long Island Rail Road station in this waterfront village where the confrontation began on the night of November 8, 2008. There was the spot where a knife pierced Marcelo's chest; the house where his cries for help went unheeded; the fence where his body crumpled and bled to death.

"For me, it's a symbol," Lucero, 38, said. "That was the end of something, but it was the beginning of the change. A regular person, bleeding ... stood up and fought for what was right."

The 27-page agreement settles a federal investigation of discriminatory policing in immigrant communities in Suffolk, one of the nation's largest suburbs and home to ritzy East Hampton. That investigation was triggered by the 2008 hate crime, which fueled international outcry and exposed a pattern of anti-immigrant violence and what community leaders called police inaction.

The agreement calls for additional police training, accountability and outreach to Latinos; better tracking of hate crimes and police discrimination; regular meetings with Latino leaders; and more bilingual officers.

The settlement does not cite wrongdoing or specific problems with the Police Department or its policies, even though the Justice Department inquiry found that police helped created a climate where hate crimes went unreported and officers routinely ignored bias attacks.

A step forward

For Joselo Lucero and others, the settlement is a tiny step for a county trying desperately to shed its reputation as a bastion of anti-immigrant fear and resentment.

"Let's not be hypocrites," Lucero told CNN. "Who were the police officers who did not follow up on these crimes? Why should I believe these people will change? No one has been named in connection with these cover ups."

Maer believes the Justice Department failed by not investigating these other alleged crimes reported by the county's Latino community as part of its settlement with Suffolk.

That failure, according to Maer, has deprived immigrants of the truth and the entire community of a "critical learning moment," said Maer, whose Manhattan-based advocacy group first took the allegations to federal investigators.

But Fallon denied that the police fostered a climate that encouraged hate crimes. "It's important to know that the Department of Justice came in to look at that allegation," he said, "and there was no finding on their part."

Fallon said some undocumented immigrants might have been reluctant to report crimes because of their legal status. But the 2,000-officer department wants the message out that "their status is not a factor for us."

"I'd like to think we are heading in the right direction," he said, referring to police and community relations. "It's going to take a long time to get that trust back."

On Main Street in Patchogue, a quiet village of about 12,000 people on the south shore of Long Island, four men from El Salvador and Honduras sitting in a laundromat said they believe some things have changed, while others have not, after the Lucero slaying.

"You don't see small groups of kids hanging around like before," said another. "There are more police around."

"But you know you're still not safe out alone at night," said a third.

The climate of fear in Suffolk County was created in part by immigration opponents who found sympathetic ears in the area, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a report one year after Lucero's killing. Former County Executive Steve Levy, an anti-immigration firebrand who employed measures seen as hostile toward Latinos, has been singled out by advocates and immigrants alike as an enabler of the hate.

"Suffolk County became ground zero for the anti-immigrant movement and it threw up a sign saying we're a county of intolerance," said Luis Valenzuela, executive director of the Long Island Immigrant Alliance.

Seven students from Patchogue-Medford High School were arrested and convicted in Lucero's death. One of them, Jeffrey Conroy, who was 17 and a star athlete at the time of the attack, is serving a 25-year sentence for manslaughter as a hate crime. Six others pleaded guilty and are serving sentences of between five and eight years.

Two years ago, federal authorities recommended changes to promote trust between police and Latinos, including "enhanced training and investigation of allegations of hate crimes and bias incidents, meaningful access to police services for individuals with limited English proficiency," the Justice Department said in a statement when the settlement was announced. The Justice Department would monitor the county's compliance for at least a year.

"All residents of Suffolk County deserve full and unbiased police protection, regardless of national origin, race, or citizenship status," said U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch.

Marcelo Lucero, who was 37 when he died and worked in a dry cleaning store, is remembered in a scholarship awarded each year by a nonprofit for whom his brother now works. Every year, Joselo Lucero and community leaders hold a vigil at the intersection near the Patchogue train station where Lucero died. In 2010, the corner was renamed Unity Place.

Lucero travels around in his brother's old car, giving talks against bullying and hate crimes at schools around the region. Two students at Patchogue-Medford High School have been awarded the scholarship bearing his brother's name, but Lucero still hasn't been invited to speak there.

"The guys who killed my brother still have friends in the school," he said. "They want to avoid any problems."

Said Casale, who teaches Spanish at a junior high school: "It's almost like the county wants damage control rather than to take responsibility. They want this to go away."
