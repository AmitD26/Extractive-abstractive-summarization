(CNN) -- Even when pulling a 60-degree angle bank turn over the Dubai desert, the U.S. military's V-22 Osprey aircraft is hardly approaching the limits of its capabilities.

"What it's doing for us operationally, it's changing the game plan," says Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Duffy after the test flight at the Dubai Airshow earlier this week. "We're still exploring what this aircraft can do."

Duffy admits that it is a complicated aircraft to fly. Pilots -- be they experienced with fighter jets or helicopters -- have to train for around 24 weeks. But after all the tests and simulator hours, "it really is a thrill to fly, wherever we go people always ask us about it."

"As domestic markets are shrinking due to budget cuts, the large manufacturers are working hard to improve their export sales into regions such as the Middle East."

UK prime minister David Cameron flew into the UAE before the airshow began to boost the bid to sell 60 Eurofighter Typhoon jets to the Emirates.

"Known as 'offsets', these can cover direct participation in the construction and manufacturing process, technology transfer or direct investment in a country's defense industry."

These offsets then are more than just sweeteners, but increasingly part of the package that aircraft manufacturers have to offer to boast sales.

Another big piece of kit that doesn't have the advantage of an operational showreel like the V-22 Osprey is Airbus Military's A400M airlifter -- one of the newest aircraft in the skies. The first planes were delivered to the French Air Force in September.

For his part former Mirage fighter pilot and A400M test engineer Eric Isorce is thoroughly impressed with the machine after 5,700 hours of test flights. "Its like nothing else, its a real plane for the 21st Century."

But it's not just a battle between big manufacturers from the U.S. and Europe. Russia's recently announcement that it wishes to sell arms to Egypt to the fill the potential void left by the U.S. showing that there are plenty of other players and obstacles in the high-stakes game of selling military hardware.
