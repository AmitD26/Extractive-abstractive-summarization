Nevertheless, Olga Mugyenyi and Nahida Beghani have injected new life into the plain white "tee" with Definition Africa, a t-shirt store based in Kampala, Uganda.

Bright prints, sharp slogans and youthful energy characterize Definition's alternative approach to fashion, where everyday Ugandan life inspires each new design.

"We felt like there weren't really any products or apparel in the market that really celebrated the local experience," she adds.

Despite the seemingly globalized nature of the fashion world, Definition's success is largely inspired by regional quirks and local collaborations rather than the latest throwaway trend.

"We also have a line that's called 'Signature Tees' where we invite people to submit their designs and if they go through the approval process then they get printed," she says.

However, the practicalities of producing and manufacturing locally-made clothing has proven to be just as difficult as they had anticipated.

This commitment to homegrown design is part of a greater ambition to support local and regional industry, the entrepreneurs say, and so far, consumers have been taking note.

Mugyenyi adds: "One of the things that makes Definition what it is, is that the products are supposed to be entirely African in subject matter and as well as where the material comes from."
