The secret balloting among 75 representatives of Syria's main opposition group, which have been meeting this week in a luxury hotel on the outskirts of Istanbul, resulted in 58 votes in favor and 14 opposed, with two abstentions and one person who handed in an unmarked ballot, the coalition's media office told CNN.

Nonetheless, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry applauded what he called "a courageous vote in the interests of all the Syrian people who have suffered so horribly under the brutality of the (President Bashar al-) Assad regime and a civil war without end.

The top U.S. diplomat promised that he'd engage "directly with the Syrian opposition and the international community" when the conference starts next Wednesday.

The goal of the talks -- dubbed Geneva 2 in recognition of a similar effort in the Swiss city in 2012 -- is to set up a transitional government that would end the violence that has wracked the country since March 2011, killing more than 100,000 people.

Kerry explained late last week that the meeting's goal is to implement the communique that was the fruit of the first such meeting.

"It is about establishing a process essential to the formation of a transition government body -- governing body -- with full executive powers established by mutual consent," he told reporters.

Any names put forward for leadership of Syria's transition must, according to the terms of Geneva 1, be agreed to by the opposition and the regime led by President Bashar al-Assad, according to Kerry.

In addition, he said, it "defies logic that those whose brutality created" the current situation could lead Syria toward a better future.

On Friday, his foreign minister announced that he'd given his Russian counterpart a proposal "to determine the time and date where there will be an end to the military operations" in Aleppo and urged him to help broker its passage.

"We will wait for Minister (Sergey) Lavrov to tell us the time and the date, the hour, and we will commit ourselves to these arrangements -- if he has enough guarantees that the other side will accept and commit themselves as well," Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said.

If that succeeds, he said, Damascus is prepared to extend the plan to other areas of the country.
