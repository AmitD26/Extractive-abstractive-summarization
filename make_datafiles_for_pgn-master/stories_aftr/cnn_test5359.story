But now, after a renovation process, the high-ceilinged warehouse has been reinvented as a modern art deco space intended to house Africa's most cutting-edge design ideas and exhibit them to the world.

Welcome to the Museum of African Design, or MOAD, a 2,500 square meter space which claims to be the first of its kind on the continent.

Situated inside Johannesburg's vibrant Maboneng precinct, a former crime hotspot that's undergoing an urban rejuvenation, MOAD opened its doors late last month with the vision to become a pan-African platform for contemporary creativity and innovation.

The spacious downtown building, which dates back to the 1920s, had been earmarked as a museum since its acquisition by the Maboneng developers in 2011. But it only hosted a number of temporary exhibitions and events during the past year before work started in July to transform it into a permanent home for African design.

The developers went on to add an extra floor, bathrooms and a cocktail bar but kept the building's integrity largely intact -- raw floors, metal bars and scaffolding ramps still dominate the three-level space, creating a rough-edged atmosphere that echoes the identity of the building and its urban surroundings.

"We will continue 'refining' the space, but the goal is to leave it as original and industrial as possible," explains Kohn.

'New ways to see the world'

The museum's launch event took place on October 24 with the annual showcase of the Southern Guild collection, a 10-day exhibition presenting the creations of some of South Africa's top designers and artists.

'Native Nostalgia'

After the launch event, which had a South African focus, MOAD is now making its first foray into the continent's creativity with "Native Nostalgia," the museum's inaugural full-length exhibition.

"Native Nostalgia" runs until February 9. Upcoming exhibitions at MOAD include "Fashioning Africa," running from March to May, and "Design of an African City," from June to August.
