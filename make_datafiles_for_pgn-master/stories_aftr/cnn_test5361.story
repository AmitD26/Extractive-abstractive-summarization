York and Leicester, England (CNN) -- A year ago, historians held their breath as archaeologist Jo Appleby painstakingly dusted centuries of dirt and debris from the curved spine and staved-in skull of a skeleton uncovered under a parking lot in the English city of Leicester.

The story of the long-lost king buried beneath a car park made headlines around the world -- but 12 months on, excitement has given way to anger, as enthusiasts and experts argue over what should happen to Richard III's remains.

The judge in the case, Mr. Justice Haddon-Cave has even gone so far as to plead with all concerned "to avoid embarking on the (legal) Wars of the Roses, part two," warning that such legal wrangling would be "unseemly, undignified and unedifying," and urging them to call in an independent panel of experts to rule on the burial. The original War of the Roses was a bloody civil war which divided England for decades, and eventually saw Richard's family, the Plantagenets, swept from power.

English rules and regulations governing exhumations should mean that the decision is a straightforward one -- such bodies are usually reburied in the nearest consecrated ground to the archaeological dig site -- but in fact it is proving anything but, with the launch of legal action to try and halt the plans.

Back then Richard Buckley, lead archaeologist on what he admits to initially thinking of as a "harebrained scheme," told CNN how he had applied for a license to exhume any human remains with the words "In the unlikely event that we find the remains of Richard III..."

The Alliance -- made up of people who claim to be distantly related to Richard III, and headed by Stephen Nicolay, his 17th great nephew -- objects to the lack of consultation over where the newly-rediscovered king's bones should be laid to rest.

"What we're saying is that for a significant historical figure such as Richard III, his remains should be the subject of a broad consultation," explains Matthew Howarth, the lawyer representing the Alliance. "All the interested parties should be able to have their say, state their case as to where the bones should be buried... It shouldn't be a closed decision."

The Alliance eventually wants to see the bones taken to York, a northern city packed to the gills with historic sites and, the group says, with links to Richard III.

It is a plea backed up by others in the city.

"Richard was the last northern king," explains Paul Toy, of York's Richard III Museum. "He had lots of estates and he was constantly moving around, but certainly he would identify himself as northern, and York was a city that was very close to his heart... He was very much part of the civic fabric."

"There's considerable historical evidence that Richard spent quite a lot of time at his castle here in Leicester," says the city's mayor, Peter Soulsby. "It was from Leicester that he chose to ride out to what would prove to be his last battle, and it was to Leicester that he was returned, and where he was buried on the orders of the new king, Henry.

"And frankly, to be buried by royal command in a city is pretty powerful evidence that this is where he ought to remain."

Soulsby insists that the events of more recent times offer all the more reason for the monarch to be laid to rest in Leicester.

"Leicester's people have honored Richard for many generations: We have a King Richard's Road, a King Richard's School, we even have pubs called after King Richard.

"It's not just the history that compels us -- it is also the fact that it was the amazing skill of Leicester University's archaeologists that actually rediscovered the remains, and their incredible forensic work that confirmed they were the remains of King Richard.

"Leicester is where he's been for 500 years, and Leicester is where he deserves to be reburied, with proper ceremony, and in a tomb fit for a king."

The council has already bought an old school which is being turned into a museum, and it is clear that there is a commercial aspect to the battle for the bones, since whichever city they end up in is likely to see a tourism boost.

Sitting in a quiet corner of the Cathedral Close with his wife Julia, waiting for a tour to begin, Leicestershire local -- but Yorkshire native -- Peter Farnworth believes that's another reason why the bones should stay close to where they were found.

"As far as we can tell, as far as we have any idea of where he wanted to be buried himself, it seems to be in York," he told CNN. "There's a sense that Richard III is a king who has had a bad press -- an unfair bad press -- and that responding as far as we can to his known wishes would slightly even things up a bit."
