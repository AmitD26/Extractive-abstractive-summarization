They went to see Michael Jackson in concert, attended the Super Bowl and took in championship boxing matches. He describes this time in his life as an inner city version of the 1980s sitcom "Silver Spoons."

"My father would pick me up in a Porsche one day, a Mercedes the next day, a BMW the next. My mother would drive a Mercedes, a Jaguar," Lewis Jr. says, "It was normal to me."

That all changed on December 6, 1989. That's the day his father, Tony Lewis Sr. was convicted of helping to run one of the largest drug rings in the history of the nation's capitol. In the same city where his cocaine operation wreaked havoc, his son now mentors young men who might be lured into a life of crime.

It wasn't until 1988, when Tony was 8 years old that he realized the truth behind his father's extravagant lifestyle. While watching the local news, Tony saw a report that claimed officials had raided one of the city's largest cocaine distribution networks. He gazed at the TV screen as his father was escorted into police custody, a suspect in the high profile case.

"When my father went to prison, my childhood pretty much ended," he says. "My innocence was taken."

Tony's father was eventually sentenced to life without parole. Lewis Sr. remembers seeing Little Tony after his guilty verdict. "I cried. ... I told him that he had to be strong." Leaving his son was the hardest thing he ever had to do. "No amount of money I made is worth this," he says.

In a recent interview with CNN from a federal prison in Maryland, Lewis Sr. told CNN that it was never his dream to be a drug dealer. As the son of a single mother raising six kids on welfare, Lewis Sr. says he started selling drugs at 14 as a way to make ends meet: "We never had enough to eat. I actually started selling drugs to ... provide for my siblings."

After his dad's downfall, Tony says he went from "riches to rags." Along with his mother, Tony moved into his grandmother's row home, located on a city block once known for violence and crime. "I had to mature very quickly to be able to kind of survive the things that I went through," Tony says.

"I didn't want to die at 16, 18, 21," Tony Jr. says. "I knew another way of life was possible." Tony graduated from the University of the District of Columbia in 2003 at the age of 23.

Now 32, Tony's goal is to impact the lives of young men growing up without fathers.

In 2010, Tony founded a mentoring initiative for children of incarcerated parents called Sons of Life. He was inspired to create the organization during a routine prison visit with his father.

Tony noticed a young boy waiting in the visiting area to see his dad. He looked to be about 8 years old, the same age as Tony when his father went away.

"I completely saw myself in that kid," he says. "I prayed he wouldn't have to endure what I endured without my father -- that was the premise for Sons of Life. ... I wanted to help some kids in my situation make it."

Tony, whose day job involves developing job skills for ex-offenders, mentors 10 young men ages 9 to 21 through his program. He organizes field trips to the White House, sporting events, and dinners. He aims to expose the young men to possibility and opportunity.

Tony also helps families buy Christmas and birthday gifts and school supplies, stepping in where their fathers can't. In collaboration with his father, who is still in prison in Maryland, Tony has also organized family prison trips for children in need of transportation to detention centers.

Tony is like a big brother to Sons of Life participants Xavier and Delfon. "He goes to our football events, basketball games," says 14-year-old Delfon. "It makes me feel like actually cares."

According to Joyce Arditti, professor of human development at Virginia Tech and author of "Parental Incarceration and the Family," children of incarcerated parents are unique when compared with those who have endured other forms of parent separation such as divorce or death.

It's difficult for the remaining parent to find coping resources for children living with the stress of having a parent behind bars, she says, adding that programs like Sons of Life can be effective. "Insider status is very important," she says. "Therapy that is typically successful for children of incarcerated parents are programs that closely model their day to day experience."
