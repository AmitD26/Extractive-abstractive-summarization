(CNN) -- Alaskan authorities say there's no evidence to back up a 19-year-old Pennsylvania woman's claim that one of the countless killings she carried out was in their state.

"At this time the Alaska State Troopers are not aware of any information -- beyond Barbour's comments quoted in the press -- or evidence that would implicate Barbour with a homicide committed in Alaska," a statement from the agency said.

The agency said it has been in contact with Pennsylvania authorities.

"We will follow up on any credible lead that is provided to us," the statement said.

Claims invite skepticism

If her other claims are true, Barbour would be one of the nation's most prolific serial killers.

Gary Ridgway, known as the Green River Killer, pleaded guilty to killing 49 women in Washington state in the 1980s and 1990s. Randy Steven Kraft may have killed as many as 65 young men in the 1970s and early 1980s.

Even the prosecutor who hopes to convict the couple, Northumberland County District Attorney Tony Rosini, said he discounts Barbour's other claims.

"As of this date, there has been no verification of any of the information that has been subject of media coverage regarding prior acts of the defendant, Miranda Barbour," Rosini said in a statement.

"Any information regarding crimes committed in other jurisdictions has been or will be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agencies and the FBI for further investigation," he said.
