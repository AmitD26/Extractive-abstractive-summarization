New York (CNN) -- Prosecutors said Friday they treating an incident in which a woman allegedly killed herself and her three young children by driving her minivan into the Hudson River as a triple murder and suicide.

"Based on all the information available, there is no one else who can be held criminally liable in this case," said Orange County District Attorney Frank Phillips in a statement.

Police say an investigation into the incident suggests that the mother intentionally drove the vehicle into the Hudson in Newburgh, New York, some 60 miles north of New York City.

"He kept saying, 'It's my fault,' " Meave Ryan recalled.

The boy, hoisted himself out of the van's driver-side window Tuesday night, swam to shore and then flagged down Ryan by the side of a road.

"He said, 'Mom just drove the car into the water,' " she added.

Ryan said she and the boy drove to the scene, wading into the water to look for survivors.

"She just speeded up and went into the water," Ryan added, recounting what Lashaun had told her.

The boy eventually recalled to Ryan that, as the car was moving, his mother climbed into the back seat and "had all her children cradled in her arms."

Lashaun told Ryan that he resisted and broke free, yelling out the window for help.

Ryan said the boy told her that as he was trying to escape, "maybe (his mother) had a break of reality," and she then cried out, "Oh, my God, I made a mistake."

She then climbed back into the front seat, the boy told Ryan.

It took responders an hour of searching, using dive teams and a circling helicopter, to find the four bodies and the van submerged in eight feet of water, according to Fire Chief Michael Vatter.

Authorities declined to identify the relative.

Meanwhile, Newburgh Mayor Nicholas Valentine said Tuesday's incident is certain to have "a lasting effect on this city."

A neighbor, Christine Santos, said she "would never have imagined (Armstrong) to do this to her kids."

"To them little babies. I would have never have imagined. I'm in shock," Santos added.

Ryan said Lashaun -- the lone survivor -- is wracked with guilt that he wasn't able to unbuckle his baby sister or teach his two brothers to swim.

"He blames himself," Ryan said of Lashaun, who told her he only learned to swim last year. "That's the sad part."
