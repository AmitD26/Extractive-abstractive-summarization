(CNN) -- He's back -- Lionel Messi returned to action with his customary goal spree following a 59-day absence as Barcelona crushed Getafe 4-0 Wednesday.

Messi, who has been sidelined since November 10 with a torn hamstring, scored twice during a cameo appearance in the second half of the Spanish Cup tie.

The Argentine, who had scored 14 times in 16 appearances before his goals at the Camp Nou, has endured a frustrating season with injuries.

But he gave a brief indication of his return to fitness with a fine second individual effort.

Messi's two goals came after Cesc Fabregas had also scored twice as Barcelona took control of the last-16 contest.

He faces strong competition from Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo and Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery.

Alonso

Meanwhile, Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso ended speculation surrounding his future by signing a new two-year deal.

"This will continue to be my home for two more years. I am very happy to tell you. Come on Madrid!" he posted on his official Twitter account, alongside a photo of the Santiago Bernabeu.

"Real Madrid can announce the extension of Xabi Alonso's contract, that will keep him tied to the club for two more years until June 30, 2016," the club added in a statement on their website.

City has won all 10 of its Premier League home games this season and has scored 92 goals in its 31 games so far.

"It's not easy to win 5-0 at home against another Premier League team," Dzeko told Sky Sports.
