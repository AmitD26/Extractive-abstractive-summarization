"The first stage was the local Chinese embassy asking us to withdraw the film," festival director Richard Moore said Sunday. "The second was to find a way for other Chinese films to withdraw from the festival -- five did so. We believe that this is probably not the end of it."

Organizers have also been "bombarded" with threatening e-mails, Moore said.  Watch Moore discuss the harassment Â»

The first attacks came soon after the festival opened Saturday. Several others followed throughout the day.

In one, visitors to the site were greeted with a pop-up message that said: "We like film but we hate Rebiya Kadeer."

The message was accompanied by a Chinese flag and ended with: "Please apologize to all the Chinese people."

That attack was traced to an IT professional in Shanghai, China, Moore said.

"He admitted hacking the site. He said he was acting as a private citizen and was protesting the film," he said.

Authorities are investigating the source of the other attacks, but they appeared to be from different sources.

"We're managing to plug leaks as fast as we can," Moore said.

The first screening of the documentary takes place Sunday night. The filmmakers have invited Kadeer to attend another screening, scheduled for early August.

"Every year, there's some level of controversy, from pro-life or anti-death (penalty) sort of position. We've never had an incident of an international scale before," Moore said. "The timing has absolutely been a critical one."

The rioting in the Xinjiang region earlier this month stemmed from a brawl between Uyghur and Han workers at a toy factory in another part of China. Han make up the majority population in China -- and many Uyghurs resent the presence of Han in Xinjiang, many of whom came looking for work.
