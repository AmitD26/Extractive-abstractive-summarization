Witnesses said the blast happened at about 8:00 a.m., when traffic was beginning to build at the roundabout, causing a major fire that engulfed vehicles and shops lining the streets.

A "rescue operation is still ongoing, which means the toll may change. We have also evacuated several people with injuries from the explosion," Kolo said.

"I saw several people lying lifeless on the street with six cars and three motorized rickshaws burning," said resident Ibrahim Mustapha.

Most of the victims were elderly women selling peanuts and kola nuts by the roadside and poor boys, Kolo said.

It is a custom in Maiduguri for residents to buy peanuts every morning and give them out as alms to poor boys begging on the streets.

The women vendors come out early in the morning and line the streets with their wares, waiting for residents leaving for work, while the child beggars mill around waiting for a generous buyer, Mustapha said.

The mobs attacked and slightly injured four firefighters trying to quench the inferno at the scene, accusing them of not deploying fast enough to battle the fire.

Maiduguri has witnessed relative calm since last year, when local vigilantes sprang up and chased out Boko Haram insurgents into the bush, ending near-daily deadly bombing and shooting attacks.

The city has however witnessed isolated bombings and deadly attacks blamed on Boko Haram.
