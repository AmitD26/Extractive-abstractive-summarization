(CNN) -- Crowds of angry Muslims attacked Buddhist shrines and homes, torching some of them Sunday in Bangladesh to protest after a photo of a partially burned Quran was posted on Facebook, police said.

The violence began in Ramu in Cox's Bazar, a town south of the capital Dhaka on the coast, early Sunday and it spread in the adjacent areas through Sunday evening, Jainul Bari, administrative chief of the tourist district, told CNN.

"Now the situation is under control," Jahangir said.

Bangladesh Home Minister Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, who visited the scene of the violence Sunday, said blamed the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party for the attacks. The minister said the violence was planned, citing evidence of gunpowder and petrol found in the burnt monasteries and houses.

The government formed a committee to investigate the violence, with a report due in 10 days.

The south Asian nation is about 90% Muslim, the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life estimated in its 2011 survey of the global Muslim population.

It is less than 1% Buddhist.

Relatively peaceful Bangladesh was one of many countries that saw demonstrations recently against the online video "The Innocence of Muslims," which portrays the prophet Mohammed as a womanizer and child abuser.
