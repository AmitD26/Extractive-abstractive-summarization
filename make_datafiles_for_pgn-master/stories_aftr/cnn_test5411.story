(CNN) -- Two sailors have died after the Navy helicopter they were in crashed Wednesday off the southern Virginia coast, the Navy said.

The Coast Guard, Virginia Beach Fire Department and Navy continued Wednesday night to search for another sailor who'd been aboard the fallen aircraft. Two sailors who had been rescued were in stable condition at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, the Navy said in a statement.

"Today has been a tough day for all of us," said Capt. Todd Flannery, commander of the Navy's Helicopter Sea Combat Wing Atlantic, based in Norfolk, Virginia.

Flannery made that comment late Wednesday afternoon, hours before the Navy announced the second fatality in the crash in ice-cold waters about 18 nautical miles (21 miles) east of Cape Henry.

At the time, he said two injured sailors were stable, while another was preparing to undergo surgery at the Norfolk hospital.

Speaking then about those aboard two Coast Guard boats among those participating in the search," Coast Guard Capt. John Little said, "They could not see the helicopter, but they are continuing to search."

The first apparent sign of trouble came around 10:45 a.m., when the aircraft's crew issued a distress call.

The air temperature was 28 degrees and the water temperature was 41 degrees, with 1- to 2-foot seas, Coast Guard spokesman Nyx Cangemi said.

The sailors were hoisted up two-apiece in two rounds -- the first pair 10 minutes after the rescuers' arrival, and the other set at 11:38 a.m., said the Navy captain. They were quickly transported to the Norfolk hospital. Flannery said he was not sure whether the first confirmed fatality died en route to or at the hospital.

The 87-foot Coast Guard Cutter Shearwater happened to be in the area at the time.

"They did not see the crash -- they were that far away -- but heard it and heard our call for assistance and immediately responded," said Little of the Coast Guard.

The MH-53E Sea Dragon carries no weapons. It has two pilots and a crew of one to six, depending on its mission, according to the Navy. There were 31 of the aircraft in operation, it said. Its role includes anti-mine operations.

Flannery didn't detail the information communicated in Wednesday's distress call or what may have caused the helicopter to go down, saying that an investigation board will be looking into that.
