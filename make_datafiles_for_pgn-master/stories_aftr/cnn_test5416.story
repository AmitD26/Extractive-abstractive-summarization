Congress approved a budget plan Wednesday, President Obama's 100th day in office.

The spending plan passed without a single Republican vote in either the House or Senate.

The Senate voted for the plan 53-43. Four Democrats, including recent party-switcher Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, voted against it.

The measure passed two days after congressional Democrats reached an agreement reconciling House and Senate versions of the budget package.

Republicans said the budget reflected reckless taxing and spending priorities that would leave the country in a more fiscally precarious position.

"Budgets are supposed to be about tough decisions, and there are no tough decisions in this budget," said House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio.

In one of the most contentious and politically polarizing decisions this year, Democratic budget negotiators decided to fast-track a key part of the budget process.

Major health care reform is likely to pass this year because the special process, known as budget reconciliation, won't allow Republicans to filibuster the legislation, as was widely expected.

Democrats, who control 59 seats in the Senate, will be able to pass it with a simple majority vote instead of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster.

Under the Democratic plan, the federal government will run an anticipated deficit of $1.2 trillion in the next fiscal year. Their plan promises to cut the deficit by more than half by 2012.

"It is clear that more will be needed to address the long-term fiscal imbalance confronting the nation beyond the five-year budget window," Conrad said.

The measure also allows former President George W. Bush's tax cuts for couples who make more than $250,000 to expire in 2010.

In an additional nod to her caucus's conservatives, Pelosi and House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer sent a letter to Senate leaders "throwing down the gauntlet" to insist that a pay-as-you-go system be followed, which would require new federal spending to be offset with budget cuts or tax increases, a Democratic aide said.

In the context of the federal budget, $100 million in savings is a tiny amount, critics say. It is the equivalent, according to one example, of having a car dealer offer to shave $1 from the cost of a $36,700 vehicle.

"Any amount of savings is obviously welcome," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said at the time. "But [$100 million is] about the average amount we'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year."

White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said ordinary Americans would nevertheless appreciate the savings effort.

"Only in Washington, D.C., is $100 million not a lot of money. It is where I'm from. It is where I grew up. And I think it is for hundreds of millions of Americans."
