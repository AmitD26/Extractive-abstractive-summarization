Matthew McConaughey as "David Wooderson"  Then: David Wooderson was that slimy older dude who was working for the city by day and partying at the Moon Tower by night. Even with the creepy 'stache and the skin-tight pants, he still managed to exude sex appeal.  Now: Matthew is still exuding sex appeal as a rom-com king in movies such as "How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days," "Fool's Gold," and "Failure to Launch." Yup, he does his best work with his shirt off.

Ben Affleck as "Fred O'Bannion"  Then: "Fafffleck" ("fat Affleck") played haze-happy, fifth-year senior Fred O'Bannion.  Now: Ben is much thinner, much hotter, much richer, and much more famous now. He's an A-List movie star married to another A-List movie star, Jennifer Garner. If you haven't heard of him or don't know what he's been up to lately, then you've been living in an isolated cave since 1993.

Marissa Ribisi as "Cynthia Dunn"  Then: Cynthia Dunn was the apple of Wooderson's eye as the smart chick with a red afro that she combed with a pick.  Now: Marissa, twin sister of actor Giovanni Ribisi, has had reasonable success in her career since the film came out. She guest starred on "Friends" and "Felicity," and co-wrote her own film in 1998 called "Some Girl." However, for the last few years she's stepped away from the spotlight and has focused on her marriage to musician Beck. Coincidentally, Marisa was delivered as a baby by Beck's mother; the two were both raised Scientologists and are raising their own children, son Cosimo and daughter Tuesday, as Xenuphiles as well. Ribisi also has a clothing line, Whitley Kros, which launched in 2007.

Adam Goldberg as "Mike Newhouse"  Then: Every high school has a token misanthrope who just wants to dance but ends up getting in a fight by calling someone a "male dominant monkey [expletive]....." Mike Newhouse did the honors at Lee High.  Now: Adam is certainly no misanthrope in the entertainment industry. He made a name for himself with his neurotic charm appearing in a bajillion things, including "Saving Private Ryan," "A Beautiful Mind," "Entourage," or "2 Days In Paris" with Julie Delphy whom he also dated.

Jason London as "Randall 'Pink' Floyd"  Then: Randall "Pink" Floyd was the hot football player with a rebellious streak. Yum.  Now: Don't get Jason confused with his twin brother Jeremy, the one with the drug problem. Jason is on the straight and narrow and has continued to act since the film. You may have seen him on "7th Heaven," "Grey's Anatomy" or, most recently, "NCIS."

Joey Lauren Adams as "Simone Kerr"  Then: Pink's girlfriend, actress Simone Kerr, did not go around inhaling helium balloons. That was just Joey Lauren Adam's natural voice.  Now: We remember Joey best as lesbian Alyssa Jones in "Chasing Amy," which Ben Affleck co-starred in. Most recently you may have seen her in "The Breakup" or as Pammy in the "United States of Tara" starring Toni Collette.

Wiley Wiggins as "Mitch Kramer"  Then: Oh, Mitch Kramer. Mitchy, Mitchy, Mitchy. What a crush we had on that little nose-grabbin' freshman just trying to avoid his hazing and make it with the ladies.  Now: Wiley's all grown up now. You can find him acting in films, writing, making art, or doing web design in Austin, Texas. You can follow him on Twitter but he'll punch your face if you ask him to touch his nose ... according to his bio. Darn.

Christin Hinojosa as "Sabrina Davis"  Then: Sabrina Davis was the lucky freshman chick that the older kids took a shine to.  Now: Christin left behind her acting career after a brief appearance in "Clueless" the television show and became an anti-war activist. She's married and lives in Oakland.

Rory Cochrane as "Ron Slater"  Then: Lovable Ron Slater was the long-haired hippie always ready with a silly catchphrase at the ready like, "Hey man ... are you cool?" or "Check ya later." Now: Since the movie, Rory has done relatively well for himself, appearing in "Empire Records" alongside his "Dazed and Confused" costars Ben Affleck, Jason London, and Renee Zellweger-who made a cameo in the film and was his live-in girlfriend for four years-as well as the Richard Linklater film "A Scanner Darkly." Most recently he was in the movie "Public Enemies" with Johnny Depp and a series regular on "24" and "CSI: Miami." He's reuniting with another one of his "Dazed" costars, Milla Jovovich, in the 2011 film "Bringing Up Bobby" written by actress Famke Janssen.

Anthony Rapp as "Tony Olson"  Then: Why wouldn't Sabrina fall for the sweet, sensitive intellectual Tony Olson? He was dreamy.  Now: While Anthony continues to do some film and television, he has achieved major success in the theater world. You may have seen him as struggling musician Mark Cohen in "Rent," both the original Broadway production and the film.

Michelle Burke as "Jodi Kramer"  Then: Jodi Kramer was Mitch's sexy, two-timing, meddling older sis.  Now: Currently, Michelle is working on a movie with Miley Cyrus, Demi Moore, Ashley Greene, and Thomas Jane called "LOL: Laughing Out Loud." Gee, I really hope the film lives up to its title. If Michelle is as funny as she was as Connie Conehead on film, everything should be fine.
