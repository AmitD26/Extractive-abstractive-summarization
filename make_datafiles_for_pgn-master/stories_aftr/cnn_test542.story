Boulder City, Nevada (CNN) -- Driving across the stark Nevada desert at 75 miles an hour, you don't expect to find much.

Then, off in the distance, I see something shiny. More than shiny; it is positively gleaming.

"First, there is a lot of available, flat land," Crider says. "Second, it is incredibly sunny. This region gets about 330 days of sunshine per year. And third, there's existing transmission lines which provide access to major markets throughout the western United States."

Which, as is so often the case, raises another question: Why are those lines way out here?

To find that answer, you have to drive 20 minutes to struggling Boulder City, population about 16,000. The town is uniquely poised to cash in on the new energy boom precisely because it was built on old energy technology; during another time when the economy and energy collided; when thousands of jobless men came here during the Great Depression to undertake an unprecedented power-generating project.

"This town is here because it was a federal reservation to build Hoover Dam."

That's Duncan McCoy. He's a member of the city council and has a background in history. He has watched his town get hammered by the recession. Tourists aren't coming to the dam just east of town like they once did. The value of local houses has plunged.

"Our local sales tax revenue is down," he says, shaking his head. "That's a major portion of our budget. Our property tax revenues are down."

"This year, we'll get about two-and-a-half million dollars. That's about 11 percent of our city's general fund budget," McCoy says. "That's pretty important money, and we can count on it."

Sempra is not alone. Nevada is aggressively courting more solar firms, convinced that if they can get enough into place, the whole state can benefit from being a major green energy source for neighboring super state California.
