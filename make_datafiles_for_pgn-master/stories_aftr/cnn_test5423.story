(CNN) -- A Canadian woman on trial for allegedly stalking Alec Baldwin described a romantic date with the actor that she says ended with sex and a promise of lifelong omelets.

Sabourin's impatience earned her a contempt of court citation and 30-day jail term Wednesday morning as she repeatedly interrupted another witness, saying at times "I want to testify."

Sabourin, an aspiring actress, heckled, "You're lying!"

The actor's wife, Hilaria Baldwin, who was then engaged to him, told the doorman that Sabourin was a stalker and that she would call police, he testified. Sabourin called Hilaria a prostitute and another derogatory term before leaving the building, the doorman said.

She says she's not a stalker, but an ex-girlfriend of the "30 Rock" television star.

Baldwin picked her up at her hotel at 7:30 p.m. and the couple attended a Broadway play, she testified. Afterward, they shared an intimate dinner, eating off of each other's plate, she said. She drank chardonnay, while Baldwin had water.

"I make the best omelets in the world and I'd be happy to make you omelets every morning for the rest of your life," she said he said.

But Baldwin testified that she imagined the relationship, and she sent him numerous e-mails and voice mails along the way. CNN obtained copies of the e-mails.

"I am less than 10 minutes away from you tonight. Say 'I do' to me," one e-mail says.

In another e-mail, she said she was ready to get married.

"I need to start my new life with my new name ... in my new country, help my newly husband, you!"

In another e-mail, she admits defeat.

Days later, she allegedly crashed an event the actor was hosting at New York City`s Lincoln Center.

Baldwin has admitted they had dinner once in 2010, but said that was it. They met through a mutual friend, he said.

Both Baldwin and Sabourin worked on the 2002 flop "The Adventures of Pluto Nash." Baldwin has also appeared in numerous other movies, including "Along Came Polly."

His past is checkered with various conflicts including an infamous berating of his then young daughter Ireland in 2007 as a "rude, thoughtless little pig," a run in with American Airlines over his playing Words with Friends on a flight, and various scuffles with paparazzi.

Unlike the actor, who didn't say a word about the case to reporters, Sabourin is basking in the media spotlight. She grinned widely as she shared her side of the story with a group of reporters.

Sabourin has been arrested several times, including late last year for violating a court order by allegedly sending a series of tweets to Baldwin and his wife.

She was released from jail after a judge rejected a prosecution request for bail.

If found guilty on the stalking charge, she faces up to a year in prison.
