(CNN) -- Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba confirmed his switch to China's Shanghai Shenhua on Wednesday, a move which will reunite him with former Chelsea teammate Nicolas Anelka.

The two-time African footballer of the year will reportedly be paid Â£200,000 ($315,000) a week, which would make him China's highest-paid player.

"I hope to help promote Chinese football around the world and further improve the links between China and Africa."

Former France international Anelka made the move from Stamford Bridge to Shanghai in January and even had a brief spell as the team's coach following Jean Tigana's exit in April.

Former Argentina coach Sergio Batista is now in charge of the team, and he is looking forward to working with former Marseille star Drogba.

"Drogba is a very good soccer player, his outstanding skills and amazing experience will give us motivation to improve our games," said Argentina's 1986 World Cup winner.

"It is my honor to invite him to join in our team. At last I have to say that the club owner Zhu Jun did his utmost to bring Drogba to Shenhua."

"We have been wanting to sign Didier for a while, and are very happy that it has finally happened," said Zhu.

"Shanghai is one of the most influential cities in the world, and we are very excited to welcome Didier here."

Drogba and Anelka are two of a number of soccer stars to have joined China's premier football competition.
