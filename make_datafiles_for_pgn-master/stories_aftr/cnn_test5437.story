(RealSimple.com) -- Invest in these designs now, and the pros say they'll be coveted collectibles one day.

Great indoors or outdoors, this chair is a refreshing twist on the 250-year-old Louis XVI version, a court of Versailles staple that had a huge impact on furniture design.

To buy: $400, exitartcatalog.stores.yahoo.net.

The backstory: French designer Starck, the man behind boutique hotels like the Delano, in Miami Beach, joined forces with Italian furniture manufacturer Kartell in 2002 to create this beauty, which is made by injecting molten plastic into a mold (so it has no seams). It resides in the Philadelphia Museum of Art's permanent collection.

What design pros say: "Starck's a design genius," says Jeffrey Beers, founder and CEO of Jeffrey Beers International, and architecture and design firm in New York City. "This chair will certainly appreciate tenfold in 25 to 30 years."

What design pros say: "Everything Hermès stands for is about quality and timelessness," says Ralph Pucci, owner of Pucci International showrooms.

With a sturdy maple hardwood frame, this sofa will last for generations. Reminiscent of midcentury modern Danish and Scandinavian designs, it mixes a traditional camelback style with contemporary, clean lines to create a timeless look.

5. Rug by Madeline Weinrib

This handwoven cotton rug is reversible and features an interpretation of an endless knot, a Buddhist symbol that represents unity or eternity. In textiles, the motif is typically seen as part of a larger pattern, but this version celebrates it on its own.

The backstory: Designer Weinrib, whose great-grandfather founded ABC Carpet & Home, created the Megan rug in 2005. She also designs home accessories.

What design pros say: "It's the perfect blend of minimalist design and maximal color," says Celerie Kemble, an interior designer in New York City. "When that's done right, it can become iconic."

6. Throw Pillows by Jonathan Adler

To buy: $110 (Diamonds) to $145 (Flame), jonathanadler.com.

What design pros say: "Adler is so well-known that having one of his pillows has its own cachet," says Lisa S. Roberts, an antiques connoisseur in Philadelphia. "In 25 years, they'll be collectible, because they're from his original line."

The backstory: Designer Christopher Gow first saw these shells in 1993 -- they were being produced in the Italian silver factory of his friend Giampiero Ruzzetti. "I would bring them back to the United States as wedding gifts," says Gow, "and people went crazy for them." The duo began exporting them in 1996.

What design pros say: "Who knows what silver is going to be worth in 50 years?" says Chip Cordelli, a furniture dealer and prop and interior stylist in Brooklyn. "I think it will be something really special."
