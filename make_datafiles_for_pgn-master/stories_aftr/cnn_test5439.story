(CNN) -- France is an impressive country.

And nobody knows it better than the French.

There are sophisticated cities, sunny seashores, snowy mountains and wooded valleys all in one country.

And sex.

1. Cheese

Yes, it's a cliché but France remains the ultimate destination for cheese lovers.

General de Gaulle once asked how he was meant to govern a country that produced 246 varieties of cheese.

No one's arguing against the existence of great cheeses around the world -- but no French citizen needs to go much further than the corner shop to find one.

2. Shopping

The annual sales in January and at the end of June offer unbelievable bargains because by law all stores have to discount prices at the same time and compete for business.

The French also do quirky, one-off boutiques probably better than anyone else.

Paris, of course, is home to perhaps the world's best known museum, the Louvre.

But French museum culture spreads much wider afield.

The Loire region has what is arguably the most beautiful collection of museums in the world -- its chateaux include the huge Chambord, with a spectacular collection of tapestries, and the impossibly romantic Chenonceau, astride its moat.

You can almost hear Joan of Arc riding up to the gate and offering to kick the English invaders out of France.

4. Trains

French trains are faster than planes.

Three hours later, you'll be sipping rosé and gazing at billionaires' yachts while the fliers are still putting in a claim for their lost luggage.

TGVs crisscross the country, and the SNCF (French national railways) offers excellent online deals -- first class for just a little more than second.

The average French driver's notion of etiquette is a strong but terrifying one: I'm going that way, and you can't stop me.

If going where he or she wants to means causing an accident or total gridlock, that's everyone else's fault, non?

The unwillingness to acknowledge any other car on the roads -- the supreme French belief in liberté incarnated in the automobile -- means that on every Saturday in summer, and on national holidays, the whole country is transformed into a huge traffic jam as everyone drives to or from their vacation at exactly the same time.

6. Politeness

Aren't they notoriously abrupt, especially Parisians when addressing non-French-speaking tourists?

More accurately, the French have mastered the art of being impeccably polite and startlingly dismissive at the same time.

When a posh maître d' raises one eyebrow and oozes "Monsieur?" or "Madame?" at you, he's simultaneously respecting you and questioning your right to exist.

But if you get the hang of French politeness, anything is possible.

The golden rule is simple: you should begin every conversation with a bright "bonjour!" ("bonsoir!" in the evening).

This doesn't just mean hello.

All that in one magic word -- and it works.

7. Sexiness

It's hard to pin down sexiness but, for many, "being French" is a good working definition.

When you think of luxury goods, the word "French" slips almost automatically into place.

Today, the French talent for luxury has trickled down beyond Louis Vuitton, Dior, Moët et Chandon and the rest.

French light-touch sophistication has been copied worldwide.

Related to "politeness," but with an important retail distinction.

The same goes for the snooty department store saleswoman.

Unlike in other countries, such jobs in France can still be lifelong careers, bringing a lifetime's worth of skills.

The thing to do is soldier on, smile and inform your server what you want.

The French respect people who know what they want, and will do their best to help you get it (as long as it's not just before their lunchtime, of course.)

France has the world's best policy on globalization -- it spends so much time complaining that foreign invaders are killing off its economy that no one notices how French products are taking over the planet.

Especially if you live in Europe, there's a strong chance you'll find a French multinational, such as EDF, Transdev, Sodexo or JCDecaux.

That's not to mention the countless French brands on every shopping street in the world.

Next time a French person tells you Hollywood is destroying French culture, just point to the nearest public toilet.

Stephen Clarke's (@sclarkewriter) books about France include "A Year in the Merde" and "Talk to the Snail: Ten Commandments for Understanding the French."
