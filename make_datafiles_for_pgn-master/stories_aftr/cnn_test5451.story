London (CNN) -- London's Metropolitan Police was under fire Friday after 10 cases involving alleged racism by police officers were referred to the independent police watchdog for investigation.

The 10 cases involve about 20 police officers and one staff member, a police spokesman said.

"I want to reiterate -- there is no room for racism in the Met," he said.

A government inquiry ordered in the wake of a bungled investigation into the murder of a black teenager nearly 20 years ago labeled the Metropolitan Police force "institutionally racist" and a raft of recommendations were made to stamp out the issue.

The complaints commission said three of the cases under investigation involve officers in Newham, east London.

The three officers involved have been suspended, the watchdog said.

IPCC commissioner Mike Franklin said many members of the public would be concerned that Newham officers were accused in more than one case.

"Undoubtedly, these are very serious allegations and I would like to reassure the Newham community and wider public, that we are conducting a full, thorough and independent investigation to establish the facts behind these allegations," he said.

Mackey said the vast majority of the force's 50,000 or so staff, including 32,000 officers, "act with the professionalism and high standards we expect," and that unacceptable behavior would be challenged.

"The Met does not tolerate racism."

The National Black Police Association said last week that the decision by prosecutors not to act on the claims of assault and racist remarks against three officers highlighted the issue of racism and the criminal justice system.

The association is "deeply concerned that this issue undermines efforts to build and maintain trust and confidence of communities grappling with the impact of serious violent crime and escalating hate crimes," it said in a statement.
