Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi government claimed gains in its fight against militants Tuesday, a day full of dizzying developments.

Ninety U.S. military advisers arrived in Iraq on Tuesday as part of the mission President Barack Obama announced last week, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said.

U.S. military personnel are supposed to assess the situation on the ground and then "advise and assist" Iraqi military forces as they try to counter the threat from ISIS militants, Kirby said.

Fight for Baiji oil refinery

Iraqi security forces are still fighting ISIS and allied Sunni insurgents at the Baiji oil refinery, Hussain al-Shahristani, the deputy prime of energy affairs, said in a statement released Tuesday.

He refuted Arab and Western reports that the oil refinery had fallen into the hands of ISIS, saying they were spreading propaganda for ISIS.

Late Monday, three separate security sources told CNN that ISIS fighters were in control of the Baiji refinery, the sprawling complex that provides much of the fuel needed for domestic consumption.

State-run TV reported Iraqi special forces involved in the fight for the refinery killed a militant leader called Abu Qatada. It offered no evidence of the death, nor did it detail how he was killed.

CNN cannot independently confirm any of the claims.

The competing claims follow days of reports of a seesaw battle for control of the refinery complex in northern Salaheddin province, about 193 kilometers (120 miles) north of Baghdad.

Kirkuk city council leader killed

The belief is ISIS is currently functioning as an "increasingly capable military force" with "capability and dexterity," one official said.

The answer lies, officials say, in whether the current support of some Sunnis is a so-called marriage of convenience or a long-term partnership even though the Sunni tribes, to a large extent, do not support the ISIS agenda.

Al-Nouman offered no evidence of the deaths, and CNN cannot independently confirm the claim.

ISIS fighters seized Tikrit during its lightning advance in northern Iraq earlier this month.

The Iraqi military began an offensive against Tikrit on Sunday, according to reports on Iraqiya TV.

Government paychecks

Those living in areas "outside of government control" will still be paid, but their paychecks will be held and released when military operations end, it said.

The Cabinet, according to the statement, has decided to given an "open holiday" to government employees who live in areas under the complete control of ISIS fighters and allied Sunni militants.

Civilian deaths climb

The number of casualties "should be viewed very much as a minimum," and it includes verified summary executions and extra-judicial killings of civilians, police and soldiers, UNAMI said.

The casualties occurred in Nineveh, Diyala and Salaheddin provinces, the agency said.

At least another 318 people were killed, and a further 590 injured during the same period in Baghdad and areas in the south, many of them as a result of at least six separate car bombs, the agency added.

Military spokesman: Iraq regains control of two border crossings

Atta, Iraq's military spokesman, said Iraqi security forces have regained control of two key border crossings after briefing losing them.

In a briefing aired on state TV, Atta said Iraqi forces, with the help of Sunni local tribes, retook al-Walid, a border town that connects Iraq with Syria. He also said Iraqi forces have retaken the Trebil bordering crossing between Iraq and Jordan.

Atta also said Iraqi forces controlled the area between Samarra and the northern border of Baghdad.

He also said fighting continues in northern Babylon province, south of Baghdad, with ISIS elements. Atta did not detail the fighting nor did he say when it started.

He offered no evidence of the claims, and CNN cannot independently confirm the report.

CNN's Barbara Starr and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.
