The news comes fresh on the heels of an announcement that Martin, front man for the Grammy-winning band Coldplay, will be joining the hit NBC singing reality show "The Voice." It also comes days after a report in the Los Angeles Times that the pair had purchased a $14 million John Lautner-designed home in Malibu, California.

The couple have been married for more than a decade and are the parents of two children, Apple and Moses. Paltrow and Martin asked for privacy for their family in their statement.

"We are, however, and always will be a family, and in many ways, we are closer than we have ever been," they said. "We are parents first and foremost, to two incredibly wonderful children and we ask for their and our space and privacy to be respected at this difficult time.

"We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner."

The statement was signed, "Love, Gwyneth & Chris."

"Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin are getting divorced, citing "insufferable similarities," wrote one Twitter user. Another wrote, "Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow have split up. Guess he's finally sick of talking to her and her referring to herself in the 3rd person."

What does "Conscious Uncoupling" mean?
