(CNN) -- Three woman in the Dominican Republic were paid to claim, falsely, that they had sex with U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, police said in a statement Monday.

Galvan has previously said that another lawyer asked him to assist in a divorce case by finding "witnesses" to claim they had sex with Menendez for money.

Attempts to contact Figueroa on Monday were unsuccessful.

For their services, two of the women received a bit more than $400. The third woman was paid close to $300, police said.

Confessions shows sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says

The Daily Caller, a conservative website, first published the report shortly before the November election, citing a video with two women claiming they had sex with Menendez for money.

She urged authorities in the United States to investigate the case.

Menendez told CNN in January that the claims he'd partied with prostitutes were "absolutely false," calling the allegations "smears."

Menendez faces scrutiny over ties to Florida doctor

Melgen, his wife, Flor, and his daughter, Melissa, have been generous donors to Menendez, his fellow Democrats and related causes in recent years.

Asked if he used his influence to help Melgen, Menendez told Bash: "I have always advocated for issues and I have advocated for policies, and that's what I have done across the board."
