Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to collect intelligence on Syrian training camps and Americans returning from Syria amid concern that U.S. citizens fighting alongside extremists might later conduct attacks back home.

"In some ways, it's more frightening than anything I think I've seen as attorney general," he said. "This is a situation that we can see developing and the potential that I see coming up, the negative potential I see coming out of the facts in Syria and Iraq now, are quite concerning," he said.

The FBI has dozens of investigations of Americans under way in the United States as the government tries to identify potential suspects even before they travel to Syria so they know if they come back.

U.S. officials tell CNN that not all potential suspects are on the no-fly list -- making it harder for investigators to track them.

Adding to the worries: thousands of fighters in Syria with European passports who are able to enter the United States. Officials say not all European countries are sharing the names of all of their suspect citizens.

U.S. officials said it was a wake-up call that borders can be readily crossed.

Meanwhile, the Transportation Security Administration said this month that security screeners at overseas airports may ask U.S.-bound passengers to turn on their cell phones and other electronics to prove they work and aren't explosive devices. The change is part of an update to security measures aimed at combating potential new threats from terrorists in the Middle East and Europe.

CNN's Pamela Brown, Evan Perez and Dana Ford contributed to this report.
