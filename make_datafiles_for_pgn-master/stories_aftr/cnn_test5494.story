In an interview with NBC's "Today" show set to be broadcast Thursday morning, Anderson describes the time she spent with alleged kidnapper James DiMaggio in his house about an hour east of San Diego.

Anderson says DiMaggio sat her down on a couch, handcuffed her, zip-tied her feet and revealed his plan to kidnap her and take her to Idaho. The day quickly took an even darker turn, Anderson told "Today," describing how DiMaggio encouraged her to play Russian roulette with him, using a real gun.

Police later found the bodies of her mother and brother at DiMaggio's burned home.

An FBI agent shot him dead and Hannah, 16, was returned to her family in Southern California.

Anderson, meanwhile, told "Today" that thinking about her abductor makes her "disgusted" and "angry," according to quotes from the interview published on the morning show's website.

But learning more about the Amber Alert issued by authorities as they searched for her, she said, has helped her recovery.

"It helped me keep going through healing," she said, "knowing that people were looking for me and that they're on my side."
