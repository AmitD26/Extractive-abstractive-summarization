The Miami-bound Silver Star train had departed New York City on Sunday at 11:02 a.m. with 261 passengers aboard, and it was supposed to arrive just after 5 p.m. in the Richmond, Virginia, area. Instead it arrived there on Monday around 6:45 a.m., according to Amtrak's website.

"The dining car developed axle problems that disabled the train 2 miles north of the Staples Mill Road Station in Richmond around 5:30 p.m. Sunday," said Amtrak spokeswoman Kimberly Woods, via e-mail. "The dining car couldn't be moved or cut out at the scene, because of the axle problems."

"The train began a very slow move (at 3:45 a.m.) to a siding in Richmond and arrived to the station just after 6:30 a.m. and a replacement car was added," she said. "The train resumed its trip around 7:12 a.m." (A siding is a section of track off the main line.)

"If you are a corporation that alienates its customer base, you ain't going to have customers," Smith told CNN affiliate WTVR. "I think Amtrak could have solved this a lot sooner."

Woods encouraged passengers to call 1-800-USA-RAIL for information about refunds and credits.

"A delay of this magnitude is considered rare and we understand the passengers' frustrations from last night's events," she said.
