Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- After intense diplomacy, the government of Mali and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have agreed that troops from the West African regional block can be based in the capital of Bamako, as a step toward ending conflict in the northern part of the country.

"A crisis like this is not solved over night. It takes time and preparation. Though, when that day comes, the Malian army is ready to go in the north," said Togo.

Islamist groups -- some of them with links to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM -- swiftly seized key towns in the vast and scarcely populated north.

Over the last month, the West African regional block has had 3,300 regional troops on standby waiting for a go-ahead from Bamako.

Meanwhile Interim President Dioncounda Traore has opposed a regional force based in Bamako. Capt. Amadou Haya Sanogo, who led a military junta that toppled the government in March, has made it clear that he does not want ECOWAS troops in the south of the country, which he argues is already secured by the Malian military.

Resistance to an actual force in the Malian capital has also come from several groups, outspoken politicians and the Malian people worried about foreign troops flooding into the capital.

The request for 3,000 troops to help defeat the Islamists and regain control of the north will be considered during a meeting chaired by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.

Before the deployment can go ahead, it will need a mandate from the Security Council, which earlier rejected an intervention plan because of a lack of detail.

Following the agreement announced Sunday regarding ECOWAS troops, there are still uncertainties about the details of troop deployment.

"The government is still very disorganized and has not been able to agree with the Malian military regarding troops deployment," said Yabi, from Dakar in neighboring Senegal.

"In any scenario a military intervention will have serious humanitarian implications. To date, there has been very little fighting since government forces fled the north -- for the most part armed groups simply carved up the territory. But once the government in Bamako begins to act, conflict in the north will escalate," said Bertrand Soret at the European Union liazon office in Bamako.

At some point, argues Yabi, the use of force will probably be necessary to neutralize transnational armed groups that indulge in terrorism, jihadism and drug and arms trafficking, and to restore Mali's territorial integrity.

"Minimal and sustainable security in northern Mali cannot be re-established without the clear involvement of the Algerian political and military authorities. This is not something the Malian army and ECOWAS forces will be able to tackle themselves."
