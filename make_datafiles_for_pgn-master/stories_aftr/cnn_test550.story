The audience at Pop! Tech's annual conference rose to its feet as Dr. Jim Olson wrapped up his talk on Tumor Paint.

They believe in him. It's hard not to after listening to the unassuming way he plans to change medicine.

That's why he and his team created Tumor Paint, a product designed to illuminate cancer cells in the body, helping surgeons distinguish them from healthy tissue.

"The key to brain surgery is to remove the bad stuff and leave the good stuff inside," says Dr. Rich Ellenbogen, a neurosurgeon who worked to develop Tumor Paint with Olson. "However, it's not that easy."

While cancerous cells may glow on an MRI, they look remarkably similar to healthy cells during an operation. Only experience -- and luck -- guide surgeons as they try to remove the deadly areas.

Ellenbogen and Olson knew they had to find a way to light tumors up during an operation.

Digging through existing research, Olson found a scientist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who was using venom from an Israeli Deathstalker scorpion to target brain tumors. The venom seemed to bind to the cancerous cells without affecting the healthy tissue.

Olson hypothesized that attaching a molecular flashlight of sorts to the venom would make it easier for surgeons to distinguish good cells from bad.

The first six grant applications Olson submitted to the National Institutes of Health to test his theory were denied for being too over-speculative, or overambitious, he says. Then a hospital administrator introduced him to Rhoda Altom.

Altom's daughter Stewart, then 7, had been diagnosed with a ganglioglioma, a rare type of brain tumor, in her left temporal lobe. Doctors told Altom they would have to take out a large portion of Stewart's brain to make sure they got all the cancer cells.

Altom asked what was being done to find a better way to treat this cancer, but no one had a satisfactory answer. So she went to Seattle Children's Hospital and offered to raise $5 million to get the research going.

Pharmaceutical development is often a dog-eat-dog world, Olson says. Scientists clamor to be the first to identify new medications that can be sold to lots of patients to gain recognition and recoup the money their company has put into the discovery.

"It has to be a huge seller to make it worth it," he says. "No company would make a drug that only affects rare diseases."

Gangliogliomas represent just 4% of all pediatric brain tumors.

Olson and his team were able to identify a small protein, or peptide, in the scorpion's venom and use it to produce Tumor Paint. They grew a brain tumor on a mouse's back and injected the "paint" into a tail vein; within an hour, the cancer was lighting up. Tumor Paint was 500 times more sensitive than an MRI, and it didn't just work for brain cancer but breast, skin, prostate and colon cancers.

Olson founded Blaze Bioscience in 2010 to run human clinical trials and commercialize Tumor Paint. The biotech company is on track to start enrollment for trials in Australia in December, CEO Heather Franklin said.

Sex is doctor's life's work

"First and foremost, I'm a parent," Olson says in a video about Project Violet that was a finalist in the Sundance Film Festival's Focus Forward competition this year. "And when I know a child is going to die, and the prescriptions I'm writing might make them live a couple weeks longer but aren't going to save their lives -- there's nothing harder than that. And that drives my research."

His lab has an open policy -- researchers share everything they learn in hopes of inspiring others. Altom, with other patient families, recently presented Olson with a check for $180,000 to create a library of information from Project Violet that will be available to scientists around the globe.
