(CNN) -- A forensic consultant for the defense of a former Kansas police officer accused of killing his wife testified on Thursday that evidence showing the man had gasoline on his pants could have been contaminated.

Pants collected from Brett Seacat the morning of the incident weren't placed in the appropriate bag, according to Gene Gietzen, the forensic consultant.

Investigators on the scene placed the pants in a paper bag and transferred them to a plastic bag about an hour later. Gietzen says an unlined paint can or a nylon bag is the appropriate transport method for any evidence that may contain an accelerant -- in this case, gasoline. Paper and plastic bags allow the accelerant to escape and can even let accelerant present in the air cross-contaminate evidence, according to Gietzen.

Monte Weldon, a neighbor of the Seacats, also testified on Thursday that he was shocked to learn the couple was splitting up. He approached them in their driveway the day before the incident, wanting to know what he could bring to a barbecue that was originally scheduled for the day Vashti died.

Weldon also testified that Brett Seacat had plans to fix up the home, so he was surprised to hear that Seacat was being accused of burning it down.

"It was such a beautiful house, you couldn't help but talk to him about it," said Weldon. "He loved the house."

Seacat has said he was sleeping downstairs on the night of the fire, HLN affiliate KWCH reported. He heard a noise, and moments later, his wife called him on his cell phone, saying he should get their two boys out of the house before they got hurt.

He reportedly said he found his wife in their bedroom and tried to save her.

Prosecutors say Brett Seacat's story doesn't make sense.

He and the couple's sons escaped from the blaze unharmed.

The Seacats' home in Kingman, Kansas, sits not far from the courthouse where Brett Seacat is standing trial.

Despite extensive fire damage, the house still stands; a brick chimney pokes out of the charred remains.
