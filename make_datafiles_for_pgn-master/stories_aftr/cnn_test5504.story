It often lies dormant in the body for many years, and most of the 11 million people in the United States who have the infection are not even aware of it. The only vaccine has limited effectiveness and is not given in the United States.

They are also unaware that the course of TB disease is frequently more severe in patients with diabetes, who do not tolerate TB drugs well. Diabetes patients often have difficulty completing treatment, take longer to be cured and are more likely to relapse, even die, and develop drug-resistant TB.

TB physicians in Texas are acutely aware of the problem. One told me about a woman with severe diabetes in her 30s. When exposed to TB, she quickly developed active disease. Despite the best efforts of the medical staff, she was not able to absorb the TB medication due to nausea and vomiting.

Today, 26 million of the 382 million people with diabetes live in the United States. By 2035, nearly 600 million people in the world will have diabetes, and by 2050 so will a third of all Americans, according to the International Diabetes Federation and the CDC. Ignoring this new threat could result in a reversal of the decline in TB experienced over recent years.

Diabetes took my teeth but not my life

So what do we need to do?

We must educate health care providers, patients and communities. All TB patients should be screened for diabetes. Diabetes caregivers and their patients need to be aware of the risk of TB, and patients born in or traveling to neighborhoods or countries where TB is common should be screened. If TB is found, these patients need treatment, along with the support they need to get through the many months of daily medication.

We also need strong investment in research and development of TB vaccines, rapid and inexpensive diagnostic methods for both TB and diabetes, and fast-acting, easy-to-take TB medication.

Research largely depends on government funding since the pharmaceutical industry shows little interest in TB. Congress has not made TB a priority despite the increasing risk to the public at large.

We all know someone with diabetes. Diabetes could reverse the achievements of several decades in TB control, but, if we combine good science, adequate funding and above all, political will, we can get ahead of this looming crisis.

We responded slowly to the combined AIDS/TB threat in the 1980s. We need to react faster to the diabetes/TB threat today.
