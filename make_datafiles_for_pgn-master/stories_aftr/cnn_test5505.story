(CNN) -- As the number of swine flu cases rises around the world, so is a gradual backlash -- with some saying the threat the virus poses is overblown.

By Monday, 985 cases of the virus, known as influenza A (H1N1), had been confirmed in 20 countries, the World Health Organization said. The number of fatalities was at 26, including one in the United States.

"There is too much hysteria in the country and so far, there hasn't been that great a danger," said Congressman Ron Paul, a Republican from Texas. "It's overblown, grossly so."

Twenty-five people died from the inoculation while one person was killed by the flu, Paul said, adding that he voted against inoculation.  Watch Ron Paul talk about 1976 swine flu Â»

The United States' only death this year from the virus was a 22-month-old boy in Texas who was visiting from Mexico. The other 25 deaths happened in Mexico.

"I wish people would back off a little bit," Paul said.

"We have people without symptoms going into the emergency rooms asking to be screened for swine flu at the expense of people with real illness," said Cathy Gichema, a nurse in Pikesville, Maryland.

"Schools are being shut for probable causes -- sending these kids congregating to the malls. How is that helping?" Gichema said.

Dr. Mark Bell, principal of Emergent Medical Associates, which operates 18 emergency departments in Southern California, said the level of fear is unprecedented.

Governments and health officials, however, say the concern is not unfounded.

On Saturday, the virus strain was found in a herd of swine in Alberta, Canada, and the animals may have caught the flu from a farmer who recently returned from a trip to Mexico.

It could be the first identified case of pigs infected in the recent outbreak.

"We have determined that the virus H1N1, found in these pigs, is the virus which is being tracked in the human population," said Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

But Evans and other officials said it is not uncommon for flu viruses to jump from humans to animals, and that it does not pose a risk for consuming pork. The number of pigs infected was not disclosed.

In his weekly radio address Saturday, President Obama said the concerns over the new virus are justified because lack of immunity makes it potentially risky.

In addition, WHO started distributing 2.4 million doses of a common anti-viral drug to 72 nations. iReport.com: How should H1N1 be handled?

Still, some say the hype over H1N1 has led to undue hysteria.

Pakistan resident Faisal Kapadia agreed.
