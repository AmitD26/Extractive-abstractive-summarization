(CNN) -- As the tech world watched the birth of the Apple Watch on Tuesday, another iconic device from the Cupertino company was being laid to rest.

Is the Apple Watch a game-changer?

The signs had been there for a while. Apple hadn't updated the the Classic since 2009 and had quit mentioning it, even at iPod-specific events.

But some loyalists still love it. Although it doesn't have the touchscreens of new models like the Touch and is downright huge in comparison with the sleek Nano and miniscule Shuffle, the Classic packed a whopping 160 GB of storage.

That's enough to hold 40,000 songs, according to Apple.
