Who paid for the trip? You did. And so did we. Taxpayers are footing the bill for almost the entire trip, which also cost millions of dollars.

It's standard practice for presidents, both Democratic and Republican, to go on predominantly fundraising trips with taxpayer's paying for most of the travel costs. It's completely legal. Do some official White House business on the trip and -- voila! -- the president's re-election campaign and party shoulder very little of the cost.

"Usually, a political party only covers a fraction of the costs of presidential travel, usually in the single digit percentages," says Pete Sepp with the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan nonprofit group against wasteful government spending. "Most of the money raised really comes at a free cost to the parties. They only reimburse for a few hundred thousand dollars, on a given trip, if tax payers are lucky."

There is little transparency in determining the cost of presidential travel. A White House spokesman declined to say how the White House and the DNC divided the cost of Obama's western trip, citing security concerns. Other administrations have declined to comment on the same grounds.

A report conducted by the Democratic-controlled House Oversight and Government Reform Committee while President George Bush was in the White House concluded taxpayers paid for about 97% of presidential travel, the Republican Party just 3%.

In 1995, President Bill Clinton attended eight fundraisers in four days on a cross-country swing.

Taxpayers often pay for travel to campaign events that rally support rather than raise money, like Bush's dramatic entrance into a baseball stadium in Fort Myers Florida less than a month before his re-election in 2004. Call it a perk of the presidency, something a mere candidate does not enjoy.

"And that's the point when the parties themselves have to pay for the cost of the pomp and the circumstance," Sepp says. "The pomp and the circumstance gets a lot smaller, a lot more modest."
