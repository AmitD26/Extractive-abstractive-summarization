(CNN)   -- At six foot five, with his shock of blonde hair shaved into a fat Mohawk and talking in a languid Georgian drawl, Omar Jarun looks like he was once part of an all-conquering college basketball team.

Instead life had a different path for Jarun, one that would take him far from his native Peachtree City, Georgia.

On Sunday he will line up as a defender for the Palestinian national soccer team as they take on Afghanistan in a match that, just one year on from the World Cup final in South Africa, represents one of the first steps towards qualification for the next tournament in Brazil in 2014.

Besides being Palestine's first World Cup match on home soil, Sunday's encounter will have extra significance for Jarun. It will be the first time he has ever set foot in the West Bank and he plans to visit his ancestral town of Tulkarem.

His team traveled for 24 hours to be able to play their first match against Afghanistan. The game was moved from Kabul to the tiny aluminum smelting town of Tursunzade in southern Tajikistan -- a few miles from the Uzbek and Afghan border -- for fear of violence in Afghanistan.

Jarun's remarkable story began in Kuwait. Along with his sister, his American mother and Palestinian father, he fled the country in 1990 when Saddam Hussein's forces invaded the kingdom and sparked the first Gulf War.

"I remember bombs going off. Missiles shooting off near the apartment. I remember grabbing my bear, me and my sister running to my dad's bedroom and saying: 'What's going on?'" he recalled.

"The next morning my dad would come in shaking from the bombs going off. Because we are American, my mom managed to get the entire family in to the U.S. We left everything behind. My parents had nothing."

Growing up, Jarun soon discovered his love for soccer, playing for AFC Lightning, the same youth team that nurtured U.S. internationals Clint Mathis and Ricardo Clark.

His Arab heritage was seldom an issue, he says, but he noticed a change after 9/11. "By looking at me, I look like a white boy," he laughed. "You don't get judged immediately like my father does. Like an Arab. He gets judged right away. But you look at me and you don't think I'm Arab.

"Before 9/11 there were no problems, really. I had always established myself as an American from the Middle East. After 9/11 it was very difficult. My dad would tell me: 'Be careful what you say.' I would get double, tripled-checked at the airport. You know it's for safety for the country, so I don't have many complaints about it."

"At the time, when I thought of the national team I thought I could play for the U.S. national team at some point but I never really got the opportunity, so I took this one. I really had no idea I'd be in the Palestinian national team," he said.

Many will be surprised that Palestine even has a national team. In 1998 FIFA, world football's governing body, recognized Palestine, making it one of the few international bodies to place it alongside other nation states.

But following the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000, and the imposition of restrictions for residents of the West Bank by the Israelis, the local league was cancelled and national team players were prevented from traveling abroad to fulfil their fixtures.

When qualification for the 2006 World Cup began, so many players were prevented from leaving Gaza and the West Bank that only nine could start against Uzbekistan in a match in Doha, Qatar.

Gaza-born players who now play in the West Bank have recently been refused re-entry when trying to come home via Jordan. Arguably the team's best player, defender Abdel Latif Bahdari, was repeatedly refused permission to leave Gaza through Egypt due to a ban on visas for men aged between 18 and 40. By the time he finally got out it was too late for him to make the team.

Jarun recalls first meeting his teammates. "Their first impressions were: 'Who the hell is this guy? How the hell is this guy Palestinian?' But they welcomed me in like I was one of the brothers. It wasn't like I was an outsider. No one was judging each other.

"They could tell I had good intentions for the team. Being an American I can explain to people in America what was going on in their country."

"I think the match is huge man. Sport brings countries together and I don't know a better way for the world to know about Palestine apart from this soccer team," he explained.
