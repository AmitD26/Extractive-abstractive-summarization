(CNN) -- Alexander the Great is said to have sobbed like a child after realizing there were no more worlds to conquer.

This was centuries before video games -- with the exception of "Pong" -- were invented.

And who would've blamed him?

These days virtual worlds are almost as impressive as the real thing.

So impressive, in fact, that we wish we could visit them.

These seven would top our itinerary.

The place: A bucolic world of grassy plains and medieval settlements that echo the gentle sounds of clopping hooves, lilting ocarina melodies and a talking tree.

San Andreas, "Grand Theft Auto V" (Rockstar Games)

The place: A sun-bleached U.S. state that stretches from sparkling ocean-side real estate to misty mountainside.

Why we want to visit: San Andreas vividly re-creates great swathes of California, chiefly Los Angeles, with such an immersive eye for detail that, if they weren't so loathsome, you might accidentally find its characters on your Christmas card list.

And, just to prove it's even more la-la than La-La-Land, you can finish off your crime spree with a yoga session.

Get real: Hire (don't hijack) a luxury car and cruise across Los Angeles.

"Tetris" (Various)

The place: A Soviet-created, two-dimensional world where doom can only be avoided by neatly stacking descending geometric shapes.

Could be an allegory for the futilities of the U.S.S.R.'s collective economy.

Get real: Play "Tetris" too much and it becomes hard not to gaze at a cityscape without figuring out which shapes would fit into its gaps. This is especially fun in the Tetroid heights of Hong Kong's Mid-Levels.

Butterfly on Hollywood Hotel (Hong Kong); +852 2850 8899

More: Starcraft, and 9 other things South Korea does better than anyplace else

Rapture, "Bioshock" (2K Games)

The place: A gloomy sub-aquatic metropolis deep beneath the North Atlantic.

According to an elaborate back story, the city was conceived in the late 1940s by idealists who wanted to break away from outmoded ideologies at the end of World War II.

So they construct an underwater utopia where all runs swimmingly until everyone, of course, becomes hopelessly hooked on sea slugs.

"Bioshock's" designers spliced Captain Nemo's "Nautilus" with the Chrysler Building to create an art deco spectacle that drips with class (and seawater).

Get real: Underwater cities are sadly somewhat thin on the ground. (Or should that be ocean floor?) For now, you have to make do with just an underwater hotel room.

The Manta Resort, Pemba Island, Tanzania; +255 776 718 852; $1,500 per night for a two-person stay, $900 per night for singles

"Super Mario Galaxy" (Nintendo)

The place: A universe of tiny planets where, if you eat the right mushrooms, you gain special powers that make it easier to navigate a series of benign but frustratingly tricky challenges.

Why we want to visit: We'd settle for any of the mildly psychedelic destinations depicted in the "Super Mario" games series, but "Galaxy" is the best yet.

Of course, traveling to strange places with a qualified plumber can only be a good thing. Particularly one whose "let's a-go" catchphrase seems to indicate a tradesman with an admirable can-do attitude.

Get real: Warm, safe and unthreatening? Welcome to Singapore!

But under no circumstances sample mushrooms offering unusual powers. Not even a plumber would be able to help you.

"Minecraft" (Mojang)

"Minecraft" is considered by many to be the best so-called "sandbox" game in which players design their own block-built worlds and mine their resources to construct elaborate settlements.

Hostile mobs and monsters are chucked in to liven things up.

Why we want to visit: Because we've all felt the call of the wild at least once in our lives. A sense of frontier spirit. The desire to wipe the slate clean, forge our own new civilizations and get our hands if not dirty, then perhaps a little clammy.

The place: A jagged, windswept and snowy mountain range on the northern fringes of the northern fringes of "World of Warcraft" -- the colossal online realm that at its peak had as many signed-up players as Belgium has citizens.

Not all were Belgian.

Why we want to visit: "WoW" boasts such a bewildering number of territories that it's hard to know where to start, but the starkly beautiful Storm Peaks stand out for sheer drama of landscape.

Get real: Aonach Eagach is a vertiginous, wind-raked mountain ridge that looms over Scotland's Glen Coe. Dragons would be the least of your worries up here.
