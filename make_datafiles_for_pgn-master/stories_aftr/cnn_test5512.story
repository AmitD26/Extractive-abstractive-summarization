This is exactly what a group of scientists at the University of Nottingham, in England, will attempt to do as part of a five-year, $1.58 million research project that has been aptly named AudACiOus -- which, according to researchers is derived from "towArds a Universal BiologicAl-Cell Operating System" with an extraneous "D" and "U" thrown in.

It is undoubtedly an audacious and ambitious initiative, but if the researchers are successful it could result in a major breakthrough for synthetic biology -- a relatively new and somewhat controversial interdisciplinary field.

It combines biology, chemistry, physics, computer science and engineering to program genetic components of a cell to perform new biological functions -- such as bacteria that could produce biofuel or vaccines.

"For each single application you have in mind, you have to start from scratch, and you have to start all of the design of the biological roots from scratch," he said. "The analogy in the computer industry would be that each time you write a computer program you have to write the entire operating system."

"If we change the operating system, then whatever modification we want to do later on will be easier," Krasnogor said.

"The truth is there is no guarantee we will succeed," he added. "This is a high risk, high return project."

Scientists not involved with the project agree it will be difficult. J Christopher Anderson, a synthetic biologist at the University of California Berkeley, said he is taking a "wait and see" view towards the project.

"As much as I'd love to see someone find the theory or practice that simplifies genetic engineering down to something easy, I'm skeptical as to whether any one technical effort could provide that simplification," he said.

"It's hard to imagine there would be one thing that would be truly revolutionary," he added."There are so many complications at play, so many little pieces that have to be found and put together.

"There are theory gaps. There are tools gaps. There are so many other bottlenecks. But it could be an important and difficult piece of the puzzle."
