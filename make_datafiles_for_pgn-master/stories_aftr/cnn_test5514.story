Stewart's "terminal medical condition and very limited life expectancy constitute extraordinary and compelling reasons that warrant the requested reduction," Koeltl wrote in his order.

"... It is further ordered that the defendant shall be released from the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons as soon as her medical condition permits, the release plan is implemented and travel arrangements can be made."

Stewart arrived in New York early Wednesday afternoon and is with her son and his family in Brooklyn, according to her lawyer, Jill Shellow.

Abdel-Rahman is serving life in prison.

The motion filed Tuesday asked the court to release Stewart from a Texas prison because her cancer has metastasized to the lung and bone, and oncologists estimate her life expectancy to be less than 18 months. The filing said her medical condition was "terminal and incurable" and cited the "relatively limited risk" of recidivism and danger to the community from her release.

In 2010, Koeltl revised his initial sentencing of Stewart from 28 months to 10 years in prison.

Wearing navy blue prison garb and handcuffs, Stewart entered a crowded courtroom to a standing ovation.

"The pain is overwhelming" said Stewart, who paused to compose herself several times while speaking. "Prison has diminished me."
