The tweet seemed to suggest that Adele's much-anticipated follow-up to "21" would be arriving at some point in 2014. However, according to the New York Times, that is no longer the case. A financial report from Adele's label XL Recordings reveals that there are no plans to drop an album from the "Rolling in the Deep" singer in 2014.

In the report, the label notes that the singer's back catalogue accounted for a "significant proportion of the sales and profit" during 2013.

"21" sold more than 25 million copies worldwide, so the quiet revelation that 2014 will be Adele-less comes as an equally disappointing update to both XL's distributor Columbia Records and the singer's fans.

However, as we enter the fourth quarter of 2014, Adele hadn't made any announcements -- she hasn't even tweeted since July -- or rolled out any new singles, which implied that the tentatively titled "25" might have to wait until "26."
