(CNN) -- There's a website that lies to restaurants, making reservations under fake names, and then sells them to you.

If that rubs you the wrong way, you're not alone. ReservationHop, which launched last week, was hit with a backlash so nasty, it led its creator to call himself "the most hated person in San Francisco."

And it's just the latest on a list of recent startups that have some critics complaining that, in the go-go Silicon Valley startup culture, almost anything can attract interest, and big investor money, even if it seems to straddle the line between right and wrong or even reality and parody.

"This is irresponsible and sleazy and exactly what people hate about startups sucking the life out of San Francisco," Wired senior writer Mat Honan wrote of ReservationHop on Twitter.

Creator Brian Mayer says he wrote the app, which is San Francisco-only for now, after waiting 30 minutes for a burrito.

"Is this even legal? Is it ethical? Restaurants are going to hate this!" Mayer wrote in a blog post about the "overwhelmingly negative" response he's gotten. "To be honest, I haven't spent a lot of time thinking through these questions. I built this site as an experiment in consumer demand for a particular product, and the jury's still out on whether it will work."

Complaints centered largely on two issues: making money off something that should be free and hurting restaurants by scooping up reservations that, if not purchased, could lead to empty tables and lost revenue.

The going rate for a reservation on the site appears to be $12. After you pay, ReservationHop tells you the fake name to use.

One, Washboard, wasn't long for this world. Its concept: selling you money for more money.

Washboard went under late last month, but not before raising the ire of some in the tech world.

"Probably smart," Valleywag's Sam Biddle wrote of the closure, which apparently came when the startup had drawn fewer than 10 customers. "But at least they will be 'focusing (their) energy on something ultimately more worthwhile,' which would be anything. Literally anything. Lying down in the middle of the street and screaming would be ultimately more worthwhile than this."

Then there's Yo.

That idea? It raised $1.2 million from investors. And reportedly has more than 300,000 users.
