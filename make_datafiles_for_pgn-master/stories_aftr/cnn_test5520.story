"I am not so sure that this is the change election," Shumlin said Tuesday during an editorial board meeting with CNN.

"I think this is the election where voters care about one thing, middle class voters, both independents and Democrats, care about one thing: Did you or can you create better opportunities for us and our kids?"

The Democratic leader continued by stating that voters who have suffered through "10 years of a stagnating economy" and have slowly "seen jobs trickle back," want to know what candidates are "going to do to improve my wallet."

"I don't think it is going to be a lofty, idealist change election," Shumlin concluded.

2014: What's at stake

Four years removed, the 2010 midterm election looms large over this November's contests.

According to CNN's initial analysis, roughly half of this year's 36 races for governor could be competitive. Democrats are on the defensive in two highly competitive races, in Illinois and Arkansas, while Republicans are defending four toss-up races, in Florida, Maine, Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Shumlin went on to hit a number of Republican governors for ethics investigations and tax cuts for high-income earners. He said that the last four years of leadership from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker prove that Republicans aren't reformers.

"Any myth that these guys are reformers is officially dead," Shumlin said.

By pressing a message centered on raising the minimum wage and strengthening the middle class, those campaigning for Democratic governors and candidates feel like they are in better position to make gains in 2014 than congressional Democrats, where it is looking more likely the Democrats will continue to be a minority in the House.

Republicans, as expected, have a different view of the map.

In a Tuesday statement, Jon Thompson, spokesman for the Republican Governors Association, said, "While Democrat governors continue to raise taxes, increase spending, and waste hardworking taxpayers' money on failed Obamacare exchanges in their states, Republican governors are cutting taxes, lowering spending, balancing budgets, reforming education and driving the American Comeback."

"RGA's strong financial position will give us the resources to push back against the public sector unions and the White House, who have targeted Republican governors and candidates for defeat," Phil Cox, the group's executive director said earlier this year.

Democrats hope to make up those fundraising gaps in the coming months and are using a prolific Democratic fundraiser - former President Bill Clinton - to do just that.

Shumlin downplayed the fact that Clinton has yet to campaign for the DGA and noted that she did help her longtime friend Terry McAuliffe, who ran and won the Virginia governor's mansion in 2013.

"Obviously, you know Hillary is kind of laying a little bit low these last few months since she stopped being secretary of state but President Clinton has been hugely helpful. ... Everybody would love to have the Clintons help and we are getting it."
