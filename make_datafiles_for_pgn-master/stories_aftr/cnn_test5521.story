Despite a controversy on the first day of the convention on Thursday -- in which the Con tweeted on behalf of attendees on their own Twitter accounts -- it appeared that the enthusiasm of fans did not let up with long lines over the rest of the weekend. The convention ceased that particular Twitter practice on Friday.

"I just got out of a panel for David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, and it was really easy to get into. With the others [conventions], you can't get into those [kind of panels] without waiting for hours and hours."

Aside from Duchovny and Anderson's 20th anniversary reunion, there were many other big events.

The smash hit TV series "The Walking Dead" announced two new actors joining their cast, Michael Cudlitz (in attendance) and Josh McDermitt, both playing characters from the popular comic book.

A "10th season" of the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" comic book was confirmed with a new creative team, and a fourth season of MTV's "Teen Wolf" series was announced.

And Marvel Comics finally confirmed that it would reprint the classic 1980s series "Miraclemen," alongside announcing new series starring "Silver Surfer," "Punisher" and "Ghost Rider."
