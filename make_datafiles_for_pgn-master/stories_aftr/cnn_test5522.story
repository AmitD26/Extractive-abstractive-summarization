(CNN) -- Manila's Payatas dump site is more than a simple landfill, it's an entire human eco-system.

Located to the northeast of the Philippines' capital, it supports a population of almost half a million people many of whom eke out a precarious living sifting through garbage.

Over the decades, an informal cottage industry grew up around women who earned money weaving recycled scrap fabric into rugs --- a job that allowed them to earn at least some money while they took care of their children at home.

Their work came to the attention of middlemen who exploited them by controlling the supply of fabric as well as their access to the market.

Eventually, many of the women were driven down below cost, producing the rugs for as little as 20 cents a day.

In 2007, a group of young professionals came together to change the situation. Rags2Riches was set up to provide the women artisans of Payatas with a fair price and access to the formal market.

According to Rags2Riches president Reese Fernandez-Ruiz, in a short six years the company has built an international brand with a growing reputation.

It now operates in 21 different communities around Metro Manila and has expanded to other parts of the Philippines taking in designs and work from poor communities across the country.

The company aims not just to pay its workers better but to provide financial, educational and health training that it says will pay dividends into the future.

"Funnily enough the middlemen made up a very informal group and a lot of middlemen didn't know that there were a string of middlemen involved in the operation," she said.

"When they had information, it allowed them to make better decisions. By coming into the picture, we provide them with that avenue."

Fernandez-Ruiz said the artisans are more than simply employees, and are integral to the operation of the company.

While the rag-pickers of Patayas had always made woven material to a high standard, she said that taking the products to the next level to allow them to be sold in international fashion houses had been an education for the artisans and the managers at Rags2Riches.

"While quality might be an objective thing for people who know what that means, for people who have other things to think about like what their kids will eat, the idea of quality can seem very trivial.

"We had to expose them to the market and understand how it works and why it has to work that way.

"It took a while and it was a process but there's a very strong understanding of how the market works now and the artisans influence it themselves."

In the often ego-driven world of high fashion -- where a designer's name drives the success of the brand -- Rags2Riches is turning many of the commonly held assumptions about brand success on their head.

"Artisans come to us with their designs all the time," Fernandez-Ruiz said, adding that individual artisans put their name to every product. "We have a practice of collaborative design so it's not just one person calling the shots.

"One person will know how one particular part of a bag works and another person will know another part.
