The company is called Topology and its unique, experiential tour is called the Taxi Diary.

Though the results can range from mundane to memorable, the Taxi Diary concept is simple.

Customers pay NTD1,000 ($33) for the privilege of doing a ride-along in a local taxi for a four-hour stint.

The tourists travel wherever the taxi is called upon to go by its normal customers.

Topology -- the same company that let travelers to be a sweet potato mama for a day -- says the appeal of the tour comes from traveling to destinations entirely dictated by whoever hires the taxi.

"This idea came to me a long time ago when I was a passenger in a taxi," says Peter Lin, Topology co-founder. "That driver was so talkative that we chatted nonstop during the half-hour drive. He told me where to find great food in town."

So far one traveler from the United States and one from England have tried the tour, according to the company.

They also took in places that aren't easily accessible to travelers, such as locations in New Taipei City, an hour from Taipei's city center.

Unknown alleys, dinner invitations

"At first, it felt really weird, honestly, because we never sit in a taxi for such a long time and (never) meet people we aren't familiar with," he says.

"But even for those of us who were born and raised in Taipei, we hit some alleys we've never been to and saw scenes that we wouldn't see if we were on foot. It felt great."

Aside from new sights, Lin says the main draw of Taxi Diary is the chance to meet local people.

Finding the right drivers

Finding taxi drivers willing to collaborate was challenging at first.

Taxi Diary now works with five English-speaking taxi drivers.

Signs displayed in each cab explain the tour concept to potential customers before they decide to hire the cab.

"The drivers might not have too many chances to go abroad, but travelers can bring the world to them," he says. "Our taxi drivers are all happy to have the chance to connect to the world."

So what if there aren't a lot of passengers during a given tour?

"Taxi drivers are the best tour guides -- they know Taipei so well and the meals they choose are always awesome.

"A journey is not about the sights, but about the insights gained from the experience and the people you meet.

"These are what make a journey unique and unforgettable."
