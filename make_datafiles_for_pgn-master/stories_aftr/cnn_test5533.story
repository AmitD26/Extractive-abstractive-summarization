"I just don't want to be involved in that kind of website anymore," Kevin Bollaert told KFMB. "I want to do good things with my life."

Bollaert, 27, of San Diego, is accused of creating one website that allowed people to post explicit images of people without their permission, and creating another one soliciting payments to get the photographs taken down.

Court documents allege that in December 2012, Bollaert created the website ugotposted.com, which allowed for the posting of sexually explicit photographs of people without their permission.

Prosecutors allege Bollaert also created a second website, changemyreputation.com, that charged up to $350 to remove the content, the documents said.

Bollaert made tens of thousands of dollars through the website, prosecutors allege.

Neither website was operational Wednesday morning.

A 20-year-old Reno, Nevada, woman whose nude pictures appeared on the site told KFMB that she didn't know how the photos got there, but that it was devastating.

"I don't feel like I've committed any crime," he said, adding that he knows why there's an uproar.

"I have gone to the police, I've had a restraining order put in place because of this site, (and) my phone has been going off EVERY 2 MINUTES with strange men sending inappropriate things to me," one woman, who said she was a minor when the photographs were posted, wrote to the website, according to the court documents cited by KFMB.

"It's disgusting. Also, I've had to ... have a sexual harassment charge put in place in court because of this. I don't know what gets you off about ruining people's lives, but I was underage in the photos posted of me so, yes, you are showing child pornography," she wrote.
