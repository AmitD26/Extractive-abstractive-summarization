But for those who love an adrenaline buzz, then "step into the void" -- a suspended glass cube with a transparent bottom overlooking the Alps.

But it's not for the fainthearted -- there's a drop of over 3,300 feet (1,000 meters).

A rival to the London Shard, which stands at 1,017 feet (310 meters) and offers a 360-degree view of the city, it is the latest piece of architecture to attract thousands of tourists.

Designed by Pierre-Yves Chays, the structure is inspired by "The Skywalk," a huge glass walkway overlooking the Grand Canyon in the U.S. state of Arizona.

Perched at the top of the 12,600-foot (3,842-meter) Aiguille du Midi peak near Chamonix, France, it gives a view of Mont Blanc which had previously only been attainable by skiing.

"I don't know if I can do it," were the first words to flash into the mind of Mathieu Dechavanne, the man who helped create the attraction.

After three years of development, Compagnie Mont Blanc, the firm which operates the ski lifts and attractions in the area, has created a structure made from three layers of tempered glass which can withstand winds of up to 200 kilometers an hour.

"The original idea was to create something even bigger to cross from one end to another," Dechavanne, general manager of Compagnie Mont Blanc, told CNN.

"You can also try to climb if you want but if you want the sensation of what it's like at the top then try this transparent box and you can gain a real experience."

To get to the top, patrons must brave a cable car ride which takes them 8,858 feet (2,700 meters) up the side of the mountain.

Once that's been completed, it's on board a second cable car for the final 4,790 feet (1,460 meters) to ascend to the peak.

"The view is fantastic," added Dechavanne. "The beauty is that the void is beneath the feet but the impact on the brain comes from the transparency of the glass."

It has since been overtaken by Shanghai's World Financial Center, which has an observation deck at 1,555 feet (474 meters), and Guangzhou's Canton Tower (1,601 feet, 488 meters).
