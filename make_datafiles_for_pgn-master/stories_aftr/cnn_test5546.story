Chavez also ordered an environmental investigation at the sites, the state-run Agencia Venezolana de Noticias reported.

Venezuelan military personnel were at the company's plant in Los Guayos, Johnston told CNN. No Venezuelan authorities were on the scene at the company's plant in Valera, Johnston said.

Owens-Illinois Inc. says it is the world's leading glass container maker with more than 22,000 employees in 21 countries. The $7.1 billion company has global headquarters in Perrysburg, Ohio.

Chavez, who has nationalized other industries and land holdings during his 11-year tenure, said he soon will announce the takeover of other foreign companies that have been "exploiting the country's working class."

U.S. officials said Tuesday they were monitoring developments.

"We've seen the announcement and are following the situation closely," the State Department said. "We would expect Venezuela to provide prompt, adequate and effective compensation for any expropriation of the investments of Owens-Illinois in accordance with international law."

CNN's Arthur Brice and Juan Carlos Lopez contributed to this report.
