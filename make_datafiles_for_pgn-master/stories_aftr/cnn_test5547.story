Authorities said Justin Casquejo early Sunday allegedly climbed through a 1-foot opening in a fence surrounding the still-under-construction skyscraper, past "do not enter" and "no trespassing" signs and, apparently undetected, got to the scaffolding around the building and started climbing.

According to the criminal complaint, Casquejo told police, "I walked around the construction site and figured out how to access the Freedom Tower rooftop. I found a way up through the scaffolding, climbed onto the sixth floor, and took the elevator up to the 88th floor. I then took the staircase up to 104th floor."

From there, Casquejo told police, he went to the rooftop and climbed a ladder out to the spire of the 1,776-foot building.

Around 6 a.m. Sunday, Port Authority police arrested Casquejo on the property, according to Pentangelo.

The criminal complaint said the teen "knowingly entered and remained unlawfully in a building and upon real property which was fenced and otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders; the defendant knowingly entered and remained unlawfully in and upon premises."

When he was taken into custody, Casquejo had a camera and a phone, Pentangelo said. Warrants have been secured, and the contents of those devices are being checked to establish a motive for Casquejo's alleged trespassing. The investigation continues as authorities review whether Casquejo went anywhere else on the property.

Pamela Griffith, Casquejo's attorney, declined to comment.

One World Trade Center is the United States' tallest building, beating out Chicago's Willis Tower in November.

Upon completion, which is expected this year, the skyscraper is expected to rank as the world's third-tallest building, after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and the Makkah Royal Clock Tower in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
