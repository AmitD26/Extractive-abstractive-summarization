(CNN) -- Around the country on Friday, you'll likely see the iconic black and white POW-MIA flag flying over federal buildings. At military bases, there will be ceremonies with troops in dress uniforms marching and leaders speaking.

If you were to walk through the mess hall of a Navy ship or an Army installation, you might see a small table covered in a simple cloth. One chair sits in front of a single formal place setting. On the plate, salt and a slice of lemon. Next to the plate, a glass vase containing a red rose with a red ribbon around the base.

The rose reminds "us of the lives of these men ... and their loved ones and friends who keep the faith, while seeking answers."

The red ribbon "symbolizes our continued determination to account for them."

The slice of lemon "reminds us of the bitter fate of those captured and missing in a foreign land."

The salt "symbolizes the tears of our missing and their families who long for answers after decades of uncertainty."

A glass is inverted on the table "to symbolize their inability to share this evening's toast."

At larger events where POW/MIA groups gather, a similar table will be set, but with identical place settings, one for each of the armed forces, including the Coast Guard, and a sixth for civilians still missing.

Pam Cain, secretary of the League of POW/MIA Families, said when an explanation is read of what each item symbolizes, she "can barely get through it to the end."

Cain's father, Col. Oscar Mauterer, disappeared after bailing out from his burning plane during a mission over Laos in 1966.

Friday night, as you sit down for dinner, look at the salt or perhaps the chair with a loved one next to you and remember there are those still waiting for a loved one to come home.
