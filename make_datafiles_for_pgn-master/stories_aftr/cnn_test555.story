Gunmen abducted Warren Weinstein nearly three years ago from his home in Lahore, Pakistan. They posed as neighbors, offered food and then pistol-whipped the American aid worker and tied up his guards.

Now he's being held by al Qaeda. And as political backlash over the controversial prisoner swap for Bergdahl grows, Weinstein's daughter says her happiness for the soldier and his family has turned to worry.

For years, when Warren Weinstein's case came up, U.S. officials called for his release but repeatedly said Washington wouldn't bargain with al Qaeda.

Now, Alisa Weinstein says it's clear that negotiating is an option.

"It was clear from that video that he is not in good physical condition. He was incredibly pale and gaunt. His voice was weak. ... My father is certainly not in good health," she said.

"My father is just as deserving of freedom as Sgt. Bergdahl, as are all of the Americans who are being held abroad," she said. "You cannot distinguish between these hostages. ... They can't just pick and choose, decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there."

He described the captive as "a former employee and a current contractor working with the U.S. government in its aid program to Pakistan, which aims to fight the jihad in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and just like the Americans arrest any suspect linked to al Qaeda and the Taliban, even if they were far related."

Weinstein was employed by J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia, that is a USAID contractor. He is a world-renowned development expert, according to the company's website.

"Nine years ago, I came to Pakistan to help my government and I did so at a time when most Americans would not come here," he said. "And now, when I need my government, it seems I have been totally abandoned and forgotten."

What about other Americans held captive?
