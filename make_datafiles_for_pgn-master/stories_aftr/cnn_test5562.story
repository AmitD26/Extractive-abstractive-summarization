(CNN) -- A passenger aboard the British-based cruise ship MS Marco Polo was killed after the ship was hit by a "freak wave during adverse sea conditions" as it made its way into the English Channel, according to a statement released Friday by the ship's owner, Cruise & Maritime Voyages.

The ship was en route from the Azores to its home port in Tilbury, England, and it was carrying 735 passengers and 349 crew members, the cruise line said. The passengers are primarily British, it said.

A man whose mother and father are aboard the Marco Polo said he first learned of the incident when his parents texted him.

They said a large wave hit the side of the ship between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. local time as they were dining in one of the ship's restaurants, said the man, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity citing concern over a possible backlash against his parents.

Passengers were asked to the go their rooms, and the man said his parents did that as the ship rocked side to side. The ship never lost power, he said.

The ship is scheduled to arrive in Tilbury on Sunday, he said.
