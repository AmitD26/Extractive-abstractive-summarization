Cindy Anthony testified that she was responsible for Internet searches on the family's home computer for information about chloroform. But records indicated she was at work at the time.

Prosecutors had alleged that Casey Anthony, 25, killed her daughter, Caylee, in 2008 by rendering her unconscious with chloroform, putting duct tape over her nose and mouth so she would suffocate, or a combination of the two acts.

Ashton himself is leaving his post, proceeding with a retirement that he had delayed to take on the Casey Anthony case. The trial ended Tuesday with Casey Anthony acquitted of murder, manslaughter, and child abuse in the death of her daughter. She was convicted of lying to police, a misdemeanor that usually results in no jail time.

"This, of course, was a rather important, you know, deception, if you will, that obviously was proven to be so by the other evidence. What they do with it is going to be a difficult decision that I'm glad I don't have to make."

"Remember, no matter what we think of Cindy Anthony, she is a victim here. She is a grieving grandmother. ... So we know that she truly truly loved that little girl and misses her. And, at this point, all she was trying to do was save her daughter's life and it worked. So at this point I think any prosecution is going to look like sour grapes."
