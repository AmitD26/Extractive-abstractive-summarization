There has been a similar conformity even in those categories -- like best actress -- which "The Artist" won't win. "The Help" star Viola Davis is the red-hot favorite in that race, which would extend Meryl Streep's losing streak to an unlucky 13 nominations since her 1983 win for "Sophie's Choice." All of which could make Sunday's ceremony the most predictable -- and anti-climactic -- Academy Awards in recent memory. And that's saying something!

The Nominees

"The Artist" WW

"The Descendants"

"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"

"Hugo" SW

"Midnight in Paris"

"The Tree of Life"

"War Horse"

Overlooked: The industry didn't know what to make of "Margaret," Kenneth Lonergan's film was overshadowed by its long and troubled backstory -- so it chose to ignore it. But this ragged, emotionally gripping drama was an unsung American masterpiece, a more probing study of grief and youth than "Extremely Loud," "The Descendants" or even "The Tree of Life".

Viola Davis ("The Help") WW

Rooney Mara ("The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo") SW

Michelle Williams ("My Week with Marilyn")

Overlooked: Charlize Theron won the Oscar for playing serial killer Aileen Wuornos in "Monster," but her performance in "Young Adult" is even more courageous and more nuanced. She dared to play a deeply damaged and highly dislikeable individual, and despite everything made us care. And spare a thought for Kirsten Dunst, whose chances were probably scuppered by her "Melancholia" director Lars von Trier's foolish remarks in Cannes.

Demian Bechir ("A Better Life") SW

Jean Dujardin ("The Artist") WW

Gary Oldman ("Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy")

Brad Pitt ("Moneyball")

Overlooked: Pitt and Clooney both gave career-best performances this year, but so did Woody Harrelson, whose bigoted, self-loathing, alcoholic cop in "Rampart" didn't get the promotion he deserved.

Actress in a Supporting Role

Jessica Chastain ("The Help")

Octavia Spencer ("The Help") WW

Overlooked: Not overlooked entirely, but Jessica Chastain could easily have been nominated twice, or even three times, in this category, such was the quality of her work as the innocent wife of the deranged Michael Shannon in "Take Shelter" and her angelic mother in Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life."

Kenneth Branagh ("My Week With Marilyn")

Jonah Hill ("Moneyball")

Nick Nolte ("Warrior")

Christopher Plummer ("Beginners") WW, SW

Terrence Malick ("The Tree of Life")

Alexander Payne ("The Descendants")

Animated Feature

"A Cat in Paris"

"Chico & Rita" SW

"Rango" WW

Overlooked: It wasn't a great year for animation, but "Arthur Christmas" was a typically witty and ingenious effort from Aardman Animation, the studio that gave us Wallace & Gromit and "Chicken Run."

Foreign Language Film

"Footnote"

"In Darkness"

"Monsieur Lazhar" WW

"A Separation" SW

Overlooked: Where to begin? Well, "Once Upon a Time in Anatolia" for a start, the Turkish police procedural that's part road film, part existential comedy, all masterpiece.

"Hell and Back Again"

"Paradise Lost 3"

"Pina" WW, SW

"Undefeated"
