(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard and the Jamaica Defence Force suspended their searches Sunday for signs of a prominent New York couple whose plane crashed in the Caribbean Sea north of Jamaica.

Jamaica suspended its search because of bad weather, said Capt. Basil Jarett of the Jamaica Defence Force.

The crew used smoke flares and two data marker buoys to mark the location for Coast Guard and Jamaican Defense Force boat crews, the Coast Guard said, but none of the searchers could relocate the objects on Saturday.

The single-engine TBM-900 aircraft, owned by estate developer Larry Glazer and his wife, Jane, crashed into the Caribbean hours after the pilot told an air traffic controller that something was wrong as it flew south over the eastern United States.

The plane's radio was silent for hours after the pilot's call, prompting U.S. and Cuban military jets to trail the small private plane. The North American Aerospace Defense Command said those aboard might have suffered from hypoxia, which sets in when oxygen is lacking.

There were conflicting reports on how many people were on the plane, with the U.S. Coast Guard indicating there were three.

Pilot seen slumped over

U.S. fighter jet pilots said when they looked into the aircraft, they saw the pilot slumped over and the windows frosted.

The plane's radio communication ended about 10 a.m. ET Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration said.

The pilot asked to descend to 18,000 feet because "we have an indication that is not correct in the plane," according to a stream of that transmission posted on LiveATC.net, which provides live air traffic control broadcasts.

The air traffic controller told the pilot to "stand by" and proceed to 25,000 feet as he worked on clearing the plane to go lower. The conversation continued off and on for more than four minutes, though it was largely one-sided: The pilot wasn't clear in his remarks and didn't declare any sort of emergency.

Data indicate the plane didn't descend. It cruised for hours about 25,000 feet above the ground.

Fate of couple unknown

Jamaica and the United States swiftly dispatched government aircraft to the scene. Jamaican authorities said they found an oil slick in the prime search area.

As they searched, the Glazer family in Rochester mourned. The couple have three children.

The TBM-900 plane was owned by the company.

Jane Glazer founded QCI Direct, a 100-employee company that has an outlet store, according to its website.

Both Glazers knew how to fly.

U.S., Cuban fighter jets trail aircraft

NORAD dispatched two F-16 fighter jets from a base in Richland County, South Carolina. Another pair of fighter jets from Homestead, Florida, took over around 11:30 a.m. and escorted the plane past the U.S. mainland.

The American fighter jets broke off their pursuit 12 miles off Cuba, at which point a Cuban fighter jet took over.

Despite the longstanding tensions between the two countries, Cuba cooperated with the United States and did not consider the plane's movement a violation of its airspace.

Cuba let the U.S. Coast Guard aircraft go through its airspace and gave permission for American "military aircraft, if necessary," according to an official statement.
