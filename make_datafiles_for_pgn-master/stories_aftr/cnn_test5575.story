(CNN) -- For most people plunging into the ocean's cold, dark depths without an oxygen tank would be an alarming experience. But for Ahmad Tahilmet and his friends its one of life's greatest pleasures.

Unlike regular divers, freedivers prefer to go under water without oxygen tanks or other bulky equipment.

"It has something to do with the ocean and how much we love to be in it. You have so many ways to discover what's under the water," says Tahilmet.

"You have no bubbles, nothing. All that you can hear is your heartbeat and you get to see things that other people can't see. You know because you are so quiet and calm."

For these young Emiratis, freediving is not just a hobby, but it's a competitive sport. But unlike other forms of competition, freediving requires participants to learn to relax, instead of relying on adrenaline.

But as that profession has disappeared, the practice of freediving has taken its place.

"I know it is not a necessity," says Tahilmet. "Now we do it because we love the ocean."

Freedivers compete for either depth or duration of a breath hold under water. And just like his pearl-diving Emirati forebears, present-day free divers such as Ahmed Khouri may opt to use weights to help them drop faster and deeper.

Both Tahilmet and Khouri are well aware of the dangers; they lost a friend to freediving, also off the coast of Dubai.

For Khouri, the thrill of freediving is like doing another kind of extreme sport.

"The most fun part of the dive is the free fall," he says. "It's like people who do skydiving, they just freefalling. It's just the same. You know I think that's the best sensation you can have because the more you free fall, the deeper you go, the more fun you have."
