(CNN) -- Last week, Kaci Hickox, the nurse isolated and tested for Ebola in New Jersey when she returned from working with patients in Sierra Leone, came to a settlement in her legal battle with Maine over a forced quarantine in that state. A District Court judge ordered that she cooperate with "direct active monitoring," coordinate her movements with public health authorities and immediately report any symptoms but didn't otherwise restrict her movement.

The panic response in much of the United States, as health workers and others have returned from Ebola-stricken West Africa, has pitted public officials against doctors against whole communities over the issue of quarantine.

Medical quarantines are as old as "the plague." They were used in the 14th century when ships arriving in Venice from plague-infected ports were forced to lay at anchor for quaranta giorni -- Italian for 40 days -- before landing. Quarantines quickly became the default mechanism for controlling outbreaks of untreatable diseases. But are these measures still needed, effective and appropriate in the 21st century?

Legally, the federal government has the authority to quarantine. U.S. Code grants the Public Health Service quarantine and inspection authority, and similar laws exist in most state constitutions. However, these powers have rarely been used, in part because advances in medicine have made such measures superfluous.

There are multiple considerations; public safety is a big one. But then there are costs: economic costs of instituting quarantine to the individual and his or her family and employer, and to local, state and national government; economic costs of not instituting quarantine -- i.e., the cost of providing health care if additional cases of Ebola arise.

There is a price to pay in individual freedom as well as for the social and emotional effects of quarantine to individuals and families, and of course the social and emotional costs of not instituting quarantine. Certainly, there are political costs for instituting or not instituting quarantine, and there is a chilling effect on volunteerism for hazardous duty in the hot zone if volunteers can expect to be quarantined on their return home.

But beyond all of these things, there are science and technology -- and this is critical.

Yes, and this is where technology steps in. We have technology to monitor people with devices that can be placed on their wrists and that can send back (in real time) their pulse, temperatures and even their blood oxygen levels. These devices can relay information to a state public health office and send an alert to an assigned public health officer if there is an abnormal parameter.

They can also be adapted to alert the person wearing the device to stop and call the public health office. This can allow for free range of movement and for a rapid stop to all movement the instant a person becomes symptomatic (if they ever do). If you think that the use of a wrist-sensing device is an expensive option, it is not (about $100 per person). Compare that with the option of a 21-day quarantine, estimated to cost a minimum of $1,000 a day per person.

The Defense Department could use this option, too, but it has so far opted for quarantine. The reasons are simple. The military likely looked at the cost of managing an Ebola patient (which in the United States is about $18,000 to $24,000 a day) and decided that quarantining its personnel (which costs a lot less than the cost for a civilian to be quarantined) is a smaller price to pay than the risk of additional Ebola patients if one of its troops becomes symptomatic.

The military must pay for medical care of all its personnel and has to avoid unnecessary risks. The Defense Department does not have to deal with the issues of who pays for quarantine and who pays for decreased work output while someone is in quarantine; military laws apply, and the other issues of social, individual freedom, volunteerism and political costs do not apply.

So, yes, the decision by the Maine court, which takes into consideration modern science, public health and public fear is reasonable and appropriate for our time. Let's hope other states will make such clearheaded decisions.
