Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- Negative, expensive campaigns is something Sen. Kay Hagan is getting an education in this year. And something Hillary Clinton knows very well.

"You have to prove them wrong," Clinton urged the crowd. Prove to them "that no matter how much money has flooded into this state, North Carolina is not for sale" -- the latter phrase having a mantra for Hagan supporters.

There is a reason Clinton focused on this: The North Carolina Senate race is by far the most expensive in the country this year. So far, campaigns and outside groups have spent close to $80 million in the state.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Tillis has had $44 million of outside money spent on his behalf. Hagan has had $22 million.

Tillis is backed by groups like Americans For Prosperity, Crossroads GPS and the Chamber of Commerce. Hagan has been supported by Senate Majority PAC, the National Education Association and AFSCME, a labor organization.

The onslaught of spending likely won't stop soon, either. A spokesman for Hagan said he sees the total spent in the campaign jumping to over $100 million in the last 10 days of campaign.

What key Senate race means for 2016

This level of spending is something Clinton understands personally: According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Clinton's New York Senate race in 2000, which cost over $100 million, is the most expensive race ever (in 2014 dollar terms).

She criticized "out-of-state billionaires" who are "trying to buy this election."

What the outside spending has meant is near constant negative ads on televisions across the state.

"All I get from all of those is don't vote for that person, because they are a bad person, vote for me," said one woman.

"Everything we are teaching your kids is ridiculous," said another, reflecting on the ads. "We teach our kids not to bully and that is all they are doing."
