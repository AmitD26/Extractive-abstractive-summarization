Washington (CNN) -- Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords is urging Arizona voters to supporter her successor, Rep. Ron Barber, who is locked in a tough race for re-election, with a personal video appeal.

5 House races to watch in 2014

Barber is a former congressional aide to Giffords. They were both wounded in that same attack as she was greeting constituents. He won a special election to replace her after she resigned her seat in 2012 and then he was re-elected to a full term in 2012.

This is the fourth ad in this contest from Americans for Responsible Solutions, which Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly formed to help push for stronger gun-control legislation, including more stringent background checks for purchases. Several of the group's previous spots went after McSally for not supporting closing a gap that allowed stalkers with misdemeanor convictions to buy guns but barring those convicted of felonies from such purposes.

One of those spots became controversial for featuring a mother whose 19-year-old daughter was stalked and shot to death by her ex-boyfriend. In the wake of the ad, her campaign later said McSally would support new legislation preventing those convicted of a misdemeanor stalking crime from buying a gun and revealed she had been a victim of stalking earlier.

The ad and the topic of how to deal with gun violence were featured in a debate between McSally and Barber on Tuesday.

McSally said she was a proud supporter of the National Rifle Association, adding she wanted to make sure gun violence was minimized and "is obviously addressed in our communities."

Americans for Responsible Solutions says the cost of its new ad is "a strong six-figure buy" and will air for two weeks on broadcast, cable, and online.

Giffords released a statement saying: "No organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to Southern Arizona and pretend to speak for me ... I work hard to speak, but's my voice. So take it from me: Ron is an independent leader in Congress, and no one will fight harder for our community."
