But a chance encounter with a chess coach turned her into a rising international chess star, the subject of a book -- and the protagonist in a future Disney movie.

Ugandan teenager Phiona Mutesi is "the ultimate underdog," her biographer says.

Those who work with her believe she's 16. But since her birthday is unclear, she might still only be 15, they say.

Her father died from AIDS when Mutesi was around 3.

"I thought the life I was living, that everyone was living that life," the teenager told CNN, describing her childhood in Katwe, a slum in the Ugandan capital of Kampala.

"I was living a hard life, where I was sleeping on the streets, and you couldn't have anything to eat at the streets. So that's when I decided for my brother to get a cup of porridge."

"It teaches you how to assess, how to make decisions, obstructive thinking, forecasts, endurance, problem solving, and looking at challenges as an opportunity in all cases -- and possibly not giving up," he told CNN. "The discipline, the patience ... anything to do with life, you can get it in that game."

Mutesi liked chess, and started training and practicing regularly. "It took me like a year" to get very good, she said.

Soon she found herself beating the older girls and boys in the program.

Eventually, she became her country's champion -- and represented Uganda at international tournaments. In 2009, she traveled to Sudan. Then, in 2010, she boarded an airplane to Siberia.

When the flight took off, "I thought that I was maybe in heaven," she wrote in a letter to her mother quoted in Crothers' book. "I asked God to protect me because who am I to fly to the europlane."

Mutesi had also never seen ice before.

Mutesi is not one of the world's top chess players. But she is the first titled female Ugandan player. She has a fighter's instinct to reach the top level -- and to achieve much more.

Meanwhile, Mutesi is becoming an inspiration to people all over the world.

Some learned about her through Crothers' article for ESPN, which went viral. Others have seen a brief documentary about her on YouTube.

Crothers' book about her, "The Queen of Katwe," was published this fall.

"That she's from Africa makes her an underdog in the world. The fact that she's from Uganda makes her sort of an underdog in Africa, because it's one of the poorer countries in Africa. The fact that she's in Katwe makes her an underdog in Uganda because it's the most impoverished slum in the entire country. And then to be a girl in Katwe -- girls are not treated as equals to the boys," said Crothers.

The extreme poverty and deprivation in Katwe is hard for many around the world to imagine. Crothers wrote that "human waste from downtown Kampala is dumped directly into the slum. There is no sanitation."

Mutesi told CNN she's never heard of Idi Amin, the so-called butcher of Uganda, who helped plunge his country into economic chaos throughout the 1970s.

"He was in northern Uganda torturing people and could kidnap children. That's what I know."

Chess could prove to be Mutesi's ticket out of a hard life -- particularly through a project that lies ahead.

Disney has optioned the rights to "The Queen of Katwe," and is starting work on a movie, Crothers said.

It's all too much for Mutesi to fathom.

"I feel happy," she said when asked about the growing attention. "I'm excited. I didn't have hope that one time, one day, I would be like someone who can encourage people, and they start playing chess," she told CNN.

"I don't like New York because there's too much noise in it," the teenager said with a big smile.

But while it may be somewhat overwhelming for her, Mutesi's success at the game she loves is bringing joy to her family.

"Some of them cried. Years back we didn't have hope that ... one day it can happen," she said. "So they are very excited."
