More Central Americans were caught crossing into the United States illegally than Mexicans, according to statistics released Friday by the Department of Homeland Security.

While Mexicans made up the single largest nationality apprehended by CBP, the combined number of Hondurans, El Salvadorans and Guatemalans apprehended was even larger.

"It's the first time in recent history where (migrants other than Mexicans) exceeded Mexican nationals," a DHS official said.

The debate over illegal immigration in the United States is often tied to the relationship the country has with Mexico, but the flow of migration are slowing from Mexico and increasing from Central America.

While the statistics released Friday, which cover fiscal year 2014, show result of changing migration trends, it was not a surprise for officials.

For at least four years, the trend has been the similar -- decreases in Mexican migration and increases in migrants from Central America, the official said.

In 2014, migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador represented 49% of all apprehensions. Mexican nationals made up 47% and migrants of other nationalities made up the rest.

Unaccompanied minors

The number of apprehensions this year -- 486,651 -- was slightly higher than the 420,789 migrants apprehended in 2013. CBP cites the surge in unaccompanied children and families who crossed illegally and turner themselves in to Border Patrol agents earlier this year.

Some 68,631 unaccompanied children were apprehended in 2014, an increase of 76% compared to 2013. The number of family units apprehended in 2014 was 68,684, an increase of 356%.

Officials say the surge, which spiked over the summer, was controlled by September.

According to the agency, 98% of the immigrants it returned or removed fell under one of the categories for priority deportation.
