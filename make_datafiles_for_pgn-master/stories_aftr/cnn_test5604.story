-- In 2010, the United States passed the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act. It revoked, for example, permission to import "certain foodstuffs and carpets of Iranian origin," the U.S. Treasury says. Those who violated the law could face a fine of up to $1 million and 20 years imprisonment.

-- The law established that Iranian goods or services may not be imported unless they are gifts valued $100 or less; informational materials, or personal property of someone coming into the United States.

-- U.S. citizens may not export goods or services to Iran or, in general, to a third country knowing it is intended for Iran. There are exceptions for "donations of articles intended to relieve human suffering," gifts valued at $100 or less, certain agricultural products, medicines, and informational materials, the Treasury says.

-- The U.S. government prohibits "servicing accounts of the government of Iran," including the country's central bank.

-- U.S. sanctions also targeted groups in Iran -- such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij Resistance Force, and Iran's Law Enforcement Forces -- as well as several individuals in Iran.

U.N. sanctions:

-- Current U.N. sanctions against Iran are the result of a series of resolutions dating back to 2006.

-- Material related to Iran's "proliferation-sensitive nuclear and ballistic missile programs" are embargoed, the United Nations says.

-- One of the resolutions bans the export or procurement "of any arms and related material from Iran," the U.N. Security Council says.

-- A long list of individuals and entities are subject to a travel ban and assets freeze. "The assets freeze also applies to any individuals or entities acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, the designated persons and entities, and to entities owned or controlled by them," the council says on its website.

EU sanctions:

-- Assets of Iran's central bank in the European Union will be frozen, and trade with Iran in gold, diamonds, and precious metals will be blocked, the union said.

-- The European Union already had in place a series of sanctions as well, targeting the oil and gas industry, nuclear industry, financial sector and more.

-- Measures put in place in 2010 include restrictions on "equipment which might be used for internal repression," the official text said.
