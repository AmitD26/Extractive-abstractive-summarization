(CNN) -- New York Yankees All-Star players Tuesday remembered owner George M. Steinbrenner III as a demanding father figure who had a gentle side.

"He was always good to be around, recalled pitcher Andy Pettitte. "He was tough. He was fair."

Yankees manager Joe Girardi and other members of the team wore black armbands in memory of Steinbrenner.

Pettitte, Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter spoke earlier about "The Boss," who died Tuesday morning after suffering a massive heart attack in Tampa, Florida.

"I once got a handwritten note from him," Rodriguez told reporters a few hours before the All-Star Game. It said, 'I AM COUNTING ON YOU!' I still hold it dear. I am playing for him."

Tributes rolled in all day Tuesday, hours after Steinbrenner's family said he was rushed from his Tampa home to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he died.

"He was an incredible and charitable man. First and foremost he was devoted to his entire family -- his beloved wife, Joan; his sisters, Susan Norpell and Judy Kamm, his children, Hank, Jennifer, Jessica and Hal; and all of his grandchildren.

"He was a visionary and a giant in the world of sports. He took a great but struggling franchise and turned it into a champion."

Under Steinbrenner's guidance, the Yankees have earned seven World Series trophies since 1973. He was the longest-tenured owner in Major League Baseball, having served as principal owner since purchasing the club on January 3, 1973.

"Owning the Yankees," Steinbrenner once said according to MLB.com, "is like owning the Mona Lisa."

Major League Baseball Commissioner Allan "Bud" Selig said Steinbrenner was a giant in the game.

"His devotion to baseball was surpassed only by his devotion to his family and his beloved New York Yankees, " Selig said. "He was and always will be as much of a New York Yankee as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford and all of the other Yankee legends. He was my dear friend for nearly four decades. Although we would have disagreements over the years, they never interfered with our friendship and commitment to each other.

Steinbrenner was a pop culture figure, famously earning some attention in episodes of the TV sitcom "Seinfeld."

Hall of Fame Yankees catcher Yogi Berra called Steinbrenner a "great friend."

"George was The Boss, make no mistake.  He built the Yankees into champions  and that's something nobody can ever deny," Berra said in a statement. "George and I had our differences, but who didn't? We became great friends over the last decade and I will miss him very much."

"George said to me it was the 'worst mistake I made in my life' and I said 'George everyone makes mistakes,'" Berra added, choking up at the memory. Berra predicted Steinbrenner would get into the Hall of Fame.

"I will always remember George Steinbrenner as a passionate man, a tough boss, a true visionary, a great humanitarian, and a dear friend. I will be forever grateful that he trusted me with his Yankees for 12 years. ... It's only fitting that he went out as a world champ," he said in a statement.

Steinbrenner was born on July 4, 1930, in Rocky River, Ohio. His mother, he once said, imbued him with a compassion for the underdog.

He told The New York Times Magazine in 1978 that he "never really appreciated" his father when he was growing up but that now he "can't give enough credit" to him. "Anything I ever accomplish I owe to him," he said then.

Steinbrenner was for decades the most colorful, controversial and domineering owner in baseball.

But Steinbrenner didn't always know where to draw the line on payments, and stepped over it at least twice -- with illegal campaign contributions to Richard Nixon in 1974, and with a $40,000 payment to a gambler for damaging information about a player. He was suspended from baseball for the Nixon contribution and banned for life for the payment to gambler Howie Spira, according to Major League Baseball. He was reinstated three years later.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, "This is a sad day not only for Yankee fans, but for our entire city, as few people have had a bigger impact on New York over the past four decades than George Steinbrenner. George was a larger-than-life New York figure whose passion and drive to succeed will forever be missed."

Steinbrenner's death marks the second loss in so many days for Yankee veterans. Announcer Bob Sheppard died Sunday. Steinbrenner called Sheppard "a good friend and fine man whose voice set the gold standard for America's sports announcers."
