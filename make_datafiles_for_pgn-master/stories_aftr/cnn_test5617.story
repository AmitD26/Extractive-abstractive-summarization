A U.N. official called Wednesday for stronger international efforts to keep sectarian tensions in Syria from spilling into neighboring Lebanon.

"The situation in Lebanon has become more precarious and the need for continued international support to the government and the Lebanese Armed Forces increasingly important," Jeffrey Feltman, U.N. under-secretary general for political affairs, told the United Nations Security Council during its monthly meeting on the Middle East.

"Tensions over domestic and security concerns remain high throughout the country and are easily exacerbated by developments in Syria," he said.

Feltman urged a clampdown on arms smuggling across the Syrian-Lebanese border, which he said posed a risk to both countries.

Feltman cited the recent spate of kidnappings in Lebanon and Syria by people loyal to the Sunni-dominated rebels and by others aligned with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an Alawite Muslim with strong Shiite support.

"In his report to the General Assembly, the secretary-general strongly, strongly condemned kidnapping and retaliatory hostage taking in Syria and Lebanon, and called for an immediate release of all those detained without due process and in violation of their human rights," Feltman said, referring to Ban Ki-moon.

This week, gun battles in Tripoli have left at least seven people dead and dozens wounded, Lebanese state-run media reported.

Syria's neighbors: What's at stake?

Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon between 1976 and 2005, primarily in the north. They were initially called in to help stop a brewing civil war but maintained their significant presence -- which once numbered 40,000 -- long afterward.
