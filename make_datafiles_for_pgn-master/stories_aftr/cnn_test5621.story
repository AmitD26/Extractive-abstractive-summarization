The aim of the military operation is to "stop attempts to tear Ukraine to pieces," he told lawmakers.

There were conflicting reports about casualties, with Russian state-run media citing varying casualty claims supplied by militants. According to the reports, there were either two injured or four killed, claims that CNN cannot independently verify.

Brink of civil war?

The pro-Russian uprising follows Russia's annexation last month of Ukraine's Crimea region, a move that emboldened other pro-Russian Ukrainians in the country's east to rise up.

Despite what Merkel's office described as "different assessments of the events on the ground in Ukraine," the focus of the conversation was on preparations for a meeting in Geneva among the foreign ministers of Russia, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union to find a way to reduce tensions in the region.

In a sign of the divisions roiling the country, YouTube footage posted online appeared to show two openly pro-Russian presidential candidates who have demonstrated support for separatists being antagonized by crowds in separate incidents in Kiev on Monday night.

Another clip showed Oleg Tsarov, an independent candidate who was expelled from the Party of Regions, speaking to people without a shirt as he apparently sought to show the bruising he'd received from an aggressive crowd.

In the third video, Tsarov tries to leave a TV station, where crowds shout "Shame! Shame! Shame!" His supporters and protesters end up in a brief scuffle.

CNN has not been able independently to verify the amateur video clips.

NATO, EU are 'deeply concerned'

The escalating tensions in the region -- along with reports of violence -- have raised concerns among European Union defense ministers and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who met Tuesday in Luxembourg.

As he arrived for the talks, Rasmussen told reporters he was "deeply concerned" by the latest developments in Ukraine.

"I call on Russia to de-escalate the crisis, to pull back its troops from Ukraine's borders, to stop destabilizing the situation in Ukraine and make clear that it doesn't support the violent actions of pro-Russian separatists," he said.

"Russia should stop being part of the problem and start being part of the solution."

"However, we are focused militarily on strengthening defense of our allies. That's our core task," he said.

Ukraine deployed a National Guard battalion of 350 troops to the Donetsk region from Kiev on Tuesday morning, said Evgen Rojenyuk, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

The National Guard troops -- many of them former street protesters who signed up after the interim government took power in February -- have had only a few weeks of training.

Military column

A CNN team in eastern Ukraine encountered a large Ukrainian military column traveling on roads leading from the city of Donetsk toward other towns in the region.

The column included more than 20 armored personnel carriers, along with support vehicles, and a helicopter circled overhead. The troops, who were carrying the Ukrainian flag, appeared to be headed north and east, although their precise destination was unclear.

Pro-Russian protesters seized a police building over the weekend in Slaviansk, some 100 miles from the border with Russia.

From a hill overlooking the town, a CNN team saw no obvious signs of a large-scale operation, such as military helicopters or planes.

Pretext for intervention?

After then-Ukrainian leader Yanukovych backed out of a deal with the European Union in November in favor of closer ties with Russia, he was forced from office in February, the result of months of protests in Kiev.

A short time later, pro-Russian elements occupied the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Russia annexed in March. Since then, pro-Russian protesters have taken to the streets in eastern Ukraine and in some cases stormed and occupied buildings.

NATO says Russian armed forces are massing on Ukraine's eastern border, while Moscow says they are merely carrying out military exercises.

A United Nations human rights report released Tuesday on the situation in Ukraine cited an urgent need to counter "misinformation, propaganda and incitement to hatred" in the country to avoid the further escalation of tensions.
