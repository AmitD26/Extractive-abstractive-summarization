Oscar Pistorius didn't consciously pull the trigger the night he shot and killed his girlfriend, the sprinter testified at his murder trial Tuesday.

"I mean the situation, and the situation as a whole, it wasn't meant to be," Pistorius said.

The double amputee said he was terrified when he heard the sound of the toilet door opening.

"I didn't think about pulling the trigger. As soon as I heard the noise, before I could think, I pulled the trigger," he said.

The testimony came after the prosecution ended five days of grueling cross-examination, which has seen the athlete break down on several occasions.

Valentine's Day card

"I'm not sure, my lady," Pistorius said, directing his answer to the judge. He repeatedly said he feared for his life and thought there was an intruder in his bathroom.

He became emotional as he described finding his girlfriend slumped over by a toilet after shooting her through a closed bathroom door.

Nel has accused Pistorius of "tailoring" his version of events to suit his story. He questioned Pistorius on details after the shooting that the athlete said he doesn't remember, such as what exactly he did with the gun immediately afterward and who connected his cell phone to a charger in the kitchen.

The prosecution contends that Pistorius shot Steenkamp intentionally after a heated argument, which Pistorius has repeatedly denied.

Pistorius read the card aloud.

Gripping trial

The defense called expert Roger Dixon as its next witness to take the stand at the Pretoria court.

The defense team will call 14 to 17 witnesses, Roux said when he opened his case. The trial is scheduled to continue until the middle of May.

Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials.

The trial has gripped South Africa and millions of sports fans around the world who saw Pistorius as a symbol of triumph over physical adversity.
