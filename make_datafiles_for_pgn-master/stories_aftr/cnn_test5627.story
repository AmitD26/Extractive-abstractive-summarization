"I think that the red carpet and the glamor is all fine but it doesn't really apply to me because I'm not a movie star," says Jay Cassidy, a three-time nominee who is back at the Dolby Theater on Sunday.

Cassidy is in the running for the Best Film Editing Oscar, alongside his colleagues Crispin Struthers and Alan Baumgarten, for their work on David O. Russell's "American Hustle." For the veteran editor, the occasion is not so much about the celebrity ephemera and who's-wearing-what, but it's an "enormous big deal" for other, more tangible reasons.

"For those who are movie stars it's part of the game," he said. "They're used to the press thing that goes on, and there's probably no more special occasion (than the Academy Awards). It's the big one of the year."

While the major categories generally hog the limelight -- and his "American Hustle" colleagues are up for the big ones including all four major acting categories, Best Director and Best Picture -- he says that the technical categories are far from unsung these days.

"There is certainly, in the years I've been in the industry a growing appreciation for the technical side," he says. "I think there's a lot more attention paid to it by the media so I think people have a level of awareness that they didn't used to have.

"That's maybe not such a good thing on a certain level because you want the movies to be magic -- you don't want to pull the man out from behind the curtain."

He says that the peer recognition is important, and while it "remains to be seen" what a win would do for his career options, the recognition from the Academy means that he is afforded more choice in what he makes.

But back to Sunday and the hush that comes over the expectant crowd as the envelope containing the name of the winner -- or winners -- is opened.

And while the Best Film Editing award may mean more to a handful of old Hollywood hands sitting in darkened editing booths than it does to those watching on E! news, the occasion is undiminished for Cassidy.
