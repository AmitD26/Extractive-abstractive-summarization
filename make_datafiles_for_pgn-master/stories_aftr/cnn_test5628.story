"I can't get into his head but I'm sure that he is stressed at this point," Bivens said. "It's been a couple of weeks and I am certain that he is not sleeping well at night."

Frein may have been spotted within the past 24 hours in the rugged area where he has been sighted numerous times, Bivens told reporters. The suspect was wearing dark clothing and was seen between 75 and 100 yards away.

Authorities have located several structures where they believe the suspect has stayed. Some items were found in a location that Frein may have used as an "overnight accommodation," Bivens said.

'We are not going anywhere'

As he has in the past, Bivens, who is spearheading the manhunt, had a personal message for Frein: "I am calling on you, Eric, to surrender. You are clearly stressed. You are making significant mistakes. We continue to take your supplies and your weapon stockpiles. While you are no doubt weakening our troopers' resolve is very strong. We are not going anywhere."

Bivens said Frein may have placed other explosive devices in the area and warned people to be very careful, especially since archery hunting season is about to begin.

The self-styled survivalist may have planned the ambush and retreat for months or years, police have said. The search area is a wooded area around the border of Pike and Monroe counties.

The area is not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis, in the Pocono Mountains.

Poring through a variety of clues

Last week, police said a  review of a computer hard drive used by Frein showed he planned the attack and his retreat into the woods for a couple of years.

Police also were able to track Frein through his cell phone when he called his parents one time earlier this month, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. Frein hung up after one ring, the source said.

Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers but not civilians.

"I do think that we have significantly degraded his ability ... to adapt," Bivens said Tuesday.
