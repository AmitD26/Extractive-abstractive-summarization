Sudan has withdrawn its soldiers from Abyei, a disputed border region also claimed by South Sudan, but has left police officers, the United Nations peacekeeping mission said Wednesday.

"The mission has confirmed the full withdrawal of the SAF from Abyei area yesterday," said Josephine Guerrero, a spokeswoman for the U.N.'s Department of Peacekeeping Operations in New York, referring to the Sudan Armed Forces. "Armed police forces are still in the area."

South Sudan's army spokesman, Philip Aguer, said he is "skeptical" that Sudan has truly pulled troops out.

He said he had received reports that the Sudan Armed Forces left two platoons of soldiers dressed in police uniforms in Abyei town, and that two battalions remain about 40 miles away in Diffra, which is the only oil field inside the disputed territory.

"We have our reservations about Sudan's claims that it withdrew from Abyei," he said, adding that his government is investigating reports that Sudanese soldiers remain in the area.

Talks have been ongoing since the South declared independence on July 9 of last year, but Sudan pulled out of negotiations last month as border clashes brought the countries to the brink of war.

A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted this month threatened sanctions if the countries refused to cease hostilities and return to talks.

South Sudan complied with the Security Council's demand that it withdraw forces from the contested, oil-rich area of Heglig, as well as police it had stationed in Abyei. The resolution also required Sudan to withdraw its forces from Abyei.

In a 2009 ruling, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague placed Abyei's boundaries around the traditional homeland of the Ngok Dinka tribe. Those borders excluded most of the oil fields in the area as well as the members of the Misseriya tribe, who often receive support from Khartoum, Sudan's capital. The nomads spend part of the year grazing their cattle in Abyei and said they should also be able to vote.
