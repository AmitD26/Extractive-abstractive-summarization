Njideka Akunyili started college planning to be a doctor, but left as an artist and is now billed as one of New York's most promising new talents.

The 29-year-old Nigerian-born artist has just completed a year-long residence with the prestigious Studio Harlem in New York.

All five of her works sold in the first half hour of this year's Art Basel, the world's top fair for modern and contemporary art and African style magazine Arise described her as "fast becoming the art world's newest star."

Her work, a combination of drawing, painting, printmaking and collage, combines Nigerian and American culture.

"Nigeria is almost a third character in my work," she said. "A lot of my work is about investigating my love for Nigeria and my life in America.

"If people think of artists, it's somebody by the side of the road painting signs."

She said many new Nigerian artists were successful internationally, but few were well known within the country.

"However, there is a new crop of creative Nigerians who are changing this and others will follow," she said. "I want to be part of that change."

"When I was young, the less Nigerian you were the cooler you were, but now we have gone back to tradition," said Akunyili. "There's a nice energy about the country that's finally coming into its own."

Akunyili won her residency immediately after graduating with a Masters of Fine Art from Yale University.

She said: "I noticed a lot of artists I like had done a residency at Studio Harlem, and I thought this couldn't be a coincidence. I felt something really good was happening there.

"I applied towards the end of my year at Yale, but I didn't think I would get it because it was very competitive and a lot of people apply several times.

The residency ended with a four-month exhibition, "Primary Sources," featuring Akunyili's work alongside that of the two other Artists In Residence, Meleko Mokgosi and Xaviera Simmons.

"Getting the residency was a big game changer for me," said Akunyili. "I have friends who graduated with me who have made little or no work because they are working other jobs to pay the rent.

"The residency puts you on a platform for people to write about and talk about, and also puts you in touch with a lot of other artists.

"The show at the end is four months, and it's allowed far more people to see my work than I ever thought would.

Akunyili's work has not yet been shown in her own country, something she would like to change soon.
