Let's face it -- it doesn't take much to convince us to do ridiculous things, document them and share them on the Internet.

The Ice Bucket Challenge is a social media campaign that aims to raise awareness and money to fight Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.

And it's simple, in the same way that laying stiff as a board in weird places or dancing the "Harlem Shake" is simple. Dump a bucket of ice-cold water over your head, then challenge a friend, or friends, to either do the same or donate money to the The ALS Association. Make a video of the whole thing and post it to your social media accounts.

Voila! You've completed the #IceBucketChallenge.

And while most viral Web trends tend to crop up, then disappear without accomplishing much other than providing a few chuckles, the Ice Bucket Challenge is making a difference.

For example, Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, himself a Boston College alum, took the challenge last week, then challenged his wide receiver corps -- Roddy White, Julio Jones and Harry Douglas -- to do the same. So far, Douglas and White have taken him up on it, with Douglas passing the challenge along to Cleveland Cavaliers star Lebron James and White challenging fellow NFL players Champ Bailey, Larry Fitzgerald and Eric Weems.

(Of course for the Falcons, who are currently being profiled on HBO's documentary series "Hard Knocks," a bucket of ice water might not have seemed so bad during training camp in the Georgia heat).

And leave it to a hockey player to try to show he's tougher than everybody else.

In the world of politics, the Boston area's most famous family, the Kennedys, joined in a big way. More than 20 members dumped buckets of ice water on their heads then challenged "Grandma Ethel" -- the 86-year-old family matriarch and widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy -- who did so after challenging President Obama himself.

"The President appreciates Mrs. Kennedy thinking of him for the challenge -- though his contribution to this effort will be monetary," Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz said Tuesday.

Of course, many of the folks who take the challenge also donate, which accounts in part for the big numbers for the ALS Association. But the very act of making the cause viral has been hugely important, too.

People with the disease lose control of muscle movement, eventually losing their ability to eat, speak, walk and, ultimately, breathe.
