According to a copy of the complaint, obtained by CNN, van der Sloot alleges that his right to due process was denied.

The complaint, given to the Peruvian National Police's internal investigation unit, singles out the department's homicide director, Col. Miguel Angel Canlla Ore, and those who work for him.

Van der Sloot said he has been detained without a judicial order.

He also alleges that police took his laptop and searched his communications and correspondence without a judicial order.

"I have been imposed an unofficial translator whom has confused me, with the intention of pressuring me to incriminate myself in the homicide investigation," the complaint states.

The document follows a similar complaint that van der Sloot made to a judge earlier this week.

Meanwhile, a judge was expected decide on the legality of van der Sloot's incarceration Wednesday, his lawyer said.

Van der Sloot was arrested twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance in Aruba but was never charged because of lack of evidence.

A court document obtained by CNN shows Flores had a cranial fracture and other significant injuries to her face and neck and showed signs of asphyxiation. Forensic luminol tests in the hotel room where her body was found showed blood on the floors, hallway and mattress, the document said.

Altez has maintained that the judge in the case should strike down van der Sloot's confession because he was not properly represented when he was interrogated. But Peruvian police have defended the interrogation, saying that van der Sloot's confession was acquired legally.

Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case. After killing Flores, police say, van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested on June 3.
