There were blizzard conditions in parts of western Kansas and southeast Colorado, with visibility of less than a quarter-mile, said Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.

A blizzard warning was in effect for those areas along with northeastern New Mexico, the northwest Texas panhandle and the Oklahoma panhandle, he said. The severe weather was starting to affect Missouri late Monday, with a winter weather advisory in effect for the northwest corner of the state.

The New Mexico State Police shut down Interstate 40, a major east-west artery, from Albuquerque to the Texas state line, saying there was zero visibility due to blowing snow. Interstate 25 was shut down from just north of Albuquerque to the Colorado state line because of the blizzard conditions, which included snow-packed and icy roads.

The state police also shut down U.S. and state highways in the northeast corner of the state.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry activated the Texas Military Forces as a precautionary measure to provide any needed assistance on the roads, his office said.

"We have whiteout conditions for the north of Amarillo at this point," he said, adding the roads will probably freeze over once the snow stops. "It's going to make for pretty bad conditions."

Flights were canceled by mid-afternoon at the Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport, which meant morning departures were scrubbed, spokesman Patrick Rhodes said. But "nothing much" has happened at the airport, he said, and he expected operations to be back to normal by mid-morning Tuesday.

To the north, in the Oklahoma Panhandle, U.S. highways were closed and transportation workers were salting the roads, according to Michaelann Ootean of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management.

Roads and highways were "completely snow-packed" or covered with ice in much of western Kansas, according to the state's Department of Transportation. They included I-70, which crosses the state from west to east, and I-135 through Salina.

The Colorado Department of Transportation shut down highways across the southeastern part of the state because of snow and icy conditions. I-25 was shut southbound from Pueblo to the New Mexico state line, and the DOT said lodging was unavailable south of Colorado City. Northbound I-25 remained open.
