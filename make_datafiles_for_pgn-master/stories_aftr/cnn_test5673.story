Long-time politician Beji Caid Essebsi won the country's runoff with about 55% of the vote, beating outgoing President Moncef Marzouki's 44%, state-run media reported Monday.

It was a hard-fought race. On Sunday, despite earlier indications Essebsi had won, supporters of Marzouki rallied in downtown Tunis.

Security forces responded to rock-throwing rioters by firing tear gas to quickly disperse the crowds, state-run media reported.

As a candidate, Essebsi promised to restore the state's prestige after the chaotic years since the 2011 revolution, when the country's dictator, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, was ousted. But Marzouki warned that Essebsi would bring back authoritarian policies.

On Saturday, The Economist declared Tunisia its "country of the year."

"The idealism engendered by the Arab spring has mostly sunk in bloodshed and extremism, with a shining exception: Tunisia," the magazine wrote.  "... Its economy is struggling and its polity is fragile; but Tunisia's pragmatism and moderation have nurtured hope in a wretched region and a troubled world. Mabrouk, Tunisia!"  ("Mabrouk" is a way of saying "congratulations" in Arabic.)

CNN's Margot Haddad, Salma Abdelaziz and Kay Guerrero contributed to this report.
