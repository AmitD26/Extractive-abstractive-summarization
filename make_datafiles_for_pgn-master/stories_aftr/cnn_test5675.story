That's the premise behind the off-Broadway comedy "Tail! Spin!," the story of some of the most memorable political sex scandals of recent times. Remember these classics?

Larry Craig, former Idaho Senator: "I am not gay. I have never been gay."

"I realized I could never write the kinds of things that these guys actually said and have an audience believe them. And so that's when I realized, it's got to be verbatim, because that's the only way for folks to see what these things are actually like," said playwright Mario Correa.

Different male actors play each of the infamous politicians but starring alongside them is Saturday Night Live alum Rachel Dratch who plays all of the wounded wives, mistresses and other women. She portrays 16 characters during the 75 minute performance.

"It pays far less than SNL, but it's good for me because it's, in general, my comfort zone. I started out [at Chicago's famed improve group] Second City doing sketch, and so the idea of like switching characters is kind of something I've been doing for a long time," Dratch told CNN.

Some of the exchanges -- especially messages sent by former U.S. Rep. Mark Foley during the Congressional Page scandal -- may not be fodder for a family website. But most of them confirm the suspicions of many ofthose already cynical about politicsâ€”that the main players somehow feel, no matter how they behave, they won't get caught.

The difference between life and art in this instance is that the play pays as much attention to the aggrieved women as the offending men, nearly all of whom stood by their husbands during the scandals -- literally.

Despite the starring role of infidelity, Correa -- a former Congressional staffer -- says his play is more about power than sex.

"I think a lot of us make mistakes in our personal lives, I know I have, but the reason we don't take these crazy, sort of outlandish risks and expect to get away with them is because we don't have power to protect us. But these guys are like, 'I'm a member of Congress, of course this is not going to come back to me, I've got a business card.'"

That's exactly what Larry Craig showed to a police officer after being confronted inside a restroom at the Minneapolis airport.

Spoiler alert: It didn't help.
