And understandably so.

1. Score extra beds the easy way

Chinese hotels aren't too fussy when it comes to matching the number of beds to the number of people, particularly when the extra bodies are children.

2. Follow proper currency protocol

Don't insult a Shanghai taxi driver by burdening him with small bills, such as 1 yuan or 5 jiao notes. He likes the jingle of coins.

Conversely, in northern and western China, expect market vendors to reject coins outright.

Pleco is the best Chinese language app for travelers.

China is the land of possibilities. If you can dream it, someone can make it.

The Shandong Juancheng Neon-Plasma Tech company make customized neon signs in one week and will ship anywhere.

5. Use the best guides to offbeat China

China Little T(r)ips is a series of guides for those who want to get off the well-worn tourist path in China, but don't have the inside knowledge or the language skills to do so.

These guides to Inner Mongolia, Gansu and soon Sichuan and Qinghai contain detailed itineraries, maps and language cards specific for each stage of the trip.

Rice is rarely served during a meal in Chinese restaurants, being seen as a cheap way to fill up at the end if needed.

7. Toilet paper reminder

Outside of large cities and internationally branded hotels, Chinese hotel breakfasts cater exclusively to the local market.

This is no issue for anyone fond of congee and pickles, but can be an unimaginable hurdle for children or picky eaters. Bring a box of their favorite cereal and a few small cartons of milk and everyone starts the day happy.

China is nowhere near as terrifying as many guidebooks would have you believe.

Yes, the traffic is chaotic and the air could be better -- much better -- but China is one of the safest countries in the world for female travelers, solo travelers and families.

10. Give -- and get -- instant gratification

Those traveling in rural China often wish to give a small gift to locals they meet, but are unsure of what might be considered appropriate.

A portrait delivered instantly on a Polaroid camera is a much-appreciated, on-the-spot gift.

Fujifilm Instax Mini 7 Polaroid camera retails for around RMB 400 (US$62) from large electronics retailers.

11. Trespass with confidence

Accustomed to the idea of private property, international travelers are often reluctant to stray from worn footpaths into lanes and hutongs for fear of intruding.

All of these outdoor areas are public spaces, and lanes and alleys hold some of the most captivating scenes in China's big cities.

12. Don't be fooled by loud voices

Chinese people like to converse very loudly and passionately at times, and it can be easy to mistake this for an argument.

"No," they told me. "We were just talking together about how devastating the Sichuan earthquake was."

13. Need help? Find a high school student

The array of Mandarin dialects and variations across China can make communication difficult even for native Mandarin speakers.

Students who have studied English in books for years, but have had little contact with native English speakers, may more readily understand written questions.

Learn the name of your country's most famous landmark for beaming instant recognition from taxi drivers, waiters and the man on the street.

Tip: Eiffel Tower is "ai fei'er tie ta," Statue of Liberty is "zi you nu shen xiang" and Great Barrier Reef is "da bao jiao."

15. Get a backstreet breakfast

16. Enhance wellness

"TCM is ingrained in Chinese culture," says Canadian Leslie Bottrell, who is trained in both Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine.

"It permeates everyday life and so empowers individuals to be responsible for their wellness by promoting disease prevention."

17. Find art in unusual places

"Their permanent art collection is second to none," says Hong Kong-based art consultant Alison Pickett.

"And they have a fantastic rotating exhibition venue in the lobby which showcases really challenging and interesting installations, many of which you wouldn't get to see in any of the galleries."

The Red Gate Gallery in Beijing holds open studio exhibitions. Visitors can see how resident international artists work, live and create in Beijing.

The Opposite House, The Village Building 1, 11 Sanlitun Lu, near Dongzhimenwai Da Jie, Village 1; nightly rate from about RMB 2,500 (US$400); +86 10 6417 6688; www.theoppositehouse.com

Red Gate Gallery, 1/F and 4/F, Dongbianmen Watchtower, Dongcheng District, Beijing 4; +86 10 6525 1005; open daily 9 a.m.-5 p.m.

"Our family took a weekend trip by train and boat to San Shan Dao, where we had an extraordinary China experience staying in small local guest houses and exploring the island," says Lynette MacDonald, editor in chief of Shanghai Family magazine and frequent traveler with children.

19. Get a tea education

Shanghai's Laoximen Tea Plaza houses a variety of specialty tea shops.

"On the second floor, at Qing Quan Tea (shop 218), I can sit for hours testing white or red teas and listening to owner David Li talking about health benefits, differences in soil or climate conditions or quality differences," says China-based food writer and tea lover Anna-Lena Bjarneberg.

The best gear investments to make before coming to China are an excellent camera bag and polarizing filter, according to professional photographer and frequent China traveler Roger D'Souza.

The Australian photographer also suggests using a polarizing filter to cut through China's frequent smog. "If there is any blue in the sky this will make it appear more vibrant," he says.
