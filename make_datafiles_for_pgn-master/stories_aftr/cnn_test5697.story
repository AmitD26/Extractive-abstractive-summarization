The search continued Thursday for a gay porn actor suspected of dismembering his acquaintance, posting the video of the incident online and mailing the severed limbs to different locations in Ottawa, including to a political party's headquarters, according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation.

The suspect has no criminal background, and his image and information related to him were later recovered from a "very graphic" website, Lafreniere said.

It's possible the body parts all came from the same dismembered victim, Lafreniere said, but police are still awaiting the results of forensic testing for confirmation.

"The two parts of the body that were found in Ottawa ... we've got all the reasons to believe that it's linked to our homicide," he added, referring to the human torso found in Montreal.

Authorities said they are asking the public for help in locating Magnotta, after a "coast-to-coast" warrant was issued for his arrest. Police say they plan to charge him with murder once he's apprehended.

Lafreniere added that Magnotta had been "involved in some stuff on the Web, that's for sure," though he would not elaborate.

The human foot was sent to the Conservative Party of Canada headquarters in Ottawa, prompting a hazardous materials team to investigate. The officers who responded noticed what appeared to be bloodstains on the box, police said.

The hand was intercepted by workers at a Montreal postal terminal.

Ottawa's major-crimes unit is checking with other police departments for similar cases and looking back through missing-persons files for any clues, according to Constable Marc Soucy, an Ottawa police spokesman.

"We're going to look at every avenue," he said.
