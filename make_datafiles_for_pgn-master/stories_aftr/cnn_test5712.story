The longtime Penn State head coach was diagnosed with what his family had called a treatable form of lung cancer shortly after the university's Board of Trustees voted to fire him.

Paterno died at 9:25 a.m. Sunday, surrounded by his family, State College's Mount Nittany Medical Center said in a statement.

Outpouring of grief at Penn State

At the same time, the program never fell under NCAA sanctions for major infractions while producing 13 Academic All-Americans since 2006. In 2009, according to the university, the Nittany Lions posted an 85% graduation rate.

How will you remember him?

He attended Brown University, where he played quarterback and cornerback, according to another Penn State biography.

When Paterno decided to forgo a career in law and make coaching his career, his family said Sunday, his father, Angelo, had one command: "Make an impact."

"As the last 61 years have shown, Joe made an incredible impact. That impact has been felt and appreciated by our family in the form of thousands of letters and well wishes along with countless acts of kindness from people whose lives he touched."

Decked out in his soon-to-become trademark thick glasses, white socks and sneakers, Paterno quickly became a memorable fixture on the football field, leading the Nittany Lions to undefeated seasons in 1968, 1969 and again in 1973 and the first national championship of his tenure in 1982.

He became the winningest coach in major college football history in 2011 with 409 victories.

Read family statement

Paterno and his wife, Suzanne, donated more than $4 million to the university over the years for faculty endowments, scholarships and building projects, according to the university.

"Penn State has been very good to both Sue and me," he said in 1998, according to his university biography.

"He has been many things in his life -- a soldier, scholar, mentor, coach, friend and father," the family statement said. To his wife, "he was and is her soul mate, and the last several weeks have shown the strength of their love. To his children and grandchildren he is a shining example of how to live a good, decent and honest life, a standard to which we aspire."

Honored with glowing words of praise from players and presidents alike -- President Ronald Reagan said Paterno never forgot that "he is a teacher who's preparing his students not just for the season, but for life," according to a university biography --  he received the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame Distinguished American Award in 1991.

In doing so, he became the first active coach to do so, according to the biography.

In October, state authorities charged two university officials with misleading investigators and failing to report alleged sexual abuse in 2002, after a Penn State assistant told a grand jury he saw former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky performing what appeared to be anal sex on a boy in a shower at the football complex.

The assistant reported it to Paterno the next day, who said he passed the report along to then-Athletic Director Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, a university vice president who oversaw campus police.

Curley went on leave and Schultz retired shortly after the grand jury report was revealed. The next month, the university fired Paterno and Penn State President Graham Spanier.

"Joe has been an integral part of my life for more than 35 years," Curley said. "Joe coached me, mentored me, taught me what it meant to compete with integrity and honor, and above all demonstrated with each day that he lived, the power of humility."

A timeline of Penn State child sex abuse scandal

In an interview with the Washington Post published January 14, Paterno said that he felt inadequate to deal with the allegations.

"I didn't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was," the Post quoted him as saying. "So I backed away and turned it over to some other people, people I thought would have a little more expertise than I did. It didn't work out that way."

SI column: Legacy more than final chapter

Sandusky, who faces more than 50 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys since 1994, has pleaded not guilty.

"Nobody did more for the academic reputation of Penn State than Joe Paterno," Sandusky said in a statement Sunday. "He maintained a high standard in a very difficult profession. Joe preached toughness, hard work and clean competition. Most importantly, he had the courage to practice what he preached. Nobody will be able to take away the memories we all shared of a great man, his family, and all the wonderful people who were a part of his life."

Paterno's family said Sunday he died "with a peaceful mind, comforted by his 'living legacy' of five kids, 17 grandchildren, and hundreds of young men whose lives he changed in more ways than can begin to be counted."

In lieu of flowers or gifts, the family requests that donations be made to the Special Olympics of Pennsylvania or the Penn State-THON, a charity dance marathon held by Penn State fraternities and sororities.
