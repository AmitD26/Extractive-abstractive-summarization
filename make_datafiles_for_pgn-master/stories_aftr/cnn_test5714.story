"I'm a soldier for my country," Kgomokhumo says. For him, as well as many others in this small, arid country, diamonds are a source of both income and pride.

The economy of Botswana, a landlocked country in southern Africa, has been transformed by diamonds. Since their discovery in late 1960s, the development of the country has been built on the gems buried deep in its soil.

In 1969, the Botswana government signed a 50/50 deal with global diamond giant De Beers to explore and mine all of the country's diamonds. The partnership, called 'Debswana,' has helped turn Botswana  into one of Africa's most prosperous countries, boasting today a robust economy and one of the highest per capita incomes on the continent.

The state mines the country's riches as an owner, getting a share of the profit in addition to just collecting taxes and royalties like many other mineral-rich African governments.

This unique arrangement has allowed Botswana to make significant investments in education and health care, officials say.

"If you were to replicate what we do in Botswana in other African countries, I have no doubt in my mind that there could be meaningful gains."

And now, Botswana's diamond industry looks set to get a further boost after De Beers announced last year its decision to shift its rough diamond trading operation from London to Gaborone, the Botswana capital.

Kago Mmopi, of the Diamond Trading Corporation, says the sales agreement will set up Botswana as one of the world's key diamond centers.

"These diamonds are basically your top-of-the-range kind of diamonds," he says. "These are gem diamonds, they will certainly go for jewelry."

Those close to the deal say the impact of the De Beers move will be felt in many other ways too. Some international banks, which finance the diamond industry, have applied for banking licenses, says the government.

Mohohlo notes that that extra $6 billion flowing through the country's banking system is the "most significant" offshoot of the deal.

Mohohlo adds that the government is aware that diamonds are exhaustible and non-renewable. "Therefore we have to continue to ensure that the benefits deriving from them are there for everybody to see," she says.

For now, though, Botswana's economic future is linked to the precious stones still buried in the soil.
