South Africans turned out Wednesday for their country's first elections since the death of Nelson Mandela, a process that's expected to dent but not end the hold of the party to which he'd long been associated.

The party Mandela once led, the governing African National Congress, held an advantage based on very early results around midnight on Wednesday, according to the South African Press Association.

Once all of the votes are counted, the ANC is expected to hold onto power. But it may have its grip weakened amid growing discontent, particularly among urban voters.

The ANC, which has governed for the past 20 years, still enjoys widespread support as the party that represents the defeat of the apartheid system and the beginning of democracy in South Afprica.

But with President Jacob Zuma dogged by scandals, economic difficulties and concerns over reports of rising corruption, the ANC could see its share of the vote fall from the 65.9% it won in the 2009 elections.

"Many are hoping that the ANC will get a scare in these elections and begin to reflect on some of its failures," wrote South African political commentator Justice Malala in an opinion article for CNN.

Elections called 'a resounding success'

"Frankly they do not see a problem with him having let his home in Nkandla be refurbished at such a high price. In fact they see it as part of the perks of being a ruler," said Achille Mbembe, a professor at the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research in Johannesburg.

"Government wishes to commend all South Africans for the part they have played in making our elections a resounding success," the agency said. "... The nation's fifth democratic elections have undoubtedly added to our legacy of regular and peaceful elections."

Past and future

The ANC is facing its biggest challenges in cities, where analysts say discontent is on the rise, notably among young people, over a lack of quality education and jobs.

The situation is compounded by the fact that many disillusioned young people aren't registered to vote.

Opposition leaders like Mmuse Maimane of the Democratic Alliance are seeking to connect with younger voters.

The Economic Freedom Fighters, a young party formed a few months ago by expelled former ANC Youth leader Julius Malema, is also trying to loosen the governing party's grip on power.
