Call it a new direction in celebrity baby names.

The Twitter universe exploded overnight after reports by TMZ and E! Online that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West named their baby girl North West. A birth certificate confirming the name was filed Friday in Los Angeles County.

"Kim and Kanye would have named their baby South West but that dang airline beat them to it!" comedian Fortune Feimster tweeted.

A Twitter post by Tracy Behr stuck with the directional humor.

There was West's rant during the MTV Video Music Awards, when he stole the mic from Taylor Swift as she was being honored for Best Female Video.

Then Kardashian generated huge buzz with her 72-day marriage to NBA star Kris Humphries.  Their wedding was the subject of a two-night TV special.
