WASHINGTON (CNN)Gov. Chris Christie said President Barack Obama's State of the Union address was "a bit disconnected from reality," arguing that it felt like a "campaign speech" and that the President failed to strike a tone of unity.

When Obama said he had run his final campaign Tuesday night, some members of the audience applauded. Obama quickly shot back: "I know, because I won both of them."

"(Obama) had an opportunity to try to unite the country last night and he didn't take it," Christie said.

"I like straight talkers," she said, "In my county ... we like blunt. It sells well there. We want the unvarnished truth. We know what the challenges are. We want someone who can tell us how to solve those challenges."

After the House members left, Christie spent close to half an hour with Kirk. The senator told reporters that he's been talking to the governor about foreign affairs and they specifically discussed his amendment that would impose sanctions on Iran if the country doesn't agree to a new deal to limit its nuclear weapons program. Kirk is sponsoring the legislation with Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey.

As Christie prepares for a potential presidential bid, he's been trying to boost his foreign policy credentials. The governor's traveling to the United Kingdom next month, making his third foreign trip since September.

Miller said Christie talked about national security and the threat of ISIS during the event, but did not offer specifics.

Rep. Tom Reed, R-New York, said Christie "had a good message about the future" and felt "impressed by his delivery."

"As he's preparing for his decision, he's definitely evolving into a very creditable, national candidate," he said.

Other members who attended included Rep. Patrick Meehan, who co-hosted with Miller, Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey, Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, Rep. Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania, Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois, former Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, and Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey.
