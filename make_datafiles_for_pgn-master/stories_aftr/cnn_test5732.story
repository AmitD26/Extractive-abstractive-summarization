When Alexis Tsipras charged onto the stage, palms clasped high and a broad grin greeting his supporters, he could have been mistaken for the election winner.

As negotiations over a new government continue, questions are being raised around which party -- or parties -- will emerge as the country's dominant center-left force. Pasok, under the Papandreou dynasty, has long staked that claim. But now, with its vote collapsed to just over 12% from almost 44% in 2009, it faces a fight for survival.

And Syriza does not have to run a country in deep recession, with unemployment over 20% and that faces a real risk of toppling out of the euro  -- a challenge for the most experienced political hands.

Tsipras is 37, born the year Greece's military dictatorship fell, and as such represents a political future unfettered by history, according to Voutsadakis. "He hasn't been brought up in this corrupt political system," she said. "This is what we hope for." As for New Democracy and Pasok: "No one wants them."

Instead Tsipras, who had sworn to tear up the austerity plans because he believed it was sending the country to "hell," will likely be a strident voice against the country's leaders. He has said the party, from its position as opposition, will continue to demand the bailouts be scrapped and believes it will be "vindicated" for that position.

"Even if it didn't manage to take the first place, Syriza is now the most basic body representing the average individual, the progressive and the anti-memorandum [anti-bailout] portion of our population," Tsipras said.

Greece's economic orphans

According to Pavlos Tsimas, a Greek journalist and political commentator, Syriza has corralled not only those angry at austerity, but the youth who may be voting for the first time.

A trained civil engineer, who joined the Communist Youth of Greece as a high school student, Tsipras shot to prominence in 2006. After being put forward as a candidate for the mayor of Athens, he swept 10% of the vote to come third -- far more than previous left-wing candidates had managed.

At that point, he became a "media darling," Tsimas said. He has since built a young guard around him, who are of "another generation ... new, fresh and different," Tsimas added.

"I don't consider Mr. Tsipras a progressive," the former Pasok leader said. "I think our agenda was actually a progressive agenda, in reforming the country and changing the country and making the necessary changes in order to be a viable economy and a very transparent and just state," he said.

Papandreou said lessons could be learnt, such as pushing stimulus packages alongside austerity. But a key destabilizing factor, he said, is "the deep sense of uncertainty. For the last two ... two and a half years, what [has been] most corrosive in the Greek society but also in the Greek economy is the sense of this lack of certainty ... that we may be in, or out of the euro."
