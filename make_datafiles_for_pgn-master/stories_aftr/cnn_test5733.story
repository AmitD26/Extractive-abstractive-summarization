(Kaiser Health News)The Obama administration Monday announced a goal of accelerating changes to Medicare so that within four years, half the program's traditional spending will go to doctors, hospitals and other providers that coordinate their patient care, stressing quality and frugality.

Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the administration has been designing new programs and underwriting experiments to come up with alternate payment models.

Last year, 20% of traditional Medicare spending, about $72 billion, went to models such as accountable care organizations, or ACOs, where doctors and others band together to care for patients with the promise of getting a piece of any savings they bring to Medicare, administration officials said.

There are now 424 ACOs, and 105 hospitals and other health care groups that accept bundled payments, where Medicare gives them a fixed sum for each patient, which is supposed to cover not only the initial treatment for a specific ailment but also all the follow-up care.

The administration also wants Medicare spending with any quality component, such as bonuses and penalties on top of traditional fee-for-service payments, to increase, so that by the end of 2018, 90% of Medicare spending has some sort of link to quality.

Monday's announcement did not include any new policies or funding to encourage providers, but Burwell said setting a concrete goal alone would prompt changes not only in Medicare but also in private insurance, where some of these alternative models are also being tried. Leavitt Partners, a consulting firm, counts 317 commercial ACOs and 40 in the Medicaid program.

"For the first time we're actually going to set clear goals and establish a clear timeline for moving from volume to value in the Medicare system," Burwell said at an announcement at the department's headquarters, where she was joined by leading physicians and leaders from the insurance and hospital industries. "So today what we want to do is measure our progress and we want to hold ourselves in the federal government accountable."

Others are wary, particularly since they could lose money if they fall short on either saving Medicare money or achieving the dozens of quality benchmarks the government has established.

In the largest ACO experiment, the Medicare Shared Savings Program, 53 ACOs saved enough money in 2013 to get bonuses from the government, but 41 spent more than the government estimated they should have.

"Government needs to do more to make sure there's more shared savings going back to the providers," said Blair Childs, an executive with Premier, a company that assists hospitals and providers in establishing ACOs and other models.

It is still too early to know whether these alternate payment models improve health of patients and whether the savings that have been achieved so far, often by focusing on the most expensive patients, will plateau. Studies on the success of these programs have shown mixed results.

"We still have very little evidence about which payment methods are going to be successful in getting the results we want, which are better quality care and more affordable care," said Suzanne Delbanco, executive director of Catalyst For Payment Reform, a California-based nonprofit that has been tracking the spread of alternative payment models in the private sector.
