(CNN)The winning machine that is Lindsey Vonn proved unstoppable again Sunday with rivals left trailing in the World Cup super-G at St Moritz.

Vonn had disappointed in the downhill on the same slopes 24 hours earlier, but reasserted her dominance in the speed events with an emphatic victory.

Her latest triumph repeats a feat she last achieved in December 2012 of back to back super-G wins.

Only second placed Anna Fenninger of Austria got within a second of Vonn, the Olympic champion in super-G finishing 0.24 seconds adrift.

A second Austrian, Nicole Hosp, took third at 1.10 seconds slower.

Home home Lara Gut, who won Saturday's downhill, crashed out in the netting, while overall World Cup leader Tina Maze of Slovenia again disappointed in 18th spot.

It is completing perfect preparation for Vonn ahead of next month's world championships in Vail, Colarado.
