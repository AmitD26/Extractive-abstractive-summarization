(CNN) -- To control costs and increase flexibility, more and more U.S. mobile users are choosing no-contract plans (month-to-month or prepaid) for cell phone service.

How happy are consumers with no-contract phones and service? J.D. Power and Associates recently released the results of its 2011 U.S. Wireless Non-Contract Customer Satisfaction Index Study. The no-contract carriers studied were: AT&T Gophone, Boost Mobile, Cricket, MetroPCS, Net10, T-Mobile, Tracfone, Verizon Wireless and Virgin Mobile.

This year, the overall winner was Boost Mobile, which scored top marks for its cost of service, account management practices, initial activation process and offers/promotions. However, Boost scored only a middling grade on performance and reliability, the characteristic that survey participants rated as most important.

The increase in attractive monthly no-contract offers might start stealing customers away from contracts. J.D. Powers notes: "Among customers currently under [a regular carrier contract of a year or more] and who say they are likely to switch their carrier during the next year, nearly 40 percent are likely to choose non-contract service."

Monthly contracts are generally cheaper. According to J.D. Powers: "Monthly non-contract customers spend an average of $32 less per month than do customers with contracts. Monthly non-contract customers spend $60 per month, compared with an average monthly service cost of $92 for customers with service contracts."

Some smartphones are now available on no-contract plans. Most no-contract carriers offer some smartphone deals -- usually for BlackBerry phones, but increasingly for Android and some Windows Phone models, too.

For example, MetroPCS currently offers a no-contract Huawei Ascend touchscreen phone running Android 2.1 for $129 after a $50 instant discount and $30 mail-in rebate; the month-to-month plan cost is $50. Similarly, Virgin Mobile is currently offering the LG Optimus (running Android 2.2) and Samsung Intercept (running Android 2.1) for $199.99, with month-to-month plans starting at $25.
