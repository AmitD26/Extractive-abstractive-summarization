A leading drug candidate for low sexual desire in women hasn't gotten approved for use in the United States, but the company backing it isn't giving up.

Sprout will resubmit the new drug application for flibanserin by the third quarter of this year, the company said.

"We are encouraged by the FDA's response and view it as a significant step toward the approval of flibanserin," said Cindy Whitehead, president and chief operating officer of Sprout Pharmaceuticals, in a statement.

The FDA declined to answer specific questions regarding the matter when contacted by CNN in January.

FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer said in a statement: "The FDA is only able to provide information on approved drug product applications. Any information on an application that has yet to receive an approval or was denied approval belongs to the manufacturer/sponsor developing the drug."

Where's the sex drive drug for women?

Flibanserin was initially developed by pharmaceutical giant Boehringer Ingelheim, but the company ditched it in 2010 after the FDA declined to approve their new drug application, asking for more research, said Dr. Irwin Goldstein, director of sexual medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, California, who collaborated on clinical trials for flibanserin.

In total, more than 11,000 people have participated in clinical trials for flibanserin, Whitehead said. Still, the most recent attempt to get flibanserin off the ground failed; the FDA did not approve the company's revised drug application in October.

Sex is doctor's life's work

A 2013 study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine showed that women taking the drug reported an average increase of 2.5 satisfying sexual events in four weeks, compared to an increase of 1.5 among women using a placebo.

Given that the drug has been through numerous, rigorous clinical trials, and so much has been invested in it, the FDA's refusal to approve it is a turning point in the field of sexual medicine, Goldstein said.

Side effects of flibanserin include dizziness, nausea, fatigue and sleepiness. Unlike some treatments for men, flibanserin needs to be taken once a day, every day.

If there is no positive action on the drug, it could spell doom for pharmacological efforts to manage female sexual desire, he said. "It will go back to dark ages of saying, 'This is all a relationship problem,' even though we know it's not," he said.

Other options

There are other experimental treatments for low female sex drive in the works.

Drugs called Lybrido and Lybridos, developed by a company called Emotional Brain, have undergone several randomized studies with results that are "very promising and will be published soon," according to the company's website. A drug called Bremelanotide is being investigated by Palatin Technologies for both men and women. None of these drugs has completed phase 3 trials, which are necessary before approval.

"A lot of times, the medical community has really put men's needs first and hasn't really addressed women's sexual needs," said Jennifer Foust, a sex therapist in Aventura, Florida, who is not affiliated with flibanserin.

Sex drive is more complicated for women than for men, Foust said. There are a lot of factors that could explain a woman's low desire -- and not all of them are medical, she said. Lifestyle and relationship issues may come into play.

Some couples maintain satisfying sex lives over many years -- but some, over time, go on autopilot and have less and less sex.

"You have to continue to feed your sexual relationship, and feed your relationship in general," Foust said. "A lot of it depends on how much importance and energy you put toward your sex life."

Sometimes stress is the issue, too, she said.

The new drug application the company will submit will be specifically for premenopausal women.
