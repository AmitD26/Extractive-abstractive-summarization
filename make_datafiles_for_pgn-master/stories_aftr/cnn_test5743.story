There is never a day where at least one person isn't outside the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department sitting or standing near an anemic tree, the only place for a bit of shade.

There are almost always two or three people streaming events live. You can hear them loudly sharing thoughts or giving a play-by-play of what's happening.

While their cameras capture live images, they call out what they think are injustices surrounding the August shooting of Michael Brown and the subsequent police crackdown on protesters in the 10 weeks or so since Brown was killed by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson.

Police can tally dozens of arrests a night since the city erupted. Among those placed in cuffs were journalists, clergy, a local rapper, a state senator, a St. Louis alderman and activist/intellectual Cornel West.

It's tough to predict the mood each night. On Tuesday, a small group of about 50 protesters caused no disturbances, and there were no arrests, police said. The next night, five police officers were assaulted with rocks, water bottles and a metal rod as demonstrators blocked traffic and knocked down barricades outside the police department.

Recovery in progress

On West Florissant, where thousands of protesters have marched for months chanting things like "Hands up, don't shoot," buildings still bear the scars of the community's frustration.

At businesses such as the Ferguson Market & Liquor and Red's BBQ, plywood slats sit where windows once stood before violent elements among the protesters looted and vandalized businesses along the corridor. The QuikTrip that was one of the first businesses attacked still lies in shambles, a chain link fence protecting it from further damage.

Asked to elaborate -- is he all right with the looting and burning? -- he says he'd prefer that the protests unfold without the violence and destruction.

"I mean, it is not my preference, no," he said. "I'm more concerned about the conditions that produced this -- the simmering poverty, the simmering oppression, the simmering alienation, the existential crises that black youth feel in America. I am far more concerned about the condition that produced the burning of buildings."

"Our children are in a tremendous amount of pain."

Tinderbox awaiting a match?

That has been a pervasive sentiment since the protests began: Many in Ferguson don't care about reports that a scuffle preceded the shooting and that Brown may have reached for Wilson's gun.

Marquita Rogers, a 27-year-old mother of two who lives a few blocks from the Canfield Green subdivision where Brown died, said in August, when the protests were at their ugliest, that she didn't care what Brown did before encountering Wilson.

Her neighbors, Arvid Wilkerson, 22, and Patricia Pendelton, also predicted during August interviews -- days after a grand jury started hearing evidence in the case and the Justice Department announced an independent investigation -- that the turmoil in Ferguson would only worsen if Wilson wasn't indicted.

"If this police officer don't get no kind of charge," said Pendelton, 41, a nurse, shaking her head, "they think it's chaos now?"

Calculated leaks?

The proceedings in a grand jury inquiry, by law, are not supposed to be made public, and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has told his staff it's "inappropriate and troubling" that information is trickling out while the grand jury and federal investigations are ongoing. He further said that the "selective flow of information coming out of Missouri" is diminishing his faith in local authorities, a Justice Department official said.

Prosecutor Robert McCulloch and Wilson's defense team released separate statements Thursday saying they were not the sources of any of the leaked information.

Sources have confirmed to CNN the information provided to The Times and Post-Dispatch is part of the testimony being considered: that Brown's blood was found on Wilson's uniform and inside his police car and that one of the wounds Brown suffered was a close-range gunshot to his hand after attacking Wilson.

Peruse Twitter, and you'll find that many believe the leaks -- along with Gov. Jay Nixon's announcement this week of a Ferguson Commission to study social and economic conditions -- are harbingers of the grand jury declining to indict Wilson.

"Feeling in Ferguson among protest leaders is that leaks are coming from law enforcement in attempt to signal that no indictment coming," tweeted Wesley Lowery, a Washington Post reporter who was detained in the early days of the protests.

A former federal law enforcement official said something similar.

Amy Hunter lives in St. Louis and is the director of racial justice at YWCA Metro St. Louis. She has been taking part in the protests and notes it's a young people's movement and that Brown was the unfortunate catalyst in a "seminal moment for change."

Asked during a news conference if he, too, was worried that Ferguson could erupt if the grand jury comes back with a no bill, Nixon said Tuesday, "When you have this level of energy and when you have what has happened over 73 days, you can rest well-assured that we are focused and concerned about what could be the most problematic scenarios."

"The only words that would have mattered, that could have possibly began the process of some symbol of justice, is the creation of a special prosecutor or the announcement of the indictment of Darren Wilson," he said.

He also has his doubts about assertions that the case is traversing the justice system and that citizens should have faith as it runs its course.

"This justice system?" Sekou asked. "Which has a wonderful set of facts to support the way it has engaged police who have taken black lives? This justice system?"
