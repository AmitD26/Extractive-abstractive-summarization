(CNN)#BlackLivesMatter has been a hashtag, a mantra, a movement and now it's a college course.

The 2014 deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York during confrontations with police sparked conversations on social media and protests around the world, including Dartmouth's Hanover, New Hampshire, campus.

"There is a special energy around this," said Abigail Neely, an assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth. "It's designed to transgress the boundaries between disciplines in an effort to do some really deep, sustained critical thinking about some of the most important issues in the country and world at this moment."

The course came together quickly with support from college leaders and Dartmouth's African and African-American Studies Program, Neely and Bahng said. Enrollment opens on Friday, but faculty members are still finalizing the syllabus and deciding how many students will be admitted.

An early lesson is expected to focus on St. Louis and its racial history. Another will consider poetry, prose, music and religious sermons. Still others will look at how events in Ferguson were documented through different media and how black activism has evolved, "from hip-hop to hashtags."

In planning the course, "we've already begun the work as a teaching collective," Neely said. "I'm so excited to see what happens when the students join."
