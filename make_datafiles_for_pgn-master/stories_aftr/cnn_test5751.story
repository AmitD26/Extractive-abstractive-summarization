The drive from Tallinn to Auvere in North-Eastern Estonia was long and dark. The winter sun had yet to rise and we saw little of the outside world from our misty car windows.

But unlike shale oil and shale gas which is drilled and often associated with fracking, oil shale is found in rocks just 30 metres underground.

They have so much of the stuff here -- 18 million tonnes are mined here every year -- that they are completely energy independent.

Eesti Energia's CEO, Sandor Liive, tells me that around 90% of the power produced in Estonia is made of oil shale and they even have enough to provide for their neighbors.

"Our production of electricity in Estonia is 11 terrawatts. Estonia consumes less than eight terrawats, so we are a very strong electricity exporter today."

But this is not a new industry for Estonia.

They have been squeezing rocks here for a century and, now that they're making money, companies such as Eesti Energia are investing heavily on new plants, Liive told me.

"Commercial utilization of oil shale started nearly 100 years ago. Estonia got our independence in 1918 and actually Estonia independence is very much close links with the oil shale industry, because in 1924 we already had oil plants in operation, and even gasoline was produced," he said.

"As you can see from here, during last three years, we have invested one billion euros here. So this is not only 100 years of history but this is actually modernization and continuous development of technology and new investments."

During our visit here, one of their proudest achievements -- the Enefit 280 oil shale plant, which will double output of kerogen oil -- was already taking shape.

"Oil shale is the dirtiest fuel used today in European Union. The external cost of the oil shale power is 18 euro cents, coal is about is 10 cents per kw hour, wind is 0.4 euro cents  -- that gives you a picture of the ecological footprint of the oil shale used," he told me.

It's a charge that I put to Eesti Energia's CEO who counter-argued by telling me that for the land they shift is replanted with trees.

One thing is very clear, the environmental impact is very predictable. Off course, we mine, we have some mining impact -- we move the land, but we put it back and we plant a lot of trees. I think in [the] energy business anyway, and in any industry, [there is] an environmental impact, even in the wind turbine has an environmental impact."

This may be the case (carbon is hovering around four euros a tonne). But some in the European parliament are calling for prices to be pushed back up as much as fifty euros a tonne, a price that could be damaging for a business like this one which has built itself mostly on shale.

While Liive may be worried about oil prices and emission costs, he tells me it's not enough to make him lose sleep.
