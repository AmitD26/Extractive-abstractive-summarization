A heavy downpour started more than four hours before the match but the roof on the stadium was never closed, so allowing the pitch to become unplayable.

World governing body FIFA delayed kick-off to see if conditions improved but the referee called the game off 45 minutes after it should have started, rescheduling the match for Wednesday afternoon.

The 58,000-capacity stadium was specifically built for the 2012 European Championship, at a cost of nearly $650 million, which Poland co-hosted in June along with neighbors Ukraine.

"It takes 15 minutes to close the roof. However, this cannot happen in a temperature below zero, with very strong wind, and rain deposited on the folded  roof," added Daria Kuklinska, a spokeswoman for the stadium operator.

"The FA condemns both the scenes of racism and the confrontation at the final whistle during which time our players and staff were under extreme provocation," said the English FA in a statement.

Among the World Cup qualifiers that were played on Tuesday, Germany were held 4-4 at home by Sweden despite leading by four goals with an hour gone.

A brace from Miroslav Klose had helped Germany assume a seemingly unassailable lead in Berlin only for Sweden to take advantage of an uncharacteristic lack of German resilience, as Rasmus Elm dramatically earned a point deep in the 93rd minute.

Another team to be denied in the last minute were Spain, whose remarkable run of 24 consecutive wins in qualifying games -- which stretched back to 2007 -- was ended when drawing 1-1 at home to 1998 World Cup winners France in Madrid.

Ronaldo had started the night in high spirits as he was presented  with a special cap to mark the occasion but after the match, the Real Madrid star left the pitch in pouring rain sporting a face like thunder.

In South America, Uruguay -- who finished third at the World Cup two years ago -- were humbled in La Paz where Bolivia won 4-1, with Luis Suarez scoring a consolation goal for the visitors late on.
