Tomahawk missiles launched from the sea began the strikes against the Sunni Muslim extremists, followed by bombers and fighters.

Here are answers to key questions about the new phase in the conflict with ISIS:

The extremists have made the city, which sits on the banks of the Euphrates River, the de facto capital of their self-declared "Islamic State" that stretches across large areas of Syria and Iraq.

ISIS targets around other Syrian cities -- Deir Ezzor, Al Hasakah and Abu Kamal -- were also hit in the strikes.

What is the Khorasan Group?

What was struck?

"Usually the first part of any air campaign are strategic targets -- fixed locations, big buildings, things that you don't need a guy on the ground to laser-designate," said retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, an Air Force veteran intelligence officer and CNN military analyst.

The Pentagon also said ISIS fighters were hit in the strikes but didn't specify how many.

Why is Raqqa a focus of the initial strikes?

The targets hit by the airstrikes are intended to hurt ISIS' ability to command and control, resupply and train, a senior U.S. military official told CNN's Jim Sciutto.

Who is taking part in the airstrikes?

"It's a remarkable diplomatic achievement," said CNN Political Commentator Peter Beinhart. "I don't think it was expected that there would be this much Arab support."

How long will the attacks go on?

For a while.

The first wave of strikes was expected to last into the early hours of Tuesday morning in Syria, CNN's Sciutto reported.

"This is not a definitive blow," said Mudd, who previously worked for the CIA. "When this gets interesting to me as a former practitioner is six months down the road, when a second-tier ISIS commander starts to create some sort of cell to recruit foreigners from Europe or the United States or Canada into Syria, do we still have the will and capability, and the intelligence, to locate that person, or that group of people, and put lead on the target?"

What happens next?

The response of ISIS fighters to the initial strikes may give military officials clues on what to target next.

"The follow-up to some of these strikes is -- what are their actions now?" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a CNN military analyst. "There is intelligence that flows from the initial strike," he said.

The Arab governments involved in the strikes could also face discontent among their own people.

"Parts of the population do not agree with Sunni going against Sunni," Hertling said.

There was no immediate confirmed comment from the militant group on the strikes.

ISIS' official Bayan Radio tweeted a photo that it claimed showed damage to a communications tower in Raqqa. CNN wasn't immediately able to independently verify the image.

The militant group has increased security patrols in Raqqa, an opposition activist told CNN.

ISIS has previously linked the U.S. campaign of airstrikes in Iraq to its decision to execute three of its Western hostages -- two Americans and one Briton. It also recently called for attacks against the United States and its allies.

Hadi al Bahra, the President of the Syrian Opposition Coalition, welcomed the strikes.

"Tonight, the international community has joined our fight against ISIS in Syria," he said in a statement. "We have called for airstrikes such as those that commenced tonight with a heavy heart and deep concern, as these strikes begin in our own homeland. We insist that utmost care is taken to avoid civilian casualties."

Did the U.S. consult with the Syrian government beforehand?

Beinhart said al-Assad's government may end up as "the real winner" from the airstrikes on ISIS, since the moderate U.S.-backed rebels aren't "in a position to take this territory that we are pulverizing from the air."

The White House argues it doesn't need any new authority; that it's using an existing authorization to combat al Qaeda to expand its airstrike campaign.

They say they were open to holding a vote on military action against ISIS -- but not until after the midterm elections in November.

"It was one thing to attack in Iraq, where you had a government that wanted us to," Beinhart said. "But Congress did not vote for U.S. airstrikes in Syria and we don't have a government requesting us to do that."

When the strikes began, Congress had already left town to campaign for the midterm elections, and most of the reaction came from those who had pressed the administration to act sooner. Privately, many of them conceded  they were relieved not to have to take a vote on a controversial issue just weeks before voters went to the polls in November.
