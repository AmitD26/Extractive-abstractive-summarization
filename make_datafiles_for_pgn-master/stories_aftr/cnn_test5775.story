(CNN)Police officer and former U.S. Army Ranger John Moynihan was honored at the White House less than a year ago as one of the nation's "Top Cops" for helping to save a transit officer wounded in a gunbattle with the Boston Marathon bombers.

"He's a strong kid," Police Commissioner William Evans told reporters. "He's a fighter. He's going to pull through."

On Sunday, after several hours of surgery to remove the bullet from his neck, Moynihan, who had been listed in critical condition, was in stable and improving condition, according to a Twitter posting by the Boston Police Department.

A six-year police veteran and member of the youth violence task force, Moynihan was shot below the right eye. The bullet lodged behind his right ear, Evans said.

Police fired nearly 300 rounds within five to 10 minutes. One round nearly killed Donohue.

A 33-year police veteran, Donohue was pale and appeared dead as four officers laid him on a gurney.

"He was essentially dead," said Dr. Heather Studley, who took over his care at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge.

"There are officers here who were in the thick of two attacks last year:  the shooting at the Washington Naval Yard and the bombing at the Boston Marathon," Obama said at the time. "On those awful days -- and we all remember them -- amid the smoke and the chaos, the courage of these officers shone through.  And their quick thinking and level-headedness undoubtedly saved lives."

Six officers in separate cars, sirens blaring, were involved in the traffic stop, which was captured by surveillance cameras in the area.

Moynihan walked up to the driver's side door. A man started to step out.

After shooting Moynihan, the suspect ran, turned around and fired at the other officers -- emptying his .357 Magnum, according to Evans.

Evans said a middle-aged woman was who driving by at the time suffered a flesh wound in the right arm. She was not identified.

The shooter, identified as 41-year-old Angelo West, was shot and killed. Evans said West had several prior gun convictions.

Two passengers in the car were arrested on unrelated charges involving an outstanding warrant and a probation violation.

At a news conference, Evans and local leaders sought to allay community concerns at a time when officer-involved shootings have led to protests throughout the nation. Moynihan is white; West was black.

"Our officers did what they had to do," the police commissioner said.

The Rev. Mark Scott of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston said Moynihan was shot "assassination-style." He called for calm in the predominantly black Roxbury section.

Evans said 1,071 guns were taken off the streets in Boston in 2014, with the youth violence task force and other units helping to seize more than 700.

Moynihan is a decorated Army Ranger with stints in Iraq from 2005 to 2008, according to the police department.
