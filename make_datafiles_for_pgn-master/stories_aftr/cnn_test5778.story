According to EW, New Line Cinema is planning a Mariah Carey Christmas movie. Producer Jonathan Shestack confirmed that he is working on the yet-untitled project with Carey's good friend director Brett Ratner co-producing.

"It's a little bit about how music can take you back in time," Shestack told EW. "It will be everything you hope a Christmas movie with Mariah Carey would be."

What is the Christmas season without a little Mariah?

Duh!

Her 1994 hit "All I Want For Christmas is You" is a classic, and admit it: You start listening to it well before the holiday season even begins. It's the jam!

The '90s are so coming back

The Backstreet Boys have a documentary out, NBC is bringing the sitcom "Coach" back to television, JNCO jeans are being spotted, and there's talk of a new version of "Full House."

Mariah was the queen of the 1990s, so it's only right that she get in on the revival.

You can't forget about her
