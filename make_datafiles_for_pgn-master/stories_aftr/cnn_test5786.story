BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- A top Iraqi political figure -- who also is an imam at a prominent Shiite mosque in the capital -- urged the abolition of militias Friday and decried violence and pervasive corruption in Baghdad's Sadr City.

Sheikh Jalal al-Din Ali al-Saghir, speaking at Buratha Mosque, blamed the corruption on followers of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.

His political group dominates the Iraqi security forces and has been fighting members of a rival Shiite group, al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia.

He said the Supreme Council, part of the ruling United Iraqi Alliance, once had an armed group called the Badr Brigade that is now a renamed non-military organization. He repeated Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's call for all armed groups not affiliated with the government to disband.

He praised Iraqi security forces' efforts in Basra, the southern Shiite city where al-Maliki launched an offensive in March. The cleric said al-Maliki freed the region of gangs.

"The elections will be tomorrow," he said, meaning soon. "How can we respect ourselves as politicians, political parties and officials within the government? How can we respect ourselves by saying we conduct honest elections while there are gangs controlling areas or provinces?"

Meanwhile, Sadrist cleric Suhail al-Iqabi delivered a fiery sermon in the eastern part of Baghdad as hundreds of Sadr City residents sat on the street performing Friday prayers. Al-Iqabi said an "act of genocide" is taking place in the town.

"What the prime minister stated in his press conference, all that he said that was so far from reality, the nonsense and false accusations he used to cover up his huge failure leading the nation's affairs," al-Iqabi said. "... We call on all politicians, journalists, intellectuals, civil society institutions, tribal leaders and clergy to visit Sadr City to witness the crimes committed by the occupier and government forces."

"I believe the coming days will witness many developments which will lead to the protection of this city from these gangs," he said.

He urged people who have grievances to make their voices heard through the political process. He decried those who arm themselves under the pretext of sectarianism or occupation.

Al-Saghir emphasized what he called corruption in Sadr City and the role of Sadrist followers in promoting it.

He noted that imams from the Supreme Council were booted from several mosques and replaced by politically correct imams, and he said companies have to pay off the Sadrists to get contracts. He said fuel tanker drivers face the risk of losing their trucks to fire or theft if they don't pay off political groups.

Meanwhile Friday, a U.S. soldier was killed in Baghdad after a roadside bomb struck the soldier's vehicle, the military said.

The soldier was part of a combat patrol in eastern Baghdad when a roadside bomb struck the patrol vehicle at about 6:15 p.m. local time.

The soldier's name is being withheld until family has been notified, the U.S. army's public affairs department in Baghdad said.

The military blamed the Sunni militant group al Qaeda in Iraq for Thursdays' attack that killed 35 people and wounded dozens more in Balad Ruz, a town northeast of Baghdad in the volatile Diyala province.

Iran's state-run news agency IRNA confirmed the delegation was in Tehran.

CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq, Jomana Karadsheh, Shirzad Bozorgmehr and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.
