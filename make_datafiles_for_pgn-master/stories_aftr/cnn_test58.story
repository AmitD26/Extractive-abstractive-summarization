Washington (CNN) -- Staff members at eight Head Start centers manipulated income information given to them by undercover applicants so that the applicants would get benefits they were not qualified for, according to a Government Accountability Office report being released Tuesday.

The GAO report says undercover applicants made 15 visits to 13 centers in six states and the District of Columbia to register their fictitious children.

At eight of those centers, Head Start employees disregarded "part of the families' income to register over-income children into under-income slots" or "lied about applicants' employment status or misrepresented their earnings," the report says.

The Head Start program provides child development services to around 1 million children of low-income families. Because of its popularity, many Head Start centers have waiting lists for spots for children. The GAO report raises concerns that many Head Start slots are taken up by children of families that are not low income, thereby leaving the targeted low income children on the waiting lists.

The GAO undercover operation also looked at centers in California, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas and the District of Columbia.

"Allowing ineligible children to enroll in the program is a blatant violation of head Start's rules and it steals opportunity from children who need it most," Sebelius wrote.
