"Living in such close proximity, the potential for this outbreak to spread quickly is quite high, Davies, MSF project coordinator for South Darfur, told CNN.

"With no health care providers to give vaccinations, and with no one to manage the meningitis cases when they come, it's really concerning," she added.

Davies told CNN she experienced no harassment, and said government officials had  been in contact with only the head of MSF's regional operations.

"We haven't actually been given any reason on why we were expelled," she said. "We have absolutely no idea when we'll be able to return."

Doctors Without Borders was among 13 aid agencies, including Mercy Corps and the International Rescue Committee, that were ordered by the government to shut down their operations in Sudan last week.

So far the agency has confirmed 32 meningitis cases and four deaths, and has seen dozens of other suspected cases.

"One of our priorities is to get another organization to take over our programs there," Davies added.

Davies also said she is worried about the cut-off of MSF's feeding and maternal delivery services: "We had over 100 patients on our feeding program that now won't be receiving any follow up."

The decision by the Sudanese government to throw out the aid groups came a day after the International Criminal Court at The Hague issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur.

The U.N. has received reports that international staff members of five non-governmental organizations had been detained for up to four hours.

In some cases Sudanese government representatives "had started gathering banking details and confiscating computers, communications equipment and vehicles from the NGOs", a U.N spokesman said at a news conference last week.

Last week, the U.N. warned that the loss of  NGOs in Sudan would cause 1.1 million people to go without food aid and health care, and more than 1 million to have no access to water.

"These agencies are vital implementation partners for the United Nations and account for at least half of the humanitarian capacity in Darfur," said Catherine Bragg, U.N. Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator at the news conference in New York.
