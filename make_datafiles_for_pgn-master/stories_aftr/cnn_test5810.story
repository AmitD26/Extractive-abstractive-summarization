Socialist Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister, told Prime Minister Francois Fillon: "You tell us this would mean more independence and more influence. It would probably mean less independence and less influence."

The move did not technically require parliamentary approval, but the president's party scheduled the debate to give opponents a chance to voice their opinions -- and to show a majority backed it.

Asking the National Assembly to vote on the issue also showed how sensitive the matter is in France.

France was a founding member of the NATO alliance in 1949 but it left the military structure in 1966 amid friction with the United States.

"To cooperate is to lose your independence," French President Charles de Gaulle said at the time.

For the next 43 years, even though France selectively participated in NATO military operations, de Gaulle's principle remained the governing cornerstone of French foreign policy.

If Paris took orders from NATO military commanders, it was reasoned, the nation would no longer have complete control of its destiny.

Rejoining NATO's military command, he argued, will give France a seat at the table for decision-making.

Meanwhile, the European nations felt the United States was trying to dominate the organization, according to NATO.

In 1995, France rejoined NATO's military committee, which advises NATO's political authorities on military policy and strategy and provides guidance on military matters to NATO's strategic commanders.

While France was still not a part of the military command, it contributed troops and funding to NATO activities, including actions in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Half of all French troops outside the country are assigned to NATO military operations.

"With this decision, France will return as a subordinate country and will lose its ability to represent another image in the world," said Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a member of the French National Assembly.

The president's allies calculate Sarkozy's move will strengthen Europe's hand on defense issues.
