The program, which will run February 15 through March 15, will include training to recognize behaviors that may lead to suicide and instruction on how to intervene.

The Army will follow the training with another teaching program, from March 15 to June 15, focused on suicide prevention at all unit levels.

Earlier Thursday, the Army reported the highest one-year level of suicides among its soldiers since it began tracking the rate 28 years ago.

The Army said that 128 soldiers were confirmed to have committed suicide in 2008, and an additional 15 were suspected to have committed suicide that year in cases under investigation among active-duty soldiers and activated National Guard and reserves.

In 2007, the Army reported 115 confirmed suicides, which was then the highest level since 1980, when it began tracking suicides.

The Army and the National Institute of Mental Health signed an agreement in October to conduct research to identify factors affecting the mental and behavioral health of soldiers and to share strategies to lower the suicide rate.

The five-year study will examine active-duty, National Guard and reserve soldiers and their families.
