LA PAZ, Bolivia (CNN)  -- Bolivian President Evo Morales nationalized the Chaco petroleum company Friday, taking over the BP subsidiary with the military on standby.

Bolivian leader Evo Morales speaks before parliament Thursday in the capital, La Paz.

Chaco is jointly owned by Pan American Energy and the Bolivian Pension Fund, each with a 50 percent stake, BP spokesman David Nicholas said from Great Britain. BP owns 60 percent of Pan American Energy, and Bridas Corp. owns the other 40 percent, Nicholas said

Formed in 1997, Chaco employs about 90 Bolivians, the company says on its Web site.

Morales decreed in 2007 and 2008 that the government should nationalize various petroleum companies.

His actions Friday came less than 48 hours before Bolivians vote Sunday on a new constitution that would give the central government more power and control.
