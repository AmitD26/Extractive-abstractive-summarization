(CNN) -- Anne and Michael Harris were an "extraordinary" couple with a zest for life, their niece said.

Anne and Michael Harris' niece says the couple "loved life, loved everyone."

The Harrises were two of three Americans on board Air France Flight 447 when it crashed Monday.

The plane was carrying 228 passengers and crew from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France, when it crashed four hours into the journey. Investigators have not determined the cause of the accident.

An official list with the victims' names was not available Wednesday afternoon.

The couple were traveling to Paris for a training seminar and vacation, Miley said.

She remembered a moment a few summers ago when her family was in Vermont, and had just seen a classical performance of Mozart.

They were "just sitting around and having a glass of wine, and laughing and talking about family and life and what was going on in our lives ... [the Harrises] could never get enough information about what all their nieces and nephews and family members were doing," she said.

"It's really the last time I can remember us all sitting around as a family and I'm so glad that I have that memory."

"The grief and the grieving process is beginning and we're just really focused on helping each other heal."

The majority of the people on the flight came from Brazil, France and Germany. The remaining victims were from 29 other countries.

Nine of those employees had won the trip to Rio from CGED because of their strong work performance, AFP said.

"There was a competition for the best sales reps ... and nine of them won and went to Brazil for four days," Laurent Bouveresse, CGED chief executive, told AFP.

CNN tried repeatedly to reach representatives of CGED.

"I just hope that they were not suffering, and at least they were together, because I would have hated for one of them to go through it alone," Buzby said.

"They were my two best friends. I just hope she knows I loved her," Buzby said.
