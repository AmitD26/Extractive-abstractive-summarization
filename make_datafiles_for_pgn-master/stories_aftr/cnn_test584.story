In an embarrassing blow to its perception from an increasingly skeptical public, the Nigerian military Thursday retracted a report that nearly all the 129 school  girls kidnapped by suspected Boko Haram militants had been released.

Just hours after a parent of an abducted girl claimed the Defense Ministry lied Wednesday about all but eight girls finding freedom, the director of defense said the initial report was "not intended to deceive the public."

"The number of those still missing is not the issue now as the life of every Nigerian is very precious," it said.

'Blatant lie'

They are shocked that the government resorted to "blatant propaganda" and a "blatant lie," he said.

Olukolade said the military received a "major breakthrough" report from a reliable source who supposedly included information from the principal of the school where the students were seized by gunmen Monday night.

Olukolade called the misinformation an "unfortunate development indeed."

How many are still missing?

But the principal and Zanna each put the number at 14. Three girls escaped their captors Wednesday and were returned home by herdsmen, Zanna said. Others escaped from a broken truck as the abductors stopped, he said.

When a truck broke down, the girls inside were transferred to another truck and the broken one was set afire, the girl said.

Boko Haram means "Western education is sin"  in the local Hausa language. The Islamist militant group is waging a campaign of violence in northeastern Nigeria, particularly in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states.

The militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike. Human Rights Watch says more than 3,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram-related violence in the past five years.

Armed militant groups in Nigeria's northeastern region are nothing new, but Boko Haram has taken the violence to unprecedented levels since 2009.

Borno is one of three states under a state of emergency since mid-May.

Britain offers help

UNICEF has called for the girls' "immediate and unconditional release" and said  attacks on Nigerian schools are getting out of control.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague was among the world leaders condemning the kidnappings.

"We stand ready to provide assistance to help the Nigerian government ensure that these children can be returned to their families in safety, and to bring to justice those responsible" for the "cowardly act," he said.
