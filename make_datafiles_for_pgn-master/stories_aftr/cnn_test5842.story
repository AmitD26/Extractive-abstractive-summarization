(CNN)  -- Didier Drogba is backing his Ivory Coast team to make history by becoming the first African country to reach the final of the World Cup next year.

The Chelsea striker scored the decisive goal as the Elephants sealed their place in South Africa with a 1-1 draw against Malawi on Saturday, but he is now looking ahead to the finals with relish.

"It is going to be a challenge," the 31-year-old told reporters.

"To make it to the final will not be easy because there are great teams like Brazil and Germany who have won the World Cup for many years.

"I hope that we'll be the team that is going to go to the final and win the competition."

Drogba is one of several stars in the Ivorian squad with Champions League experience, including Barcelona's Yaya Toure who is anxious to erase memories of their failure to qualify from the group stages in the 2006 finals in Germany.

"But I think with this kind of experience, it will be possible at South Africa 2010 to do much better. Perhaps we can make the quarterfinals and then semifinals, this is something we can achieve."

"We are very proud to participate in the World Cup for the second consecutive time and this time it is going to be better," he added.
