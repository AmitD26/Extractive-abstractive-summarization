Newark, New Jersey (CNN)  -- A Transportation Security Administration officer has been reassigned after Sunday's security breach at Newark's Liberty International Airport, according to the TSA.

Davis confirmed Monday that the TSA had not been able to locate the individual who breached security, but there was no indication that the individual presented a serious threat, she said.

The incident Sunday evening forced the closure of a terminal for hours while authorities rescreened thousands of passengers.

All passengers had been rescreened by early Monday, according to the TSA. Flights from Terminal C were grounded until the process was completed.

"I just saw one woman pleading with a gate agent, saying that she had two small children and a heart condition -- that she simply could not take this," Cho said. "But of course, there will be no exceptions."

Newark Liberty International Airport, about 15 miles from Manhattan, is the second-largest hub for Continental.

The airport handles approximately 35 million passengers a year.

CNN's Susan Candiotti, Ross Levitt and Jamie Guzzardo contributed to this report.
