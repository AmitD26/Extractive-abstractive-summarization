(CNN)  -- Toyota Motor Corp. has recently been in the hot seat after issuing massive recalls because of problems related to the accelerator pedal in several of its auto models.

To date, 8.1 million vehicles worldwide have been recalled by the manufacturer, with the possibility of more to come after Thursday's announcement by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration of a formal investigation into brake problems with the 2010 Prius.

As the company's woes continue to mount, there has been some speculation from critics such as Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, as to whether Toyota's recent problems with sudden unintended acceleration go beyond the problems already identified.

Speaking on Wednesday to CNN's Campbell Brown, Larry Webster of Popular Mechanics magazine spoke at length on the problem, saying that "in the last decade, there have been tens of thousands of reports of sudden unintended acceleration in cars made by all the manufacturers." Is this true?

The CNN Fact Check Desk wondered: Which other car manufacturers have had a problem with sudden unintended acceleration?

• The top five manufacturers of cars driven in the United States are General Motors, Toyota, Ford, Honda and Chrysler.

• Recalls due to incidents of sudden unintended acceleration are not limited to the big five manufacturers. According to the NHTSA database, recalls have also been issued for vehicles made by Nissan, BMW, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Mazda, Land Rover, Suzuki and Volvo.
