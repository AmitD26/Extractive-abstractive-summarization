(CNN) --   Over the past week, I've been inundated with questions about swine flu, via Facebook, Twitter, CNN blogs and e-mail. So this week I'm empowering people with information about swine flu: how to protect yourself, what all the numbers mean and why you shouldn't freak out.

The most recnt advice from the CDC is that non-essential travel to Mexico should be avoided.

2. The folks who have it now, did they get it from pigs or people?

It appears that no one in the United States with swine flu had any contact with pigs. Dr. Richard Besser, the acting director of the CDC, said in a news conference Friday that among the first seven cases, no one had contact with pigs. In another press conference Monday, he added that investigators have looked to see whether any of the infected people had contact with pigs, and "we're not finding that linkage here."

Yes, you should, unless it's essential. That's the advice from a recent CDC travel warning.  Watch Elizabeth Cohen answer your questions »

5. Should I be freaking out?

"You can acquire this infection if you're within the 'breathing zone' of a sick person, which is about three to six feet," Schaffner said. "And we usually mean being this close to someone in a confined space. We're not talking about fleeting contact. We're not talking about walking past someone in the street. You need sustained contact." If you think you might have sustained contact with someone who's ill, read this guidance from the CDC's Web site.

7. Yikes! Every day I'm that close to countless people -- at work, on the bus, at church, in a movie theater. Could I get swine flu from them?

Yes.

"If you're standing next to someone on a bus, or sitting next to someone or in front of someone in a theater, you could acquire the infection in that fashion," Schaffner said. That's why people with the symptoms of any kind of flu -- fever, diarrhea, body aches, vomiting, etc. -- are urged to stay home and away from groups of people.

8. Wasn't there a vaccine at one time? Is there one now?

The 1976 vaccine wouldn't be helpful anyway, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy & Infectious Diseases.

Here are two scientific articles about the swine flu outbreak and vaccination program in 1976:

•Swine Influenza A Outbreak, Fort Dix, New Jersey, 1976

9. Many young, healthy people have become sick in the United States. Many of the dead in Mexico have been young and healthy. What's going on? Usually we think of flu as affecting the very young and the very old.

This is the big mystery doctors are trying to solve right now. Many infectious disease experts say it's most likely a matter of numbers: with more illnesses in Mexico, there are also more deaths. Other explanations: that in Mexico people have, in addition to swine flu, other viruses that make for a more deadly combination than swine flu alone. It's also possible that the virus infecting the rest of the world is a weaker version than the one in Mexico. Among the swine flu mysteries: Why only deaths in Mexico?

11. Could this new swine flu virus have been manufactured by bioterrorists?

That's the theory on some conspiracy theorists' Web sites. But experts don't believe it.

12. I get a flu shot every fall. Will that help protect me against swine flu?

13. I was in Mexico two weeks ago. Could I have contracted swine flu, and the symptoms just haven't shown up yet?

No. The incubation period of the swine flu is one to seven days.

"If you just traveled to Mexico and you're home and feeling well you should get on with your daily life and not worry about it," Evans said.

14. Can the swine flu virus live on inanimate objects? If someone with swine flu touches a doorknob, then I touch it, could I get swine flu?

Flu viruses can live on inanimate surfaces. So theoretically, you could get swine flu from touching a doorknob that was just touched by an infected person. However, that's pretty unlikely, according to Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of epidemiology in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley.

Schaffner agrees, adding that flu viruses don't survive in large numbers on surfaces. "A doorknob isn't a warm, nourishing environment for a virus," he said.

15. What should I do if I develop symptoms of swine flu?

Call your doctor -- don't just drive on over, Schaffner advised. "Follow the instructions of your doctor. He might not want you in the waiting room spreading germs to others," he said.

The emergence of the swine flu has raised many questions; here are some answers

@highlight

Swine flu was first identified in 1930 when researchers isolated the virus in a pig

Why people are dying in Mexico but not in other places is still a mystery

@highlight

While the virus can live on surfaces, transmission is unlikely
