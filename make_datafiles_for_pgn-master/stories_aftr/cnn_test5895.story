ANTIOCH, California (CNN) -- A bone fragment found near the northern California home of kidnapping and rape suspect Phillip Garrido could add another chapter to the twisted tale.

Cases of missing girls Ilene Misheloff, left, and Michaela Garecht now linked to Garrido investigation.

Investigators said they found the bone on a neighbor's property in an area to which Garrido had access.

Crews were using cadaver dogs to search the property, said Jimmy Lee, a spokesman for the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department.

Investigators are looking into other cases that may involve Garrido, giving hope to parents including Sharon Murch, whose daughter, Michaela Garecht, was abducted at age 9 in 1988.

Dugard has begun the process of getting to know her mother again, said her stepfather, Carl Probyn.

"She's doing good," Probyn told CNN's Larry King on Monday. "She's with a group and they're taking care of her and they're getting adjusted."

FBI special agent Chris Campion, lead federal investigator in the case, said Dugard's mother, Terry Probyn, was "ecstatic" her daughter was found.

The similarities in the cases, the fact that Dugard was found close to home and comments from neighbors make Murch think her daughter could have been on Garrido's compound.

"I understand that a few years ago, one of the neighbors called in and said that there were girls being kept in the backyard. ... She said that there were a number of girls that came and went, but that there was a core group of five," Murch said. She hopes her daughter was among them.

Garrido was convicted of kidnapping and raping Katie Callaway Hall in 1976. He was released after serving 10 years of a 50-year sentence. He was labeled a sex offender and put on lifetime parole.

"I can't imagine what Jaycee is going through. He had me for eight hours. He had her for 18 years," Hall said.

The revelations came in documents obtained by CNN that Garrido delivered to an FBI office in San Francisco, California, just days before he was arrested in the Dugard case.

Garrido also wrote that he could control minds with sound and could help others before they committed violence.

Dugard apparently led an outwardly unremarkable life. Customers of Garrido's printing company, Printing for Less, knew her as "Allissa."

"She was always having a very pretty smile on the face," said Deepal Karunaratne, who had real estate brochures printed. "She comes and talks to me and was always smiling. She was a very pretty girl, a very pretty young lady."

Garrido even used a picture of Dugard to promote his printing company, customer Cheyvonne Molino said.

"They were polite," Molino said. "They were well-mannered."
