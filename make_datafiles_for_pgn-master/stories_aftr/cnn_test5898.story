"We detected Kim Jong-il's train heading towards China, over the border, at midnight Wednesday," a source at South Korea's presidential office said. "We assume that Kim is aboard the train, and are trying to find out his destination and the purpose of his visit."

As is common with the secretive state, the visit was unannounced and no agenda has been released. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to questions regarding Kim Jong-il's visit. The North Korean Embassy in Beijing said it had no information regarding the visit.

The alleged movement is taking place amid speculation that the ailing Kim, 68, who is believed to have suffered a stroke two years ago, is preparing to officially announce his son, Kim Jong-eun, as his successor.

Meanwhile, Carter arrived in Pyongyang Wednesday on a humanitarian mission to negotiate the release of U.S. citizen Aijilon Gomes, believed to be a Christian activist, who is currently imprisoned in the country after entering it illegally in January.

There have been hopes of some breakthrough in tense Pyongyang-Washington relations with Carter's visit. Carter's 1994 talks with the late Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il's father, paved the way for the "Agreed Framework" the same year, an agreement designed to reign in Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.

These events come amid intense speculation surrounding North Korea's leadership, given that the state will be holding only its third-ever Workers Party Congress in September.

"Kim Jong-il, I think, would be looking primarily for expressions of economic support and political support," added Mike Chinoy, author of Meltdown: The Inside Story of the North Korean Nuclear Crisis. "He needs Chinese help to keep his economy afloat and the Chinese remain North Korea's best friend"

With Carter being greeted by Kim Gye-gwan in Pyongyang, and with Wu visiting Seoul, there may be a desire by Pyongyang and/or Beijing to restart stalled denuclearization talks.

While the 1994 "Agreed Framework" fell apart soon after the George W. Bush administration accused Pyongyang of a secret atomic arms program in 2002, Beijing has invested considerable credibility in sponsoring the six-party talks, designed to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.

China has railed against U.S. and South Korean naval exercises held in the eastern Pacific following the sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan in March, perhaps explaining why Beijing wishes for a resumption of dialogue at this time.

"I think Beijing would like to contain any further escalation of military exercises generated as a result of the Cheonan incident," said Korea University's Kim. "It is not in their interest to have a further tightening of the U.S.-Korea-Japan alliance."

South Korea, however, may be less willing to resume talks, given the talks' history, and given current public anger over the Cheonan, in which 46 sailors died.
