(CNN) -- Police in Collierville, Tennessee, are investigating the disappearance of a former professional basketball player and say "there is a high level of concern" in the search to find him.

"This is not like him," Wright's sister, Savia Archie, told CNN Tuesday. "I haven't talked to my brother in nine days. He doesn't go without talking to family.

"I'm trying to keep my faith in the world and that he's not in trouble and hopefully he will come home. He's my big brother. Without him, there's no me."

"Our detectives have talked to a lot of people -- former coaches, players, sports agents -- and continue to follow leads given by the public," Heuberger said, "and we're working very close to the family."

The 6-foot-11-inch Wright, who lives in Atlanta, was a forward/center for several teams during his professional basketball career. He played with the Los Angeles Clippers, Atlanta Hawks, Memphis Grizzlies and Sacramento Kings. He was with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2008-2009, his last year in the NBA.

Wright, who has six children, completed his degree at the University of Memphis in 2003, according to the official NBA website.

Police are asking anyone with information on his whereabouts to call 901-853-3207.
