Texas Gov. Rick Perry suspended his struggling presidential campaign Thursday and threw his support to Newt Gingrich, a development that could alter the dynamics of the Republican race just two days before the tightening South Carolina primary.

"I believe Newt is a conservative visionary who can transform our country. We've had our differences, which campaigns will inevitably have, and Newt is not perfect, but who among us is?" Perry said at a press conference in Charleston, South Carolina.

Perry said "there is no viable path forward for me in this 2012 campaign."

Shortly after Perry's speech, the former House speaker released a statement on the endorsement.

One source close to the Perry campaign said Perry made the final decision Wednesday night and spoke with Gingrich on the phone shortly before he held the press conference Thursday morning.

Asked if Perry's wife, Anita, agreed with the governor's decision, Sullivan said the family is all "supportive."

The campaigns of Gingrich and Rick Santorum reached out to the Perry campaign Thursday morning in an "aggressive effort" to get his endorsement, according to a source close to Perry.

Perry placed fifth in Iowa and last in New Hampshire -- a state in which he did not actively compete -- and had said he would launch a bid to win in South Carolina.

"South Carolinians are looking for a conservative candidate that will get this country back working again and I am it," Perry told CNN last week.

"We're convinced that that's our goal, so the idea that we're going to do anything else, other than try to impact this election is -- that's why we got in it. We didn't get in it because it was our purpose in life to be the president of the United States. We did it because it was our purpose to serve this country, and that's what we've been called for, and that's what we're going to continue doing."

On Thursday, his campaign website continued to say "help Rick Perry win South Carolina and get America back on track."
