LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Catherine Zeta-Jones is limbering up for her Broadway debut.

Catherine Zeta-Jones will make her Broadway debut in Stephen Sondheim's "A Little Night Music."

The production is set to open December 13 at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York's theater district. Previews begin November 24.

The 83-year-old Lansbury first appeared on Broadway more than 40 years ago and has claimed five Tonys during her stage career. Her most recent Tony came this year for her work in the revival of the Noel Coward play "Blithe Spirit."

The score features "Send in the Clowns," one of Sondheim's best-known songs, as well as "A Weekend in the Country," "Liaisons" and "Every Day a Little Death."

The producers have not announced ticket prices for the revival. Tickets go on sale October 17 for the general public.
