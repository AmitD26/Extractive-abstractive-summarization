(CNN) -- Investigators pleaded Monday for swift public help in reconstructing events leading to the disappearance of a 10-year-old Hickory, North Carolina, girl after casting doubt on her stepmother's story.

Zahra Clare Baker was last seen sleeping in her bedroom about 2:30 a.m. Saturday, according to Hickory police. She was reported missing about 2 p.m. Saturday by her father, Adam Baker, and stepmother, Elisa Baker.

"At this point in the investigation, we are having a very difficult time establishing a true timeline," Adkins said. "We are looking for the public to help us. We need teachers. We need doctors. We need store clerks. We need anyone who has seen this girl in the last week, the last month. Anything they feel is important for us to know, we need the public to call us."

Zahra is described as being about 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighing 85 pounds. She has brown hair and blue eyes, and according to CNN affiliate WCNC, she's a cancer survivor.

The girl uses a prosthetic leg and hearing aids. The hearing aids have been found, but not the prosthesis, Adkins said.

Farr said she faces other charges in different counties, including a felony larceny count and other bad-check charges. She is being held on $31,500 bail.

Adkins said Adam Baker faces similar charges, but police have held off serving an arrest warrant while he cooperates with police.

Adkins said Sunday that a small fire had been reported at the residence the morning Zahra is thought to have vanished. He said "some evidence" was recovered from the scene, but would not elaborate on what connection the fire may have with the investigation.
