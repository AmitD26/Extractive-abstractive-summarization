And Dortmund made the home side pay for missing that spot-kick when they added a second goal midway through the second half, Paraguayan striker Lucas Barrios netting his fifth of the season from a tight angle.

The result means Dortmund overtake Mainz by a point at the top of the table with 25 points from their 10 matches.

Despite the defeat, Mainz remain six points clear of Hoffenheim, who moved up to third on Sunday, ahead of Bayer Leverkusen on goal difference, with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Hanover.

Meanwhile, in Spain's Primera Liga, third-placed Villarreal lost ground on Real Madrid and Barcelona at the top of the table after a 1-1 draw at Sporting Gijon on Sunday.

The result extends Villarreal's unbeaten league run to eight matches, but they are now three points behind Real Madrid at the top of the table.

Elsewhere, Atletico Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw at home to strugglers Almeria and go into next weekend's Madrid derby against Real down in seventh place in the table.

Sergio Aguero put Atletico ahead but Pablo Piatti levelled for the visitors on the stroke of half-time.
