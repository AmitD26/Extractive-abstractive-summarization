Local resident Kathy Lamberth apparently had lost control of the Suburban, CNN affiliate WSOC reported.

"You couldn't see in the vehicle," which was about 35 yards from the station, Peterson, 36, told HLN on Wednesday.

"I thought as long as he made it I was happy," Lamberth said, referring to her son.

Landen did not suffer injuries, WSOC said. Lamberth, 23, who was treated at a hospital and released, had gratitude for the firefighters.

Officials credit part of the quick response to the fact they had gathered for the meal.

"We were miraculously all there for dinner," Peterson said.

HLN's Tracey Jordan and CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.
