"Travel into the high country of the southern Sierra Nevada may be difficult, if not impossible," according to forecasters.

That  possibility exists for the northern Sierras as well. At 3:56 p.m. PST, the National Weather Service was predicting blizzard conditions with winds of up to 70 mph along the higher mountain passes. That could shut down traffic along Interstate 80, state Highway 50 and state Highway 88.

The Weather Service was urging residents in the higher mountain areas to check their generators and buy extra food and supplies.

At lower elevations, heavy rain was causing flash flooding in a number of locations. Flood advisories and watches were posted almost the entire length of California, from Redding to San Diego. Los Angeles had received 2 to 3 inches of rain as of about 2:30 a.m. Sunday (5:30 a.m. ET), and "more significant rain" was on the way, forecasters said.

Flooding in the San Joaquin valley, which includes Fresno and Sacramento, is a "firm possibility," said Wolf. Footage from Sacramento showed drivers creeping through water on roadways.

And with the heavy rain comes the threat of mudslides, especially in areas near Los Angeles affected by this year's wildfires, where there is no vegetation to hold the soil in place, Wolf said. The soil becomes saturated and gravity pulls it downward.

In Placer County a minor mudslide forced the closing of one of two lanes on Interstate 80 on Sunday.

On Saturday, there were more than 260 freeway crashes in Los Angeles County and unincorporated areas because of the rain, said California Highway Patrol Officer Ed Jacobs. That is compared to 48 last Saturday, when it was not raining, he said.

About 5,000 customers lost power in southern California, said Steve Conroy of Southern California Edison, but noted that is a small percentage of the company's 5.4 million customers.

About 2,100 customers lost power early Sunday in the Highland Park area of Los Angeles, but power had been restored as of about 6:30 Sunday morning, said Maychelle Yee, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The outages were likely weather related, she said.

Further north, high winds affected Seattle, downing trees and power lines, and knocking out power to about 100,000 people. Most of those had been restored as of Sunday. Footage from Spokane, Washington, showed drivers crashing as they slid down a snowy hill.

Besides the potential for road closures, air travel could be affected in cities including San Francisco; Los Angeles; Seattle; Portland, Oregon; and Salt Lake City, Wolf said. Those delays could have a ripple effect elsewhere as a busy holiday travel week approaches.
