(CNN)  -- Top seeds Serbia have been forced to withdraw from Saturday's Hopman Cup final because of an injury to former world number one Ana Ivanovic.

The 2008 French Open champion tore a stomach muscle during her straight sets loss to Justine Henin of Belgium at the annual team event in Perth, Australia on Thursday.

"This morning, I was playing some points and on one serve I felt a sharp pain and I couldn't even hit or move after that," Ivanovic told reporters.

Ivanovic and world number three Djokovic -- whose singles win over Benelmans on Thursday secured Serbia's final berth -- will be replaced in the weekend's title-clash by Belgium who finished in second place in group A.

The injury is an early-season blow for Ivanovic, who recently made a comeback to the WTA tour following a string of fitness problems.

But the 23-year-old said she can recover in time for the first grand slam of the year, the Australian Open, which begins in Melbourne on January 17.

"It's definitely a scare," the current world number 17 told reporters. "At this moment in time my chances are still very good because I stopped in time. I'm positive I will be fit.

"It's very frustrating because this has been the case for a long time now. But I have to stay positive."

The 26-year-old brushed aside Aussie qualifier Matthew Ebden in straight sets and will now face Czech Radek Stepanek in the semifinal, after the former world number eight and two-time finalist of the Brisbane event put out seventh seed Florian Mayer 6-3 6-3.

Saturday's other last-four clash will see American second seed and world number eight Andy Roddick take on Kevin Anderson of South Africa, after the pair had respective quarterfinal wins over Marcos Baghdatis and Santiago Giraldo on Thursday.

Meanwhile at the Auckland Classic in New Zealand Maria Sharapova's quarter final conqueror Greta Arn continued her winning streak with a straight sets victory over German fourth seed Julia Georges.

Hungary's Arn will meet second seed Yanina Wickmayer of Belgium in the final of the event, after the world number 23 overcame the challenge of Chinese qualifier Peng Shuai 3-6 7-6 6-3.
