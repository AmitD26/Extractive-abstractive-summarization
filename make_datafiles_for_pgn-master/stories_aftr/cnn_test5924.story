In a statement released to the Basque newspaper Gara -- where it typically releases information -- ETA said it declares a permanent general and verifiable cease-fire as a "firm commitment towards a process to achieve a lasting resolution and toward an end to the armed confrontation."

"Am I more tranquil today than before? Yes," Perez said. "Is this the end? I would say no."

ETA wants Basque independence in northern Spain and southwest France. Various Basque leftist parties -- including the Batasuna party, outlawed for its links to ETA -- as well as four Nobel peace laureates and the Nelson Mandela Foundation also have called in recent months for the organization to establish a permanent and verifiable cease-fire. The Batasuna party's ban from running candidates in municipal elections will not be lifted because of ETA's statement, the interior minister said.

The latest statement comes after weeks of speculation in Spain that ETA would issue a statement during the holiday season.

"It is time to act with historical responsibility. ETA calls upon those governing Spain and France to end all repressive measures and to leave aside for once and for all their position of denial towards the Basque Country," the statement said.

Despite ETA's current cease-fire, in effect since September, the government has not eased up on the police pressure against ETA operatives in Spain and the organization's hideouts in neighboring France and Portugal.

In the past few years, police have arrested many of ETA's suspected top operatives, as well as many of its foot soldiers, and seized bomb-making materials and weapons from hidden arms caches, virtually shutting off ETA attacks.

There are about 800 ETA convicts or suspects in prison, mainly in Spain but also in France, the Interior Ministry said recently.

ETA's statement comes two days after a march Saturday in the largest Basque city, Bilbao, by relatives and friends of the prisoners. They want the prisoners transferred to jails in the Basque region instead of being dispersed across Spain, which authorities have said is done for security purposes.

Since then, officials of Zapatero's government have said they would not accept another cease-fire, only a definitive statement from ETA that it would end its armed fight, and specifying when and where it would lay down its arms forever.

The Basque region in northern Spain already has considerable home-rule authority, with its own police, parliament, taxing power and control of health and education. But ETA rejects those as partial steps, and has fought for full independence.

Officials have said that in recent years, ETA has become weaker and more isolated from its traditional base of popular support.
