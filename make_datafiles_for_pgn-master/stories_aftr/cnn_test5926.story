(CNN) -- Queensland's flood disaster fund received a massive boost on Sunday as the world's best tennis players turned out to raise money at a packed Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne.

The specially organized Rally for Relief raised nearly $2 million and counting as stars from the ATP and WTA tours gave up their time on the eve of the Australian Open.

Players were split into two teams: "Gold," led by Lleyton Hewitt and "Green" captained by Queenslander Pat Rafter.

The finale pitted Nadal and Clijsters against Federer and Samantha Stosur who played out a highly entertaining mixed doubles match.

Earlier Hewitt and Rafter went head-to-head in an all Australian clash - the first time they had played one another publicly since 2001.

World number two Federer starts his defence of the Australian Open title he won in 2010, against Slovakia's Lukas Lacko on Monday.
