The Belgian was pushed up front by coach Louis van Gaal after Italian striker Luca Toni was substituted and he came up trumps with a late header.

It made amends for his sending off in the 2-1 Champions League defeat to Bordeaux in midweek.

The win also takes the Bavarian giants to fifth place in the German standings with 18 points after 10 games, four points adrift of Bayer Leverkusen, who were held 1-1 by Borussia Dortmund on Friday night.

Bayern coach van Gaal was relieved to claim the three points after their midweek setback in Europe.

Hoffenheim ended a two-goal losing run with a 3-0 home win over Nuremberg to move up to sixth in the standings, a point behind Bayern.

Argentina's Franco Zuculini completed the scoring just after the hour mark with a fierce shot.

Elsewhere, Mainz thrashed fellow promoted side Freiburg 3-0 with captain Tim Hoogland scoring twice in the second half as they moved up to seventh.
