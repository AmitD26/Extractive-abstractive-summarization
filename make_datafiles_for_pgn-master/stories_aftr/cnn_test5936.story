From "Anchorman" to "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" to "Knocked Up," Rudd has consistently played a hilarious second string. But he's no longer just comedic backup in Hollywood.

In his new movie "Role Models," which opens November 7, Rudd and Seann William Scott star as a pair of energy drink representatives who end up with a choice: jail time or 150 community service hours in a local mentoring program. As it turns out, the jail time might have been less painful.

CNN talked to Rudd about the movie -- which he helped write -- how he chooses his roles and what he was like as a child. The following is an edited version of that interview.

CNN: What attracts you to the roles you choose?

Paul Rudd: Well, you know, 99 percent of the time I just say I want to do it if I'd want to see it. A lot depends on the people that are involved and if I feel there's something I can connect with a character in some way.

I kind of decided a long time ago that I was going to try to make a career work on my own terms as much as possible. I mean, you know you don't always have the options you'd like, but I just decided however long or bumpy the route was, I would do it doing things that I liked and was genuinely interested in and wanted to do.

Rudd: There have been many that I've really liked. Brian Fantana in "Anchorman" was a blast, just really, really fun. "Role Models" is the one that's coming out that was really, really enriching and fun and personal in many ways, because it's the first movie I co-wrote.

CNN: Can you tell me about the process of writing "Role Models"?

Rudd: It had been around for a while in different forms, this film. I thought that the premise was really, really funny, and the script was funny, but there were certain things that were being changed. In talking with the producer, she wanted to know what was working and what wasn't working ... and I was hired to be one of the writers.

CNN: I have to ask, what was it like working with "McLovin" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse from "Superbad"), who plays your mentor child in the movie?

Rudd: It was pretty great. That kid is seriously smart and funny. It blows my mind how much his life changed in the course of a couple years. We didn't necessarily write that part for Chris. I imagined that role to be younger, but he's so good and kind of so perfect for it. And he liked it and was into the idea of doing it, so that's how that happened.

Rudd: No, the thing is, this is why he's so good; this is what impressed me about him. He knows what he's doing. Michael Cera is like this, too. I'm shocked at the kind of self-awareness of these kids, and they're 18 and really talented. [They] know how to deliver a joke and don't ham it up.

CNN: This movie is all about role models, and as an actor, you are a role model to many people. What do you think the most important qualities of a role model are?

Rudd: To be an actual role model? Oh, God, I would hesitate to say we should be anybody's role models. Your role models are your parents.

CNN: Do you have any personal role models?

CNN: Do you do any volunteering yourself?

CNN: What were you like as a child?

Rudd: I had a pretty happy childhood. I loved goofing around in any way, shape or form. I loved speech classes and making videos and comedy stuff. I loved football.

I was into being a kid. I didn't necessarily want to grow up. I remember that a lot of kids my age wanted to get older, and I think I knew as a kid that it was going to get harder.
