"A controlled nap can boost performance significantly," said NTSB board member Mark Rosekind at a briefing with reporters Monday at agency headquarters. Citing a 1995 study from NASA that has been backed by other research, he said, "A 26-minute nap improved performance 34% and alertness 54%."

Referring to a variety of transportation workers who unintentionally fall asleep on the job, the NTSB official said, "We have many circumstances of documented, uncontrolled spontaneous sleep episodes," including incidents among air traffic control, long-haul trucking and railroads.

According to the research, "A short nap can boost performance, a long nap can make you groggy," Rosekind explained, saying the tactic of catching a few winks is but one element in a comprehensive plan.

Although U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood directed the FAA to increase overnight staffing in air traffic control towers in response to unplanned sleeping on the job, Rosekind says that alone won't solve the problem of fatigued controllers.

What's going on with air traffic controllers?

"If you don't have a fatigue management plan, and you just throw more people at it, then you've got more tired people on," he said. "However many people you throw at the problem, you're still gonna have the fatigue risk."

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also hopes the FAA will implement scientifically validated improvements to fight fatigue in the control tower.

In a written statement, NACTA President Paul Rinaldi said, "There is nothing groundbreaking about these recommendations. They are common-sense solutions to a problem NATCA and fatigue experts have consistently raised for years while past administrations turned a blind eye."

"They only work for 10 minutes or so," he said, saying the research suggests greater benefits from pulling over for a short nap.

And addressing the economic issues of improved staffing and the cost of scheduling people more in line with their sleep clocks, Rosekind said, "Most people focus on the cost of the fatigue risk when an accident happens.
