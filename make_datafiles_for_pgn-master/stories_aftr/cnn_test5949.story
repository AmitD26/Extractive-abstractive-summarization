Atlanta (CNN) -- A robbery suspect nicknamed the "Grandma Bandit" died in a shootout Friday in Atlanta, Georgia, authorities said.

Later, authorities discovered that Grandma was actually Grandpa.

"His name is Roxanne Taylor, a 57-year-old man."

She was a distinctive-looking woman with swollen cheeks who wore oversize, dark sunglasses and a baseball cap, according to surveillance video and witness accounts.

"The individuals called 9-1-1 and nearby Atlanta police officers arrived to investigate, leading to a pursuit," she said.

Taylor led police on a car chase that ended with a multi-car accident off an interstate exit.

"When officers pursued to investigate the accident, they heard a shot ring out," Parish said. "The responding officers returned fire."
