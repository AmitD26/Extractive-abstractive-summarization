Antonio Yarbough and Sharrif Wilson were teenagers when prison doors clanked shut behind them.

Now, in their late 30s, they can hardly believe they're out.

What does freedom feel like? "I'm still going through it right now," Yarbough said Friday.

"I haven't slept yet. I've been up for two days now. I have no words for it right now."

Nearly 22 years of hard time

As if that's not enough,  you were the one who discovered their lifeless, bloodied bodies when you opened the door to your home one night.

After years in Attica's maximum security prison among New York's toughest criminals, he left its high, gray walls behind him Thursday.

"It was a nightmare," Yarbough told CNN's Piers Morgan in an exclusive interview. "Twenty-one years and seven months was more like 42 years and seven months, when you know you're in prison for something you didn't do."

"Anybody looking at this evidence with an open mind would see that there is no chance in the world that Tony murdered his mother and these two little girls," his lawyer Zachary Margulis-Ohuma said.

A night out

After a night of partying, Yarbough, 18 at the time, and Wilson, 15, went home to Coney Island. Wilson was staying with friends, they said.

When Yarbough got home, he opened the door to find his mother, sister and a close family friend lying stabbed and strangled to death. The two girls were partially undressed.

Police came.

"I was asked to come down to the precinct," he said. Officers said they wanted him to tell them who might have killed his family, he said.

Police also took in Wilson and questioned him separately from Yarbough. But he got similar treatment, he said.

"I was scared, afraid; I was lied to, manipulated into believing that I was going to go home, if I do tell ... what they said happened." Wilson said.

Life in prison

The two were convicted in separate trials. Yarbough was sentenced to 75 years to life.  Wilson got a lower sentence of nine years to life.

They sat behind bars for about 12 years, then something important arrived by mail.

"Out of the blue, I got a letter from his (Yarbough's) aunt," Wilson said. "And she asked me, did we really do it. And I had to tell the truth."

"I still feel horrible now," he said, sitting next to Yarbough.

Thompson came into office in January with promises to restore justice to the wrongfully convicted. This case is part of a review of Brooklyn killings from the 1980s and early 1990s.

Then, last year, the right shred of evidence came along in the form of a DNA sample from a rape-murder committed in 1999.

"When I heard about it, I was extremely overwhelmed," Yarbough said. "I was happy."

Free at last

Wilson approached the man he had testified against. "I just wanted to apologize to him for all I put him through, all I went through."

"I know what they did to him, because I know what they did to me," he said.

As to finding his relatives' killer decades later, Yarbough said, "It's in God's hand's now." He teared up.

Yarbough filled his lungs with New York air.
