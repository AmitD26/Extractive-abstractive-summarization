The case is linked to David Headley, who pleaded guilty last year to all 12 charges against him in connection with the four-day siege on India's financial capital and a plot to attack a Danish newspaper.

The new indictment included charges of aiding and abetting the murder of U.S. citizens in India and conspiracy to bomb public places in India. Both carry a maximum penalty of life in prison or death.

In addition, some or all of the suspects in the new indictment were charged with conspiracy to murder and maim in India, conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism in India, conspiracy to murder and maim in Denmark and others that carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.

Named in the new indictment were Ilyas Kahmiri, Tahawwur Hussain Rana, Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed, Sajid Mir, Abu Qahafa, Mazhar Iqbal and an unidentified man referred to by the alias of Major Iqbal.

Rana, a Canadian citizen and Chicago resident, is the only suspect in U.S. custody. Rana, Kahmiri and Syed were named in previous indictments that charged Headley, who also lived in Chicago. The other suspects were all believed to live in Pakistan.

Headley initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, then changed his plea as part of a deal with the government to cooperate with investigators in exchange for a maximum possible sentence of life in prison. By pleading guilty, he also gave up his right to appeal. Headley's actual sentence will depend on how much he cooperates with authorities.

"More specifically, during the course of the attacks, the attackers were advised to, among other actions, kill hostages, set fires and throw grenades," the indictment said. "Sajid Mir also sought to arrange the release of a hostage in exchange for the release of a captured attacker."

It also accused Mir of working with Headley to plan a terrorist attack on a Danish newspaper, which was never carried out. The newspaper became the target of Muslim fury in 2005 after it published cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in a manner offensive to Muslims.
