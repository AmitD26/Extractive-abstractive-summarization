First Up: West Bank Settlements

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We're right next to Ma'ale Adumim, which is the biggest Jewish settlement in the West Bank. Now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said, he's insisted, that he wants natural expansion, or growth, to occur in those settlements Which means that settlements like Ma'ale Adumim are going to get bigger and bigger. And that's something the Palestinians are completely opposed to.

Now, what you see on the other side of this valley is the town, the Palestinian town of Eizariya, known from the Bible as Bethany. Now, this town is right up against Jerusalem, in fact many people consider it part of Jerusalem, but it's separated from Jerusalem by the Israeli so-called security barrier, what the Palestinians call the apartheid separation wall. It cannot expand. It cannot have growth in the direction of Jerusalem because of the wall, and because of Ma'ale Adumim, it can't expand in that direction.

International Highlights

AZUZ: Catching up on a couple other international headlines, beginning with a series of deadly explosions in Pakistan. This took place last night in and around the city of Peshawar. At least eight people were killed in the violence and dozens of others were wounded. The attacks came one day after a suicide bombing in the Pakistani city of Lahore.

And parts of Honduras are recovering from a deadly earthquake. Reports yesterday evening indicated that five people had been killed and 17 others injured by the tremor. Officials say the quake, which struck early Thursday morning, registered a magnitude of 7.1. It was followed 30 minutes later by a 4.8-magnitude aftershock.

GEORGE RAMSAY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Here's the deal: Today's Money Word is budget. It's a financial plan that estimates income and expenses. Put that in your word bank!

Education Budget Cuts?

AZUZ: The state of California is facing a budget crisis. The state is struggling with a multi-billion dollar deficit. In a recent special election, voters cast their ballots against some plans that Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger designed to help the state's budget. Now, he says California has to make some severe cuts. Dan Simon explores how one might have a big impact on students.

DOROTHY MOORE, ROMELL MOORE'S GRANDMOTHER: I'm strict with him.

ROMELL MOORE, HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR: It makes me feel good that I was doing all the right stuff and doing all the hard work to go, and maybe I can be a guidance to my young cousins and nephews that maybe they'll want to go to college, too.

SIMON: He wants to become a lawyer, but that dream could be shattered because of California's budget woes. The state facing an unprecedented deficit is looking at ways to save billions, and Governor Schwarzenegger has proposed slashing what are called Cal Grants, money that helps pay tuition for students from low income families. 200,000 students statewide could lose all or part of the Cal Grants they were counting on to pay for college this fall.

NANCY ROMAN, COLLEGE COUNSELOR: Our main problem is just getting students to even look at college, because in their head, already, its been ingrained that it's too expensive as well as with parents; they don't want students to apply, because, "Oh, it's too expensive," so we always talk about about Cal Grants.

SIMON: Romell has this message for lawmakers making the touch choices.

ROMELL MOORE: By helping me go to school they won't have another person on welfare just taking state money to survive. They'll have another person working, making money for the state.

AZUZ: We already have our first of the year. Tropical Depression One formed off the eastern U.S. coast yesterday. Forecasters don't expect it to be much of a threat. Of course, when these storms increase in intensity, they can become hurricanes, and as we've seen in recent years, some can cause serious damage. John Zarrella looks at how prepared we are as hurricane season begins.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN MIAMI BUREAU CHIEF AND CORRESPONDENT: Galveston: Rebuilding the seawall continues after Hurricane Ike. New Orleans: The fortified levees are inspected. Alabama: Rehearsal for a massive coastal evacuation. Days before the start of hurricane season, preseason drills and preparations are nearly complete. You've been paying attention, right? Surely, you've heard the chorus of warnings. The U.S. Commerce Secretary.

GARY LOCKE, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY: Public awareness and public preparedness are the best defenses against a hurricane. And that defense is more important than ever.

ZARRELLA: The New Orleans mayor.

MAYOR RAY NAGIN, (D) NEW ORLEANS: Each citizen must have a personal evacuation and recovery plan that accounts for your entire family.

ZARRELLA: The Hurricane Specialist.

ZARRELLA: With so much drums beating, everyone living in hurricane-prone communities is ready, right? Well, no. Not hardly. A new Mason-Dixon poll sponsored by the National Hurricane Survival Initiative found most people surveyed from Maine to Texas have done little to get ready, despite recent big ones: Katrina, Rita and, last year, Ike. 83% of the 1,100 people surveyed have taken no steps to make their homes stronger. 66% have no hurricane survival kits; basics like food and water for three days. 53% don't know if their insurance policy covers hurricane damage. Every year, surveys find hurricane apathy pretty much unchanged, no matter how bad the season was. Sociologists chalk it up to human nature: procrastinate. Emergency managers say the "uh oh" factor will kick in when.

ZARRELLA: But this year, emergency managers fear because of the economy, many people can't afford to stock up.

Off the Beaten Path

AZUZ: He definitely ain't the world's fastest coffee server.

MIKE KEEN, BARISTA: You better never be a hurry when you're in here.

AZUZ: But if you don't need your espresso express-o, impress your senses with a picture-perfect latte! Mike Keen is an artist and a barista at the same time. And if you're into image and taste, you won't mind if this takes a latt-e time. For a different flavor...

ALISON GROS, TEACHER: I made the deal, and I'm just gonna have to accept the consequences.

AZUZ: Well, they would have, if they could've wormed their way out of this. Some students even stepped up to the table! But if the worms' woes seem in bad taste, they still make for one good segment. And who can argue with a fudge dessert? At least, until you find out it's filled with crickets. I guess there'll be no chirping on this trip Off the Beaten Path.
