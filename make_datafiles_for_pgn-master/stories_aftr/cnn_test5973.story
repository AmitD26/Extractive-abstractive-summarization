The government released its annual report on income, poverty and insurance coverage last week. The median income in the U.S. in 2010 was $49,445, which is 2.3% lower than it was in 2009. But that's just the median. To understand how bad things really are, we need to look at poverty.

Let's be explicit. To qualify as below the poverty line, you have to be really poor. A single person under the age of 65 has to earn less than $11,244 to be considered in poverty. That's significantly less than a full-time minimum wage job. A single mother with a child has to make less than $15,030 to be considered in poverty.

Think about that when we talk about how to save money in the future.

I'm a health services researcher, and incredibly invested in how we reform the health care system of this country. It's why I'd also like you to focus on the plight of the uninsured.

In 2010, the report said, the number of people in the United States who lacked insurance for an entire year was 49.9 million. This is the largest number of people without insurance since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid. Almost all of these people are below 65. (Pretty much every American over 65 is on Medicare, after all.)

America is hurting. Unemployment is on the rise. Poverty is increasing. More people are losing or unable to get private insurance, and turning to our safety nets for coverage. Most of the benefits and improvements of the Affordable Care Act -- the large Medicaid expansion, the exchanges, the mandate, the subsidies -- won't go into effect until 2014. (An early feature of the act that has already gone into effect has allowed hundreds of thousands of young people under 26 to remain on their parents' insurance, and this group has fared better.)

I know that there's a deficit problem, and I know that it's important to get a handle on entitlement spending. But we can't ignore that right now Medicaid is one of the cheapest insurance programs around. People seem to have forgotten, but the reason the Affordable Care Act puts 20 million more people in Medicaid is that it was cheaper than putting them in the exchanges to get private insurance.

Moreover, about 5% of Medicaid enrollees account for more than 50% of all Medicaid spending. That spending is almost all on elderly and disabled people. It's unlikely these people will be cut from Medicaid. Poor children? Poor adults? Far more likely.

There will be hard decisions ahead. No one can deny that entitlement spending, especially health care spending, is unsustainable on its current path. We must be able to look at the budget and talk about areas where we might spend less. That will inevitably lead to some groups getting less than they did before. Yet, as voting blocs and advocacy groups defend their piece of the pie, let's not forget those who cannot speak for themselves.
