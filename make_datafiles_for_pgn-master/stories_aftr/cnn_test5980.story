"St Andrews has proved time and again that it is perfectly equipped to host The Open and I am certain we will yet again see a worthy winner lift the Claret Jug.

Some of the sport's biggest names have lifted the famous Claret Jug trophy at St Andrews, with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods having won at the Fife course in both 2000 and 2005.

American Jack Nicklaus, the most successful golfer of all time with 18 major triumphs, won the championship twice at St Andrews, in 1970 and 1978, and also played the final tournament of his professional career there in 2005.

The 2015 British Open will also boost the country's economy, with the 2010 tournament bringing $62 million into the local economy and providing a $156 injection across Scotland.

Next year's tournament will be held at the Royal Lytham and St Annes Golf Club in Lancashire, England between July 19-22.
