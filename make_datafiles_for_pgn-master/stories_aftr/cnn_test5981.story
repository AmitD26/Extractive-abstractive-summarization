(CNN) -- Juventus retained their unbeaten record and went back to the top of Italy's Serie A table with a 2-0 victory over 10-man Cesena on Sunday.

The result leaves Juventus two point clear of AC Milan and Udinese, who both won earlier in the weekend, with 13 matches played.

Lazio are a further five points behind in fourth place, although they can close the gap against Novara on Monday.

In other matches, Roma finished with a remarkable eight men as they crashed to a 3-0 humiliation at Fiorentina.

Juan was the first to be dismissed, after giving away a spot-kick from which Stevan Jovetic scored.

To complete Roma's misery, they had Bojan Krkic dismissed late on for handball on the line and Santiago Silva netted Fiorentina's second penalty.

Meanwhile, Victor Ibarbo scored a stunning individual goal to give Cagliari a 1-0 victory over Catania for their first win in eight games.

In other news, Lecce confirmed on Sunday that they had sacked coach Eusebio Di Francesco and replaced him with Serse Cosmi.

Di Francesco becomes the eighth coaching casualty of the Italian Serie A season.

Meanwhile, in Spain's La Liga, on-loan Arsenal striker Carlos Vela hit a spectacular late goal as Real Sociedad scored twice in the last two minutes to snatch a 3-2 home win over Malaga.

And a goal on half-time from on-loan Nigerian Odion Ighalo gave Granada a 1-0 success over Real Zaragoza, who are now bottom of the table on 10 points after the defeat.
