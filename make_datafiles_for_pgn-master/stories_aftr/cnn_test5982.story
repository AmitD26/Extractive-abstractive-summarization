Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- The Internet doesn't have a flag or a national anthem, but it does have a government.

Last week, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission wrote a letter saying ICANN has long failed to provide safeguards that protect consumers from online swindlers and help cybersecurity officials catch such crooks. In the letter, the FTC also criticized a major ICANN initiative that would let Internet users run their own domain-name extensions, to accompany .com, .org and others.

The federal agency fears that a quick expansion of domains, a project that has been several years in the making, would increase the likelihood that scammers could trick people who enter common misspellings, such as Amazon.comm. The government is also concerned that it will have a more difficult time getting information about website owners after the switch.

The FTC's criticisms are just another in a series of legal battles, political pressures and public name-calling that comes with being the most visible party overseeing the global Internet. There are several other governmental gatekeepers for the Web, but ICANN gets the most attention, and ire.

As for the domain expansion, ICANN officials say they are working to improve the data they can provide to governments and police, and that they have stringent rules in place for who can register which extensions. Another ongoing controversy, the .XXX extension for porn sites, was initially resisted by ICANN's board of directors. But the organization now supports it and may have to defend that stance in court against adult-entertainment companies who fear the .XXX domains will marginalize their sites.

How ICANN works

With the Stop Online Piracy Act in the United States or systems in China and other Asian countries proposing major changes to who is responsible for what information is posted online, ICANN has to pick its battles and juggle hundreds of competing interests. Its critics often overpower its allies.

"ICANN stays neutral, and it has to keep running," Beckstrom said in a recent interview from his office here in Silicon Valley. "We're a lot like Switzerland."

A frequent target

For example, ICANN has been criticized for being slow to respond to a shortage of Web addresses that could make certain websites inaccessible to some people. However, ICANN has a fairly small role in this transition from Internet Protocol version 4 to 6, ICANN chairman Steve Crocker said in a phone interview.

ICANN officials say its own initiatives, such as .XXX and the global domain expansion, are controversial but necessary as the Internet keeps growing.

"Any time you take a system that started out small and expand it hugely, you get a lot of changes," said Crocker, who was a member of the team that posted the first message to ARPANET, the Internet's predecessor.

"We don't have the authority of being a government," he said. "If we did, that would create more problems."

The Internet's governmental bodies say they are more effective at getting things done than America's political system, which is often seen as polarized and gridlocked. The Internet has an effective system of checks and balances, said John Curran, the president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers. The registry is one of five international groups that propose new initiatives to ICANN.

The Interplanetary Internet

In the efficiency-obsessed technology sector, ICANN has streamlined its system of yearly goals under Beckstrom, a former finance executive for Morgan Stanley who transitioned to high tech and cashed out at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999.

Beckstrom, who has also served as a director for the U.S. National Cybersecurity Center, plans to step down in July. ICANN said last week it is searching for a replacement.

"The Internet doesn't just happen," Cerf said by phone. "It's a continued battle to keep it as open and accessible and free as possible. And it's hard to do."

But the Internet still faces major hurdles on its home planet. Cerf said he believes governmental organizations, like ICANN, will need to continue to adapt.

"These institutions got created in response to the forces in the ecosystem," Cerf said. "I would not say that this was top-down architected. I don't think it could be, because these institutions got created as the demands made themselves apparent."
