But first-half goals from Laurent Koscielny, Tomas Rosicky and captain Robin van Persie gave the English Premier League side the perfect platform to complete a remarkable recovery.

Koscielny headed home from a corner, Rosicky took advantage of a defensive mistake after a Theo Walcott run and van Persie slotted home a penalty after the excellent Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain was fouled.

Van Persie uncharacteristically fluffed the best chance for the home side to make it 4-4 on aggregate, but after fine work by Gervinho his effort was saved by Christian Abbiati.

"I hoped in the final 10 or 15 minutes to create some more goal chances, but it didn't happen."

But at the finish it was the Milan players who were celebrating, while Arsenal will be boosted in their challenge for a Champions League spot in the EPL and remain in the FA Cup.

In Tuesday's other last 16 tie, Benfica overturned a 3-2 deficit from their first leg against Zenit St Petersburg to win 2-0 in Lisbon and go through 4-3 on aggregate.

Maxi Pereira's goal in first-half injury-time set them on their way with Nelson Oliveira secured the outright win in the second minute of added time.
