Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi went on the attack Tuesday, pushing opposition fighters back to the outskirts of a key oil town, rebels said.

Also Tuesday, world diplomats met in London to discuss the future of the North African nation.

Opposition fighters in Bin Jawad battled Gadhafi forces and came under a hail of artillery and rocket attacks, a rebel source said. CNN saw rebel fighters streaming back out of the city, beating what looked to be a hasty retreat. One said the barrage was too much for the opposition to withstand, and that Gadhafi loyalists had infiltrated Bin Jawad.

Rebel forces regrouped in the nearby city of Ras Lanuf, a key oil town that they said they seized on Sunday. They came under heavy fire on the western edge of that city, said the rebels, who responded in kind, firing back with whatever weapons were available.

Tuesday's fighting marked a reversal of the momentum of the opposition, which until recently had faced relatively little resistance in its westward march.

Elsewhere in Libya, three loud explosions were heard in Tripoli. The blasts came within about a 20-minute span and were the first time since the uprising began that such blasts were heard during daylight in the Libyan capitol.

On state television, a bulletin attributed to a "military source" said that military and civilian locations were bombed in Tripoli "by the crusader colonial aggression."

To the east, Libyan forces continued to pound parts of the city of Misrata Tuesday, with tanks firing mortar shells and troops using heavy artillery in an effort to retake control of the city, a witness told CNN.

Coalition planes circled overhead but did not strike the tanks, he said.

The day after Gadhafi's regime tried to convince journalists that it was in control of Misrata by taking them on a trip to part of the city -- but not allowing them into the city center -- his troops were killing and wounding civilians and evicting thousands of people from their homes, the witness told CNN.

CNN could not independently verify the witness' descriptions.

Fierce battles on the ground raged in Libya as diplomats from around the world met in London to decide next steps. More than 40 foreign ministers and representatives attended the Tuesday conference, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Chairman of the African Union Jean Ping.

"The purpose of this conference is to broaden and deepen the coalition effort," said British Foreign Secretary William Hague. "We all want to see that cease-fire. We all want to see Gadhafi go. Those things are clear. But once we have that cease-fire, we have something to work with."

Gadhafi has showed no sign of letting up his effort to crush the rebellion, which seeks an end to his nearly 42 years in power.

Opposition fighters have credited coalition airstrikes with helping them advance in their rebellion, but say more are needed.

The witness in Misrata on Tuesday pleaded for coalition forces to strike Gadhafi's forces in that city to "save Misrata from a massacre."

Off the coast of Misrata, U.S. military planes fired at three Libyan boats, destroying one and damaging the other two, military officials said in a statement Tuesday. The Libyan ships were targeted because of reports that they were firing indiscriminately at merchant vessels in the port of Misrata on Monday, the statement said.

The group, representing numerous areas throughout Libya, has been meeting in Benghazi.

Much of the statement focused on promises to build a better economy that would eradicate poverty. About a third of Libyans live at or below the national poverty line. The declaration makes no reference to religious freedom.

Mahmoud Shammam, a spokesman for the council, said the future government would try members of the Gadhafi regime, not "hang people in the street."

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of the council Tuesday at the meeting, part of a U.S. effort to expand ties with rebel leaders fighting to oust Gadhafi. It was the second meeting in less than two weeks between Clinton and the Libyan Interim National Council's Mahmoud Jabril, a former head of Libya's economic planning council.
