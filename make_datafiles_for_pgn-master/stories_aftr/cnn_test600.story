(CNN) -- Anyone who has been deceived by a punchbowl at a party, or a diet-busting cake, will recognize the value of knowing exactly what you are eating. A new pocket scanner promises to deliver that power by giving the user an instant breakdown of alcohol, sugar, or calorie content before they consume.

An accompanying app then displays the nutrient values on a smart phone, measuring fat, protein and carbohydrate levels to the milligram, as well as overall quality.

This underlying technology has been industry standard for decades in quality control of oil, sewage or chemicals. But SCiO is the first portable spectrometer for consumers, and offers far greater versatility of application. The product, developed by engineers from leading institutions such as MIT and Harvard, has been tested in live demonstrations with high accuracy. The final product will be sent to backers this year.

"The first application is for consumers interested to know the nutritional value of what they're eating", Dror Sharon, CEO of Consumer Physics, told CNN. "I often meet people who don't know what's in cheese, fruit and vegetables and have a hard time discerning what they should eat.

The device could be applied to the environment as well as consumed objects -- an athlete could scan their track or field in order to optimize its playability.

"What they've done is quite an ingenious approach as the device only measures the spectrum, and then applies calibration (in the algorithm cloud) and sends results, so the lab system and software have been centralized."

The success of the Kickstarter campaign indicates a substantial market, and addresses a genuine need says Quantified Self technologist Maarten Van Braaben: "This is answering a question as food checking has never been automated well, and this offers a less tedious process."

Van Brabben foresees further innovation with the technology. "If you could have the same spectrometry analysis through the camera on your phone that would be a popular concept, and I think it's not far off, perhaps two or three years."

Consumer Physics are providing a 'maker kit' for developers to use their technology in any form they wish, and Sharon hopes they can become as ubiquitous as smart phones with billions in circulation.
