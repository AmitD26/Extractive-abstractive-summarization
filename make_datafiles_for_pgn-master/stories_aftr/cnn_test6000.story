"We're gaining," said Bill Hahnenberg, the U.S. Forest Service's commander for the team battling the High Park wildfire, which has burned 46,600 acres in northern Colorado. The fire, which has claimed at least one life, is estimated to be 10% contained.

About 100 structures are confirmed lost, but hundreds of families are anxiously waiting to hear whether their homes survived.

"This fire's behavior is starting to diminish, at least in some places, where we can have trained individuals to go in and determine which structures are lost," Hahnenberg said during his Wednesday morning media briefing.

Hundreds of firefighters have arrived from around the United States to help local departments that have been battling the fire, bringing to 1,000 the number of personnel involved in the fight.

The local firefighters, some of whom have lost their own homes, are tired, Hahnenberg said. "We're doing our best and have enough resources on board to rotate in and relieve them."

They've had "some success, some failure" in containing the advance of flames eastward and southward, toward residential areas, he said.

Residents should be able to return to two evacuated neighborhoods later Wednesday and perhaps three areas Thursday, said Nick Christensen of the Larimer County Sheriff's Department.

His family was packed and ready to leave in a hurry, Engle said.

But they wanted to stay put, even though authorities have ordered residents in the area to clear out.

"There's a number of people like myself, (for whom) packing up and leaving when you have livestock and animals just isn't as easy as if you have just a house," Engle said.

CNN iReporter Dave Thrush, a musician from Denver, posted dramatic pictures of smoke darkening the skies above the Colorado State University campus Sunday.

"I found myself watching the crowd watch the fire. Heartbreaking."
