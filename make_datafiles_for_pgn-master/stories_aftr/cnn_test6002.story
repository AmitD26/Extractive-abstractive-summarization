The 23-year-old, who didn't drop a set throughout the tournament, now joins world No.1 Victoria Azarenka as the only woman to have won multiple titles on the WTA Tour in 2012.

Radwanska needed 57 minutes to clinch a first set marked by few winners and a string of unforced errors.

Sharapova's tally of 26 compared with Radwanska's eight eventually told as the Pole broke the Russian's serve in the 12th game.
