Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Five men and four women have been selected to be jurors in the Pennsylvania trial of Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach charged with child rape.

About 220 potential jurors reported for duty Tuesday, after the court whittled the number to about 600 based on answers to questionnaires sent to prospective jurors' homes. Of those, about half were sent home and asked to return Wednesday.

Twelve jurors and four alternates will eventually be selected.

Sandusky, 68, has been under house arrest since being charged with sexually abusing 10 boys for at least 15 years. Prosecutors allege he met some of his accusers through Second Mile, a charity he created for underprivileged children.

He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He and his attorney, Joe Amendola, were in attendance Tuesday.

Keys to the case against Sandusky

Sandusky supposedly wrote love letters to one of his alleged victims, Victim 4, ABC News reported late Tuesday. They will be read into testimony, ABC said.

When asked by CNN about the report, the attorney for Victim 4, Ben Andreozzi, said he expects that letters from Sandusky to his client will be introduced at trial, but declined to comment on their content.

Gifts Sandusky allegedly gave to Victim 4 may also be introduced as evidence by prosecutors, according to a source close to the case. Those gifts could include golf clubs and football jerseys, the source said.

Authorities allege that Sandusky abused some of the boys on the Penn State campus. The case has shaken the university, raised questions about its response to the allegations and drawn criticism from those who claim Penn State put its reputation ahead of protecting potential child victims.

University President Graham Spanier and iconic head football coach Joe Paterno lost their jobs soon after Sandusky's arrest amid criticism that they did not adequately handle the matter when allegations involving Sandusky arose years earlier. Paterno died of complications from lung cancer in January.

Mike McQueary, a former graduate student considered to be a key witness in the Sandusky case, has testified that he alerted Paterno in 2002 that he'd seen what appeared to be Sandusky sexually assaulting a boy in a shower in Penn State's athletic facilities, an allegation that authorities didn't learn of until years later.

Prosecutors said later that the McQueary incident took place about a year earlier than was originally alleged, causing defense attorneys for Curley and Schultz to argue that one of the charges should now be dropped. Both of them have pleaded not guilty, and their attorneys have said that prosecutors "charged this case before (they) knew the facts."

Potential jurors were asked Tuesday about their relationships with Penn State, local law enforcement and Second Mile, and whether they had contributed to any of those entities. Several reported knowing Sandusky or his wife, while others said they had volunteered at Second Mile. Others said they were current or former Penn State employees.

McQueary and his father were told to be in town and ready to testify next Wednesday or Thursday, one of the sources said.

He told the prospective jurors that after he speaks with them, groups will be taken to another room for questioning and then to a different room for more questioning from the judge and attorneys.

Sandusky listened intently to the judge as he spoke to the jury pool, also chuckling at times. But he looked down when the judge discussed the charges against him.

As jury selection in the case began Tuesday, Penn State released a statement, saying, "The acts that Jerry Sandusky is accused of committing are horrible and if proven true, deserve punishment."

Several of Sandusky's alleged victims, including Victim 4, asked a judge to protect their identities at trial. However, Cleland ruled Monday that the alleged victims' identities may not be concealed during the trial, although they will be protected through the jury selection process.

"Courts are not customarily in the business of withholding information," Cleland's ruling said. "Secrecy is thought to be inconsistent with the openness required to assure the public that the law is being administered fairly and applied faithfully."

Prosecutors in Sandusky case present new, graphic details

CNN generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault.

Victim advocacy groups criticized the judge's decision late Monday, expressing their hope that it would not have a chilling effect on the reporting of child sexual abuse.

"We are not asking to close the courtroom, only to use a pseudonym," he said.

"My client couldn't break free," said the attorney, describing the relationship between Victim 4 and Sandusky as "complex."

After news of the scandal broke last year, The New York Times published an extensive interview in which Sandusky attempted to clarify his relationships with young people.

His lawyer, who was present at the interview, spoke up at that point to note that Sandusky is "not sexually" attracted to them.
