(CNN) -- Dan Wheldon won the Indianapolis 500 Sunday, making a mad dash past rookie J.R. Hildebrand in the last stretch of the race.

Hildebrand crashed at the end, almost winning the race by sliding on three wheels.

Drivers had to deal with a new rule that some said could increase the risk of crashes.

That differed from the past, when cars lined up in single file for restarts. The new double-file formation claimed its first victim 27 laps into the race as E.J. Viso was knocked out after bumping two cars.

Danica Patrick, another big draw at the race, finished in 10th place.

During a thrilling dash in that race, she became the first woman to lead a lap at Indy. She ended in fourth place and has finished in the top eight in five of her six Indy 500s, including a sixth-place finish last year.
