The Stefan Grand Prix team, owned by businessman Zoran Stefanovic, announced this week that they have already sent a container of equipment to Bahrain and will be testing drivers in Portugal later this month.

Stefan GP have also announced a technical support deal with Toyota, who withdrew from F1 last year and have reportedly sold equipment and cars to the Serbians.

"I do not believe in the participation of U.S. F1 and Campos," the 79-year-old said.

"Instead, I have good contacts with Stefan GP and would like to give this team a good starting point. Ralf Schumacher would be the perfect driver for them, he knows the team and he has experience."

Schumacher, the younger brother of recently-returned seven-time world champion Michael, has not raced in F1 since leaving Toyota at the end of 2007. He drove in the DTM touring car series in 2008, finishing 14th.

Autosport claims that former Williams driver Kazuki Nakajima will be involved with Stefan, who plan to launch their new car before tests at the Portimao circuit on February 25-28.
