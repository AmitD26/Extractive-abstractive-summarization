"As there is still a potential threat, even though reduced, a voluntary evacuation remains in place until the Army Corps of Engineers deems the lock stable and safe," the president and sheriff of St. Tammany Parish announced late Sunday morning. "Please stay vigilant."

Earlier Sunday, St. Tammany Parish President Pat Brister told CNN the water level at the lock has been reduced "tremendously" since Saturday night, and "We feel a lot better."

President Barack Obama will be in Louisiana on Monday for a briefing with local officials and to tour flood-damaged areas in St. John the Baptist parish.

What's left of Isaac, meanwhile, soaked in and around the Ohio River valley on Sunday, bringing stormy weather from Nashville, Tennessee, to Indianapolis.

The storm's remnants have brought much-needed rain to parts of the lower Midwest. But the system skirted most of the Midwestern and Plains states where this year's drought -- which the National Climatic Data Center reported last month was affecting a majority of the U.S. mainland, the most since 1956 -- has been most devastating.

"Certainly, it helped some locations in our far eastern counties in Oklahoma, but there was very little beneficial rain," said Pete Snyder, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Tulsa.

Nearly all of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas fall under the worst two drought categories. Isaac dumped heavy rain across southern Arkansas last week, with some flooding reported around Little Rock and Pine Bluff. But the northwestern city of Fayetteville, which is nearly 11 inches below its normal rainfall totals for the year, got just over an inch, Snyder said.

Flood warnings remained posted for parts of two northeastern Arkansas counties along the Cache River on Sunday. Parts of Missouri and Illinois saw up to six inches of rain Saturday, and the National Weather Service issued a flood warning Sunday for parts of southern Illinois.

Isaac is blamed for at least 19 deaths in Haiti and at least four more in Louisiana and Mississippi after making landfall last week as a Category 1 hurricane -- on the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina -- near the mouth of the Mississippi River.

Hundreds of thousands in the region were without power early Sunday, including at least 320,000 Entergy Louisiana customers, officials said

Residents began returning home over the weekend in Helena, Mississippi, where National Guard troops rescued hundreds trapped by rising waters brought on by Isaac. Annie Judge returned home Saturday to find more than four feet of water inside her home.
