(CNN) -- Traveling with young children is an imperfect art. Sure, there are urban myths about parents who tour Europe with their silent, serene baby in an organic backpack. But that's just folklore peddled by luxury retailers selling couture children's clothing. Real kids are loud, smelly and fidgety.

Traveling only ups the ante. Exhibit A: The Brangelina brood traipsing through an airport. If that glamorous couple can't mask the hot mess of family travel, what hope is there for the rest of us? Maybe the answer lies in embracing the messiness. It's what the Japanese call 'wabi sabi,' a perspective that celebrates the imperfect, the impermanent and the incomplete. It's an apt metaphor for modern American family life, especially when you're planning spring break on the road with young children.

CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee

Nicknamed the scenic city, Chattanooga, Tennessee, lives up to its billing. Perched invitingly on the banks of the Tennessee River, the city offers abundant natural attractions, including whitewater rafting, hiking and hang gliding.

More surprising, perhaps, is Chattanooga's rich cultural scene, including the Hunter Museum of Art and the historic Bluff View Art District. With literally dozens of attractions packed along the city's downtown riverfront alone, it's little wonder Chattanooga was named one of the country's top places to travel in 2012 by The New York Times. Narrowing down the list of family-friendly attractions can be difficult. Here's a kid-centered cheat sheet to help:

Ruby Falls. Modern childhood is a torrent of gadgetry and engrossing virtual reality, but at Ruby Falls there are no electronic escapes, there's something better: marvel-worthy natural wonders. Traveling from Chicago on a recent Disney-bound trip, Yuji Tamura, 32, was eager to see what he'd heard described as one of the "100 things to see before you die."

Situated 1,120 feet below the surface of Lookout Mountain (think of an inverted Empire State building and you get a sense of the depth), Ruby Falls is actually a series of caves leading to a stunning 145-foot waterfall named after the wife of Leo Lambert, the chemist and cave enthusiast who made the original 17-hour round-trip trek (mostly wriggling on his stomach) to view the falls. Today, it's an easy round-trip walk (less than a mile, upright). One caveat: there are no strollers allowed so be prepared to carry younger kids or distract them by throwing pennies into the countless underground pools along the guided path.

When to go

HUNTSVILLE, Alabama

Known as rocket city, modern Huntsville retains its antebellum aura (the National Trust even named it one of America's "distinctive destinations"), but the city's skyline is defined by the Saturn V rockets developed there in the 1960s. Led by Wernher von Braun and his team of German rocket scientists (spirited into the United States after WWII through a covert CIA effort codenamed "operation paper clip"), this team of former Axis-allied scientists paved the way for modern American space flight.

What to do

U.S. Space and Rocket Center. The centerpiece of this sprawling space oasis is the 68,000-square-foot Davidson Center, housing an original Saturn V rocket, an Apollo cockpit trainer and a 67-foot curved-screen IMAX theater featuring five daily showings. Outside, kids can explore numerous rockets up close; experience a simulated space launch (for those under 54 inches, there's a mini-version in the cosmos play area); and stomp around a faux lunar crater. If you're planning to make a day of it, pack a lunch and picnic in space shuttle park. The perfect follow-up? A week spent at the center's famous space camp.

EarlyWorks Children's History Museum. This charming, mid-sized children's museum welcomes visitors under a canopy of 8,000 fabric leaves that comprise a sprawling imitation evergreen in the museum's atrium. Inside, this hands-on learning space is packed with fun features, including a replica blasting exhibit (complete with dry ice) that teaches kids about local mining history; a 19th-century general store; and a special space for infants and young children to safely explore. If you have extra energy, the Huntsville Museum of Art is across the street, and kids 6 and under are free.

Huntsville Botanical Garden. Located just a mile from the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, this 100-acre natural retreat is a world away from the high-tech wonders of aerospace engineering. Kids will enjoy the two-acre children's garden and mini-railroad. (The open-air Bridge Street shopping center is also nearby and has a kids' carousel and gondola rides.)

When to go

Summer in the south can be brutal, so it's better to go during the explosion of color that defines Dixie in the springtime. During April, the Huntsville Botanical Garden hosts its annual festival of flowers with thousands of blooming dogwoods and azaleas on display, with average temperatures topping out at just 75 degrees.

Another spring standout in Huntsville is the 19th annual NASA Great Moonbuggy Race, April 13-14, at the Space and Rocket Center. The race pits high school students from around the world against one another in a feat of engineering to see who has the math and science skills to reach the finish line first.
