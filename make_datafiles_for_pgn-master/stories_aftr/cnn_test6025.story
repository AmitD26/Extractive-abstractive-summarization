The South Korean Central Disaster Relief Headquarters said one person had died after being crushed by a container and that another had been injured after being hit by an object blown by the wind.

Nearly 200,000 households were without power, the disaster agency said, most of them in the south of the country. About 1,000 people in coastal areas had been advised to relocate to safe areas, it said.

The storm prompted the cancellation of 119 flights, the suspension of 96 ferry routes and the temporary closure of 21 roads, according to the agency.

Okinawa, meanwhile, emerged relatively unscathed Monday after the typhoon buffeted it with maximum sustained winds near its center of 185 kilometers per hour (115 mph), according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which monitors storms in the region.

That wind strength put Bolaven in the "super typhoon" category at the time. And with a cloud field of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), it was 20 times larger than Okinawa's length. The storm weakened somewhat Tuesday to become a regular typhoon, with maximum sustained winds of around 130 kilometers per hour (86 miles per hour).

Okinawa, which is situated in an area of the western Pacific Ocean where typhoons are frequent, avoided the kind of destruction that some other storms have caused in East Asia this summer.

Five people were injured on the island, the local authorities said, and 549 residents took shelter in public buildings to avoid potential damage to their homes. About 17,500 households lost electricity as the storm damaged power lines.

Storm chaser James Reynolds was on the northwestern coast of the island during the worst of the typhoon.

The infrastructure on Okinawa is designed to withstand violent storms. "Everything's made of solid concrete," Reynolds said.

The power of Bolaven was also having an effect on another storm further south.
