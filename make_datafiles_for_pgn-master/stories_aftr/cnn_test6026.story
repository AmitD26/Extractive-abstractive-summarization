(CNN) -- If you're traveling abroad, your laptop could be attacked. That much, is certain, according to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, which warned this week that hackers are "targeting travelers abroad through pop-up windows while establishing an internet connection in their hotel rooms."

The warning comes from the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, or the IC3. But it lacks so many key details that security experts wonder if it's of any use. It doesn't say where these attacks have occurred, how prevalent they are, or how exactly they work.

Graham Cluely, a blogger with antivirus vendor Sophos, found the lack of details peculiar. "What's fascinating about the advisory is what it doesn't say," he wrote on his blog Thursday. "And without more information it's hard to know how computer users are supposed to take meaningful action to protect themselves."

The IC3 report comes months after the Bloomberg story, but then the FBI isn't exactly known for being ahead of the curve when it comes to security warnings.

Here's the key passage:

But pop-up windows that instruct users to do bad things -- installing adware or fake antivirus products or malicious Trojan horse programs, for example -- have been around for years. They happen everywhere in the internet, not just in untrustworthy hotel and public Wi-Fi networks.

Security experts generally acknowledge that hotel networks â€” especially open Wi-Fi networks â€” are untrustworthy minefields.

For corporate users, or those who are technically savvy, a virtual private network is often the best way to boost security.

For Graham, that means full disk encryption, to make your laptop unreadable in case it gets stolen. He also says that travelers should be up-to-date with their software patches and use secure SSL connections whenever they're on the Web. "And stop clicking on Trojans," he adds "If you don't do this already, then there's really no hope for you anyway.
