That's stunning.

"The Walking Dead" was already the the most successful basic cable drama of all time in the adult demo. Last night was up more than 50 percent from season two. And if you include "The Walking Dead's" encore telecast in the mix — which is a common habit for cable networks when touting their ratings — the total viewer number rises to 15.2 million. Sure, it's two airings, but still ... that's edging into NCIS territory.

This hasn't been a great fall for broadcast so far. Three of the four major networks are down compared to last fall, with NBC — aided by "The Voice" — rising somewhat. For a cable show to come along and prove that getting a huge rating in the valuable adult demo for a third-year show is still very possible must give pause. Broadcasters, after all, turned down "The Walking Dead." As the show's writer Robert Kirkman told EW.com: "There definitely was resistance to dive into the genre. [Network executives] were like, 'I don't know if we want dead people eating people on our network.' That makes sense."

'Walking Dead' revived! Ken Tucker's take

Last night's premiere will probably be remembered as the hour that set a record for zombie killing. How many was that? Seventy? Eighty? After last season's fan complaint of too much farm chatting and not enough zombie killing, the third season premiere's orgy of kill-shots surely satisfied fan blood lust (though left me wanting an Xbox controller in my hands).
