Another 24 people were injured, 14 critically, when the coach smashed through a roadside barrier on the steep Laffrey gradient, some 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the southeastern city of Grenoble.

Several helicopters and a fleet of emergency vehicles ferried the injured to hospital in Grenoble in an operation that mobilized 60 police as well as fire-fighters.

France's LCI television quoted him as saying that he had alerted his men to the route's dangers. He said he had driven the coach himself recently and its brakes had then worked well.

"My daughter got in touch with me. She's got a broken leg and collarbone and head injuries and is badly shaken up," Poland's TVN24 quoted a weeping Malgorzata Wachowiak as saying of her daughter Karolina, aged 22.

"It is a dangerous road, so dangerous that coaches that don't have the authorization to take it, which seems to be the case here, are banned from taking it," French Prime Minister Francois Fillon told reporters after visiting the scene.

"Doubtless the best thing to do is ensure that this type of vehicle does not take such a difficult route as this."

French President Nicolas Sarkozy sent a message of condolence to his Polish counterpart Lech Kaczynski and would meet the Polish president at Grenoble airport when he arrived later on Sunday, the French presidency said.

Maciej Lopinski, an aide to the Polish president, told PAP that the victims' families would receive financial support from a special presidential fund.

Robert Caban, owner of the transport firm that hired out the coach, told PAP the drivers were experienced and the seven-year-old Scania coach was in good condition.

"Ahead of the pilgrimage the coach underwent a thorough check-up in Germany and everything was in order. Before going on the pilgrimage it had traveled to Spain, and everything was in order," PAP quoted him as saying.

Polish television said the Polish pilgrims were from parishes in the Szczecin area of northwestern Poland, who were due to return home on Tuesday. E-mail to a friend
