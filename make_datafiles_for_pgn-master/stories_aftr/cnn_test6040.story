(CNN) -- Justice Department prosecutors said Friday that they are closing a criminal investigation of champion cyclist Lance Armstrong without filing charges that he used performance-enhancing drugs.

Late Friday, he released a statement in which he said he was "gratified" to learn that prosecutors are closing their investigation.

Prosecutors called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles as they investigated the case, but they apparently determined that they lacked evidence to bring a charge.

In May 2011, Armstrong once again denied claims from a former teammate that he used drugs during his cycling career.

Armstrong came out fighting once again in May, in the face of fresh allegations made on the CBS News "60 Minutes" show by another American Tyler Hamilton.

On his Twitter page, Armstrong said at the time: "I have had a 20-year career, 500 drug controls worldwide, in and out of competition, and never a failed test. I rest my case."

In the CBS interview, Hamilton -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw Armstrong use blood boosting substance EPO in 1999, the year of his first Tour de France victory.

"He has completely changed the story he has always told before so that he could get himself on "60 Minutes" and increase his chances with publishers."

Fabiani continued: "Greed and a hunger for publicity cannot change the facts: Lance Armstrong is the most tested athlete in the history of sports: He has passed nearly 500 tests over 20 years of competition."
