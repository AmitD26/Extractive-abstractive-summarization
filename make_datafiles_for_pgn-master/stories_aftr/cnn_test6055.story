Prosecutors said the public was never in imminent danger.

All four suspects were in custody and are scheduled to make their initial court appearances Wednesday in Gainesville, about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta, the U.S. attorney's office announced.

"When it comes time to saving the Constitution, that means some people gotta die," an arrest affidavit quotes one of the defendants, Frederick Thomas, as saying during one recorded conversation.

"While many are focused on the threat posed by international violent extremists, this case demonstrates that we must also remain vigilant in protecting our country from citizens within our own borders who threaten our safety and security," U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said in a written statement announcing the arrests.

The affidavits don't identify the "known militia organization" of which FBI agents say the men are a part. But according to the documents, they talked about spreading ricin across several cities at once, including Washington, Atlanta, New Orleans and Jacksonville, Florida.

During an April meeting at his home, Thomas allegedly told participants he had a "bucket list" of politicians, government officials, corporate leaders and media figures he said should be targeted to "make the country right again."

Crump allegedly said he wanted to make 10 pounds of ricin for distribution. "Dump that little (unintelligible) that's all you gotta do is lay it in the damn road, the cars are gonna spread it," the affidavit quotes him as saying.

According to one of the affidavits, Crump formerly worked for a contractor doing "maintenance type services" at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Crump also spoke of an even deadlier substance, "worse than anthrax," but the group would need financial backing to produce it, according to the affidavit.

The document states a castor bean provided to the informant by Adams and Crump tested positive for ricin.

According to another affidavit, Thomas allegedly said the group was ready to move forward with obtaining silencers from an active-duty member of the U.S. Army. In a phone call, he also said the four began physical training to prepare for their plans, the affidavit states.

Yates told CNN Atlanta affiliate WXIA that the investigation began earlier this year when an informant talked with the FBI about conversations he had overheard. The informant taped conversations with the four suspects and an undercover agent began talking with them, Yates said.

She said the defendants had taken "substantial steps" in the alleged plot.

Adams, Crump and Roberts are from Toccoa, about 90 miles northeast of Atlanta, while Thomas is from nearby Cleveland, Georgia, prosecutors said.
