The monarch, wearing blue, was greeted at the door of 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister David Cameron.

Her role is clear: "As Head of State The Queen has to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters, unable to vote or stand for election," according to the British Monarchy's website.

Her presence as an observer Tuesday coincides with the end of the yearlong celebration marking her 60 years on the throne. During that time, the United Kingdom has had 12 prime ministers.

The session lasted 90 minutes, during which ministers presented her with a gift they personally paid for to mark her diamond jubilee.

The previously unnamed territory is nearly twice the size of the United Kingdom and about a third of the whole land mass of the British Antarctic Territory, Hague said.

The queen's visit to the Foreign Office, only her second in the past six decades, is the final official engagement of her busy jubilee year.
