The 266-foot-diameter Kulluk remains upright and there is no apparent threat to its stability, said Sean Churchfield, the incident commander and operations manager for Shell Alaska.

The Killuk ran aground off uninhabited Sitkalidak Island, about 200 miles south of Anchorage, on Monday night. The current tow plan calls for the barge to be towed 30 miles to the north to Kiliuda Bay for safe harbor and a more detailed assessment.

"The exact timing of a potential towing activity will depend on weather, tides and operational readiness," Churchfield told reporters in a news conference.

As much as 150,000 gallons of ultra low sulfur diesel and approximately 12,000 gallons of other petroleum products are on board the Kulluk, which had been working in the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska's North Slope, until October.

The Kulluk is a blue and white circular rig with a helicopter landing pad and a tower in the middle. The steel vessel is double-hulled and designed for drilling in Arctic waters.

Shell's Arctic exploration plans caused widespread concern among environmentalists and were held up after BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.

The U.S. Geological Survey estimates more than 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable by drilling. And the shrinking of the region's sea ice -- which hit record lows in 2012 -- has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region.

Climate researchers say that a decrease in sea ice is a symptom of a warming climate, caused largely by the combustion of carbon-rich fossil fuels. The science is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most scientists.
