NEWPORT NEWS, Virginia (CNN) -- A federal bankruptcy judge has denied the Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan presented by suspended NFL quarterback Michael Vick.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro urged Vick, 28, to offer the Eastern District of Virginia Bankruptcy Court another plan for emerging from bankruptcy.

The sports agent who landed Vick's landmark 10-year, $140 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons also testified that he expects Vick will be back in the game as soon as September -- if the National Football League reinstates him.

Vick is in great shape and could once again command millions of dollars if he returns to football, Joel Segal told the court.

The decision to reinstate Vick rests with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, with whom Segal said he had consulted.

Vick was suspended from the NFL after his conviction but remains under contract with the Falcons, Segal said, though he does not expect the Falcons to retain Vick's rights if he is reinstated.

Vick and many of his creditors are depending on a return to football as his main source of income. But Segal admitted that he has no way of knowing whether Vick will be reinstated, because the decision lies with Goodell.

In the meantime, Vick is ready to "get back in the community in a positive light" and demonstrate remorse for his actions, Segal said.

He has agreed to participate in a documentary about him that will net him $600,000, Segal said. He will also work 40 hours a week for W.M. Jordan, a construction company based in Newport News.

The employment is not part of the official 61-page agreement tentatively worked out between's Vick's lawyers and numerous creditors.
