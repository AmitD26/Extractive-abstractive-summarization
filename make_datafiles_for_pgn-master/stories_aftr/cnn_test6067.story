(CNN) -- It's an illuminating idea which its creators hope will help drive up energy efficiency and bring down buildings' carbon emissions.

Mixing the idea of Google's Street View with multi-spectral thermal camera technology, Massachusetts-based startup Essess is building a giant database mapping residential and commercial properties in the U.S.

The project is the idea of Sanjay Sarma, professor of mechanical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who wanted to create a way of identifying and remedying inefficiencies in buildings.

"The purpose of the approach is to provide a snapshot of the energy efficiency. It answers about 20-30% of the problems of your home." Duncan said.

"I consider it a fabulous way to start a broader dialogue about the more comprehensive (energy) profile," he added.

The beauty of the reporting system (see gallery) is its simplicity, says Duncan, with consumers immediately getting a sense of how efficient their homes really are.

The database will also create what he calls "an eco-system around building efficiency" becoming the cornerstone of a competitive hub where homeowners can link up with specialists who can remedy problems.

Buildings consume around 40% of the U.S.'s total energy requirements annually, according to the Department of Energy, with over one third of that power going to waste.

The company is evolving a business model which Duncan hopes will mean customers won't pay a cent to view information about their home.

Instead, audits will potentially become part of the service provided by real estate databases like Zillow and Trulia, Duncan says.

It's a strategy that's proved highly successful in motivating people to insulate their homes, Little says.

"With gas and electricity prices only looking like they are going in one direction, the amount you can save is also upwards as well," he added.

"The headline figures around how much you can save could be the catalyst to get you from being aware to doing something about it."
