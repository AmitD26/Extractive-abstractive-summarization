(CNN) -- Steve Reeder says it's no secret among his Facebook friends: He's a Republican.

But after he began posting news articles and political cartoons on his page that reflect his support for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, his friend count began falling off. Today, it's down by several dozen.

"One day, they are there. The next day, they just disappear," said Reeder, 53, of Roswell, Georgia. "Most (people) don't say anything to me about it. So I just say 'good riddance.'"

Nearly one-fifth of people admit to blocking, unfriending or hiding someone on social media over political postings, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. The biggest gripes: The offending person posted too often about politics, disagreed with others' updates, or bothered mutual friends with partisan political postings.

"In the real world, we navigate these issues all the time. We know not to bring up politics around certain friends or family members. We try to avoid people who are constantly looking for an argument or trying to sell us on their pet ideas," said Aaron Smith, a Pew research associate.

"Since blocking, unfriending, hiding people is the closest social analogue to those real-world examples, it's not necessarily surprising to see people taking these steps in the virtual space."

"This is a pretty mercurial campaign on both sides. People on both sides tend to get heated pretty fast," said Stevens, 37, of Ruidoso, New Mexico. As a result, he said, "there are way too many people on Twitter who are a little scary."

"When you don't follow people with the opposing viewpoint, Facebook and Twitter can become an echo chamber where everybody agrees," Stevens said.

But that's just fine with Andre Kelly, who took to Facebook in recent weeks with a posting decrying political opposition on his page.

He warned off supporters of Romney from posting on his page, writing that he was "simply NOT having it."

"This was amazing and I loved every second. I'm glad he took the time to think and word this the way he did. I believe and agree with this 100%," wrote one admirer.

Battling allegations

The political divide on social media has become so wide that some people have been trying to silence one another.

Liberal groups, meanwhile, have accused conservatives of using #block/report to shut them down.

The battling allegations have led to competing blog posts that offer some of the same advice.

Liberty Chick, a columnist for conservative site Breitbart.com, encouraged users to report suspected abusers, while Charles Johnson of left-leaning blog Little Green Footballs said he would continue to tell his followers "to block and report" those who harass them.

And for people sick of politics poisoning their feeds, there are Facebook pages such as "Nobody Cares About Your Political Posts. Really," where users can vent their frustrations.

Repairing relationships

It started out as friendly barbs on Facebook, childhood friends sparring over differences in the presidential election.

"One less hateful troll = more peace on my page," Mirocha, 43, wrote in a Facebook post.

The Iowa-based writer made no apologies: "It's my page, isn't it?"

"The beauty of social media is that it does allow us to be commentators on the news. But you have to be aware of your audience," Farley said. "You know these people would never say anything to your face. But it is sort of an unfortunate consequence of anonymity online."

For many people, the hardest part of the 2012 political debate may be restoring friendships that have been damaged.

"I think that for friends, real friends, it will get better," said Stevens, who after the election plans to restore a number of Twitter voices he has muted. "I think for people that are partisan acquaintances, it will probably calm down a little."

But Farley believes repairing friendships damaged by political differences will probably take a little work.
