(CNN) -- The shelling and sinking of a rust-stained fishing trawler in Alaskan waters ends its aimless voyage more than a year after a tsunami swept it off the east coast of Japan.

The U.S. Coast Guard said it opened fire on the roughly 200-foot trawler Thursday after it determined the "unmanned, unlit, unmarked vessel" posed a hazard to mariners and Alaska's marine environment.

The Ryou-Un Maru caught fire and capsized in more than 6,000 feet of water about 180 miles southwest of the port city of Sitka, said Petty Officer 1st Class David Mosley, a Coast Guard spokesman.

"It's really one of the first significant pieces of tsunami debris to make its way across the Pacific Ocean," Mosley said.

The ship drifted undetected until late last month when a Canadian coastal air patrol spotted it several hundred miles off the Queen Charlotte Islands, an archipelago on the north coast of British Columbia.

"I think it captured a lot of people because it survived. It was swept away by the tsunami. It's believed lost. It's forgotten about. And it spends an entire year at sea, a summer, a winter and it makes it all the way across the Pacific Ocean," Mosley said.

The Japan coast guard identified the trawler and its owner after Canadian officials provided the identification number on the hull of the ship. It was moored at Hachinohe in the Aomori prefecture when the tsunami hit last year.

At that point, the U.S. Coast Guard determined it posed a threat to other ships navigating the area as well as a potential environment hazard, he said.

The trawler's planned sinking was temporarily halted Thursday morning when the Coast Guard ship, the Anacapa, based out of Petersburg, Alaska, arrived to find a Canadian ship inspecting the trawler.

"At that point, there was a meeting to discuss whether they had the means to tow or salvage the vessel," he said. "They determined it would be too unsafe. At that point, they were asked to leave the area."

The Anacapa opened fire Thursday afternoon with its 25 mm cannons, blowing holes into the side of the Ryou-Un Maru, the Coast Guard said.

It took more than four hours for the trawler to sink.
