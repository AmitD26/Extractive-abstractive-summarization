It was supposed to be the end of an era, the end of a generation.

Had it not been for a post, then perhaps the world would be looking at a different future. Football is nothing but fickle.

The headline will be Barcelona's 4-0 annihilation of AC Milan, swatting aside the critics and doubters in the only way that this great team know how.

Had the ball deflected off the post and spun the other way, the chilling inquest into Barcelona's fall of grace would have already begun.

Trailing 2-0 from the first leg, Barca was in a supposed crisis, its crown as Europe's dominant force precariously balanced.

Consecutive defeats to arch rival Real Madrid in domestic competition and the anemic display at San Siro just three weeks ago had stoked the fires.

It could have been a different story -- but history is written by the victors and Barcelona were victorious by a considerable distance.

Without coach Tito Vilanova, who is still undergoing cancer treatment, question marks had emerged about the ability of the club to make it through to its sixth consecutive quarterfinal.

Whether Barcelona's world would have crumbled had that ball nestled in the far corner will never be known, but had it done so, then Milan would have at least given itself a chance.

There is little room for "What if?" in sport however and Barcelona left little to chance as it went on to produce a mesmeric performance.

His 58th came less than 100 seconds after Niang had threatened to send shockwaves throughout Europe.

This time, albeit with a suspicion of offside, Messi unleashed an unstoppable drive from 20-yards after Massimo Ambrosini had gift wrapped possession to the Barca man.

The halftime whistle brought some solace for Milan, but it only delayed the inevitable.

But not even a prayer was going to help the Italian side out of this.

Just 10 minutes of the second period had elapsed when Kevin Constant's dreadful error allowed Xavi's pass to skip into the path of David Villa, who curled an exquisite effort into the far corner.

Milan threatened sporadically and a wonderful block from Jordi Alba denied Robinho as Barcelona began to look nervous for the first time in the contest.

Crisis? What crisis.

From the cradle to the grave service provided by Schalke

In the night's other game, Galatasaray booked its place in the last eight with a dramatic 3-2 win over Schalke in Germany to progress 4-3 on aggregate.

Following a 1-1 draw in the first leg, Schalke looked set to progress when Roman Neustadter prodded home from close-range.

But Galatasaray, boasting the likes of Didier Drogba and Wesley Sneijder, was soon level thanks to a stunning 25-yard drive from former Schalke player Hamit Altintop.

Burak Yilmaz then grabbed his eighth goal of the competition to put Galatasaray ahead and put himself top of the Champions League goalscoring charts.

Marco Hoger smashed an effort against the crossbar with 63 minutes gone before Michel Bastos leveled soon after.

But with Schalke pushing up for a winner, Umut Bulut raced through to score and seal his side's place in the quarterfinals for the first time in 12 years.

"We showed we deserve to be in the quarter-finals, but it was a close game and both teams had their chances," said Altintop.

"Perhaps we had a bit of luck at the end, but I'll take that.

"We responded well to fight back after conceding the early goal."
