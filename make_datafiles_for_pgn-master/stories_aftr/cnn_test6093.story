Heath Ledger's final film, "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus," will screen at Cannes.

The Terry Gilliam production was delayed by several months after Ledger's death from an accidental overdose last January, before Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law stepped in to complete his role. It will screen out of competition.

The official selection, announced Thursday, also confirmed that the festival will open with a 3-D animated film for the first time. "Up," the latest from Disney Pixar, will premiere in Cannes on May 13th.

Almodovar again has Penelope Cruz as his leading lady in "Broken Embraces," while Ken Loach's comedy "Looking for Eric" sees former Manchester United and France footballer Eric Cantona return to the silverscreen.

Park leads the large Asian contingent with "Bak-Jwi" ("Thirst"), which follows a priest who becomes a vampire.

Competition will also feature Von Trier's "Antichrist," Haneke's "The White Ribbon," Isabel Coixet's "Map of the Sounds of Tokyo" and Italian Marco Bellocchio's "Vincere."

The film festival runs from May 13 to 24.
