Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The man convicted of killing British student Meredith Kercher has given an interview from his Italian jail cell, insisting Amanda Knox is a "sweet girl" incapable of murder.

Asked if his former girlfriend Knox -- also convicted of Kercher's murder and jailed for 26 years -- was capable of killing, Sollecito told Il Messagero: "It is absurd and inadmissible. She is a very sweet girl."

Sollecito's lawyer Luca Maori, who acted as an intermediary for the newspaper, confirmed to CNN that the interview had taken place and was reported accurately.

Speaking from his cell in Terni prison in central Italy, Sollecito maintained his innocence and blamed his conviction on a "media campaign."

"I was certain that the verdict would put an end to a nightmare. Instead, it didn't," he said.

Sollecito said he was no longer in love with Knox but still felt close to her. "She is also in a nightmare and a harrowing situation like mine."

He also rejected claims he and Knox had acted inappropriately by shopping for underwear after Kercher's murder -- an incident that was cited as an example of Knox's lack of emotion following her roommate's death.

Sollecito said his religious faith was sustaining him in prison, although he was struggling to cope.
