"I'm on the plane," I heard her tell the caller. "It's Adele on my iPad!" Then, "I don't have headphones. But everyone likes Adele!"

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) saw a 29% rise in incidents on board flights between 2009 and 2010. The Transportation Security Administration, however, has seen a decline over the last three years in security-related disturbances the agency has been called to deal with on planes.

Air rage: Passengers 'quicker to snap'

However you slice it, you don't have to work too hard to notice multiple recent examples of passengers losing their cool in lavish fashion.

This year alone we've seen some impressive displays of in-flight fury.

Later that month, a Jetblue flight from New York to San Diego made an unscheduled stop in Denver to remove a woman who allegedly became verbally abusive after another passenger was moved to a neighboring "even more legroom" seat near her. The source of the woman's rage was apparently that the man had not paid for the extra legroom ($65), but had been moved there due to a broken television in his seat.

In February, a male passenger on a flight to Atlanta is accused of hitting another passenger's crying baby, uttering a racial slur as he did so.

Airline squeeze: It's not you, it's the seat

Airlines, angling to make a profit, are chipping away at legroom or charging extra for a little more room, introducing new fees or bundling and unbundling the existing charges and re-jiggering mileage programs to favor the elite big-spenders.

Is the altitude getting to them? HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky points out that fliers can experience mild brain swelling even at low altitudes that can make it harder to keep your cool.

Or are enraged passengers just under the influence?

"Alcohol," he writes, "is the leading driver of air rage." In fact, many of the air rage incidents above were allegedly alcohol-related.
