Explorer America Concept

Wisely supporting the green trend, Ford chose to combine two important concepts in the debut of a single vehicle, the Ford Explorer America.

Compared to Ford's current SUV champ (the regular production Explorer), the America concept is smaller, lighter, more efficient and more refined. Moving away from traditional truck-like body-on-frame construction, the America is a lighter-weight unitized design. The styling may be a hint at what a future Explorer might look like.

However, for the first time, Ford has combined these two features on a gasoline engine. The result is an affordable line of 4- and 6-cylinder engines that deliver excellent economy, reduced emissions, and impressive power.

The 3.5-liter Gasoline Turbo Direct Injection V6 in the Explorer America is claimed to produce 340 horsepower, more than the base 4.6-liter V8 in a Ford F-150 pickup truck.

Ford also pointed out that while a GTDI engine is more expensive than a similar engine without GTDI, it's a technology that will pay for itself.

While we understand the concept of saving fuel and money, we're not exactly sure what the Explorer America's implies. Perhaps this is what Captain America would drive ... after all, there's plenty of room in this 6-passenger mid-size SUV for his shield and other members of the Justice League.
