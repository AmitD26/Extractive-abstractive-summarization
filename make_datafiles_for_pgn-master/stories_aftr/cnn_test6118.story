Those are the sensational words that have captured mainstream headlines in the United States, Great Britain and Italy during the Amanda Knox saga. On Monday, the buzz phrase was "judgment day." Would the flaxen-haired, photogenic American student, convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering her British housemate Meredith Kercher in 2009, be released? Would her conviction be overturned?

At about 3:50 p.m. ET, Knox was freed.

Authorities quickly hustled her out of the courtroom and to the prison where she could collect her things.

Italian jury clears Amanda Knox of murder

The Knox case was a pop culture obsession, and that's not going to stop now that the jury has decided to set her free. The race will be on for which media outlet interviews her first. More than 410 journalists had credentials to be at the courthouse in the tiny Umbrian hillside village of Perugia.

Meanwhile, movie deals are in the works. Noted director Michael Winterbottom is interested in making a movie about Knox, with Oscar-winning actor Colin Firth starring as a journalist covering the trial, the Guardian reports.

It is social media, after all, which helped form the image of Amanda Knox as both an innocent American college student and a murdering temptress.

In the past few years, many books have been written about Knox, including one titled "Angel Face." The latest book is "The Fatal Gift of Beauty: The Trials of Amanda Knox" by Nina Burleigh, who appeared Monday on CNN, to discuss the book.

The reason Knox was falsely convicted, Burleigh suggests, is because Knox is attractive.

Everyone, Burleigh said, was "riveted" on "this woman's face" and not the facts of the crime or the case.
