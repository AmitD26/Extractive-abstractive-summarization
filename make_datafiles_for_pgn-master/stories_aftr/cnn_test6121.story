Mariposa, California (CNN) -- A campfire left untended sparked a blaze near Yosemite National Park that is threatening hundreds of homeowners, but firefighters are starting to get a handle on it.

"My cats are with some friends and the dogs are with some other friends," Cann told CNN affiliate KGPE.

"When you are evacuated, it makes you think," he said. "I've been in that house 23 years and it makes you think about what's really important; what do you have to take, and, in the end, it's not all that much."

The quickly spreading flames forced many, like Orlando Vigil, to flee in a hurry.

"We'll see if there's anything when we get back," Vigil said.

Beating back the fire

Summer wildfires are nothing new in California. But this one is happening weeks earlier than normal, and comes as parts of the state experience "exceptional" dryness that could fuel flames.

The Carstens Fire was first spotted Sunday afternoon, after embers from a campfire that hadn't been totally put out spread into the surrounding forest.

The evacuations forced some residents into the Red Cross shelter at Mariposa Elementary School. Officials are there with food, medical help and other basics.

"We also have a mental health worker to help those that are overstressed emotionally from the ordeal of being uprooted from their home," Cindy Thomas of the Red Cross told KGPE.

Among them is Paul "Bear" Vasquez. More than 37 million people have viewed his YouTube video showing him becoming overjoyed and then breaking down at the site of a vibrant double rainbow over a mountain in 2010.

Today, that mountain is singed by the Carstens Fire. But Vasquez says he's staying on the property he bought in 1998, hacking out of the wilderness a spot for the home where he's raised his children.

"I am the protector of this land," he said. "I am part of this place. It has magical powers, and I can't leave."
