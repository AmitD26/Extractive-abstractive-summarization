Washington (CNN) -- U.S. transportation security officials want to speed more travelers through airport security lines by expanding a voluntary program that requires a background check.

"Let's get away from the one size fits all and let's focus on those that we can pre-screen," Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole told the Aspen Security Forum on Friday.

For those who opt to become a five-year member of the PreCheck program for $85, they can keep their shoes, belt and light jacket as they walk through a dedicated and expedited security line.

TSA hopes to have 25% of the traveling public enrolled in expedited screening by the end of 2013. More than 650 million people fly U.S. airlines annually.

The idea of removing low-risk, pre-screened people from the main security lines, will allow security resources to be concentrated more closely on potential threats and alleviate long lines at security checkpoints.

Homeland security officials are most concerned about long-standing terror interests in bringing down U.S. airliners. Currently, the focus has been on sharpening the ability of security personnel to detect explosives.

When it was first released, the program was only available on Delta and American Airlines, but US Airways, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines were later included.

The latest expansion will include JetBlue and Southwest, the largest airline for domestic flights.
