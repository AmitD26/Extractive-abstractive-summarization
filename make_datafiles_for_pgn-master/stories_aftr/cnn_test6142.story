Police said the crimes occurred Friday evening in a poor suburb west of the city center known as Favela do Muquico.

The attack reinforces the need for more security in a city that will host of high-profile events, starting with a visit by Pope Francis in July for World Youth Day. Rio will also host matches in the 2014 World Cup and the Olympic Games in 2016.

In late March, an American tourist was gang-raped and brutally beaten aboard a minibus in the touristy Copacabana area of Rio.

According to a police report, in the latest incident, the man robbed passengers and forced them to the front of the bus. He then raped a woman and beat her with a gun.

Passengers told police that the man appeared to be under the influence of drugs. He ran out of the bus after about 30 minutes.
