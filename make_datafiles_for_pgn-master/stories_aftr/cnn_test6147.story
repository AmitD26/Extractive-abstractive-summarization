Every group of people has a right to its own views, Obama said, and that diversity should be respected, "but when it comes to how the state treats people -- how the law treats people -- I believe that everybody has to be treated equal." He spoke at a news conference with President Macky Sall of Senegal, a country in which homosexuality is illegal.

"Regardless of race, regardless of religion, regardless of gender, regardless of sexual orientation ... people should be treated equally, and that's a principle that I think applies universally," Obama said.

The remarks came in response to a question from CNN as to whether he was pressing Sall on the issue.

Obama said that the issue did not come up in their talks, but that the question of how gays and lesbians are treated has been coming up in Africa in general.

"Senegal is a very tolerant country which does not discriminate in terms of inalienable rights of human beings," he said, according to an official translation. People are not refused jobs for being gay, he said. "But we are still not ready to decriminalize homosexuality."

"But of course this does not mean that we are all homophobic," Sall insisted.

"In our country, we have abolished it for many years," he said, adding, "We do respect the choice of each country."

Obama left the United States on Wednesday for a trip to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania -- his second visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office.

At Thursday's news conference, Obama was asked to assess the big news at home: the Supreme Court ruling Wednesday striking down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act.

Mandela's influence

"My first act of political activism was when I was at Occidental College as a 19-year-old -- I got involved in the anti-apartheid movement," Obama said.

He said he was inspired by what was taking place at the time in South Africa. He had read Mandela's writings and speeches, and understood "that this was somebody who believed in that basic principle I just talked about -- treating people equally -- and was willing to sacrifice his life for that belief."

Obama's visit to South Africa on Saturday will include a stop at Robben Island, where Mandela spent a majority of his 27 years in prison. The White House schedule does not include a visit with the anti-apartheid icon.

After making his remarks Thursday, Obama visited Goree Island, which once served as a strategic post in the transatlantic slave trade.

"Obviously, for an African-American, an African-American president, to be able to visit this site, I think, gives me even greater motivation in terms of human rights around the world," Obama said.
