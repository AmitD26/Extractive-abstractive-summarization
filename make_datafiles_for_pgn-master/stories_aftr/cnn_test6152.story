The eight-man, four-woman panel will resume work at 9 a.m. Monday to continue processing testimony from more than 70 witnesses and over 800 exhibits compiled during the seven weeks of the trial.

If he is found guilty, the money and weapons will be forfeited to the government.

U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper asked Bulger if he understood he was giving up his right to have the jury decide whether or not his possessions will be forfeited if he is convicted.

"I understand yes," Bulger replied."

Outside the courtroom Thursday, Bulger's lead attorney, J.W. Carney, said he was "very, very proud of the service these jurors have provided to us no matter what the outcome of the trial."

Carney added that it was difficult waiting for a verdict "because we invested at this point two years of work to get this case ready for trial."

The widow of one of Bulger's alleged victims said separately that she believed "the jurors are looking at the situation and trying to do right by all of us."

Still, Donahue said, "If deliberations go for a long period of time I'm going to start to worry about a mistrial."

Bulger never took the stand despite repeated hints from his lawyers throughout trial he would testify. In fact, Bulger seemed to want to testify. Questioned by Judge Casper, Bulger called his decision a "choice made involuntarily."

Bulger was a fugitive for more than 16 years, disappearing after a crooked FBI agent told him he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. The FBI tracked him down and arrested him in 2011 in Santa Monica, California, where he had been living with his girlfriend under an alias.
