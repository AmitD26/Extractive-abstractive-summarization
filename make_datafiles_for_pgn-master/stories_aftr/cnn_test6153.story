KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Taliban said its gunmen opened fire on an aid group's vehicle in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday, killing four International Rescue Committee workers and prompting the organization to suspend its operations.

Three IRC female staffers -- a British-Canadian, a Canadian, and a Trinidadian-American -- were killed, as well as an Afghan driver who also worked for the New York-based aid group, the IRC said in a statement.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. The aid workers were in a two-car convoy when gunmen opened fire on them in Pul-i-Alam, the capital of Logar, according to provincial governor Abdullah Wardak.

IRC, which provides relief to refugees and victims of armed conflict around the world, said it "has suspended its humanitarian aid programs in Afghanistan indefinitely."

"We are stunned and profoundly saddened by this tragic loss," said IRC president George Rupp.

Earlier this month, aid groups in Afghanistan issued a report that said 19 of their workers have been killed in the country this year. The deaths Wednesday add to the count.
