Washington (CNN) -- A post-mortem Sunday of the mid-term elections provided little evidence that Democrats and Republicans will work together to address major issues such as deficit reduction any better than they have in recent years.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, considered a likely presidential contender in 2012, told CNN's "State of the Union" that he advocated repealing the health care bill and ensuring that government operates on the revenues available.

Voters want to see results on creating jobs, and if Republicans don't produce, "we'll be thrown out in two years," Pawlenty said.

The question was not whether Obama was willing to work with Republicans, as he stated last week, but, "Are we willing to work with him?" Cantor asked.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told the CBS program "Face the Nation" that agreement exists on some specific provisions, but he refused to signal any willingness to compromise.

After explaining he must stick to core policies such as education and infrastructure investment and clean energy development, Obama said he also needs to "make some mid-course corrections and adjustments."

"How those play themselves out over the next several months will be a matter of me being in discussions with the Republican Party," the president said, adding: "There are going to be areas where we disagree and hopefully there are going to be some areas where we agree."

Obama wants to extend the lower tax rates for income below $200,000 a year for individuals and $250,000 a year for families, saying that means 98 percent of Americans won't be subject to a de facto tax increase.

Republicans oppose higher tax rates for anyone, including the nation's wealthiest 2 percent, arguing it would harm small business owners who traditionally bring about significant job creation.

In an interview to be broadcast Sunday night on the CBS program "60 Minutes," Obama expressed a willingness to compromise, perhaps by extending the lower tax rates for wealthy Americans for a two-year period as long as everyone else also maintains their current lower rates.

McConnell, however, made clear that Republicans believe no one should have their tax rates return to the higher levels of the 1990s.

"We don't have a revenue problem; we have a spending problem," McConnell said, repeating a line parroted by Republicans on other shows. "So the whole nomenclature surrounding this -- that somehow we're doing people a favor by giving them their own money back -- I just don't accept. The government is too big. It needs to be shrunk."

Other GOP positions spelled out Sunday included reducing non-military "discretionary" spending -- such as department and agency budgets, but not including entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security -- to 2008 levels, reducing federal wages and cutting the federal workforce.

A unanimous Republican policy is to try to get the health care reform bill repealed. While acknowledging Obama and the Democrats will almost certainly be able to stave off full repeal, Republican lawmakers including McConnell, Cantor and others advocated cutting funding and mounting legal challenges to hinder implementation of the measure until they can try to defeat Obama in 2012.

Some of the Republican opponents of the bill also called for keeping popular provisions touted by Obama and Democrats, such as preventing insurance companies from dropping coverage when people get sick, or denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions.

"We're going to do everything we can to try and repeal and replace this thing," Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, expected to be the new chairman of the House Budget Committee, said on "Fox News Sunday."

Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina told CBS that the Republicans were on the wrong side of history on the health care issue. Clyburn noted that similar calls for repeal followed landmark legislation in the past including the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that allowed African-Americans to vote.

Amid the legislative wrangling will be new investigations by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the expected new chairman of the panel in January, told the Fox program.

He cited White House attempts to influence candidates to drop out of primary elections, as occurred in the Pennsylvania Senate race, as one issue to be investigated. Issa's committee also will support a Judiciary Committee probe of alleged voter intimidation by two members of the New Black Panther Party at a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, voting station in 2008, he said.

Meanwhile, signs of friction within the Republican Party also appeared Sunday, with conservative lawmakers pushing plans not favored by some in the GOP congressional leadership.

Republican Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who supported Tea Party candidates across the country in toppling mainstream contenders in GOP primaries, called for a halt to all congressional earmarks as part of a conservative action plan against high spending.

McConnell, however, said the issue was more complex than just spending, involving whether the legislature has the authority to determine exactly how money gets spent. DeMint made clear that he and the new Tea Party conservatives rejected McConnell's position.

"Well, you know, he's going to have an opportunity in the Senate to offer all of those ideas," McConnell said. "We'll get votes on them."
