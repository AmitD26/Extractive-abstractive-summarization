(CNN)As they took their seats on a TransAsia Airways flight that crashed in Taipei on Wednesday, Lin Ming-wei and his young family were looking forward to a vacation on Kinmen, an island in the Taiwan Strait.

Lin Ming-wei didn't give up, performing CPR on his son.

"He is my only child. I absolutely have to save his life -- I can't lose him," the Liberty Times newspaper quoted him as saying.

The 2Â½-year-old boy made it and was in a hospital Thursday, about to be discharged from the intensive care unit as he battles pneumonia, his uncle said. Chris Lin said that his brother, Lin Ming-wei, suffered some scratches, while his sister-in-law fractured some bones and is recovering well after surgery on her left hand.

He told CNN on Monday that his brother and family switched seats at the check-in desk and not when they were on the plane.

Chris Lin said his brother told him the plane suddenly dropped after its left engine lost power. After it hit the water, Lin Ming-wei -- who was strapped to his seat and upside down -- unbuckled himself before helping free his wife, the brother said.

"Many passengers were tangled up in their seat belts and hung upside down," the Taipei Times quoted him as saying.

"Shortly after taking off, I felt something was not right," he told CNN affiliate ETTV.  "I thought: 'something's wrong with the engine,' because I always take this flight."

Thirteen people were saved in the initial rescue effort but progress slowed and water had completely filled the fuselage by evening, when a crane lifted it from the water.

The Lins were not the only ones to have a lucky escape.

After the plane hit, the taxi driver made a shocking report to dispatchers.

"I just brought a passenger up unto Huandong, and as I was getting on (the expressway), a plane flew by and hit me," he said, according to an audio recording of the call released by taxi company Crown Taxi.

"A remote-controlled model plane?" the dispatcher asked.

"Huh?" the puzzled dispatcher responded. "Are there any casualties?"

The driver described the dire situation: "The whole thing fell into the Keelung River. My passenger can't get out of the vehicle. My car's wrecked."

According to the Taipei Times, Chou's family didn't believe him at first when he telephoned home to say: "I'm OK. My car got into a crash. It was hit by an airplane."
