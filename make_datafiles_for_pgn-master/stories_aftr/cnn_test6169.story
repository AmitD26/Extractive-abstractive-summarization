Alexander Poulides told the San Jose Mercury News that he's embarrassed and shocked, but most of all apologetic for his "indiscretion."

"Oh, my God,'' Poulides said. "I threw a banana on my way out."

That's when he contacted the newspaper to claim responsibility.

The team's front office said it's continuing to investigate.

"The Giants have a zero tolerance policy against this type of behavior, which results in immediate ejection from the ballpark," a statement from the team said. "While we have been investigating the matter since we learned of the situation, unfortunately we have been unable to identify the person responsible.

"We would like to extend our sincerest apologies to Adam and the entire Orioles organization for this unfortunate incident.

Jones took to his official Twitter account to express his displeasure.

"I want to thank whatever (expletive) threw that banana towards my direction in CF in the last inning," he posted. "Way to show ur class u jackass."

The Orioles overcame a two-run deficit to score 10 unanswered runs in the 10-2 victory over last season's World Series champs.
