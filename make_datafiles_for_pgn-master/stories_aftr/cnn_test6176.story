Hunt, who turned 19 on Wednesday according to her family, is charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after the parents of the 14-year-old went to authorities. Hunt's family says their relationship was consensual, though in Florida a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to give consent to sex.

Bruce Colton, state attorney for Florida's 19th judicial circuit, told CNN that his office offered Hunt the latest plea deal in July.

Under its terms, she would plead to two misdemeanor battery counts and one felony count for interference of child custody -- a charge that could be expunged later from her record -- said Colton.

In exchange, Hunt would be subject to a curfew, would have to do community service and would be on probation, he added. But she would not face jail time, nor would she have to wear an ankle bracelet or have to register as a sex offender.

If Hunt is convicted on all charges she's currently facing, she could go to prison for 15 years. No trial date has been set.

"If this case involved a boy and girl, there would be no media attention to this case," her attorney Julia Graves said then in a statement. "... If this incident occurred 108 days earlier when (Hunt) was 17, we wouldn't even be here."

The case generated buzz when Hunt's family went public on Facebook, detailing their daughter's case and essentially accusing the victim's family of going after their daughter because she is gay.

The victim's family said that isn't true; they are only trying to protect their teenage daughter.

Sheriff: Case is about age, not gay rights

Jim and Laurie Smith have told CNN affiliate WPEC that they twice warned Hunt, who was then 18, to stop. They took action after going to their daughter's bedroom one weekend morning and discovered she was missing.

"We had no other alternative but to turn to the law, use it basically as a last resort," Jim Smith said.
