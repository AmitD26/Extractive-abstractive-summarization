ESTEROS DEL IBERA, Argentina (CNN)  -- When Doug Tompkins wants to drop in on his neighbor, the best way to do so -- in fact, the only way to do so -- is to fire up his Cessna 206 and fly across the vast subtropical wetlands that he owns in this remote corner of northeastern Argentina.

Doug Tompkins and his wife Kris have dedicated their lives to land conservation in Argentina and Chile.

During the flight we pass a thousand feet over the wetlands, and I watch the landscape change rapidly below: Long, thin lagoons slice through thick fields of brown marsh. Tiny floating islands sit engulfed by lush green prairies. With his keen eye, Tompkins spots a lone marsh deer, knee-deep in water, munching on grass. More than 350 bird species live in the wetlands, which is roughly the size of Belgium.

I traveled to the Esteros del Ibera -- which means 'shining water' in the Guarani language -- to profile Tompkins and his wife, Kris, for CNN International's "Going Green" series. We are highlighting "Green Pioneers" from around the world, and Doug and Kris Tompkins certainly fit the bill.

Tompkins made a fortune as the founder of The North Face and Esprit clothing companies. In 1990, he cashed in his shares in Esprit, making millions in the process. Kris soon followed suit, ending her 18-year stint as CEO of the Patagonia outdoor clothing company.

"The fashion business is not the business to be in if you're trying to contribute to diminishing the impact on nature," Doug says.

"Buying land, conserving it and shepherding it towards national park status, yes, it is probably legitimate to call us pioneers," says Kris, 59.

"There were really wild allegations that we were creating a Jewish state, though we don't happen to be Jewish. That we were creating a nuclear waste dump for the U.S. That we were creating a passage for Argentina to finally militarily overtake Chile. All these things are society's ways of beginning to accommodate new ideas," says Kris.

Just getting to the Esteros del Ibera is a challenge. My journey started with a 10-hour, 700-km overnight bus ride from my home in Buenos Aires to the small town of Mercedes in Corrientes Province. From there, cameraman Eduardo Aragona and I drove two hours on a bumpy, red-dirt road to arrive at the Estancia Rincon del Socorro, the traditional Argentine ranch that the Tompkins operate, and where guests from around the globe come to get up-close looks at rare species of capybara, caiman, deer and scores of birds.

"We are trying to restore the place and bring back the species that were already extinct, like the anteater. And we are working with the Pampas deer, which is a very endangered species. And perhaps in some years we will bring back the jaguar, that is our big dream," says Sofia Heinonen, a wildlife biologist who heads the Conservation Land Trust's initiatives here.

While the Tompkins are heroes in most environmental circles, some activists and political leaders have labeled Doug as arrogant, eccentric and out-of-touch with the pressing needs of humans. He told me that he does what he does because he feels the need to "pay rent" for living on planet earth.

"The reality is that nature doesn't care about human economies, or social justice or whatever problems exists within the realms of human beings. It's just responding to impacts -- and we have to deal with those impacts one way or another," he says.
