Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from author Alex Wellen's new novel, "Lovesick." In this chapter, after weeks of procrastinating, Andy Altman finally works up the nerve to ask his future father-in-law, Gregory Day, for his daughter Paige's hand in marriage. Alex Wellen is an award-winning television producer for CNN.

Nothing like mixing love and a battle with a crime ring of geriatric gangsters to cause some dizziness.

Reception here is spotty. My phone flickers between one and three bars. You can't do this with anything less than three out of five. The quality of the connection is crucial. "Come again, Andrew? Why on God's green earth would you want my dressing?"

I've got two bars. It's ringing. Holy crap! Holy crap! Holy crap! I'm getting married. I should have done this in person. I should have taken him to Applebee's or bought tickets to an Oakland A's game or just asked him over lunch at Langley's Diner. This should be easier. Doesn't every man secretly want a son?

"Hello," Gregory says, bracing for a telemarketer.

"Is anyone there?"

"Hi, it's Andy," I say finally.

"Hello, Andrew," he says, still concerned I might sell him something. I can hear him tearing paper like he's opening mail.

"Everything okay?" he says suddenly.

"You bet. We arrived safely in Sonoma," I assure him. "Paige is getting ready for dinner." His daughter may have just turned thirty, but a father never wants to be reminded that his unwed daughter is on a sleepover with a boy. "Ignorance is bliss," "plausible deniability," this is how a father deals with his daughter's virginity, Paige tells me.

"So I wanted to call," I say, taking a deep breath.

It sounded better in the shower.

A tumbleweed rolls through the dining room. Crickets chirp.

"Hello?" I ask.

Gregory speaks, finally. "I appreciate that, Andrew," he says kindly. "I do." He seems genuinely touched. "When did you want to do this?"

Didn't I say "tonight"? I swore I said "tonight."

"No, not at all, I trust you. I bet you're the best with secrets."

Gregory takes a deep breath. Then another. He clears his throat.

I'm blowing this.

"Wait," he commands finally.

"Okay. No problem."

"Hello?" I ask.

"Hello?" he asks.

"You're back, you told me to wait. Didn't you just go somewhere?"

"I'm just sitting here. I was waiting for you to say something."

"I thought you wanted me to wait," I say.

"I do. I want you to wait to ask Paige to get married."

"That's not it at all."

"It's been more like nine months, and that's not it either. Listen," he begins.

It's the first time he's called me this.

"I have my reasons and I'll explain when I see you. I promise. But you need to make me two promises, son: keep this between us . . . and wait."
