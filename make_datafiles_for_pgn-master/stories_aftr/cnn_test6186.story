The government insists it would never use chemical weapons on its own people. But world leaders say Syria's desperation could lead to even more tragedy in the war-torn country.

--What kinds of weapons are we talking about?

U.S. intelligence indicates Syria has mixed chemical compounds needed to make sarin -- a deadly agent that can quickly kill thousands.

Opinion: Don't wait for Syria to cross the 'red line'

Sarin quickly evaporates from liquid to vapor form and disperse into the environment. It also mixes easily with water and can poison a water supply.

VX is another nerve agent that can be lethal when inhaled. It can also be dispersed in a liquid form; even a few small drops on the skin can lead to the same effects as sarin gas.

"Compared with the nerve agent sarin (also known as GB), VX is considered to be much more toxic by entry through the skin and somewhat more toxic by inhalation," the CDC said.

Mustard gas -- also known as sulfur mustard -- leaves chemical burns on the skin, eyes and even the lungs when inhaled. It was commonly used in World War I.

Syria's endgame in sight as rebels advance

--How long do the dangers linger?

A person's clothing can emit sarin for about 30 minutes after exposure to sarin vapor, which can lead to exposure of other people, the CDC said. Sarin can also be ingested though contaminated food.

VX gas evaporates very slowly, at about the same rate as motor oil. As with sarin, it can also be emitted from clothing for up to half an hour after exposure.

--How devastating can chemical attacks get?

One of the most horrific chemical attacks on a civilian area occurred 25 years ago, when Saddam Hussein unleashed chemical weapons in Iraq's Kurdish city of Halabja. The attack left thousands dead and thousands more wounded.

--What's the risk of Syria using chemical weapons on foreigners?

But with no end in sight to Syria's 21-month conflict, some aren't so sure Syria will keep its promise.

"For the first time in the history of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which entered into force in April 1997, there are serious concerns that chemical weapons might be used," said Ahmet Uzumcu, director-general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

U.S. President Barack Obama warned Syria that any deployment of chemical agents would be catastrophic.
