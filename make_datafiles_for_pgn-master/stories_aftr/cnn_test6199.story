The incident occurred when Red Bull's Australian driver Mark Webber came in for a pit stop on lap nine of the race at the Nurburgring Circuit.

"The most important thing today is that the cameraman who got struck by the tire does not appear to have suffered any life-threatening injuries," Horner told the sport's official website.

"It's a timely reminder that working in the pit lane is dangerous. Everyone reacted incredibly quickly and the most important thing is to hear that he seems to be fundamentally OK.

"We need to understand what went wrong in that first pit stop for Mark, but as I said, our main concern today is knowing that the cameraman is OK."

Triple world champion Vettel, bidding to win a fourth successive drivers' title, is now 34 points clear of second-place Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso.

"It was a tough race; it was one of the toughest for a long time," said the 26-year-old Vettel. "I'm happy the race wasn't two or three laps longer, as Kimi was a bit quicker towards the end.

"I'm very happy that it worked out and it's very special. The team worked really hard to give me the chance to win this weekend and we got it."
