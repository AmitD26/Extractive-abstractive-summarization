New York (CNN) -- The 25-year-old man who jumped from a monorail car into the Bronx Zoo's tiger den was not drunk or insane, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said.

Kelly added there was no evidence Villalobos is mentally ill or was intoxicated.

"I don't think it was malicious," Kelly added. "There was no indication he was drinking, but that he just ... momentarily lost any semblance of common sense."

David Villalobos, who is hospitalized in stable condition, told police "his leap was definitely not a suicide attempt, but a desire to be one with the tiger," according to Paul Browne, chief spokesman for the NYPD.

Villalobos was riding on the zoo's Wild Asia monorail around 3 p.m. Friday when he jumped out of the rail car, "clearing the exhibit's perimeter fence" and landing in the den, according to Bronx Zoo Director Jim Breheny.

The commissioner said most of Villalobos's injuries appear to be the result of the 17-foot fall from the monorail.

Police said Villalobos was charged with misdemeanor trespassing and will be arraigned after he leaves the hospital. He will not have a court appearance until January, according to the office of the Bronx district attorney.

He was "conscious and talking" as he was taken by ambulance to Jacobi Medical Center in Bronx, New York.

"I think it's safe to say that if the tiger really wanted to do harm to this individual he certainly had the time to do it," Breheny said. "This is just an extraordinary occurrence that happened because ... somebody was deliberately trying to endanger themselves."

The Bronx Zoo is the city's flagship park run by the Wildlife Conservation Society.
