Acevedo is accused of strangling 30-year-old Pamela Pemberton on October, 24, 1994, and leaving her body in a vacant lot, according to the indictment and authorities.

Last week, the FBI's Violent Crime Task Force linked Acevedo to the murder of Christina Adkins, who disappeared in 1995 at age 18, McGinty said.

Remains believed to be those of Adkins were found this month in a utility vault near the intersection of interstates 71, 90 and 490, the prosecutor said. As a result of the finding, the grand jury indicted Acevedo on murder charges in that case, too.

Bret Jordan, Acevedo's attorney in the 1993 case, declined to comment on the latest indictments.

Acevedo is expected to be arraigned on the new charges next week. Jordan said he will find out at the arraignment whether he has been assigned the new case.

Acevedo was arrested earlier this year in the same Cleveland neighborhood where authorities found Amanda Berry, Georgina "Gina" DeJesus and Michelle Knight in May at Castro's two-story home.
