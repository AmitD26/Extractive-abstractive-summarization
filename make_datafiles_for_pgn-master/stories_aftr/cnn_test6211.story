Hong Kong (CNN) -- For the second time in a week, suspected Hong Kong organized crime syndicates -- known better as triads -- have targeted the production of "Transformers: Age of Extinction" being filmed in the Chinese territory.

Police arrested and charged one 35-year old man with blackmail but his three partners remain at-large.

"I personally told this man and his friends to forget it," said Bay. "We were not going to let him extort us. He didn't like that answer."

The man returned an hour later, "carrying a long air-conditioner unit," added Bay. "He walked right up to me and tried to smack my face, but I ducked threw the air unit on the floor and pushed him away."

In both episodes, triads -- known for their dealings in smuggling, prostitution and illegal gambling -- are believed to be involved.

"The separate side of this is that the triad control of the movie industry in Hong Kong is a very complicated issue and has been in place for many years," added Vickers. "The triads strangle the oxygen out of the local movie scene. They're not just extorting people for money. It's control of movies, starlets and distribution."

In recent years, triad-related crimes in general have been on the rise, according to crime statistics from the Hong Kong Police Force.

For three years in a row, from 2010 to 2012, the number of triad-linked incidents rose nearly 15%. Most recent data for the first half of 2013, however, shows 988 triad-related crimes -- the second lowest reported number for the same time period over the past decade.
