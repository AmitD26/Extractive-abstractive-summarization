(CNN) -- Google is a company focused on problem solving. It has untold amounts of computing power at its disposal working away to try and solve big problems.

The company has a number of year-round initiatives aimed at hiring and educating more women programmers, including scholarships and events. The annual developers' conference offers a rare public, visual example of the industry's gender gap and the company's progress.

Google has worked to shine a spotlight on the accomplshed women working in technology now, as well as the women who have done important work in the field throughout history. The Women Techmakers Fireside Chat featured some of Google's high-ranking women, and the event was quickly filled to capacity with a mix of men and women.

"Its been a priority from the beginning ... the visibly of technical women is something we really want to work on," said Smith, who works at Google[x], Google's semi-secretive experimental wing that works on futuristic projects and prototypes.

First Google made a concerted effort to find talented women in the field from around the world to invite to the conference.

"We felt like there were incredible technical women who should be at I/O, who for whatever reason weren't there," said Smith. "We did a lot of work to just make sure that we were increasing the presence of women leaders ... on the stage and in demos."

They also organized a social event for all the women attendees and offered on-site day care for all parents attending the conference. Kids were also welcome on the floor, and one dad wrote in to say it had been a great father-daughter event.

"I think Google can (and should) expand their efforts to be more visible to the general public and not just to the people who are already in the industry," said Rozen. "Incorporate more women into their commercials, make sure to advertise women tech-makers events throughout the year and eventually also expand the relevant age groups to focus on younger girls."

Smith is influenced by the success of the Harvey Mudd school in southern California, headed up by president Maria Klawe. Its computer science department is now 44% women, thanks to efforts by the school to figure out why more women weren't joining in the first place.

"Young women are very interested in having an impact on the world," said Smith. "We haven't connected the dots for them" that coding can have a direct impact on issues that are important to them.

It's not just a matter of reaching out to young people. Women are getting into computer science later in life as returning professionals. And going back to college isn't the only way to learn programming, according to Smith. Anyone can take classes on sites like Khan Academy, Codecademy and Coursera.

Female programmers are also spreading the word on their own. Rozen is doing her part by teaching her young nieces how to program.
