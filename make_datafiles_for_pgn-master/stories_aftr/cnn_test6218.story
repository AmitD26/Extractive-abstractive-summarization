(EW.com) -- Spiraling into oblivion really helps you see things from a different perspective.

At Sunday night's premiere of "Gravity," Sandra Bullock said she felt she didn't deserve the Oscar when she won it for "The Blind Side" three years ago — and now her performance as an astronaut stranded in orbit when space debris demolishes her shuttle could win her another one.

"I think most people have that out-of-body experience when they win the Oscar. I had a little newborn at home, so my body was already out of itself," Bullock said in response to a question about awards season during the post-screening Q&A with festival-goers. "I still haven't gotten around to having my moment with it yet. Maybe one day it will come."

She'll face formidable opponents in the race. Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine, Kate Winslet in "Labor Day," and Emma Thompson from "Saving Mr. Banks" are among the potential nominees generating voter buzz.

Since the film is set in orbit, she was often strung up on wires, or locked in a device that spun her wildly in different directions while multiple cameras shot close ups of her face. That footage was later woven into photo-real animation of her and George Clooney in jeopardy, floating far above the Earth.

"It was painful, I remember. Not for me -- but for you," Cuarón said.

"It was frustrating, it was painful, and it was isolating. But how lucky am I that I got to have all those frustrations, you know, built in?" Bullock told the crowd. "That's something people who are in the position these characters are in [would be] experiencing a thousand-fold."

Turning serious, Bullock said there was one part of the role that was particularly special to her.

"It was an amazing experience to do as an actor, but I think more importantly as a woman," she said, thanking Cuaron, who wrote the script with his son, Jonás . "It could have very easily [become] the role of a man.
