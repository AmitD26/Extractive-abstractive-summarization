(CNN) -- A Las Vegas cabbie who returned $300,000 left in his car has received a $10,000 reward from the poker player who lost the cash.

But cab driver Gerardo Gamboa and his bosses on Friday still weren't revealing the name of the 28-year-old professional gambler, whom they earlier described as a famous figure on the poker circuit.

Before the gambler forgot his paper bag of cash in the cab's backseat, the poker player tipped the cabbie $5 on a $9.90 fare, Gamboa said.

"I really appreciate that because when somebody gives me $5 it means they appreciate my service," Gamboa said.

When pressed for the high roller's name, however, Gamboa was, well, poker-faced himself.

"You know, he doesn't want me to mention his name, and I want to keep his privacy. He doesn't want any publicity," Gamboa said.

Meanwhile, Gamboa's native country of the Philippines is going to honor him.

The office of President Benigno Aquino III called the cab company and said it will send a resolution of commendation to him, said Bill Shranko, chief operations officer at Yellow Checker Star.

"They are so proud of me, and I am so proud of what I have done," Gamboa said.

He has been surprised by the international attention.

His boss also gave him four paid days off.

On New Year's Eve -- one of the busiest days in the cabbie business -- Gamboa will be back at work on the Las Vegas Strip. That's where the cabbie picked up the forgetful gambler and proved his honesty in a town better known as sin city.
