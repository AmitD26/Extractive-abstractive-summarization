"There was a march. The peaceful intent did not exist. We used the best practices in law enforcement," he said at a news conference Friday.

Huerta's sister, Evelin Huerta, said a federal investigation is needed.

Protesters threw bottles and rocks at police officers and vandalized police property, Lopez said, defending his officers' reaction to the vigil.

The Durham Police Department says Huerta died on November 19 from a self-inflicted gunshot while handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser. The teen was being taken to the police station by Officer Samuel Duncan about 3 a.m. for a second-degree trespassing violation.

The chief said at the news conference that gunshot residue tests were conducted on Huerta and the arresting officer, and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation "found that Huerta was wearing gloves and that his gloves had a saturation of gunshot residue on it. Officer Duncan's revealed that he had no gunshot residue on his hands," Lopez said.

Huerta's family, along with local activists, allege police foul play in the death of Huerta, who was affectionately called "Chuy" by his loved ones. Huerta's family has submitted a formal petition to local authorities for archives into the investigation, according to local media.

"People can see that we actually support him and that we need justice for Durham because it's not fair that this is happening, like the police is not giving us answers," Evelin Huerta told CNN affiliate WTVD.

A separate vigil held last month by the family also turned violent and ended in arrests. The family has said it plans to hold a protest on the 19th of every month.

"Personally, I don't believe one word of what the Durham Police Department has stated," local activist Lamont Lilly wrote in an article published shortly after Huerta's death. "It seems to me, and many others throughout the city, Durham police officers are simply covering their tracks with a concocted story that makes no physical or logical sense whatsoever."

Between 150 and 200 Huerta supporters marched Thursday from Durham City Hall to the parking lot of police headquarters. Some carried banners that read, "Fue Matado Por La Policia" or "Murdered By Police."

"They didn't really look like batons or night sticks, but they were thinner and longer and they were reaching over the banner, whacking people with them," protester David Kaplan told CNN affiliate WTVD. "They were clearly upset with the fact that people were out expressing themselves and upset at the fact that it appears they murdered a 17-year-old child."

At least one demonstrator suffered minor injuries, and no officers were injured, the police chief said.

Images from the scene showed smoke billowing as riot police launched tear gas at the crowd. Some demonstrators wore masks to cover their faces.

A similar case in July stoked skepticism in Jonesboro, Arkansas, when Chavis Carter, 21, died from a close-range gunshot while handcuffed in the back of a police car.
