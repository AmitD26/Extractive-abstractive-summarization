(CNN) -- Four years ago, Beth Cirami walked into Malissa Booth's tattoo shop, mournful and anxious. Her brother had just died of leukemia, and she wanted something to remember him by.

She'd gone to other tattoo shops in the St. Louis area and when she tried to explain her story -- why she was getting her first tattoo at age 37, what it meant to her -- it felt like no one listened. They told her to flip through a book and pick a drawing she liked; it just didn't feel right.

"This was a very personal piece for me. I needed that work of art," Cirami said.

Cirami left Booth's shop with a pinstripe tattoo adorned with the initials of her children and a picture of a heart glass her brother gave her before he passed away. It was exactly what she wanted.

"She had that sensitivity to that reason why most people get tattoos. It is a very secret and spiritual experience," Cirami said.

But Booth's entrance into the tattooing world didn't start off easy.

Long before Booth started dabbling with needles and inks, she managed a call center with more than 180 employees. The single mother of three teens rose quickly at her company, but when the travel industry hit a slump, jobs were cut left and right.

"I was angry, angrier than I had ever been," she recalls. "I put everything I had into that job."

After sending out dozens of job applications and not hearing back, she decided to pay her ex-husband, a tattooist, a visit. She wanted to give tattooing a shot, maybe just as a part-time job until she found her next management gig.

He was hesitant to help her.

"The life of a tattoo artist is one of feast or famine," she said. "He knew I had three kids to raise and that it wouldn't be stable income, but I insisted. So, he spent months making me draw."

At age 37, she quickly learned she was a rarity in the business; few middle-aged women were signing up to become tattoo artists. As an apprentice working among other artists -- all men -- she sometimes heard she was too "soft" to be in the industry, or too old to start learning.

While apprenticing at a shop in Warrenton, she met Michael Pease, a 30-year veteran of tattooing. Pease taught Booth how to draw lines and quick sketches, techniques tattoo artists use to ink their customers quickly, "before they change their minds," he jokes.

After Booth apprenticed with him for a year, Pease encouraged her to take another step by purchasing a tattoo shop that was going on sale in Warrenton.

In her shop, there are no photos of nude girls. Instead, there are colorful paintings of wildflowers, abstract shapes, and warped skulls, it's reminiscent of Creole artwork hanging in the French Quarter of New Orleans, a place where Booth says she draws artistic inspiration.

Although experts usually advise against tapping into your 401(k), Booth cashed hers out, using $12,000 to buy the tattoo shop and new equipment.

"My clientele ranges from 80-year-old women to leaders of churches and doctors and lawyers," she said. "I wanted to create a shop where anyone would feel safe and like family."

It's that kind feel of that drew customers like Beth Cirami, who now refers others to the shop.

"It's a very cherished thing," Cirami said. "Malissa really takes the time to produce something that is as special as the reason why you are getting it."

Booth says she's on track to grow the business, and happier now than when she worked her corporate job.

"It was very hard going from being in careers where you are at the top of your game, winning awards of excellence, being the expert at things, to being a nobody that knew nothing," she said.
