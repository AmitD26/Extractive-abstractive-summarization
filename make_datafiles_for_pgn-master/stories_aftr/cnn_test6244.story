Washington (CNN) -- (CNN) -- The words "budget" and "compromise" haven't been connected in Congress in recent years.

But legislators stunned observers and perhaps each other this week when Republicans and Democrats proved that they can, indeed, agree on government spending.

Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray worked out a budget framework to fund the government into 2015.

It was the first full budget agreement by a divided Congress -- in which different parties control the House and Senate -- since 1986, Ryan boasted in announcing the deal.

A short-term spending plan got it going again, but a CNN/ORC International poll found that 71% of Americans thought another shutdown would occur when the money ran out in January.

Instead, such repeated budget brinksmanship would be put on hold if Congress passes the Ryan-Murray proposal. While neither side loves the compromise legislation, it appears to be on a path to approval.

For two years, the most conservative members of the Republican Party, with the help of outside conservative groups, have been driving the agenda in the GOP-led House.

House Speaker John Boehner endured humiliating leadership lapses when he was unable to corral sufficient votes from his majority caucus for legislation and agreements opposed by the tea party wing.

Led by tea party conservatives, Republicans forced a showdown over their demand to dismantle Obamacare. When Democrats balked, the public blamed the GOP for the dysfunction.

At the same time, Boehner and other GOP leaders want to keep the political focus on problems with Obamacare, such as the botched launch of the HealthCare.gov website and policy cancellations despite President Barack Obama's promise that people could keep coverage they liked.

In defense of defense

In general, members of Congress hated the untargeted forced spending cuts known as sequestration from a 2011 agreement, albeit for different reasons.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel praised the agreement Thursday, saying it provided certainty for military planning.

"This agreement does not solve all (Department of Defense) budget problems but it helps address readiness especially in 2014 with putting more money back in training, in particular, and procurement," said Hagel, a former Republican senator.

After the October government shutdown, a CNN/ORC International poll showed only 14% of respondents expressed satisfaction with how the government was operating.

By comparison, 26% of people were dissatisfied with the government during the Watergate scandal.

Perhaps lawmakers are sick of being the least popular kids in town.

Democrats don't want to be blamed

Republicans got the most blame for the October shutdown, and Democrats want to make that a permanent association in the mind of the public.

"In many ways, those people have hijacked the name Republican, which has been such a valuable contribution to our country, the Republican Party," the California Democrat said. "But they've taken it over the cliff."

With congressional elections coming up next year, Democrats want to ensure that voters think of Republicans whenever the word shutdown comes up.

Actually passing a formal budget for the first time in several years benefits everyone.

Bureaucrats can develop strategies and plans based on known figures, rather than wallowing in uncertainty over how much money the bickering legislators finally would authorize.

"I came here to cut the size of government. That's exactly what this bill does," Boehner said Thursday of the budget deal.

Meanwhile, Pelosi made sure to point out that passing the budget agreement would require Democratic votes because too many Republicans oppose it for the majority party to push it through on its own.

"They haven't passed anything with their own votes that was any good for the country," she said.
