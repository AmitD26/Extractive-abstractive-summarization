Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- The mood around Independence Square in Ukraine's capital was very somber Sunday as thousands gathered, mourning the dozens of people killed in demonstrations during the past week and wondering who will take charge of the politically divided nation.

They wondered where President Viktor Yanukovych, who reportedly tried to leave the country Saturday night, had gone.

There was a great uncertainty in the country after the rapidly moving events of the past 24 hours, which saw Parliament oust Yanukovych, free his political rival Yulia Tymoshenko from prison and schedule elections for May.

Oleksandr Yefremov, parliamentary leader of Yanukovych's Party of Regions, condemned the ousted President on Sunday in a video statement, blaming him for the "robbery and deception" of the nation.

It also remains to be seen how Russia -- Yanukovych's ally -- will respond with the Winter Olympics in Sochi closing on Sunday.

Rapid changes to political scene

"Today, Ukraine has finished with this terrible dictator," Tymoshenko told the cheering crowd.

She served as prime minister from 2007 until she was forced out of office in 2010 after losing the election to Yanukovych. A year later, she was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia.

Last we heard, Yanukovych was in Kharkiv, a pro-Russian stronghold near Ukraine's border with that nation.

He tried to leave the country by plane but was turned away, authorities said.

On Saturday, the President and his entourage attempted to board a charter flight without proper documentation in the eastern city of Donetsk, according to the head of Ukraine's Border Guard Service, Sergei Astakov.

May elections

Parliament voted to oust the President and hold new elections on May 25. It also appointed Oleksandr Turchinov, the speaker, to take on Yanukovych's duties until then.

Lawmakers also fired several ministers, including the foreign and education chiefs.

But who will lead the nation is still a big question.

The opposition coalition is a chaotic mix of voices, each working to assert dominance.

Russia's influence

The series of concessions started Friday with Parliament overwhelmingly approving the return of the nation's 2004 constitution. Reinstating it gives the President less power -- a key demand of protesters who'd taken over Kiev City Hall for weeks -- and paves the way for lawmakers to appoint key ministers.

Close ally Russia has been busy hosting the Winter Olympics, which end Sunday.

But it's closely linked to the crisis, which started in November, when Yanukovych scrapped a European Union trade deal and turned toward Russia.

Russia offered to lend money to Ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and lower its gas prices.

On Saturday, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, condemned what he called Western attempts to influence the outcome of the tumult in Ukraine.

"Either they don't understand the consequences of what they're doing, or they're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing Ukraine and therefore Eastern Europe," Churkin said in a post on his official Twitter account.

Churkin has accused the opposition of wanting to take power by force.

"If those so-called democratic opposition leaders come to power on the shoulders of thugs, that will not produce democracy in Ukraine," he said.
