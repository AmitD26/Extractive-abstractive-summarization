(CNN)The economy's in the tank, the currency's crumbling, and he's risking diplomatic isolation for doubling down on Ukraine.

So how is it that Russian President Vladimir Putin's popularity is at a whopping 86%?

That's the conclusion of a poll conducted this month by the Levada Center. Last month, Putin's approval rating was at 85%.

What gives?

"An opinion poll can only be conducted in a democracy with a free press," he explained. "In a country with no free press, where people are arrested for expressing their opinions, where the truth is hidden from them, where the media even online is almost all controlled by the government -- when a pollster phones people up and asks, 'Hello, do you approve of Vladimir Putin,' the answer is overwhelmingly yes.

"So what that opinion poll is, is not a poll of approval but it's a poll of fear."

Putin has remained defiant in the face of Western sanctions and political pressure to stand down in Ukraine. And that defiance is earning him political points at home despite the impact on the Russian economy.

"I don't think Russians are really hiding their feelings," Hale told CNN in December, adding that the polls indicate support for Putin, but not necessarily the depth of that support.

Media propaganda plays a key role in bolstering Putin's popularity, Hale said, especially in the portrayal of Ukraine's popular revolt as a fascist takeover and in portraying the annexation of Crimea as, essentially, a rescue mission.

Nationalism's OK, but families have mouths to feed.
