WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The IRS says it's still trying to reach some 5 million Americans -- primarily seniors and veterans -- who have not filed the tax returns needed to qualify for their stimulus checks.

Shulman explained that the IRS had sent out information packages to 20.5 million recipients of Social Security or veterans benefits who did not file 2006 tax returns to explain how to claim their payments.

The commissioner says the agency will soon send a second notice to the remaining 5.2 million and launch an aggressive public relations campaign titled, "It's Not Too Late to File!"

The checks mailed nationwide so far total $63.8 billion, Shulman said. He predicted the total by the end of the calendar year would reach $100 billion.

Shulman apologized for the now 13-minute average wait time to get an IRS employee on the phone, saying, "It's where we'd not like to be, but it's a fact of doing stimulus."

Nina Olson, the IRS' national taxpayer advocate, said only a few glitches had developed in the stimulus effort. One occurred when the Social Security numbers of approximately 1,500 taxpayers were inadvertently disclosed when the IRS routed the stimulus payments to the wrong bank accounts.

Olson also blamed the lack of participation of more than 5 million seniors and veterans on their lack of access to and experience with computers and the Internet, as well as a belief by some that the filing process is too cumbersome and complicated.

"I think there are some natural barriers to getting some folks to want to file a return again," she explained.

To receive a stimulus check, people had to file a 2007 return. The notices sent to those who didn't file an income tax return in 2006 told them they should file a 1040A tax form for 2007 even if they had no tax liability.
