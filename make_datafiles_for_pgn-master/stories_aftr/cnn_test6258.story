Facing another boring day at work, a Toronto car repair shop worker decided some weed would be just the thing to make the day fly by.

Opinions on marijuana reaching tipping point

You can imagine what happens next.

The police forwarded the tweet to an account for a man listed on the board of directors for the repair shop chain.

The tweeter then tried a couple of different tactics.

Finally, shame. "Can't lie, stupid move but would y'all have noticed that tweet if YRP didn't retweet it?"

Since the tweeter named the company, Mr. Lube, and the intersection where his shop was, the chain got involved.

"Thank you to the York Regional Police for your help and great work. The matter has now been handled," it said in a tweet.

Handled?

"Just got the call of termination," tweeted the worker later that afternoon. Make that, the ex-worker.

The York Regional Police explained in a later tweet, "If you shouted on a busy street corner about illegal activity & we drove by, we'd intervene. Think of Twitter as a virtual street corner."

And one final volley from the social media-savvy department.

Lesson learned?
