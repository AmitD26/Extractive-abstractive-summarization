They were on the hunt again, though not for deer or waterfowl or the usual Tennessee fare.

Sanford and Tom's morning hunt proved fruitless. But the pair has had better luck than most sniffing out truffles on American soil -- a relatively new and wholly unpredictable ground for cultivation.

Enthusiasts describe the truffle's olfactory Siren song, which is part of its allure, as "dank," "earthy," "musky," "pungent" -- the gist is its aroma and taste are unparalleled. "It transforms an otherwise ordinary dish into something very extraordinary," Sanford said.

Different types of truffles are found all over the world, but the Périgord and white variety from Alba, Italy, are the top dogs of the gastronomic set.

The elusive truffle hunt is often romanticized: Man and beast wander into the woods of southwest France with a shovel and a calling. A bird chips, a breeze flows and the storybook closes with "happily ever after."

If only it were that simple.

Until recently, the black truffle had been solely imported to the United States.

"I'll have done everything to two trees next to each other, and one will have truffles and one won't," Michaels said.

The first question from proprietor Sam Beall: "How come I didn't know about this?"

Beall and Michaels teamed up to seed and sniff out truffles locally.

Enter the four-legged Tom, who was sourced by local breeder Hilarie Gibbs-Sykes from Italy to simplify the hunt.

At the height of Michaels's truffle business, Tom helped haul in 200 pounds in one season.

"It was a thousand dollars a pound so if you do the arithmetic, that's a good dog," Sanford said.

If we know anything about agriculture, though, it's that Mother Nature holds the reins.

Michaels' hazelnut trees were hit with blight after his initial success, and he had to start over with a new blight-resistant variety.

Last year, Michaels yielded about 60 pounds on his land and sold the majority off to hyper-local ingredient-focused chefs such as Sean Brock in Charleston, South Carolina, and Linton Hopkins in Atlanta. This year, after a series of unseasonable cold snaps, and only a few days left in the season, he hasn't unearthed any truffles of sellable quality.

"Mother nature took its course," Michaels said with the matter-of-factness of someone who has been here before.

Back at Blackberry Farm, Sanford's pin that read "Truffle Dog Trainer" reflected the sun as he crouched beneath a tree to dig up a truffle-scented practice tube that Tom found. On the days when there isn't any luck, training is a commitment to the cause.

Blackberry found only one Périgord truffle last winter on its property.

If it seems like a wild goose chase, that's because it is. But Tom is a Lagotto Romagnolo; he not only enjoys the chase -- it's in his DNA. According to the American Kennel Club, Tom's breed is the only one recognized as a "specialized truffle searcher."

"We wouldn't be talking about any of this if it wasn't for Tom," Sanford said. "He has really put everything we're talking about in cultivating truffles in North America on the map."

Working like a dog at a Long Island vineyard

Now 13 years old, Tom is passing the baton through his bloodline by breeding and sharing his skills. He and Sanford travel around the country to help train other canines in areas like Oregon with an eye on the truffle prize.

At Blackberry and every where else, they're hoping it's not a matter of if, but when, a consistent yield will happen.
