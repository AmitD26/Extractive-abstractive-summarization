But we have to admit, Mars rocked the house (or rather stadium) and his obvious joy at performing for what was basically almost the entire world was pretty infectious.

For those not familiar with Mars, he's pretty awesome. Here are just a few things to love about the guy:

1) He was a baby Elvis

2) He's a return to the singer-songwriter

Mars doesn't just belt out the tunes, Mars also writes them. While struggling to be discovered as a singer, he got his start in the industry writing and producing hit songs for other artists, including Travie McCoy's "Billionaire," Flo Rida's hit "Right Round," and K'Naan's "Wavin' Flag," which became the theme song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

3) He's really good at impressions

His turn on "Saturday Night Live" may not have gotten as much attention as, say, Justin Timberlake's, but there was no denying Mars was out of this world when he portrayed an intern at Pandora who has to imitate several artists -- including Green Day, Michael Jackson, Steven Tyler and Justin Bieber -- when the power goes out.

He's a whole lot of talent packed into a little frame. Mars is reportedly 5-foot-5.

5) He can always find the bright spot -- even when being arrested

6) He really is as cute as a Monchhichi

We hooted when fans started pointing out the cropped-haired resemblance to the Monchhichi doll, made popular in the 1980s. But there is no denying either the similarity or the utter cuteness of both.

They may want to start listening.
