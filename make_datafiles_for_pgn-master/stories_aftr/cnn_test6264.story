(CNN) -- With the news of a video showing their son Bowe Bergdahl is alive, his family sent out a statement they hoped his captors would let him see.

Stay strong, be patient, it said.

CNN has not seen the video, but a U.S. military official told the network that the clip apparently shows the Idaho native in diminished health.

That's a picture that's hard to envision for family and friends. For them, strong has been a word often associated with Bergdahl.

Dan Collins said it was hard, grueling work.

Now Bergdahl, 27, is believed to held by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network in Pakistan, the U.S. military official said. Bergdahl has been in captivity so long he has been promoted twice and is now a sergeant.

In Hailey, Idaho, many residents still have yellow ribbons around trees. It was there four years ago that Sue Martin, owner of Zaney's Coffee Shop spoke glowingly of her former barista.

"He captures you," Martin said.

He was a seeker, a hard worker, a man raised and home-schooled in a small town, an avid outdoorsman who did ballet.

He toured Europe before joining the Army.

He also didn't care for cars, choosing to ride a bicycle to and from the odd jobs he worked to pay for his travels, friends said.

And he was polite, very polite.

One rainy evening the sheriff in his Idaho community stopped to offer him a ride. Bergdahl, who was drenched and walking his bike, said he wouldn't want to get the car wet, so no thanks. And he kept walking.

"Kind of tells you a little bit about the person," recalled Walt Femling, who knew Bergdahl through renting him an apartment the sheriff owned.

"There's not many young people who have the kind manners he has," said neighbor Minna Casser. "He's a gentleman and a sportsman."

The Bergdahl family hasn't spoken much publicly about their son. His father, Robert Bergdahl, posted a YouTube video in May 2011 and a year later he spoke at a Memorial Day event in Washington that was attended by more than 100,000 people.
