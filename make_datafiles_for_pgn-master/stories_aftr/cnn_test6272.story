That's the question raised by tantalizing evidence published this week by teams trying to find out what happened to famed aviator Amelia Earhart, who vanished along with navigator Fred Noonan during a doomed attempt to fly around the world in 1937.

Yet that evidence has been met with skepticism in some quarters.

Debate about the mystery gained new currency this week after researchers publicized images recorded by search teams scanning the ocean floor nearly a year ago near Nikumaroro Island in the South Pacific.

The group said, "It's the right size, it's the right shape and it's in the right place."

Could it really be a piece of Earhart's Lockheed Electra plane?

"We don't want to shrug off the hard work anyone is doing. We do like the idea that people are still interested," she said. "But we're skeptical."

Opinion: Will mystery of Earhart be solved?

There are people out there who buy those theories. But in reality, Foudray said, "no one has yet to come up with anything conclusive."

It wasn't until March that one analyst made a possible connection to Earhart in an online forum for the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery.

Richard Fredricks, executive director of the American Salvage Association, a trade group, said that "almost anything is possible" these days with advanced technology. And that includes locating a lost airplane.

He cited technology such as side-scan sonar and magnetometers but said finding a lost plane such as the Earhart craft is "more a function of funding than technology." Money is needed to invest in expeditions, he said. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery on its website is asking for contributions to continue its work.

"We don't expect anything," she said.
