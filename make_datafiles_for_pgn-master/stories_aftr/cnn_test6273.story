To show some of the impacts of this vast human upheaval, Canadian anthropologist Felix Pharand has created a series of visualizations mapping the presence of technology onto a selection of satellite images showing the Earth from space. 

Using data from a range of sources, including the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the World Meteorological Organization, the images depict a sprawl of air traffic routes, the underwater cables that carry the internet, road and rail networks, pipelines, shipping lanes and electricity transmission lines.

"It shows a human-dominated planet where wilderness areas are shrinking and where the habitats of other species are decreasing in size," he added.

"We humans have become a major force of operation on the biosphere. My goal is to foster global awareness of these issues by changing people's worldviews," said Pharand.

"The strength of these images is, I think, the fact that they are wordless and global, and their overall meaning can be grasped instantly by almost anyone without having to describe them with labels and legend."
