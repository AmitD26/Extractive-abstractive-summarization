(CNN) -- There's no doubt that Boyz II Men know a little something about love. The superstar R&B group even used the word as the title of their new album.

The group covers a variety of love tunes, including Journey's "Open Arms," the Goo Goo Dolls' "Iris," and "In My Life" by the Beatles.

We tried to reach and delve inside of this album and to not just go with the sound, but also the lyrical content that embodies that representation of love

CNN: Boyz II Men has been around for almost 20 years. How has the music business changed?

Nate Morris: A lot of people don't understand that music conforms to the day and times that it is in. It is a circular motion, but it never comes back exactly the same.

This album is the type of album that will hopefully try to steer some of those musical people back in the direction of true music.

CNN: There don't really seem to be any R&B groups out right now representing like Boyz II Men has in the past. Why do you think that is?

Wanya: Groups are hard to come by. A lot of times, when a group is put together by an entity or a manager, [the members] never really had aspirations of being in a group.

With our group, music put us together. We were not contrived by a manager. We loved the way we sounded together, even before we liked each other.

Nate: We have definitely grown in more ways than one. We have children now, some of us wives and relationships. We're very big believers in learning and trying to gain as much wisdom as we can.

CNN: What's the biggest lesson you both have learned as entertainers?

Nate: To stay consistent. It's OK to move with the times, but stay consistent with who you are, not just because of who you are, but because of who your fans fell in love with.

CNN: What's the first single from the new album?

Wanya: The first single we are pushing for is "I Can't Make You Love Me," originally done by Bonnie Raitt. We wanted to stay true to our roots, and it's a very beautiful song. And with our sound, we gave it an R&B twist.

CNN: Is it difficult to cover songs that are so beloved and have been hugely successful?

Nate: Oh yes. There are so many people that have listened to these songs and fallen in love with the song as it was originally performed.

We know that these songs have a fan base. We try to put our interpretation with how we think the song should be without swinging too far away from the solid concrete melody.

Wanya: Integrity is important. Just like someone doing "End of the Road." If they take it so far away from what people know, the fans want to know, "Why did they do that?"

Wanya: Marvin Gaye, the Isley Brothers, anything with a nice feel.

It's funny because you take a language like English that only has one word to describe "love," while a language like Spanish has four or five. That gives you the understanding that love can mean so many different things to different people.

Nate: Late, late next year, we are planning on releasing a Boyz II Men 20th anniversary album, which we are hoping to be a double CD. There's a slim chance that our fourth member of the group will be back for that album.
