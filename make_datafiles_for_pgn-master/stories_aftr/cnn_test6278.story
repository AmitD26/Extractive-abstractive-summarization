The victory re-opened an eight-point cushion over chasing Roma with three rounds of the Scudetto still to be played.

Roma have kept doggedly in pursuit of their rivals, with a fine win over Milan Friday.

But this latest victory for Juve will allow Antonio Conte's men to place one hand on the trophy.

They were given an early fright at the Stadio Citta del Tricolore when the home side took a shock lead as Simone Zaza scored with a low shot past Gianluigi Buffon.

Juventus took until the 34th minute to equalize as Carlos Tevez scored from outside the area with a fine shot after an assist by Claudio Marchisio.

Andrea Pirlo put Marchisio clear to add the go-ahead goal in the 57th minute and Stephan Lichsteiner crossed for Fernando Llorente's third to seal the three points on 76 minutes.

Conte's men are next in action Thursday at their own Juventus Stadium in Turin, looking to overcome a 2-1 deficit from the away leg of their Europa League semifinal with Benfica.

Visiting manager Alan Pardew was allowed pitch side after his seven-game touchline ban but it made little difference to his under performing side.

Arsenal have moved four points clear of fifth-placed Everton with both having just two games left of the season in the EPL.
