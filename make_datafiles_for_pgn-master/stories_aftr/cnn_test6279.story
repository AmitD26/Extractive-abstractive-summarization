(CNN) -- Hoffenheim have failed in their bid to get their 2-1 Bundesliga home defeat to Bayer Leverkusen replayed despite the controversial 'ghost' goal scored by visiting striker Stefan Kiessling.

High flying Leverkusen were winning the ninth round match on October 18 by a single goal in the 70th minute when Kiessling headed a corner just wide of the home goal.

German international striker Kiessling was seen with his head in his hands, apparently acknowledging a bad miss, but the ball found its way into the net through a hole in the side netting.

After a 90-minute hearing in Frankfurt, the head of the DFB tribunal, Judge Hans E. Lorenz said they had been left with "no alternative" but to uphold the original result.

"The question isn't whether this judgment satisfies us from a sporting perspective," he said in a statement on the DBF website.

"From a legal point of view, there is no alternative. There are no grounds for the appeal. The factual decision may have been incorrect, but it is irrevocable."

Hoffenheim cited an incident in a match between Bayern and Nuremberg in 1994 when Bayern's Thomas Helmer scored a similar 'ghost' goal in a 2-1 win.

That game was replayed and Bavarian giants Bayern cruised to a 5-0 win.
