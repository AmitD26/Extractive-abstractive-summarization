Scientific tests have shown that four registered chemicals provide a high level of protection from a number of bug bites, according to the EWG report: Picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (and its synthetic derivative known as p-Menthane-3,8-diol, or PMD) and DEET.

These chemicals are found in many of the popular products on your drugstore shelves. Despite DEET's reputation as a harmful substance, the EWG researchers found it to be one of the most effective chemicals against the risks of West Nile virus and Lyme disease.

"We found them all to be safe, especially if people don't overdose on the product," said David Andrews, lead author on the study and a researcher with EWG. "And these chemicals do protect people against a lot of rather nasty insects."

And that's important because insect-borne illnesses are on the rise. The West Nile virus, which is carried by mosquitoes, infected more than 5,600 Americans last year, and 286 people died from the virus, according to the CDC. A report this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association noted that the virus, which had been declining over the past few years, spiked in 2012, especially in Texas.

By analyzing the epidemic in Dallas County, Texas, researchers found serious West Nile outbreaks begin early, after unusually warm winters. They also seem to be concentrated in one area every year. The virus migrates around the country, so health officials say it's very important to be aware if your area is being affected.

"The concentration level doesn't mean how much it protects," Andrews said. "It means how long it protects. So if you are out for a few hours, 30% is just fine."

The EWG also notes that repellents should be a last resort when warding off insects. The organization recommends covering up with clothing, like long pants and long sleeves, socks and shoes. And be aware of the environment around you. Draining standing water -- where mosquitoes breed -- from your yard will keep populations low.

Picaridin

Developed by Bayer AG in the 1980s, Picaridin is not known to irritate skin and eyes and does not have a bad odor. It may also repel bugs for longer periods of time than other chemicals.

Products that have Picaridin: Avon Skin So Soft Bug Guard; Cutter; OFF! Active; OFF! FamilyCare; Walgreens Light and Clean

IR3535

IR3535 has been used in Europe for years. It can be irritating to the eyes but poses few other safety risks. Merck, the manufacturer, recommends formulas with 10% to 30% concentration to repel biting insects and ticks.

Products that have DEET: Bug Off; Buzz Off; OFF! Active; OFF! FamilyCare; OFF! Deep Woods; Repel; Ultrathon

Oil of lemon eucalyptus is the trade name for a repellent that originated as an extract of the eucalyptus tree, which is native to Australia. Because the dangers to children have not been thoroughly investigated, products with oil of lemon eucalyptus or PMD have warning labels that say, "Don't use on children under the age of 3."
