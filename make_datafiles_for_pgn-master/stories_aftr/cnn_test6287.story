(CNN) -- He may have fallen at the first hurdle at the All England Club last year, but Rafael Nadal managed to avoid another shock first-round defeat 12 months on.

The Spaniard crashed out to Steve Darcis in 2013 -- his first ever opening-round loss at a grand slam -- yet was able to see off Slovakia's Martin Klizan 4-6 6-3 6-3 6-3 this time around, despite an early scare on Centre Court.

That early sting, however, seemed to awaken Nadal from his slumber as the tournament's second seed began to find his rhythm and went on to claim three straight sets to wrap up the victory.

"For me, always emotions are so high when I'm able to play on this Centre Court," Nadal told reporters afterwards.

The win for Nadal, who is now just three Grand Slam titles off Roger Federer's record haul of 17 after his latest success at Roland Garros, sets up a second-round tie against Lukas Rosol.

Nadal will need no reminding that the Czech player dumped him out of the tournament at the same stage two years ago.

"The important thing is to fight, play with the right tactic and wait for the luck."

The Australian Open champion looked comfortable as he saw off his Portuguese opponent in straight sets with a 6-3 6-4 6-3 win and will next face Yen-Hsun Lu.

Needing to claim just a game to advance to the second round with the scores at 6-1 3-6 3-6 6-2, the 14th seed racked up four straight points off his serve to win the final set 6-4.

After losing the first set, the 15th seed hit back and was eventually taken into a decider by Devvarman, to which he held his nerve to run out a 4-6 6-3 6-3 3-6 6-3 winner. Former champion Hewitt advanced after defeating Michal Przysiezny 6-2 6-7 6-1 6-4.

Japan's Kei Nishikori overcame his first hurdle of the competition in Kenny De Schepper of France with a straight-sets victory.

The 10th seed was made to work, however, and had to edge a tiebreak 7-5 in the second set en route to a 6-4 7-6 7-5 win. His reward is a second-round tie against American Denis Kudla.

The women's competition also resumed Tuesday as Maria Sharapova, fresh from success at the French Open earlier this month, took just 58 minutes to book her place in the second round.

The fifth seed dropped just one game as she saw off Samantha Murray of Great Britain 6-1 6-0 to set up a tie against Timea Bacsinszky for a place in round three.

"I love playing at Wimbledon. You dream of playing here when you're really young.

"To still be playing here is a great honor for me. Every time I step out on that court, it makes me want to keep coming back for years and years."

Agnieszka Radwanska was equally efficient in her dispensing of Andreea Mitu as she also dropped only three games on the way to a first-round win.

The fourth seed raced to a 6-2 6-1 defeat of Romanian Mitu to set up a second-round tie against Casey Dellacqua.

Radwanska's younger sister Urszula won't be taking any further part though after going down in straight sets 6-2 6-4 to ninth seed Angelique Kerber from Germany.

Caroline Wozniacki is also safely through to the next round after knocking out Shahar Peer.

The 16th seed, who has never made it past the fourth round of the competition, will meet Naomi Broady of Great Britain in the next stage after defeating Peer 6-3 6-0.

Despite losing the first set, Garcia fought back with a 2-6 7-6 7-5 win to set up a meet with Varvara Lepchenko next time out.
