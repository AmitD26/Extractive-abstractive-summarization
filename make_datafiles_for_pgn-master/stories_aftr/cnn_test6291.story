The group, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, known as ISIS, said Thursday's suicide blast in southern Beirut was the "first small payment" in a bigger push against the Lebanon-based Shiite militia Hezbollah.

The al Qaeda-affiliated group has been pushing for a fundamentalist Islamic state carved out of northern Syria, while Hezbollah fighters have been supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's brutal push to crush a rebellion there.

The residential Harek Hreik district, where the car bomb exploded Thursday, is known as a Hezbollah stronghold.

Regional turmoil

Majed Al-Majed, a Saudi national, was detained in the past few days by the Lebanese army. His group has claimed responsibility for bombings in Lebanon and elsewhere.

Beirut-based Middle East analyst Rami Khouri told CNN that the recent surge in violence in Lebanon was part of larger, regional turmoil.

"We are seeing the greatest proxy war of modern times playing itself out in Lebanon and Syria and Iraq, that have now become really one battlefield in which two great ideological camps are fighting to the death like gladiators," he said.

Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, was designated as a terrorist group by the United States in 1995.

CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.
