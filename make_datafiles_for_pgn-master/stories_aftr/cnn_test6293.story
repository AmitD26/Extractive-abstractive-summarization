NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A TV-size probe adorned with a painting of the Indian flag successfully rammed into the moon Friday evening as part of the country's first unmanned lunar mission, Indian space officials said.

The Moon Impact Probe detached from the unmanned lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 and made a hard landing on the lunar surface around 8:31 p.m. New Delhi time (10:01 a.m. ET), said the official, Srinivasa Murthy Satish.

Kumar said the probe transmitted sufficient signals to the mother craft before landing, but no more were expected after the impact.

Ramachandra Rao Guruprasad, a spokesman for the Indian Space Research Organization, said the probe was not meant to be retrieved.

"One of the objectives of this probe is to understand the moon for future soft landings," he said. He added that the Chandrayaan-1 was to transmit the data it recorded from the probe to the ISRO.

The Chandrayaan-1 -- Chandrayaan means "moon craft" in Sanskrit -- was successfully launched from southern India on October 22 and is now orbiting the moon. iReport.com: Feeling spacy?

The craft is carrying payloads from the United States, the European Union and Bulgaria. India plans to share the data from the mission with other programs, including NASA.
