She cleared that mark more than a century ago.

"You betcha," she told the station.

Stoehr, who lives in a retirement community and was born before her family had a telephone, car or electricity, has gotten more plugged in since striking up a friendship with a Verizon salesman.

He's helped her use FaceTime to video chat with friends on an iPad and has been teaching her to use email and Google search.

While Facebook might not provide turn-of-the-20th century age options, the network has publicly celebrated its oldest users in the past.

In 2012, then-101-year-old Florence Detlor got a tour of Facebook's headquarters and a meeting with Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. She was believed to be the oldest Facebook user at the time, though an older user was later identified.

According to her Facebook page, Stoehr now has 31 friends on the site and has activated Facebook Mobile.

She turns 114 on Wednesday and celebrated with a party at her retirement community on Sunday.
