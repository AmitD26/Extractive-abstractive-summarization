Bitten on the shoulder by Suarez during Tuesday's match against Uruguay, Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini labelled the four-month ban handed down to Suarez by football's global governing body FIFA as "excessive."

But FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke stood by the punishment handed out by the world governing body and told reporters that Suarez should seek professional help after his latest biting incident.

The president of the Uruguayan Football Association confirmed it will appeal against Suarez's ban as one of his personal sponsors announced it was terminating its contract with the player.

"888poker signed Luis Suarez following a fantastic season for which his achievements were widely recognized," said gambling website 888poker.com in a statement.

When playing with Dutch club Ajax in 2007 he was suspended for seven games for biting an opponent, while he was hit with a 10-match sanction for an identical offense while playing for Liverpool in April 2013.

Suarez also courted controversy in 2011, when he was handed an eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra.

Following previous indiscretions, Suarez has enjoyed the backing of his club Liverpool.

According to Spanish radio network Cadena COPE, Suarez's lawyer will meet with representatives of the English Premier League team in Barcelona.

Suarez has been heavily linked with a move away from Liverpool and, with the 27-year-old set to miss the first nine games of the Premier League season, it remains to be seen whether the Anfield team will continue to stand by its man.

Argentina great Diego Maradona has also come out in support of SuÃ¡rez, likening the ban to being "handcuffed" and "thrown in Guantanamo."

Beckenbauer ban lifted

Meanwhile, FIFA has lifted its ban on German legend Franz Beckenbauer for failing to cooperate with its investigation of alleged corruption in the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

Beckenbauer, a World Cup winner as a player and coach, was handed a 90-day suspension earlier this month, but it has now been revoked, the world governing body announced Friday.

Hoefl had confirmed on Twitter on June 18 that his client had since given detailed replies to the FIFA ethics committee probe, which is being headed by American lawyer Michael Garcia.

The 68-year-old Beckenbauer, who was a member of the FIFA executive committee which awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, will not be traveling to Brazil for the current competition, Hoefl also confirmed.
