New York (CNN) -- The head of a group that promotes Times Square said Friday that he will lobby the new mayor to regulate dozens of costumed characters who inhabit the popular tourist destination after the arrest on sex abuse charges of a man dressed as Woody from "Toy Story."

A 44-year-old man was charged Thursday with three counts of forcible touching and three counts of third-degree sex abuse, said Detective Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. The victims were two females, ages 21 and 22.

The alleged abuse occurred around 8 p.m. Thursday at Broadway and West 46th Street in the glowing Times Square district popularly known as the crossroads of the world.

"This is the latest in a long series of disturbing incidents that reinforce our belief that these costume characters must be licensed and regulated," said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes business development in the area. "We are looking forward to working with the new administration and City Council to come up with an equitable and effective regulatory solution."

Tompkins told CNN that his organization had recently been in touch with the administration of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg about taking steps to reign in the costumed characters but the ex-mayor's term ended before any action could be taken. He said he has made preliminary contact with office of Mayor Bill de Blasio about the issue.

De Blasio's office did not return calls seeking comment.

Times Square, once a seedy neighborhood overrun with crime and porn theaters, has undergone a major facelift in recent decade, profiting from the draw of Broadway shows and its bright lights. A Times Square Alliance survey estimates that during high tourist summer months between 60 and 70 people gather around Times Square dressed in costumes or performing.

Thursday night's sex abuse arrest was the latest bad news involving the popular Times Square characters.
