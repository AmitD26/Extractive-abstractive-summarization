(CNN)Share, and your gift will be multiplied.

"I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big," Broussard told CNN affiliate KGO.

She may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power.

But the power that multiplied Broussard's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor-recipient pairs. It works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level, according to California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco.

So high, that it is taking five surgeons, a covey of physician assistants, nurses and anesthesiologists, and more than 40 support staff to perform surgeries on 12 people. They are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients.

Here's how the super swap works, according to California Pacific Medical Center.

Say, your brother needs a kidney to save his life, or at least get off of dialysis, and you're willing to give him one of yours.

But then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him, and it's certain his body would reject it. Your brother can then get on a years-long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died.

Maybe that will work out -- or not, and time could run out for him.

So, you'd do a swap. That's called a paired donation.

That donor's kidney went to the next recipient, who was also paired with a donor, and so on. On Friday, the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been biding time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain.

Such long-chain transplanting is rare. It's been done before, California Pacific Medical Center said in a statement, but matching up the people in the chain has been laborious and taken a long time.

That changed when a computer programmer named David Jacobs received a kidney transplant. He had been waiting on a deceased donor list, when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger.

"When we did a five-way swap a few years ago, which was one of the largest, it took about three to four months. We did this in about three weeks," Jacobs said.

But this chain wouldn't have worked so quickly without Broussard's generosity -- or may not have worked at all.

And that's divine, Broussard's friend Shirley Williams wrote in a comment her on Broussard's Facebook page.

"You are a true angel my friend."
