Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- An 80-year-old Japanese man on Thursday became the oldest person to reach the top of Mt. Everest, officials said.

Yuichiro Miura reached the top of Everest Thursday morning with his physician son Gota, mountaineering official Gyanendra Shrestha said from the base of Everest.

Miura broke his hip in an accident two years ago, and he underwent heart surgery in January.

"I am still healthy and strong. I think I have a good chance to reach the summit of Everest," he said via phone earlier this month.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of the first expedition to reach the summit of Everest: Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay made it to the top of the mountain on May 29, 1953.

Earlier this month, a 27-year-old graphic designer has made history by becoming the first Saudi woman to conquer the mount.
