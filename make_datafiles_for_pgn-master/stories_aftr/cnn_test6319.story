(CNN) -- Filming for the next "Star Wars" movie will take a break next month to give Harrison Ford's broken leg time to heal, producers said Monday.

Two "young aspiring actors" will join the cast as the result of a search "high and low for young and undiscovered talent," the filmmakers also announced.

The two new faces Ford will see when he returns to the production are American actress Crystal Clarke and British actor Pip Andersen. They were chosen through an open casting call by Lucasfilm and Disney executives starting seven months ago, according to a statement.

"The Star Wars universe has always been about discovering and nurturing young talent and in casting Episode VII we wanted to remain absolutely faithful to this tradition," Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said in the announcement. "We are delighted that so many travelled to see us at the open casting calls and that we have been able to make Crystal and Pip a part of the film."

Her professional acting resume is short. Clarke's first feature film role will not hit theaters until next year, when she acts opposite Pierce Brosnan and William Hurt in "The Moon and the Sun."

Pip Andersen's budding career is built on his skills as "a practitioner of parkour, a discipline that involves propelling oneself through any given environment with incredible grace and agility," the release said. He is best known for using his parkour skills in a Spider-Man ad for Sony, the producers said.
