(CNN)Charlottesville Police said Monday that investigators found no "substantive basis" to support a University of Virginia female student's story that she was raped at the Phi Kappa Psi house, an account that Rolling Stone published last November.

"Jackie" told the magazine that in late September 2012, she was assaulted at the house, the article said. Police Chief Tim  Longo noted that just because police found no evidence to support her account, "That doesn't mean that something terrible didn't happen to Jackie" on the day in question.

The Rolling Stone story generated controversy from the moment it came out, first sparking a debate about the prevalence of rape on college campuses throughout the country. But then the controversy turned toward the story's content when apparent contradictions and discrepancies in the article came to light.

Longo said Jackie did not give police a statement during their investigation.

"Sometimes they can't deal with the probing that occurs. They don't want to submit to a rape kit. They're embarrassed. They know that they will be scrutinized, quite frankly. So that in and of itself ... doesn't make this young woman a liar," she said.

Hostin pointed out that only about 2% of rapes that are reported are false, and only about 40% of rapes that occur are even reported: "So the suggestion that she just sort of made this entire thing up flies in the face of the statistics."

Nine out of 11 people at the fraternity house at the time the sexual assault allegedly occurred talked to police, Longo said. None of them said they knew about a rape, he said, and investigators further determined that it was unlikely a party even happened at the fraternity house on the day in question as was alleged in the Rolling Stone story.

The Rolling Stone reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, talked to police, authorities said, but there were some questions she declined to answer for journalistic reasons. It's unclear what those questions were.

In total, authorities spoke to 70 people as part of their investigation, and just two believed that Jackie was the victim of something, Capt. Gary Pleasants told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront."

"The two of them were fairly convinced that something had happened -- not the way it was described, the way it was written. But they thought, again, that something had probably occurred," he said.

The article also suggested the school failed to respond to the alleged assault.

Phi Kappa Psi released a statement Monday, saying the "discredited" story has done significant damage, while acknowledging the "importance of sexual assault issues on America's college campuses."

Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana later tweeted that "the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story."

Columbia University's review will be published in early April in the magazine.

Ryan Duffin added: "I've resigned myself to realize that I might never know what did or didn't happen."
