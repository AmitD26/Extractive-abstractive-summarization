Such behavior, experts say, would be rooted in normal childhood development; the children participating in or seeing such sexual acts may not fully understand what is taking place. Whether such alleged inappropriate acts will have a long-term impact on students depends on how the situation is handled, experts say.

"Young children are not developmentally prepared to engage in sex," said Kathryn Seifert, an expert in youth violence and sexual behavior. "Their brains are not ready to absorb that kind of information."

In a statement, First Lutheran officials said the incident referenced in the lawsuit happened in October and was "addressed and dealt with" at that time. The statement notes that the plaintiff was still enrolled in the church's preschool until last week.

Michael Weston, spokesman for the California Department of Social Services, told CNN the department met with officials from the church on February 1 concerning "noncompliance" license violations against the school over the past six months. The violations discussed included a lack of supervision at the care facility, child-teacher ratios and inappropriate discipline.

Weston said the department will continue to investigate after the school closes.

Questions remain, Seifert said, about what exactly happened at the school: Was this a group of unsupervised children just being curious about their bodies? Were they copying something they had seen on TV or in a magazine at home? Was it the result of sexual abuse -- either by another student or an adult?

Judith Myers-Walls, an expert in human developmental stages at Purdue University, said sexuality, in a sense, starts younger than you might think. Between the ages of 2 and 5, children learn to dress and undress themselves and begin to understand what it means to be a boy versus a girl. Many toddlers like to run around naked, Myers-Walls said, and may touch themselves.

"That is again, very normal. ... They're simply doing things that feel good, in the same way they might curl their hair," she said. "They don't (know) social norms. They haven't learned what's polite and impolite until parents teach them."

Children are excellent imitators, Myers-Walls said. Often the actions they're exhibiting have been copied from somewhere else.

The way parents deal with the alleged situation in California will affect how much of a long-term impact it may have on the children, Seifert said. Getting upset or angry may convey to a child that he is in trouble and lead to anxiety surrounding his sexuality down the road. Instead, asking questions calmly about what happened and why should clear up whether the child has been traumatized by events.

A professional therapist can help determine the extent of trauma and work with the family to recover, Seifert said. Even if the child doesn't know sexual activity is wrong, it can still have lingering effects.

The best way to avoid these kinds of situations is to have ongoing conversations about sexual behaviors with your kids, Myers-Walls said. "It's important for parents to realize you don't have 'the talk' and you're done."

"(Sex) is very different than drugs and smoking -- you don't ever want them to do that," Myers-Walls said. "Being a sexual being is who we are."

There are warning signs that your child is participating in inappropriate behavior or is being abused, Seifert said. Every day, parents should be talking to their children about their day: what happened, who they hung out with, what they did. If topics come up the child should have no knowledge about, calmly ask more questions, she suggested.

Other signs include drastic changes in behavior, trouble sleeping, eating changes or anger issues, Seifert said.

"We want people to be aware so if they're in this situation they know what to do," she said. "Even if it is something that's unfortunate that's happened to your child, there is help out there."
