(CNN) -- Anything you can do, I can do better.

Both players, teammates at Barcelona, have lit up this World Cup with four goals in their opening three games.

"Messi is one heck of a player," Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi told reporters.

"You can't take that away from him. He's blessed. I think there are other players in the Argentina squad who are very strong, but Messi is from Jupiter.

"We gave too much respect to the Argentinians and did not play our game in the first half. We played a bit more aggressive in the second half. Congratulations to the Argentina team, I wish them all the best in the tournament."

Surely that myth will be extinguished should Messi lead his country to its first World Cup triumph since 1986 -- and the signs are increasingly encouraging.

He has now scored 42 goals in 88 international appearances while playing with an energy which suggests he may have been saving his best for last following a relatively poor season at Barcelona, which was interrupted by injury.

His last-gasp goal which secured a 1-0 win over a valiant Iran was a moment of magic which will long be remembered.

Unlike on Saturday against Iran, Messi required just three minutes to unpick the Nigerian defense in Porto Alegre.

Nigeria, which hadn't conceded a goal in its previous two games, could scarcely have reacted better.

A draw would have been enough to take Nigeria through to the next stage for the first time since 1998 but the Africans struggled to contain a rampant looking Argentina.

Di Maria, a star of Real Madrid's European Champions League triumph, unleashed a fierce 30-yard drive which Vincent Enyeama, the Nigeria goalkeeper, did well to turn behind.

But with the first half drawing to a close, he was beaten again as Messi curled home an exquisite effort from 20 yards with his wand-like left-foot.

But Stephen Keshi's men appeared reinvigorated after the break and Musa broke through the Argentina defense to level within two minutes of the restart.

But any thoughts that this would finally be its day were soon extinguished when Marcos Rojo bundled in Messi's corner just three minutes later.

As Messi walked off to a standing ovation and an almighty roar from the thousands wearing blue and white packed inside the stadium, the game appeared to meander somewhat.

There was still time for Musa to threaten a hat-trick while Messi's replacement, Ricky Alvarez, should have done better with a headed chance late on.

But with the news of Iran's demise filtering through from Salvador, Nigeria appeared aware of its qualification and a showdown with France in Brasilia on Monday.

Iran, which fought so valiantly during the 1-0 defeat by Argentina last Saturday, required a victory to progress for the first time in its history, combined with a Nigerian defeat.

But it was frustrated in its attempt by a Bosnia team, which despite already being unable to qualify for the knockout phase, appeared determined to go out of its first World Cup in style.

But there was little sign of a hangover and Edin Dzeko, the man whose effort was ruled out, finally gained the goal he so badly craved when he drove home from 20 yards.

But with Iran pushing forward for an equalizer, Avdija Vrsajevic rounded off a rapid move by firing in off the post to secure his country's historic first World Cup victory
