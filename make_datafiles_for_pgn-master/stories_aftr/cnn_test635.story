Teammate Viktor Troicki had been due to play in the doubles rubber alongside Nenad Zimonjic, but a draining five-set singles match with Croatian teen starlet Borna Coric on Friday convinced Serbia coach Bogdan Obradovic to draft in the fresher Djokovic.

It was an inspired choice.

"We wanted to finish the job today, to take advantage of the fact that we won the first singles and that was done," Djokovic said in quotes carried by the AFP news agency after the match.

He was cheered on by a packed and passionate home crowd at the Kraljevo Sports Center.

Serbia has won the Davis Cup once before, in 2010 when it defeated Croatia on the way to the final.

France marches on

The Bryan brothers fought back to secure doubles victory for the U.S. over Great Britain in Glasgow, reducing the 2-0 deficit built up by singles victories from Andy Murray and James Ward Friday.
