Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai police are monitoring departures from a popular resort island after the battered bodies of a British man and woman were found on a beach.

The deaths on the small southern island of Koh Tao are being investigated as murders. The victims were discovered early Monday partially undressed with severe injuries to their heads, and a hoe with blood on it was found near the bodies, police said.

The two Britons, both in their early 20s, were last seen hanging out with friends at a bar in the early hours of Monday before leaving together, said Maj. Gen. Kiatthipong Khaosumarng, the provincial police chief.

A regional police official had earlier told CNN that people had been prevented from leaving Koh Tao, but Prachum said that wasn't the case.

Victims may have met recently

Police said that interviews with friends of the victims indicated that the two Britons may have only recently met while on the nearby larger island of Koh Phangan before traveling to Koh Tao for a party excursion.

The British Consul arrived in Koh Tao on Tuesday, the British Embassy in Bangkok said.

While the victims' names have been widely reported, the Embassy wouldn't tell CNN if their families have been notified yet.

CNN's Kocha Olarn reported from Bangkok, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.
