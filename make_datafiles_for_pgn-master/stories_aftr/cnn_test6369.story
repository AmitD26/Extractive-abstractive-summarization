(CNN) -- While a 5-year-old victim of an alleged rape recovers in a New Delhi hospital, India's prime minister admits that his country has "vast improvements to make" when it comes to "the safety, security and status of women in our society," and protesters are taking to the streets of the Indian capital.

The little girl is stable, conscious and alert, her doctor, D.K. Sharma, said Sunday.

Indian police say the suspect abducted the 5-year-old last Sunday, locked her in his house and brutally raped her repeatedly before she was found semiconscious Wednesday on the ground floor of her building.

The assault came just four months after a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was gang raped in a moving bus, triggering seething protests in India. She later died at a Singapore hospital.

Criticized for what was seen as a slow response to the savage December attack, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was quick to issue a statement this time, calling the act "shameful."

Sunday, in a follow-up statement, Singh said, "The gruesome assault on a little girl a few days back reminds us once again of the need to work collectively to root out this sort of depravity from our society."

Outside the prime minister's residence Sunday, nonviolent demonstrators conducted a sit-in. Video from CNN affiliate CNN-IBN showed police removing the protesters.
