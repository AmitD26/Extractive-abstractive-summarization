Obama, who hosted the workshops and luncheon, emphasized the importance of education in getting ahead.

"I know that many of you are hoping to one day pursue a career in fashion, and that's why we invited you here today, because we want you to really understand what it's going to take to be successful," Obama said. "We want you to see firsthand that a solid education and the willingness to work hard is really at the core of what it's going to take to achieve your goals: education and hard work. It's that simple."

Von Furstenberg, who designed the famous wrap dress, echoed that message and told the participants how she made her dreams come true.

The first lady also talked about the example of an unlikely fashion icon: Sara Blakely.

They also heard from a panel that included several top designers like von Furstenberg, Jenna Lyons of J. Crew, and Wu, all whose creations have been worn by Obama.

Wu, who designed the first lady's dresses for both her husband's inaugurations, told the audience about growing up in Taiwan and feeling like he was different when he chose designing clothes over playing sports.

Obama assured the fashionistas that hard work and perseverance are essential to succeed.

"I want those stories to show you that there's no magic to being successful in fashion or in anything else. What is required is a willingness to work long nights, to suffer through rejection and failure, to rise above all of that, all the doubts and fears and anxieties, whether you come from, you know, the city, the suburbs, no matter where you come from, all those feelings are natural," Obama said.
