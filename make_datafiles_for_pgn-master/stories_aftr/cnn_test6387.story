The long, redundant process is extremely error-prone, says Subha Madhavan, director of biomedical informatics at Georgetown. Handwriting often makes answers illegible. Questions get skipped. Even inputting data into the hospital's computer system can lead to mistakes.

The app uses colorful graphics and interactive features to reduce literacy barriers and move patients through the questionnaire. For instance, it asks you to slide a button along the bottom of a birthday cake to determine your age, or to rate your pain on a scale of happy green to angry red.

The app is also intuitive, skipping questions about your mother's breast health if you say you have no family history of cancer. Along the way, Tonic provides pop-up educational boxes for patients who are unfamiliar with certain medical terms.

"Why is that important? The more we know about somebody, the better we can treat them at a lower cost," he says.

The app also offers doctors a real-time risk assessment. When patients submit their questionnaires, the data go straight to doctors' tablets. For example, using information on a patient's family history, daily nutrition and exercise habits, the app can determine his or her risk for heart disease. If it's high, the app flags that for the doctor.

"You might be there for a cough, but the doctor says, 'Let's talk about this,' " Lanier says. "We're helping people not get lost in the shuffle."

Digital health for kids, seniors and workout buffs

Patients are "universally enthusiastic" about using Tonic, says Dr. Eric Esrailian, vice chief for the digestive diseases and gastroenterology department at UCLA. UCLA began using the app last year.

Doctors in his department are also happier because they're getting completed surveys with accurate information, Esrailian says. "We can spend more time actually talking to the patient and focusing on health care," he says.

Moving forward, Esrailian says he would like to see patient intake information integrated with electronic health care records. These records should be interactive, he says, so clinicians could schedule tests or consult on other doctors' patients.

Lanier says Tonic is fully compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, but the discussion needs to be ongoing as the medical industry moves more toward mobile health.
