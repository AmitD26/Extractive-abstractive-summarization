Rossi took the lead early from pole sitter and Honda teammate Jorge Lorenzo but was being chased by Marc Marquez when the dominant title leader went down on the Rio corner on the 10th lap.

Marquez was able to restart his Yamaha but his chances of victory were over and and he finished 15th.

Rossi, whose last win came at Assen in 2013, went on to claim the San Marino GP with Lorenzo and Marquez's teammate Dani Pedrosa completing the podium.

Rossi's home town of Tavullia is a few kilometers from Misano and his win was greeted with delight by his supporters.

Marquez said he was pleased to be able to recover after his tumble. "I saw the possibility of fighting with Valentino for the victory, but that was not possible in the end because of the mistake, I was riding over the inside of the rumble strip and that meant that I lost the front," he said.

Pedrosa was taking his ninth podium of the season, edging out another home hope, Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso.

Andrea Iannone (Pramac Racing) impressed in fifth place ahead of the Monster Yamaha Tech3 pair of Pol Espargaro and Bradley Smith.
