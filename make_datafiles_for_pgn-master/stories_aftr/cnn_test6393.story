(CNN) -- While tinkering in his garage, French electrician Andre Cassagnes dreamed up a drawing toy that kids could shake up and start over.

Little did he know that more than 50 years later, the toy that became the Etch A Sketch would continue to delight children.

Cassagnes created what would become the Etch A Sketch in his garage in 1950. The drawing toy was made up of a joystick, glass and aluminum powder.

Fascinated by the invention, American Henry Winzeler, founder and president of The Ohio Art Company, licensed L'Ecran Magique for $25,000 and introduced it as Etch A Sketch in the United States in 1960.

Winzeler connected Cassagnes with Jerry Burger, an engineer at the company, so they could collaborate to improve the toy's drawing capability.

It quickly became the most popular selling toy during the Christmas season that year, according to the manufacturer. Since then, the company has sold more than 150 million of them.

The toy was thrust into the political spotlight during last year during a highly publicized gaffe by Mitt Romney's senior campaign adviser, who compared his candidate's positions to an Etch A Sketch.

"I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes," the aide said. "It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again.""

The toy's "magic screen" was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 1998, and it was added by the Toy Industry Association to its "Century of Toys" list in 2003.

He is survived by his wife, Renee.

Readers react

The news of the death prompted many to go to their basements and dig out their decades-old Etch A Sketch.

CNN reader Lawrence Garcia said it was a toy "I could always get lost in."

Jane Labowitch, a 21-year-old art student in Chicago, said she has played with an Etch A Sketch since she was 4 years old.

"I love doing all kinds of art, but there is something really unique to Etch A Sketch," she said. "It's one of those timeless toys that everyone seems to have some sort of nostalgic connection to."
