In all, seven people were killed, including the gunman who fired into crowds while driving his black BMW.

UCSB is renowned as a school on the beach, and as such, it's one of the most scenic campuses in America, caressed by cool Pacific breezes.

Just 100 miles from Los Angeles, Santa Barbara attracts weekend crowds seeking a getaway. Its main street features boutiques and eateries in stylish Spanish-mission architecture.

Isla Vista is the adjacent residential quarter for students mostly enrolled in UCSB and others at Santa Barbara City College. The community sits on beachfront bluffs just west of UCSB and offers off-campus apartments where students commonly double up in one bedroom.

Officially, Isla Vista is an unincorporated community of 20,000 people -- 13,000 of them are students -- in Santa Barbara County, the county says.

The streets prove the student presence: they're lined with bicycles.

Friday night's mass shooting occurred on an weekend evening when Isla Vista is typically jammed with students moving shoulder-to-shoulder from one party to another.

On Saturday morning, however, the community was a massive crime scene.

Pizzerias, delis, cafes and convenience stores downtown were lined with yellow police tapes zigzagging everywhere -- because the drive-by gunman apparently fired upon several places while in motion.

2001 mass killing

As grisly as it was, the setting wasn't the first time that Isla Vista has known a mass killing, especially by a motorist.

In 2001, David Attias, son of film director Daniel Attias, ran over five people in Isla Vista, killing four of them, and exclaimed he was the "angel of death."

Sounded like fireworks

Summer Young said she was walking down the street and heard what sounded like fireworks set off by students. "People get stupid out here sometimes," she said.

But the pops were gunfire, and the car passed her, she learned.

Another witness, Cayla Bergman, a UCSB student, also described the bangs as fireworks. "We're used to loud noises around here," she said.

But then the crowds went into a panic.

"A bunch of people from outside just started running into the store," Bergman said.

Sorority bloodshed

One woman appeared to be dead. Another was struggling and "just barely able to move her eyes." A third, wounded in the kidney and arm, was on the phone with her mother, telling her she probably wasn't going to make it and "how much she loved her," Sullivan said.

"It was a huge shock last night," Sullivan told CNN in an interview on the sorority lawn, reconstructing events. "I really wasn't able to sleep at all. It was heartbreaking, that something would happen in our community like this."

Nikolaus Becker, a graduating high school senior who was visiting Isla Vista, was eating a burger in a restaurant when he and friends heard pops, thinking they were fireworks. Other students were doing homework inside the eatery.

"We were actually joking around about it," he said of the popping. "People were riding their bikes around outside, and parties were still going on."

Then Becker and friends heard two more sets of bangs -- with police running. They also saw a speeding car -- moving at 50 mph, screeching around a corner.

"Nobody knew what was going on, and everybody was kind of scared to go outside," Becker said.

When he finally went outside a half hour later, Becker saw body bags on the street.

Colleges ache

Both colleges expressed sympathies Saturday. They are now coordinating counseling and student support services.

Who's the man behind the rampage?
