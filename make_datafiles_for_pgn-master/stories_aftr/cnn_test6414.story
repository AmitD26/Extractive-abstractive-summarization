Now, for the first time, writings, photographs and items from the arduous Terra Nova expedition, which lasted from 1910 to 1913, have been brought together for public display.

"It's a story of immense heroism," said curator Kay Smith at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, where the exhibition is taking place.

It also includes pictures taken by photographer Herbert Ponting, showing scenes of ice caves, frolicking penguins and the men relaxing at their camp, Cape Evans, in preparation for the assault ahead.

"He was one of the finest photographers of the 20th century," said Smith of Ponting.

"Scott realized that expeditions like this, just like today, run at a loss, so he realized that once he got to the South Pole and back, he would have to give lecture tours, and would need photographic records," she continued.

Also included in the exhibition are items from the company's midwinter's day festivities in June 1911, which they celebrated in lieu of Christmas with a big meal and a "tree" they decorated with little flags.

"It's a once-in-a-hundred-year opportunity to read this material and actually see the handwriting," said archivist at the institute, Naomi Boneham.

"A lot of it has been quoted, but actually seeing the handwriting and seeing how shaky their hands were from when the weather was so extreme, is slightly different from seeing a typed page," she continued.

The final, tortuous journey to the South Pole is also brought to life through the writings and photographs on display.

But the farewell letters from the last three men standing -- Scott, Dr. Edward Adrian Wilson and Henry Robertson (Birdie) Bowers-- are written in the knowledge that they were dying and are, said Boneham, "very personal."

Heart-rending photographs of the team finding rival Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen's tent already at the South Pole complement the written details of their arduous journey there -- and cast a shadow on their harrowing and ill-fated journey back.

It is through their writing that we now know the story of Captain Lawrence Oates, one of the five men to reach the Pole, who suffered horribly from injury and frostbite on the way back and walked out into a blizzard in order to save his companions.

Scott, Wilson and Bowers died of starvation and exposure in their tent in late March 1912. Months later, a search party found them, along with their last letters and journals.

Smith believes people remain fascinated by this tale of endurance because it involves extremes: Of temperature, of effort and of emotion.

But, she said, "The story is actually much better than fiction. It's a tremendously heroic story, and it's real."
