Gary, Indiana (CNN) -- The man accused in a string of killings in Indiana appeared in court for the first time Wednesday but was held in contempt after he refused to answer the judge's questions, forcing the hearing to be rescheduled for next week, CNN's Poppy Harlow reported.

Vann, 43, was expected to have an initial hearing on Wednesday related to Hardy's case but instead Magistrate Judge Kathleen Sullivan postponed the hearing until October 29 after Vann refused to speak.

"You may want to explain to your client he stays in jail for the rest of his life until this hearing takes place," Sullivan told Vann's defense attorney, Matthew Fech.

Sullivan granted Fech's request that prosecutors and investigators must request Fech's permission before they interview Vann again.

Sullivan also upheld a gag order requested by the defense.

The hearing was held at the Lake County jail in Crown Point.

Investigators are looking into whether there are any other victims, and they're canvassing abandoned properties in Gary, Indiana.

Even without admissions of more killings, authorities are not taking any chances.

One young woman, Tatianna Foster, said she doesn't leave home after 8 p.m. "because it's so dark out here, they call it 'Scary Gary.'"

"I've got seven kids, two sets of twins," Williams said. "I can't take that chance."

'Low-risk' sex offender after aggravated sexual assault

That's where, in December 2007, he repeatedly struck, choked and raped a 25-year-old Hispanic female, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark.

Vann was later convicted of aggravated sexual assault, a first-degree felony. He served five years in prison, from 2008 to July 2013.

After registering as a "low-risk" sex offender in Texas, Vann told prison officials that he would be moving more than 1,000 miles northeast to Indiana, Clark said.

He did register as a sex offender in Lake County.

Buncich said his department checked on Vann twice last year.

That 2007 incident wasn't Vann's only brush with the law.

Records also show he was arrested on unspecified charges while living in Cherry Point, North Carolina, in 1993.

Edward Matlock, whose mother married Vann in the 1990s, described him as "a nutcase who I'd never allow near my kids or in my house." Matlock said Vann and his mother divorced after 16 years.

"He was just a strange guy," said Matlock.

Coroner seeks help identifying 2 bodies

But McKinley, the Gary Police chief, told reporters Tuesday that his department will file charges in "the next couple of days" against Vann in the deaths of 28-year-old Teaira Batey and 36-year-old Kristine Williams.

"That's going to be the hardest part about it," he told WLS. "Because he loved his mama, and she loved him. It's devastating."

The other three bodies are known only as Jane Doe 3, Jane Doe 5 and Jane Doe 6.

The Lake County Coroner asked for the public's help Wednesday in identifying two of the women.

Jane Doe 3 was wearing a pair of jeans -- the brand is twentyone black by rue 21, size 3/4 -- and white Nike shoes size 6. She had shoulder length blond and rust-colored hair.

"We may have a possible lead. We will be conducting DNA analysis with her possible family through the Indiana State Police. As well as all the victims that we have identified, to be able to make a positive identification," said Lake County Coroner Merrilee D. Frey

Jane Doe 6 was African-American.

Frey said it is possible there are other cold cases tied to Vann.
