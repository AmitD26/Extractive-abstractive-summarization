Now the teacher is on administrative leave. The student has been suspended. The video has gone viral, with hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. And there are now copies floating around.

The eight-minute video gives a glimpse of a lesson that students at the science and technology high school in Mexico's Tamaulipas state aren't likely to forget.

For several minutes, Hernandez asks one student to stand up read a statement about social media out loud, then peppers her with questions about how harmful it can be and how people can be prosecuted for what they've posted.

The student mentions possible problems with cyberbullying.

"And the destruction of the image of another person?" Hernandez asks.

The student nods vigorously.

A long, tense silence follows. The student then admits being the author of the tweet, saying that she was "upset."

Growing visibly emotional, Hernandez tells the student that she's also "very upset." She then points to several other students recording the incident on cell phone cameras and tablets and demands an apology.

"My family saw it (the tweet) and now you're going to apologize in front of these cameras," Hernandez says.

An official at the CBTis 103 science and technology high school told CNN that Hernandez has been temporarily taken out of the classroom while the August incident is investigated.

Debate has surged on social media over the video, with some praising the teacher and others criticizing her for humiliating the student.

The school official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that "most of the teacher's colleagues are siding with her."

"It may take up to four months to make a final determination on whether the teacher is fired or not," she said.
