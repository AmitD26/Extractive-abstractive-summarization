Missing for 237 days now, Flight 370 carried 239 people, including 12 crew members. Malaysia, Australia and China are conducting a deep-sea search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, where authorities say they believe it ended up.

In the suit, the claimants say the airline breached the agreement with their father for a safe passage when it failed to land in Beijing.

Two Iranians with forged Italian and Austrian passports were on the flight, according to authorities.

Against the air force chief, the claimants allege that the Malaysian air force failed or neglected to investigate an unscheduled flight, presumed to be MH370, after detecting it.

The government of Malaysia was named, as it is the employer and principal of the agencies named in the lawsuit.

Civil aviation director Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said he found out about the lawsuit from news websites.

The claimants are suing for loss of support from their father, who operated an Internet-based business.
