(Travel + Leisure) -- I'm not an early riser. I have a rule against stepping outside my Paris apartment without first indulging in my café au lait.

Others have gone on a quest for the perfect croissant, but always landed on swanky Left Bank addresses. I thought it was time to give the Right Bank its due, now that a new generation of young bakers have set up their ovens.

An equally obsessed friend sent me to a busy corner of Rue Paul Bert for La Pâtisserie by Cyril Lignac, whose owner is a spirited presence on French television. Here, the horseshoe-shaped croissants were lined up right next to the register. I ripped off one crisp end and let the wisps of warm, yeasted puff pastry melt in my mouth.

Never one to shy away from being thorough, I made a beeline for Du Pain et des Idées, in the scenic Canal St.-Martin neighborhood. Christophe Vasseur's rustic breads are among the best in Paris, and I was curious to see how his artisanal croissant stacked up.

This specimen was more substantial than the others, with a sturdy crust and hearty interior—too dense for my Proustian ideal. But I couldn't resist a crusty loaf of my favorite pain aux céréales for later.

When I arrived in the charming Square Trousseau, I was worried I wouldn't have room for the hefty croissant at Pâtisserie Boulangerie Blé Sucré. One look at its crackly glazed crust, one bite into the tender interior, and I was enchanted.
