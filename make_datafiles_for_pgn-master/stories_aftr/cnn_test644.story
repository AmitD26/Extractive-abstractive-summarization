(CNN)It was all set for a fairytale ending for record breaking jockey AP McCoy. In the end it was a different but familiar name who won the Grand National on Saturday.

25-1 outsider Many Clouds, who had shown little form going into the race, won by a length and a half, ridden by jockey Leighton Aspell.

"It feels wonderful, I asked big questions," Aspell said of Many Clouds, moments after his victory.

Last week the 40-year-old Ulsterman, who has won an astonishing 4,356 races, announced he would retire if he won the Grand National for the second time in his career.

He was well placed going into the final straight but just couldn't keep up after Many Clouds cut lose, and finished back in fifth.

Third time winner

But for Trevor Hemmings, the owner of Many Clouds, it was his third victory in the Grand National.

"I always dreamed of winning my first National," a shocked Hemmings told Channel 4.

"Then along comes a second. That's special. And when a third comes along, it's such a wonderful, wonderful feeling."

"This morning talking we talked about the achievers," said Hemmings.

"They are quiet, confident and experienced. He has all of them."
