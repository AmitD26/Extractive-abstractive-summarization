(CNN) -- Attention minions of Colonel Meow:

... thank you for your kind attention. This moment has been duly noted on your timecards and will be deducted from your pay.

Yes, The Colonel is dead.

And the Internet mourns the passing of a truly magnificent animal.

An animal who struck fear into the hearts of lesser beings. An animal who became an icon. An animal who routinely pooped in his own fur.

Though the ever-scowling Colonel Meow may not have been quite as world-famous and instantly recognizable as Grumpy Cat, he was definitely first. And definitely the greatest.

To the Internet world he was an "adorable fearsome dictator" whose toothy anger-face ruled over all mankind.

Eventually rescued from the mean streets, he was taken in by the Seattle Himalayan and Persian Society, and later adopted at Petco by a loving human named Anna Marie Avey.

Who soon became known simply as "Slave Beast."

Colonel Meow's true rise to power began when Avey and her husband, Eric Rosario, began posting images of him on Instagram. Almost immediately, he was a star, and The Colonel commanded allegiance from a growing number of faithful admirers.

He holds the Guinness World Record for "cat with the longest fur."

In fact, three independent vets measured and confirmed his coat, which averaged out to 22.89 centimeters.

Now, not only was he the world's angriest cat, he was also the fluffiest. So fluffy you could die.

Which, if those were his wishes, you most certainly would.

He was scared of the things he coughed up. He liked to be held. And he enjoyed having his butt scratched.

And, somewhat surprisingly, he also had an unexpected best friend named Boots -- a golden retriever he lovingly described on Facebook as "stupid."

But, mostly, Colonel Meow was fearsome. And powerful. And for a brief, incredible moment in time, it was truly The Colonel's world.

Grumpy Cat responded to the news on Twitter: Rest in peace @colonel_meow. A grumpy day indeed. #RIPColonelMeow

Another Internet-famous cat, Lil Bub, also expressed her condolences: Dear @colonel_meow -- You are without question the most regal feline I have ever known. See you in space dear friend.

And space is exactly where Colonel Meow now looks down upon his minions, a proud and regal cat floating through eternity.
