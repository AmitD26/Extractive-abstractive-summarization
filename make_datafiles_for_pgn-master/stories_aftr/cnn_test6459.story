Now 19, she is telling her story publicly for the very first time.

It was not the first time the boy had propositioned her, said Jaden, who was enrolled in the school's special education program.

Usually, she just ignored him. But, on that day, Jaden told a friend, who suggested she tell a teacher's aide about what was happening.

That aide, June Ann Simpson, knew of other girls who the boy had tried to lure into a bathroom for sex, according to a 2010 federal lawsuit filed by Jaden's father against Madison County Schools and officials.

According to a 2012 deposition, Blair told Simpson the boy would have to be proven guilty to be punished. In response, Simpson crafted a plan to prove the allegations, using Jaden as bait.

The idea was to have the girl agree to meet the boy in a bathroom. Simpson would watch surveillance video, and teachers would intervene before anything happened.

"I told her no. I didn't want to do it," Jaden told CNN. She acquiesced later that day.

"I just wanted it to stop," Jaden said about the alleged harassment.

Key questions in her case center around who knew what and when.

According to Jaden's written statement after the incident, the boy made a last-minute change.

Instead of meeting in the boys' bathroom on the special needs students' corridor, the boy allegedly told the girl to meet him in the sixth grade boys' bathroom, in another part of the school.

Once there, Jaden says she tried to stall the boy, hoping a teacher would rush in. She told him she didn't want to have sex, and she tried blocking him, according to her 2012 deposition. Nothing worked. Jaden says the boy sodomized her.

"I thought they were going to do what they said they were going to do -- and be there and stop him -- just get him in trouble," Jaden told CNN.

The incident was characterized as "inappropriate (sic) touching a girl in boys bathroom" according to school disciplinary records. The boy was suspended from school for five days and sent to an alternative school for a short time.

The alleged attack was at least the 13th incident of sexual or violent misconduct in the boy's file, all within two academic years. While at the alternative school, the boy was suspended for sharing pornographic images on a cell phone.

"He just gets away with it, I guess," she told CNN.

June Ann Simpson resigned shortly after the incident.

"My client has gone from being a teacher's aide to being a scapegoat," Simpson's attorney, McGriff Belser III told CNN.

Both sides have appealed.

"(Judge T. Michael Putnam) found the board of education's policies were proper. He found that the school administrators took appropriate action and complied completely with federal law as soon as they were notified of this unfortunate incident," attorney Mark Boardman told reporters last month.

Boardman's firm represents Madison County Schools and the administrators named in the 2010 lawsuit.

The firm has not responded to CNN's numerous calls for an interview.

Also in September, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division submitted a 126-page strident amicus brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, disagreeing with the district judge's order.

The brief, submitted jointly with the U.S. Department of Education, argues the school, in its capacity as a recipient of federal funds is "liable for (its) deliberate indifference to known acts of peer sexual harassment."

"If Title IX imposes any responsibility on school officials to prevent sexual harassment, it surely requires a response when they learn, as here, that a 14-year-old special needs student is about to be used as bait to catch a 16-year-old student with an extensive history of sexual and violent misconduct," federal attorneys write in the brief.

Months after the incident, the teen transferred to a school district out of state, but eventually dropped out of school before graduating. Jaden says she continues to struggle.

"It's hard for me to have good days," she told CNN. "I have days to where I just want to sit there by myself. I get angry faster, and I get insecure."

"By actually having our day in court, and letting everything be known, so that it won't happen again," Jaden said.
