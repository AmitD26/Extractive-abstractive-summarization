(CNN) -- From the scorched corn fields of Kansas, to the storm-lashed hills of Nicaragua, an increasingly volatile climate is posing ever greater challenges for farmers around the world.

The Climate Corporation, founded by two ex-Google engineers, is dragging a famously technophobic industry into the digital era. Through exhaustive data modeling and an elite pool of climate and agriculture analysts, the Corporation is seeking to take guesswork out of the field.

"The increasing uncertainty in agriculture, with the changing patterns of weather we are seeing, is making it difficult for farmers to grow successful crops consistently," says CEO David Friedberg. "The tools we provide help farmers make smarter decisions based on analytical techniques, rather than intuition."

The Climate Corporation's model produces hyper-local climate forecasts for individual farms, using satellite imaging, growth modeling and simulations. This is supported by decades of data, much of it from government sources, covering crop performance, soil properties, moisture levels and weather.

The free "Basic" platform allows farmers to monitor their land and crops, while the "Climate Pro" platform includes a suite of features such as to optimize use of nitrogen fertilizer, control pests, and plan perfect harvests.

"Fertilizer is the number one expense for farmers and they are basically throwing away money," says Friedberg. "We can help farmers decide how much fertilizer to put in the field at what point in the season, reducing what goes into the atmosphere and waterways, so that 100% goes to plants to deliver food."

While Friedberg is a strict vegetarian and keen to support environmental protection, his priority is to convince farmers with an economic argument.

"I don't see collective action on climate change in agriculture. We need to create commercial incentives to change behavior, that's where we can be successful."

The company estimate they can make $20 billion in efficiency savings in the U.S. by applying their data models, and increase corn field yields by 30% an acre.

More with less

Its technology covers 50 million acres in the U.S., including a third of total land for corn and soybean, serving thousands of farmers. This figure is growing rapidly, and its platforms will be rolled out internationally from 2015.

Optimal performance

The opportunities for data in agriculture are also shown by Edyn, a Californian startup that emerged from one of the state's worst ever droughts.

With award-winning designer Yves Behar, Edyn produced a multi-faceted sensor that allows growers to micro-manage their plots, providing constant readings on moisture level, with a connected water valve that keeps the level optimal. It also gives readings of light, temperature, humidity and fertility so that even inexperienced users can sustain high performance yields.

Aramburu is confident about the integration of data, but believes the industry must change now to protect livelihoods and the environment.

"It's a question of when, not if," he says. "This is as big an opportunity as the Internet was, in one of the last big industries that has not adopted big data.

"I don't think there's a problem with people making money from climate change. My only concern is whether the technology would be expanded to farmers everywhere, whether they can afford it in places like the Sahara, otherwise the effects (of climate change) will continue to get worse."

With the right information, even the most extreme conditions can be profitable.
