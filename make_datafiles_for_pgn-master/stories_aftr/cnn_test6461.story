(CNN) -- Alarming findings related to women's safety have come to light with the release of a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey that looks at harassment on public transportation systems in the world's largest cities.

According to the new report, six in 10 women in major Latin American cities report they've been physically harassed while using transport systems, with Bogota, Colombia, found to have the most unsafe public transportation, followed by Mexico City and Lima, Peru.

At the other end of the safety spectrum, New York was rated as the best of the 16 cities studied followed by Tokyo, the world's largest capital with 38 million people, then Beijing and London.

1. Bogota, Colombia

5. Jakarta, Indonesia

6. Buenos Aires

9. Moscow

11. Paris

12. Seoul

13. London

15. Tokyo

16. New York

In total, 6,555 women and experts were surveyed.

Results are based on the respondents' answers as well as surveys of experts in women's rights, gender equality, urban planning and gender-friendly urban spaces in each of the cities.

The group says it did survey 10 experts in Cairo, the world's fifth largest capital, but those findings were not included in the overall ranking as YouGov could not carry out the public poll.

Had they been included, it would have put Cairo in the top five most dangerous transport systems, said the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

"When there is not frequent, reliable, accessible transport, this can affect women and anyone's ability to access opportunity and notably employment in urban areas, which can make a big difference for women in particular," she said.

Women-only cars a short-term fix, say experts

Tokyo's high standing may come as a surprise to those familiar with the highly publicized problems women have faced when riding Japanese subways, with widespread reports of groping consistently making headlines.

The Thompson Reuters Foundation said experts attributed Tokyo's second place ranking to a raft of measures taken in the city over recent years to combat such incidents in often overcrowded buses and trains.

These include the introduction of women-only trains in 2000, which are color-coded in pink, and transit police to enforce rules.

Women-only sections on public transport are now also found in Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Delhi, Cairo and Manila.

"The emerging interest in several countries on women-only initiatives should be seen as an opportunity for improving security in cities but not as a silver bullet for dealing with gender-based violence in transportation and urban settings," Babinard told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

"Women-only initiatives are not likely to provide long-term solutions as they only segregate by gender and provide a short-term remedy instead of addressing more fundamental issues."

Although experts remain critical of single-sex transport, most women favored the idea, according to the survey.
