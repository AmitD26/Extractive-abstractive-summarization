Bayern Munich has honored the remarkable life of its former president Kurt Landauer, who was hounded out of office 80 years ago by the Nazi regime and sent to a concentration camp.

During four terms as president of the German football club, Landauer is credited with establishing Bayern as an international force and nurturing the club's youth policy.

"This accolade is long overdue," said club president Uli Hoeness during a presentation to Landauer's nephew Uri Siegel, his only surviving relative.

Landauer was born into a Jewish family in 1884 and at the turn of the 20th Century was playing for Bayern Munich's youth team.

His football career was cut short when he left for Switzerland to train as a banker but when he returned to Munich he was soon elected as president of Bayern in 1913.

"The president, who favored investment in the team rather than the construction of a stadium demanded by a section of the membership, rates to this day as one of the founding fathers of the club's widely-admired youth policy," explained Bayern Munich's website.

Bayern also won their first domestic title under Landauer's tenure in 1932.

The Nazi authorities branded Bayern a "Jewish club" and the club lost team members and fans, and fell back in the national rankings.

Landauer resigned the presidency and in 1938 he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp.

However, his three brothers all died under the Nazi regime, while his sister Gabriele was deported and is still officially listed as missing.

Landauer returned to Munich in 1947 and resumed presidency of his beloved Bayern in 1947 to 1951. He died 10 years later at the age of 77.

The former youth player and four time club president has joined player Franz Beckenbauer -- star of the team which won three European Cupss in the mid-Seventies --  and former president Wilhelm Neudecker as Bayern's only honorary presidents.

"His efforts were pioneering during an extremely difficult time for FC Bayern," Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge recalled in 2009.

"Remembrance is a vital component in that."

In Britain, a former prisoner of war, Ron Jones, has also detailed his painful memories of football under the Nazi regime in a new memoir.
