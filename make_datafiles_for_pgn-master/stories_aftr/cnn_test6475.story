Washington (CNN)Election Night 2014 was more than a landslide win for congressional Republicans -- it was a historic moment for black Republicans in particular.

Come January, newly elected representatives Mia Love of Utah and Will Hurd from Texas along with Sen. Tim Scott -- who won election to the South Carolina Senate seat he had been appointed to -- will make up the largest number of black Republicans serving in a single Congress since Reconstruction.

A racial controversy over a speech a top a House Republican gave to white supremacists while a state politician in 2002, could make that work harder.

The Republican Party's focus so far has been more on biography than ideology -- finding black candidates who fit the conservative mold but have a compelling story that could appeal to blacks.

Mia Love, the Mormon former mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, first made a splash on the national stage as a speaker at the Republican National Convention in 2012. She stressed her background as a child of Haitian immigrants who arrived in America with $10 in their pocket and raised her with an ethos of self-reliance. Arriving on Capitol Hill for new members' orientation shortly after Election Day, Love stressed her desire to represent everyone, regardless of race or gender.

"All the issues that we face in this country, they're not black issues, they're not white issues, they're not gender-specific, they're people issues and I'm doing everything I can to get the decision making closest to people," she said as she made her way to the welcome reception.

Scott, who is the first black senator elected in the South since Reconstruction, has focused on issues like tax reform, expanding school choice and reigning in government spending.

But he has also addressed the historic nature of his election.

He added: "We have too many young people being trapped in poverty because other people are defining them with low expectations."

Black turnout for certain Republican candidates this year hit double-digits in Florida (12%), in Arkansas, South Carolina and Wisconsin (10%) and in Ohio, where Republican Gov. John Kasich won 26% of the black vote. It's news Republicans are applauding as a sign the party is making inroads with black voters, whose strong Democratic leanings are well documented.

Potential presidential hopeful Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, believes that the GOP could attract blacks in even bigger numbers.

"If Republicans have a clue and do this and go out and ask every African-American for their vote, I think we can transform an election in one cycle and that doesn't mean that we go to a majority of African American votes in one cycle but I think there's fully a third of the African American vote that is open to much of the message, because much of what Democrats have offered hasn't worked," Paul told Politico.

That's wishful thinking, analysts say. While the election of Love, Hurd and Scott is a good sign for Republicans as they try to broaden their base, it's important not to read too much into their wins, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.

"Obviously, he's dreaming," Sabato said, of Paul's goal of capturing one-third of the black vote. "I just don't think it's practical to spend a lot of time and money on the African-American vote because it's so heavily Democratic and so intensely Democratic. Look at the intensity of African-American support and it's very high."

In the last two presidential elections, more than 90% of black voters supported the Democrat, Barack Obama, who also happened to be black. But even in 1972, the most recent low-point in terms of black vote share, the white Democrat George McGovern got a whopping 82%.

One big problem is the perception that the Republican Party is not as open to minorities. A September analysis by David Wasserman, the U.S. House editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, found that in 1950, 98% of House Democrats and 97% of House Republicans were white men. By this year, 89% of House Republicans were white men. Just 47% of Democrats, by comparison, are white men.

"Here is what we see happening throughout the country, people are aligning their votes for values and voting for candidates who are not of their own complexion," Scott told CNN's Erin Burnett the day after the election.

Meanwhile, the Congressional Black Caucus, which is dominated by Democrats, is ready to accept the new class of black Republicans with open arms and say they could help improve bipartisanship.

"I've reached out to congratulate all of the newly elected African-American members of Congress on their win, including Representatives-elect Love and Hurd, and to invite them to join the Congressional Black Caucus," said CBC Chair Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio. "Government is most effective when both parties work together for the greater good of the country. I have no doubt that all of the new Members of the CBC will bring their own unique perspective and skills, further solidifying our strength as a caucus."

"I believe he should remain in leadership. There's one quality that he has that I think is very important in leadership, and that's humility. And he's actually shown that in this case," Love said on ABC's "This Week." "He's apologized, and I think that we need to move on and get the work of the American people done."

Still, CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Kevin Madden acknowledged the controversy could complicate the party's efforts to expand its appeal to minorities heading into 2016.

"It certainly presents challenges anytime you are a party like ours that has demographic challenges and is trying to overcome those demographic challenges," Madden said. "This will be an element in that conversation. What's important is that we address it head-on, and that we continue to promote an agenda that is going to attract more African-American voters, that's going to attract more Latino voters, that's going to attract more African-American candidates to run within our party."
