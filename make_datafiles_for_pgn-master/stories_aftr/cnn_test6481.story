Yet conditions weren't ideal, with seas at 9 feet and winds of 17.5 knots (20 mph). Sanchez's private boat was hit and flipped over by what Focha described as a "rogue wave" in Bodega Bay, about 60 miles north of San Francisco.

"The boat pitched, and they were all thrown from the boat," the spokeswoman said.

Responding authorities from the Coast Guard and Sheriff's Office found four people unresponsive in the water about 40 yards offshore.

One was pronounced dead there, while Coast Guard and Bodega Bay fire boats brought the three others to a nearby Coast Guard station. Once there, medical personnel performed CPR in the ambulance. None of the three -- Jessie Daniel Langley, 79; Samuel Garcia, 86; and David Costa, 60 -- survived.

As Focha explained, boats can't pull up to the rock, so a Sonoma County Sheriff's helicopter was brought in and a deputy at the end of a 100-foot line pulled Sanchez up to safety.

Dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, Sanchez was taken to a Santa Rosa hospital because he was "very cold" and for treatment of scrapes and abrasions, presumably from the sharp rocks, the Sheriff's Office said.

Authorities do not believe that alcohol or drugs played any part in the incident.

Focha said, "Life vests are what they are. It's so tragic."
