Marching, dancing and poster-waving environmentalists chanting "Hey, Obama. We don't want no climate drama," packed several blocks on and around Washington's National Mall on Sunday, hoping to spur President Barack Obama to take strong measures against climate change.

Allison Spitz, 16, brandished a sign reading "Oil and Water Don't Mix" as she attended her first political demonstration.

"Someday, I hope to have my own kids, and I want them to live in a world that's environmentally safe and natural," Spitz said, explaining why she, her mother and her boyfriend had traveled more than 500 miles from Plymouth, Michigan.

During Obama's State of the Union speech on Tuesday, the president urged Congress to do more to combat climate change.

"We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it's too late," the president said. "I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will."

Long-term climate change fueled by a buildup of atmospheric carbon emissions is a controversial notion politically, but it's one accepted as fact by most scientists. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, which traps heat, have gone up sharply in recent decades, while global average temperatures are up about 1.5 degrees F since records started being kept in the late 19th century, according to NASA.

The Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 pact aimed at reining in carbon emissions, aimed to limit that increase to 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) by 2100 --  but a November report by the World Bank warned that trends point more toward an increase twice that big by the end of the century.

Bitumen, otherwise known as tar sand, is oil-soaked dirt that needs to be cooked to extract the oil. A Congressional Research Service report released in June said oil produced from bitumen emits 14% to 20% more greenhouse gases -- the gases that can cause atmospheric hearting -- than the average transportation fuels sold or distributed in the United States.

At Sunday's rally, Maura Cowley of the Energy Action Coalition verbalized a common theme.

"Keystone XL is a dirty and dangerous pipeline. It's literally going to cut our country in half, carrying a very dangerous fuel, and it will cause runaway climate change," Cowley said. "Young people across the country are the same generation that elected Barack Obama twice now, and we really want to see him reject the Keystone XL pipeline."

The Obama administration rejected the initial proposal from the Canadian energy company TransCanada, saying it needed more time to gauge the potential environmental impact of the project. While that decision pleased environmentalists, pipeline supporters argued that the postponement cost Americans jobs and a degree of energy independence.

"The political calculus is obvious. If they come out against it, they are going to pay a very big price," Michaels said Sunday. "It's very popular around the country: the notion that you are going to be pumping more oil through this country, that there will be some jobs that will be established to put the pipeline in. There will be some jobs for maintenance, and, you know, if you want to talk about the internationalization, if you will, of oil supply, Canada is our biggest supplier and they're friendly.  What's not to like?"

Environmentalists say there's plenty not to like.

"It reminds me of the TransCanada pipeline that was supposed to cause all these problems and wreak all this havoc. It never did.  All it did was supply oil," Michaels said.

He posited that U.S. emissions from the energy sector are at their lowest level since 1992, despite -- not thanks to -- government intervention.

"That didn't happen because of subsidizing solar energy and windmills. There's just not a lot, not enough electricity coming from those minuscule rays. It happened because of natural gas, hydrofracturizing and horizontal drilling, which has increased the supply dramatically," he said.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration says increased use of natural gas has come at the expense of coal, which tends to emit significantly more carbon dioxide than natural gas.

But the crowds that braved temperatures in the low 30s and winds exceeding 20 mph to make their point heard in Washington couldn't disagree more.

The Sierra Club, the anti-climate change consortium 350.org, and the civil rights organization the Hip Hop Caucus put together the rally.
