Militants, army face off in Ukraine

1. What's going on in eastern Ukraine?

Eastern Ukraine is home to a large number of pro-Russia, Russian-speaking Ukrainians, and is where the play-out of tensions has been most visible.

A similar convoy of armored personnel carriers also entered the city of Slaviansk, some 100 miles from the border with Russia.

But there was little sign that the Ukrainian military presence was effective. In a village near Kramatorsk, pro-Russian militants surrounded the Ukrainian forces, took away their vehicles and forced them to surrender, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported. They were allowed to depart only after they disabled their weapons.

They want more say in how their affairs are handled. Ukraine is currently a unitary state, where Kiev makes the major decisions that affect the rest of the country, according to Nicolai N. Petro, a professor of political science at the University of Rhode Island specializing in Russian affairs.

"What folks in the east are asking for is greater autonomy, local self-government," he said. Were it to become enshrined in the constitution, that form of autonomy would become a new form of government --  federalism.

3. What do Russian officials want?

They say they want to protect the rights of ethnic Russians, but some observers say Putin is wistful for the days of the Soviet Union.

"It's just Russia trying to expand back into the borders of its old empire," said Roman Popadiuk, the first U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under George H.W. Bush, from 1992-1993. He is now a principal in Bingham Consulting LLC.

4. How did this all start?

When the Soviet satellite became independent in 1991, hopes were high that it would succeed, given its rich human and natural resources: vast tracts of arable land and stores of coal, iron ore and titanium, said Popadiuk.

At the time, the country was largely unified. "When Ukraine held its independence referendum, almost 91% voted for independence, including the majority of ethnic Russians in Ukraine, including Crimea," Popadiuk said.

But years of massive corruption and economic stagnation took a toll. The hopes for a better future deflated, only to be renewed late last year, when Ukraine began negotiating an association agreement with the European Union.

But when he reversed course, deciding instead to sign a deal with Russia, fed up Ukrainians took to the streets. They filled not only Maidan Square in the capital city of Kiev, but protested in western Ukraine and, though to a much lesser extent, in eastern Ukraine.

In February, after dozens of demonstrators had been killed, Yanukovych succumbed to the pressure, signing an agreement for a unity government.

But he then fled to Russia.

But Russia, coming off the success of the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, declared the new government illegal. "With the Sochi Games over, Putin had a clear opening to move into Crimea," Popadiuk said. "He sent instigators, got the people riled up, introduced troops without insignia, claiming that they were local militia, local citizens."

Russia has said the uprisings have been the work of pro-Russian Ukrainians.

In Crimea, where Russia's Black Sea Fleet is based, a referendum was held March 16.

Voters were able to choose to become more independent but stay within Ukraine, or to join Russia. The latter option prevailed by an overwhelming margin.

"He thought he would be able to foment a general uprising," Popadiuk said. "That did not happen; Ukrainians stayed quiet."

7. So then what happened?

Putin has been sending provocateurs and special forces masquerading as Ukrainians into the zone, Popadiuk said, citing news sources as well as sources he would not identify.

"He's basically manufactured an environment of instability," one that lends itself to rebellion, he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking Tuesday in Beijing, rejected as "nonsense" accusations that Russia is fomenting the unrest and supporting the militants.

Rather than allowing themselves to be baited by pro-Russian demonstrators, Ukrainian forces could simply isolate them, he said. "Let them sit there -- you could have a stand-down for weeks or months. Right now, the ones that are pushing the envelope are the Russians, not the Ukrainians."

9. And what if it does?

The drawbacks would be obvious, according to Popadiuk. "By creating a federalist structure you would create regions that are almost autonomous," he said, citing the educational system, trade practices and the use of language.

That relative autonomy could undermine the strength of the central government in Kiev "and is a step away from Russians being able to have a referendum along the lines of Crimea -- which could then lead to a breakaway," he added. "It's kind of like taking Ukraine one slice at a time."
