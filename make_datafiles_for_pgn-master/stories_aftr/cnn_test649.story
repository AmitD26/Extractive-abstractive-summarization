Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, of Nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a young girl.

"A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,'" he said.

Donohue said the mother recognized the suspect, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a former animal trainer.

The attorney said he knows who the baby sitter is, but would not release that information because of the ongoing investigation.

The mother of the girl asked that the news media leave the family alone.

Professionals have since evaluated her and she appears to be "healthy and fine and happy," the lawyer said.

Asked whether the mother is thankful to the news media for having published the girl's picture so that authorities were able to identify her, Donohue said, "Not really ... there's some things maybe you don't want to know."

Still, he said, he hopes the man in the tape is brought to justice.

"Speaking as a father myself, I wish the guy would dig a hole in the desert and put a gun in his mouth," he said, referring to such an outcome as "Wild-West justice."

Meanwhile, the intense manhunt for Stiles continued Tuesday.

Allen said she and Stiles were in an on-again, off-again relationship for 10 years until recently, when she called it off.

"He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be," Allen said.

"I'm disgusted. I'm ashamed, embarrassed, mortified," Allen said of the alleged rape. "I regret every, every step I ever took, I feel bad for the baby."

A man who said he found the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in Sunday to Nye County officials.

Darren Tuck, a Nevada resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography. E-mail to a friend
