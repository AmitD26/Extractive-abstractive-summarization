Widex, one of the globe's largest hearing aid companies, developed its first model in 1956. Back then, it came with its own battery pack and had to be strapped to the chest.

"The smallest are less than the size of the tip of a little finger," says Soren Westermann, the Widex CEO whose father co-founded the company nearly 60 years ago.

Back then, hearing aid technology had just made a great leap forward following the invention of the electric transistor in 1948.

Westermann recalls that when he was born, hearing aids had been hulking, impractical devices "that you wore on your back." But the energy efficiency and relatively small size of the transistor -- which is used to amplify electronic signals -- paved the way for the now familiar "behind the ear" style of hearing aid.

Widex are now the pioneers of a manufacturing process known as Computer Aided Manufacturing for Individual Shells for Hearing Aids or, less cumbersomely, CAMISHA.

The process takes advantage of recently developed 3D printing technology to create staggeringly precise molds of the ear canal.

But it's the second stage of production where things get smart. Standing in the Widex lab, Westermann demonstrates how the finely detailed mold is scanned through a 3D scanner taking millions of measurements to create what he calls a "3D point-cloud" representing exactly the inside of a patient's ear.

"The detail that we can reproduce is down to a hundredth of a millimeter," claims Westermann.

The precision and efficiency of the process has resulted in the world's smallest ever hearing aids. For Westermann, this is a significant development.

But the CAMISHA process offers more than discretion. Unlike previous models, which blocked large parts of the ear with big plastic shells, the so-called Invisible In-Canal (IIC) hearing aids allow for more sound to be collected naturally by the shape of the ear, and to flow down the ear canal as it would with unassisted hearing, improving the fidelity and range of sound.

The fact that the shell is modeled so exactly on the user's ear also prevents any noise from leaking out. According to Westermann, this was the cause of irritating "whistling" in previous models.

In addition to these technical improvements, the precision of the mold, says Westermann, means that it is substantially more comfortable.

Previous manufacturing methods, which Westermann describes as more like a form of manual sculpting, allowed for small discrepancies between the silicone mold and the hearing aid, causing potentially significant discomfort.

"The ear canal is actually extremely sensitive, so the tiniest irregularity may be intolerable," he says.

At least for now, however, the premium sound and comfort comes at a premium price. While you can get a conventional hearing aid for a few hundred dollars, the CAMISHA produced models range from about $1,000-$3,000 per device.

"That makes a lot of difference in your work, to know that you made a difference to somebody else."
