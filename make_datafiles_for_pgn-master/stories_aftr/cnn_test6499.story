What's better than a "supermoon"? Three supermoons!

Supermoon linked to supercreativity? We think so

Chester was talking about the supermoon that happened in June last year. It was 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full moons of 2013, and garnered international headlines.

"Loving this super moon on the coast of NC tonight." one woman tweeted. "Super moon looks incredible right now!!!" a man tweeted.

NASA stressed that sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between a supermoon and a regular full moon, as clouds and haze can mask a difference in brightness.

"There's a part of me that wishes that this 'super-Moon' moniker would just dry up and blow away, like the 'Blood-Moon' that accompanied the most recent lunar eclipse, because it tends to promulgate a lot of mis-information," Chester said in his statement.

"However, if it gets people out and looking at the night sky and maybe hooks them into astronomy, then it's a good thing."
