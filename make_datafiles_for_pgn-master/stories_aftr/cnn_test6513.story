This week it was reported that Steve Jobs, the CEO and cofounder of Apple, underwent a liver transplant two months ago. One detail concerning Jobs's transplant seemed odd: The surgery took place at a hospital in Tennessee, some 2,000 miles from Jobs' home in northern California. Why Tennessee?

Steve Jobs (pictured in October 2008) has been on a health-related leave of absence since January 2009.

The answer sheds light on the intricacies of the organ transplant system, as well as why it's sometimes easier for people with significant financial resources to get an organ transplant. (Jobs' estimated net worth: $5.7 billion.)

Yet it sometimes seems that celebrities in need end up at the front of the line when they need a transplant, and people often assume they get preferential treatment. (Rumors about special treatment circulated after baseball player Mickey Mantle's liver transplant in 1995, for example.) Health.com: The real gift of life: How medical donations help

There are 127 centers in the U.S. that perform liver transplants. If you need an organ transplant, your doctor will refer you to one of these centers, where you will be evaluated, given a score based on the severity of illness, and placed on the center's waiting list, if you are indeed a candidate for transplant.

The problem -- or the advantage for some patients -- is that not all OPOs are created equal. Some regions contain nearly 15 times as many people as others, and their waiting list times vary widely. Patients in the smaller OPOs tend to be less sick and experience shorter wait times before getting an organ. In the Tennessee OPO where Jobs received his transplant, the median wait for a liver between 2002 and 2007 was just over four months. The national average was just over a year, and in some OPOs it was more than three years.

"The system works at two levels," explains Arthur Caplan, Ph.D., the chair of the department of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania. "One, who gets in to a center. Two, who gets transplanted off a particular center's list when an organ becomes available. Most of the attention goes to stage two, but the biggest ethical challenges are really at stage one."

Jobs underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2004. (He reportedly had a type that grows more slowly -- and has a better prognosis -- than others.) He was said to have recovered, but last year he appeared in public looking thin and sick. He took a leave of absence in January and underwent a liver transplant a few months later. However, it's not clear how long he was on the transplant waiting list, or whether he was on the waiting list for a center other than the one in Tennessee.

Since 2003, UNOS has required that transplant centers inform all candidates that they can be evaluated and listed at more than one center, and that they can also transfer their care from one center to another without losing the time they have accrued on the waiting list. However, not everyone can afford to fly around the country and be evaluated at more than one transplant center. In fact, many people can't afford a liver transplant, period.

Moreover, your insurance continues to be important during the evaluation process. The decision to accept a transplant candidate takes place before UNOS enters the picture, and the committees that determine whether a patient is added to the transplant center's waiting list have access to a patient's full medical and financial history.

"There's a huge triage involved in getting in," says Caplan. "If you're a homeless alcoholic sleeping on the streets of L.A., and you're going toe-to-toe with Steve Jobs, you're going to lose."

For most people, the ability to pay is a precondition for acceptance at more than one transplant center. Wealthy people who are, in effect, financially "pre-approved" for a liver transplant, can shop around and identify the transplant centers that will give them the best chance of receiving a new organ.

Reforming the system

In the late 1990s, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued new regulations that would have given priority to the sickest patients, regardless of region. This would have eliminated the geographic disparities that make approval at multiple transplant centers advantageous, but Congress blocked the regulations and instead asked the Institute of Medicine, an advisory organization that belongs to the National Academy of Sciences, to consider the issue.

Some transplant centers advocated the shift away from the OPO system, but others vigorously lobbied Congress to oppose the new policy. The smaller transplant centers were concerned that in a national organ allocation system, they would receive fewer transplants and be driven out of business. The larger transplant centers, meanwhile, wanted to maintain the size and geographical reach of the OPOs in their areas.

"There was a huge split in the transplant community," says Paschke. "It was very territorial at the time, and there was a lot of maneuvering going on. There were a lot of business interests on the part of the transplant centers."

UNOS itself has been split on the issue of multiple listing. The organization's board of directors has voted on whether to restrict multiple listing three times in the past 15 years; the first vote resulted in a tie, and in the others the proposal was rejected by a divided vote.

"Money doesn't play such a big role in entry into the system," he says. "Steve Jobs' transplant is relevant to why we need some health reform."
