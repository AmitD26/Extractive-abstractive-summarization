London (CNN) -- A portrait artist promises to capture more than a photograph is ever able to: more than just a glimpse of a person's external appearance, a portrait can display a person as they truly are. But how does the artists do it?

Jonathan Yeo is one of Britain's greatest portrait artists. Some of the world's most famous people -- Tony Blair, Nicole Kidman, Damien Hirst, Kevin Spacey, Prince Phillip, and Malala Yousafzai among them -- have sat to have their image -- and something of their essence -- captured by him.

Here, he meets prima ballerina Tamara Rojo, artistic director and star dancer at the English National Ballet, and explains how to create a stunning portrait -- from choosing a subject to immortalizing them in paint - broken down into a series of six-second Vines.

You want to choose people you're going to find interesting company.

It doesn't even matter if you end up not liking them, if you find them interesting, then that makes for an interesting painting.

It's only if you find someone boring, then that tends to make the whole process harder.

You might start one and not like it. Or you might like some bits of it, and start it again using some parts and not others.

The advantage of drawing straight onto the canvas is, the bits I like, I'll keep -- and then it could be that it'll stay as a study. Or it might be that I'll do another layer and another layer and then It'll become more three dimensional.

At this stage you don't necessarily know what's going to happen.

The idea is that I start by laying down an under-layer of the picture, probably in quite muted colors, like I'm doing here.

And then once you're happy with the idea of it, that it's on the right lines, then I don't have to be quite so fixed or concentrating so hard.

Actually, you start talking more and it's partly then you see the animation in people's faces. And then that's what makes the thing come alive.

You've got very good, very strong eyes. It's important to get that right -- more than anything else.

We are interested in faces more than other things.

If people really want to look at it while I'm doing it, I'll let them, but on the basis that they don't say anything to me about it.

It's not often easy to judge at the time when you've just done something whether it's good or not.

You might like something on the day because it's what you were trying to do, but sometimes the best ones happen by accident.

For that bit, the photo doesn't tell the whole story: you want to see, not just how someone looks, but how a person moves and how they react to things, and if you can get those things in, that's what makes it come alive, really, and makes it more interesting than a photo.
