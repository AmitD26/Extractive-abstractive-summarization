An Indonesian search and rescue official told CNN that he thinks material detected by sonar equipment in the water is from AirAsia Flight QZ8501.

So what happens next?

Priorities

The bodies give clues about what happened on the flight, based on where they're found and their condition. For example, sea water in their lungs would suggest that the people on board may have been conscious when the plane struck the sea.

There is particular attention to the location of the bodies and various debris.

David Soucie, a former Federal Aviation Administration safety inspector and analyst for CNN, likens it to "peeling an onion apart and then putting that onion back together from the inside out."

Investigators map the debris found on the surface of the water. Then they have to look for other pieces in the next level of sea for more clues, he said.

The key to understanding what happened is likely contained in the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, commonly known as black boxes.

If they are recovered, Indonesian authorities will designate which agency should open and download the information.

"It picks up other sounds like clicks, things going wrong, thuds, hail. You can hear that on the windshield," said Mary Schiavo, a lawyer and former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation.

The data recorder holds hundreds of pieces of data such as airspeed, altitude, whether the plane's nose was up or down and which direction it was headed. All that data would print out on long sheets, almost like EKGs, that authorities would use to piece together a timeline of the flight.

Because the AirAsia plane was only six years old, its data recorder is fairly modern and would contain lots of parameters, Schiavo said.

Challenges in the search

"This plane couldn't have gone down in a worse time of year. There's big winds, choppy waves. These shallow seas are known for complicated waves. It's really difficult to work in."

This could put search and recovery crews at risk and decrease visibility. They're also working under a deadline as the plane's pingers, or underwater locator beacons, only last for about 30 days.

Salvage operation

Underwater vehicles, designed for deep water salvage operations, can descend as deep as 20,000 feet. They could retrieve smaller items such as the flight data recorder.

Since they can only carry up to 4,000 pounds, larger pieces, such as the fuselage would have to be attached to a cable and pulled to the surface by a crane on a ship. This was done for recovering remnants of the fuselage of Air France Flight 447.
