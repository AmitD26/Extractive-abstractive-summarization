Cesar Millan has been showcasing his talents as "The Dog Whisperer" since 2004, teaching dog owners how to train their energetic and oftentimes misbehaving canines.

Millan gained celebrity status after helping stars such as Oprah Winfrey with their precious pooches, but on his Nat Geo Wild series "The Dog Whisperer," he works with everyday people.

He said compatibility starts with understanding a dog's body language, beginning with the eyes.

"It's the softness of the eye contact that can tell you a lot [because] they can tell you sadness, as much as it can tell you, 'I'm open for a relationship.' Or they can tell you, 'I don't want to be with you,'" he explained.  "Through the eye contact you can know exactly how they feel about your presence."

Millan accompanied the Giessens as they checked out the homeless dogs at DeKalb County Animal Control in Atlanta.  Casey Giessen recounted how Millan helped explain to the couple how they should go about choosing their future pet.

Millan said many future pet owners often mistake a high-powered tail wag as happiness.

"That doesn't mean the dog is happy, that means the dog is excited!" he explained.

Next, he said future dog owners need to consider how they will set boundaries and limitations for their pet.

The Giessens, who described their energy level as medium, found a small lab mix at the DeKalb shelter that they liked.  After observing them together, Millan said he believed she was a compatible dog for the couple.  The couple later noticed the dog shedding quite a bit, so, because Sarah has allergies, they decided to continue their search using the advice Millan has shared.

"My goal was to teach them a little bit more than what they knew," Millan said.  "And what they adopt today was knowledge, maybe not a dog yet, but when they adopt a dog, it will be the right dog for them because they will do it with knowledge."

Millan said after you have adopted a shelter dog, the first thing you need to do before bringing your new pet home is take it for a long, one- to two-hour walk.

"We go to work, kids go to school, at one point he will be by himself," he explained. "So, it's best to introduce him to how his life is going to look like in the future from day one. So you don't catch him by surprise."

"Follow through with exercise and discipline," he said.  "Everybody wants to pet a dog, but not everybody walks the dog and is consistent with rules, boundaries and limitations. We don't have a problem with breed, with pit bulls, we don't have a problem with aggression, we have a problem with education."

"We kept saying to each other, we can't get him just because he's cute," Sara Giessen said.

They found the dog at Georgia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which has a "spend the night" program. They were allowed to bring the dog home for a night, which sealed the deal.

"We were really surprised because at the shelter he was really hyperactive," Casey said. "We got him home and he was really chill."
