NAPLES, Florida (CNN)  -- At least seven possible tornadoes were reported Tuesday in eastern Florida as  Tropical Storm Fay battered parts of the state with high winds and heavy rain, the National Hurricane Center said.

Fay could strengthen into a hurricane when it swings over Florida again Thursday, according to the center.

At 5 p.m., the center of the storm was about 60 miles southwest of Melbourne, the hurricane center said. Fay was traveling north-northeast at 8 mph.

Florida Power & Light reported more than 93,000 customers without power in 20 counties. Most of the outages -- 34,000 -- were in Collier County, where Fay came ashore earlier in the day.

As many as 9,700 residents in Brevard County were without power Tuesday evening, according to David Waters, the county Emergency Operations Center spokesman.

A Brevard County tornado that hit about 1:45 p.m. damaged more than 50 homes, leaving nine uninhabitable, according to the emergency operations center. Three people suffered minor injuries, officials said.

Fay's maximum sustained winds remained near 65 mph, with higher gusts, forecasters said. A storm tracker in Moore Haven, near the west bank of Lake Okeechobee, reported winds up to 81 mph in the afternoon.

"Some fluctuations in intensity are likely this afternoon and tonight as Fay moves inland over Florida. Some strengthening is expected when Fay moves over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday," according to the hurricane center.

Dr. Bob Smith, an associate veterinarian at the Palm Beach Equine Clinic, said an 8-year-old quarterhorse named Onyx was in a stall, untied, when the suspected tornado hit about 2 a.m. It destroyed the structure "and left the horse standing there unscathed," Smith said. iReport.com: Flooding, beached whale as Fay hits

When he came to work several hours later, a technician had rescued the horse, who was not visibly rattled, Smith said.

"She's just calm and cool," he said. "She's fine."

Smith said roof tiles flew off the veterinary clinic and broke car windows in a nearby parking lot. The storm also picked up a horse trailer and smashed it into another horse trailer, he said.

"It's clear that the damage was in a very linear fashion," he said.

Crist said 31 schools were closed in the region Tuesday as a precaution. All but four, including Brevard County, will be open Wednesday.

"Floridians should continue to monitor local news reports, stay calm and exercise common sense," he advised. "Please remember to be cautious when testing generators and other hurricane-related equipment.

"In areas where the weather is getting worse, stay inside and stay off the roads and be safe," Crist added.

Concern about Fay's strength also led school officials in Broward County to delay the start of the school year, which was supposed to begin Monday.   Watch wind and rain batter Key West »
