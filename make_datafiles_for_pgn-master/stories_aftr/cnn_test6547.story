(CNN) -- Enterovirus D68 has swept through 30 states since mid-August. What sets the virus apart from many others in the same family is its vicious symptoms: Instead of just causing a summer cold, it sends children to the hospital -- where they often end up in the intensive care unit, struggling to breathe.

At first his parents, Rachel and Rodney Nash, weren't too alarmed when David came down with a cough, runny nose and low-grade fever. But then the 3-year-old got sick very quickly.

What parents should know

The Nashes shared with CNN the day-to-day story of their son's illness, hoping it might help families whose children have been recently diagnosed with what one pediatrician calls a "frightening" virus.

David develops a cough, runny nose and low-grade fever. His parents aren't too worried as it seems like a regular cold.

The Nashes become more concerned. Their little ball of energy who loves flying around the house as Batman doesn't want to play. That night, he wheezes as he sleeps. His parents wake him to give him puffs from an inhaler prescribed for his seasonal allergies.

"You could see him trying to pull the air in," Rachel Nash recalls. "His nostrils flared as he inhaled, and you could see the muscles in his neck and collarbone working extra hard."

Rodney Nash adds, "I remember as a kid my goldfish jumped out of the bowl. That's how he looked to me -- like a goldfish gasping for breath."

David's saturation rate goes up to 88%, but that's not enough. He's admitted to the hospital.

Doctors try a "shaker vest." Blasts of air shake the vest, which loosens up mucus caught in the lungs.

At 4 a.m., a nurse says David is finally responding to the treatments. His breathing, which had been quick and shallow, is slowing down.

The nebulizer treatments go from every two hours to every four. He still doesn't like them, but he doesn't protest as much as he did before.

He's discharged from the hospital.

For the first two days back at home, David does inhaler treatments every four hours. He wheezes a bit, but he's pretty much back to his old self -- energetic and playful.

David has an appointment with his pediatrician, Dr. Betsy John. She gives him a clean bill of health.

David's journey with Enterovirus D68 is fairly typical, says Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, division director of infectious diseases at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri.

Many children, however, get sick even faster. David was ill for about two days before he had to be hospitalized, but many of Jackson's patients have gone from healthy to severely ill in just a day, and they arrive at the hospital barely able to breathe.

"These kids were really struggling. Many can't even speak a sentence," she says. "It's frightening."
