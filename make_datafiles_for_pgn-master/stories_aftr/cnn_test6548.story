London, England (CNN) -- Britain's military chiefs have been told to prepare for a "leaner and less centralized" Ministry of Defence.

In a speech in London, Fox -- just returned from a trip to Afghanistan where Britain has almost 10,000 troops deployed -- said the previous Labour administration had left a "dangerous deficit" in the public finances, including an unfunded liability in the ministry's balance sheet of around Â£37 billion ($57.7 billion) over the next 10 years.

"I don't pretend it is going to be painless," he said.

"We cannot demand efficiency from the lower ranks while exempting those at the top," he said.

The report, scheduled for release at the end of October, will set out what the panel believes should be the shape of the United Kingdom's armed forces in 10 years.

Three factors would determine that shape, Fox said: foreign policy goals; an assessment of the character of future conflicts; and anticipated changes in technology.

According to Professor Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank, that reflects the generally held view among Britain's defense establishment that the current strategic environment is one characterized by "uncertainty and complexity, not by a single existential threat."

The challenge, according to Chalmers, will be to translate that consensus into agreement on where the ax needs to fall.

Among those legacy items are fighter jet programs and the procurement of two aircraft carriers, both projects reportedly threatened with big cuts.
