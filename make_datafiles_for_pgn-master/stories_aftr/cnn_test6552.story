He set foot on U.S. soil for the first time in June, part of a group of young Iraqis chosen for a State Department-sponsored leadership program.

But the hopes in his heart vanished as fast as they had blossomed.

Azwan's family feared for their lives in Bozan, a Yazidi village on the arid plains of Ninevah that's about 30 miles from Mosul.

As a child, Azwan played with his five brothers and sisters and his cousins in the garden. They rode tricycles along a paved driveway and cooled off in Iraq's blistering blaze by soaking in a small, portable pool.

Azwan, the oldest boy in the family, was a serious student. His father encouraged his education and had sent him to the Kurdish city of Irbil to study at The Kingery Institute for English and Computing, run by an American.

There, he began working with another American, Brad Blauser, whose charity delivers wheelchairs to Iraqi children with disabilities.

But now they were on the run. Their community was facing extermination.

And Azwan, whose drive to help others had led him to America, watched from afar, unable to help even his own family.

ISIS fighters were turning their rage on anyone who refused to succumb to their radical Sunni tenets, including Christians and Yazidis, religious minorities in Iraq. Hundreds of thousands were displaced overnight, according to the regional government.

He feared that if ISIS managed to enter Irbil, the first thing it would shut down would be the airport. Then, he would never be able to get out.

If he could get permission to stay in America, he would be safe. He might even have a chance at a life he could never dream of in Iraq. But he would be separated from his family, perhaps for a very long time.

The group traveled to various cities in America and spent a chunk of time in Portland, Oregon. Azwan savored the lush greenery of the Pacific Northwest and the wildly different taste of Mexican food. But his mind raced across continents and an ocean to the starkly arid, undulating landscape of northern Iraq.

Life-and-death decisions

But times were getting tough for the Yazidis, long persecuted in Iraq for their religious beliefs.

Yazidis are one of the world's oldest and smallest monotheistic religious minorities. Their ancient religion predates Islam by thousands of years and has links to Zoroastrianism.

They venerate Lucifer as a redeemed archangel, which is why Muslims view them -- mistakenly -- as devil worshipers. Islamic militant attacks on the Yazidis in Iraq are based on this centuries-old loathing.

But "Yazidi" was not in America's vocabulary until in recent weeks when militant Islam's wrath threatened to wipe out an entire people in Iraq.

ISIS slaughtered more than 500 Yazidis, burying some of them alive. They captured women as slaves, ordered conversions to Islam and laid siege to Mount Sinjar, trapping 50,000 Yazidi people atop without food and water.

Azwan told me it was hard to look at those images. He knew his loved ones, displaced from their home, were huddled together in a small room, struggling to survive. He also knew his father was not telling him everything.

I called his father to learn more about their situation.

"Please say hello to Azwan," Assad Elias told me, the fatigue apparent in his voice. "Don't tell him about our condition. I don't want him to worry."

Azwan, he said, should make a new life in America and hold onto one belief: one day the family will be reunited.

His father worries because no one in the family has a passport. Getting one would have meant a trip to Mosul, and for the last decade he has feared entering the Sunni-dominated city that has been a hotbed of insurgent activity since the ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Once a proud farmer and veterinarian, Assad Elias feels like a caged bird. Life centers every day now on one thing: staying alive.

"Thank you," he said, "to good people everywhere. I wish only for peace in the world."

In America, Azwan worried about what would happen if ISIS pushed northward. How would his loved ones escape? He feared they would be trapped and slaughtered like animals.

He knew he was facing decisions that no one his age should have to make.

Last week, the visiting Iraqi students in the State Department's youth development program visited the White House and met with Vice President Joe Biden even as President Barack Obama was dealing with the myriad problems in Iraq.

It was the last outing for the Iraqi students. The leadership program was nearing an end. Time was running out for Azwan.He knew he could potentially face death if he returned to Iraq.

The young Iraqis boarded a plane to carry them back to their troubled land, their future prospects seemingly bleaker by the day. They took off with the horrific ISIS killing of American journalist James Foley in the headlines.

They took off without Azwan.

He stayed back with Bertwin Lord, a Washington-based international business consultant who knows Blauser and met Azwan at Kingery's school in Irbil. The three Americans had kept in touch with Azwan during his stay in the United States and stepped up to help him.

Lord said Azwan's father gave him permission to act as a guardian for Azwan until he turns 18 next month. Lord then filed a petition for Azwan to obtain asylum in the United States.

"He's a good kid," Lord said. "I know him. He deserves this."

Amid a real threat of extermination of his people, Azwan knows he is getting a chance to flourish.
