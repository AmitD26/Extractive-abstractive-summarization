A Maine judge on Friday ruled in favor of a nurse who defied a quarantine in a tense standoff with state authorities, saying local health officials failed to prove the need for a stricter order enforcing an Ebola quarantine.

Standing with her boyfriend Ted Wilbur, outside their home in Maine, Hickox told reporters the decision was a "good compromise" and that she would continue to comply with direct active monitoring.

Ebola outbreak: Get up to speed

In a news conference with her lawyers Friday, Hickox, via Skype, expressed her support with the army of U.S. health care professionals battling the outbreak in West Africa.

"They are why I'm here," she said, acknowledging that she will work in Africa again. "I hope that one day I can meet some of them at the airport and give them a big hug and let them know that we're in this together ... This is important day for public health."

At the news conference, another lawyer for Hickox, Steve Hyman, called the decision "an indication of thoughtfulness versus irrationality" and said his client had become "a prisoner because of misconceptions and a whole host of irrational arguments."

In Friday's ruling, LaVerdiere praised Hickox for lending her skills "generously, kindly and with compassion" to "aid, comfort and care" for Ebola patients.

"We owe her and all professionals who give of themselves in this way a debt of gratitude," he wrote.

Maine authorities wanted Hickox to stay home for 21 days -- the incubation period for the deadly virus -- although she has tested negative for the disease and has shown no symptoms.

Hickox says that she is healthy and that forcing her to stay home is unconstitutional.

Wilbur said isolating medical professionals returning from West Africa, the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, affects their partners as well.

"This thing doesn't just affect Kaci," Wilbur told CNN affiliate WCHS. "And when people are going to be coming home from different parts of the world and West Africa, it's just not affecting the aid workers and what not. It's affecting their partners."

'We're not trying to push any limits'

"If anyone in the community might have noticed, we went bicycling that way. We did not go into town," Wilbur told the affiliate.

He said they are not trying to cause trouble and want the community to feel at ease.

Hickox's quarantine was scheduled to end on November 10.

Governor: Her safety is a concern

Hickox has said state officials are the ones being unreasonable. She contends the U.S. Constitution and science are on her side.

"I'm fighting for something much more than myself," she said. "There are so many aid workers coming back. It scares me to think how they're going to be treated and how they're going to feel."

Siegel, her attorney, said the couple went for the bike ride to highlight that she could be out in public without interacting with people.

New Jersey incident

When she returned from a month working with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone last week, Hickox had an elevated temperature at an airport in Newark, New Jersey, officials said. She was put into an isolation tent.

She blasted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for enforcing a new policy that required anyone showing symptoms of Ebola, including an elevated temperature, to be isolated.
