The 112 Penn State victories that the NCAA voided -- 111 of them Paterno's -- when it sanctioned Penn State University following the Jerry Sandusky scandal are likely being restored as part of a proposed settlement with the NCAA. Penn State's board of trustees unanimously approved it, and now the NCAA and a judge will have to accept the settlement.

Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of abusing the victims and is serving a 30- to 60-year sentence, which means he will probably spend the rest of his life behind bars. The same year, Paterno died at age 85.

"Today is a great victory for everyone who has fought for the truth in the Sandusky tragedy," the Paterno family said Friday in a statement. "The repeal of the consent decree and the return of the wins to the University and Joe Paterno confirm that the NCAA and the Board of Trustees acted prematurely and irresponsibly in the unprecedented sanctions the NCAA imposed on the University, the players, coaches and the community."

But at least some of Sandusky's victims disagree. Marci Hamilton, a Philadelphia attorney who represents some of them, said it's another example of protecting the powerful over the vulnerable.

"At least the money is still going to be used for the benefit of survivors in Pennsylvania.  Powerful institutions involved in child sex abuse scandals are typically more concerned about their leaders' pristine reputations (regardless of what they have done) than money.  This settlement follows the trend," she said in an email to CNN.

Howard Janet, lawyer for another victim, said in a statement: "Any effort by Penn State officials or others that implies the NCAA's action suggests the University had no responsibility for the molestation of adolescent boys by the defensive coordinator of its football team -- which often took place in team showers --  is ludicrous."

Another Philadelphia attorney, Tom Kline, who represented victims including one who was assaulted after administrators were informed of allegations in 2001, said: "Penn State institutionally has demonstrated significant good faith in the past two and half years, and deserved real relief from the overbearing sanctions to which it previously agreed -- especially relating to the $60 million fine.

"But, we must not lose sight -- in between the chants of 'restore the wins' and 'restore the statute' pertaining to strong feeling relating to (the late) Joe Paterno, that the remaining issue is the individual accountability of the administrators in charge when Jerry Sandusky was enable to commit his horrible acts on young boys."

When Penn State hired an independent investigator to look into what happened, the investigator found that Paterno was also part of a coverup, creating a divide among Pennsylvanians and provoking a visceral response from his family and supporters who maintain he was not aware that Sandusky was a pedophile.

That independent report, done by former FBI director Louis Freeh, was what the NCAA relied on when it sanctioned the university.

"I am thankful that a small but significant part of this great injustice has been rectified with the restoration of Joe Paterno's win record. Joe and Penn State did not cover anything up because there was simply nothing to cover up," she said. "Hopefully, as the media's false narrative continues to unravel, more people will realize this obvious reality."
