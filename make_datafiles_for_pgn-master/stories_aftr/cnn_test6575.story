(CNN)As a guy with a Fred Flintstone physique, competing on the same runway with a Miss Universe contestant was never on my bucket list.

"I like your dress," she said, without the slightest trace of irony.

Pretending to be used to such compliments, I replied, "Right back at ya!" before awkwardly turning the conversation to Ghana's geography, of which I knew nothing. (Note to self: The next time I hang out with Miss Ghana, remember that her home city of Accra is the capital.)

Before the race, as Miss Ghana's bodyguard snapped pics of us with her mobile phone, I imagined what she might be texting her friends and family back home: "Dear Mom and Dad: If this contestant in the purple dress is a preview of my competition, this pageant will be a breeze!" Her real Instagram feed was much kinder, praising me and another male bridesmaid for our "courage."

It's fascinating to see if that fa√ßade can even last three hours. This week Miss Lebanon Saly Greige weathered a PR crisis at home for posing in a selfie taken by Miss Israel Doron Matalon along with Miss Slovenia and Miss Japan. It is against Lebanese law to make contact with Israelis. Although she is smiling in the picture, Miss Lebanon accused Miss Israel of "photobombing" her, and it's understandable why she's running scared.  In 1993, Miss Lebanon Ghada Turk was stripped of her title when she posed with the then-Miss Israel.

What will happen if Miss Israel and Miss Lebanon both make the Top 5 on Sunday night? How about Miss Russia and Miss Ukraine? Will contestants from any of the former Soviet bloc countries -- Miss Poland, Miss Hungary, Miss Czech Republic -- give Miss Russia the stink eye?

Just like the Olympic Opening Ceremony, the Miss Universe pageant encourages people (on stage and at home) to momentarily be classy and see each other as individuals versus national or ethnic stereotypes. Not that any of the millions of viewers around the globe will be asking for a geography lesson, but the competition also forces people to wonder: "So where exactly IS Trinidad and Tobago?" and "How cool is it to have an ampersand in your country's name?"

According to her official Miss Universe bio, Miss Ghana can burp "more than 50 times in a row." All those curves must do wonders for the acoustics. I'll definitely be rooting for her to win it all.

How could I not? She liked my dress.
