If Belgium is divided by the Flemish speakers who live in the north and the French-speaking Walloons in the south, the nation's footballers are united with one goal.

Like Les Bleus -- a team which included players of African and Caribbean heritage -- Belgium's class of 2013 has a cosmopolitan feel.

And while the 26-year-old considers himself Belgian, he believes the ethnic mix within the team has made his time in the national setup a more enjoyable experience.

"With Germany, you can see there's a real mix of nationalities in their team. I like that approach because I'm of mixed nationality myself."

It's a nuanced response from Dembele and contrasts sharply with the view of Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, who said this week only English people should play for England.

Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen will speak to the press in Flemish, while Zenit St. Petersburg midfielder Axel Witsel, whose father came from the Caribbean island of Martinique,  will give his thoughts in French.

"Some 13 years ago the Belgian Football Federation decided to reorganize Belgian football programs and set up in every province an elite academy," leading Belgium youth football coach Michel Bruyninckx, who has long been interested in maximizing the way players use their brain in games as part of his innovative training sessions, told CNN in a recent interview.

"Just as importantly the Ministry of Education agreed to create a school curriculum to extend the number of weekly training hours.

"That meant we could guarantee young talents would have about 20 hours training time a week and their school programs were never in danger.

"The structure, organization and lifestyle in the academies was regularly checked to make sure that this project delivered professional players or highly qualified young people."

The project has been a huge success -- Belgium's top club side Anderlecht competes in the European Champions League with a team boasting an average of just 22.5 years.

The club's youth teams have been dominating on both the national and European stage, while the Belgian Under-21 side recently defeated Italy 3-1.

"The integration of many very young players in the first team is the proof of the success of what has happened in Belgium. Most of all Youri Tielemans, the 16-year-old player who has surprised the whole of Belgium and is the product of the new strategy."

Star pupils

One of those players to have come through the Anderlecht system announced himself on the world stage last weekend.

Adnan Januzaj scored twice on his full Premier League debut for Manchester United in a 2-1 win at Sunderland -- sparking a wild frenzy among a whole host of nations which want to secure his international future.

Even England has made overtures in attracting the youngster to wearing the Three Lions.

There may be a chance Januzaj will wear the red of Belgium, but that is for the future -- he has refused all international call-ups so far.

Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has starred in Spain's La Liga for Atletico Madrid, while Chelsea's Eden Hazard is regarded as one of the most exciting playmakers in the world.

Benteke and Lukaku are two of the most lethal finishers in the English Premier League, while Fellaini commanded a $43 million transfer fee when he joined Manchester United from Everton in August.

Then there is the prodigiously talented Bakkali -- who, at 17 years and 196 days old, became the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Dutch league, for PSV Eindhoven in August.

'Something special'

There is talent everywhere you look -- it is a squad which promises to thrill, excite, inspire and perhaps, just perhaps, win.

"I think now you can see we have a lot more confidence there. With the World Cup, it's all looking good for us but it's not done quite yet.

"I think there are some difficult games to play but we're confident.

"We have a very good team, so we don't have to be scared. But we have to be concentrated, and I believe if we get to Brazil we can do something special, but we have to get there first."
