Rapper Gucci Mane will serve 39 months in prison after pleading guilty Tuesday to a federal firearms charge.

The plea agreement worked out with prosecutors saves Gucci Mane, 33, whose real name is Radric Davis, considerable time behind bars.

In 2012, Davis was arrested for hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at an Atlanta nightclub. The man told police the incident occurred after he tried to strike up a conversation with the rapper.

In 2005, Davis was charged with murder in the shooting death of a man, but the charge was dropped because of insufficient evidence.

"The criminal history of the defendant, Radric Davis shows a complete and utter disregard for the lives of others as well as for their personal pursuits," Aladino Ortiz with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday.

Sentencing is scheduled for July 28.
