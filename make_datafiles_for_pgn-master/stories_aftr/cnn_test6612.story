(CNN)Lars Vilks is no stranger to threats. The Swedish artist is on an al Qaeda hit list and travels everywhere with bodyguards at his side.

He's survived previous attempts on his life. But Vilks said the shooting at a free speech forum at a Copenhagen cafe was the worst.

At the Saturday event, France's ambassador to Denmark had just spoken about the recent attack at the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. A woman from a feminist organization had taken the floor and started to speak.

Vilks realized that something was wrong.

"We suddenly heard a lot of noise. There was a bang, bang, bang, and very quickly we could understand that something was going on," he told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday.

"He was very well-equipped, and the policemen were not. So he had an advantage. ... Several of the policemen (were) wounded, but still they tried to fire back," Vilks said.

Inside the cafe, terrified audience members scrambled for cover.

"They were hiding in corners and under tables and everything," Vilks said. "They were just waiting (to see) who is going to open the door there and who will come in."

Luckily, Vilks said, it was a wounded policeman who finally entered the cafe -- not the gunman, who police later said they'd killed.

The artist wasn't hurt, but the gunman did kill a 55-year-old man and wounded three officers before fleeing, police said.

It's impossible to know for sure what the gunman's aims were, Vilks said. But Vilks said it's likely that he was the target. Controversial sketches Vilks made depicting the Prophet Mohammed in 2007 landed him on an al Qaeda hit list with a $100,000 bounty on his head and have sparked a number of threats and attacks against him.

Vilks said he plans to keep speaking out, but he told CNN on Monday that he'd gone into hiding. He declined to specify when he first went into hiding and said he is not afraid.

Organizers of future events will take security very seriously, he said.

Islam and other religions, he said, should be open to criticism because their ideology is deeply tied to social and political issues.

"If you go into the political business, you have to play the game," he said. "And as long as that goes on, criticism of Islam is to be continued, and rightly so."

Vilks said his work and those who are discussing it are "part of a political conversation."

Such conversations, he said, are a key part of free speech and living in a democracy.

The one responsible for the violence "is of course not the one who is following the rules and keeping a reasonable discussion going," he said. "It's those people who try to stop it with violence and murder."
