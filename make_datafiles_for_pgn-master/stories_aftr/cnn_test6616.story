(CNN)For Rami the dog, the story begins in south Georgia, where he's found wandering in a backyard.

The pit bull- dachshund mix's look brings him attention at a local shelter, where his picture goes viral. Adoption offers and fame pour in.

"It is a true pit bull head on a dachshund body," Dawn Blanton of the Moultrie-Colquitt County Humane Society said last month.

His mission: become a therapy dog and bring awareness about unique pets in shelters everywhere.

And the pup has a message for those worried about him: don't be.

"At night I go to my other home where I can play and sleep with my fosters! No more worries as a dog on the street, now I have food in my tummy, a warm cozy bed, and lots of friends and most important ... LOVE!!"

When his popularity skyrocketed, the shelter carefully considered his adoption. It did not want him to become a freak show.

Rami's celebrity status has reportedly increased adoptions at the shelter.

And the pup's taking his ambassador role seriously: His page features photos of him sending off fellow animals to new owners.
