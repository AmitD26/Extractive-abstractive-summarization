(The Hollywood Reporter)Now in its third season, "House of Cards" has one of those problems that soap operas bump up against all the time: story fatigue.

You can only ask your audience to buy into the political shenanigans of Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey) and wife Claire (Robin Wright) for so long, given the Gumbyesque contortions that the series uses to entertain.

Unfortunately, after holding out against the cruel intrusion of reality, at some point in season two of "House of Cards," ridiculous was the key word for pretty much everything in it.

That wouldn't be much of a problem if "House of Cards" was, like a true soap opera, keenly aware of its reputation (like, say, "Scandal"). Meaning, if "House of Cards" really believed that its ridiculousness was a wink-wink at the audience, its diversions from believability wouldn't be so troubling.

In that role, "House of Cards" is often touted as a prestige drama a la "Breaking Bad," "Mad Men" and "The Americans," among others. But if season two proved anything, with its collapsing parade of paper tigers standing up to Frank's quest for ultimate power, it's that the series is far more entertaining than it is great. Power wielded by a ruthless married couple as they sack Washington D.C. is a pretty fun thing to behold, soapy as it is racing toward the assured victory, the stakes-free gamble.

There just wasn't much gravitas in the midst of it as the bubbles got in your eyes.

Awards shows are still making this qualitatively dubious connection (as they've done to an even worse degree with another soap opera, "Downton Abbey"). I worry that the creative forces behind "House of Cards" will blindly accept the accolades and not address the more glaring issues critics (and fans) began harping on in season two.

Early episodes of the third season of "House of Cards" indicate a change of direction might be afoot, though plenty of worry remains that this will be only temporary and the Underwoods will continue to fool and rule the world with the ease of master puppeteers as the season goes forward.

But at least in the early going, creator Beau Willimon and the many executive producers with a hand in this series seem to agree that maybe the Underwoods, now known as the President and First Lady of the United States, need to hit some road blocks that they can't immediately get around.

But at least in dealing with the basic moving parts of the series, it's safe to say being President and First Lady isn't as easy or as satisfying as Frank and Claire expected. Both want more. Frank wants, naturally, to avoid being a placeholder president and focus on getting reelected.

After all the cream-puff politicians and supposedly brilliant strategists that the Underwoods have fooled all too easily in the first two seasons, a little payback and a little failure plays well for "House of Cards."
