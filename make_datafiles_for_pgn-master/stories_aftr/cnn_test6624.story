(CNN) -- French soccer star Nicolas Anelka has been given a five-match ban and fined Â£80,000 ($130,000) by the English Football Association (FA) for making a "quenelle" gesture in a game last year.

The "quenelle" which involves pointing a straightened arm downwards while touching the shoulder of that arm with the other hand, is believed by some to be a Nazi salute in reverse and has been linked with anti-Semitism in Anelka's homeland.

An Independent Regulatory Commission was asked to consider if the gesture was "abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper," and "included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief."

In addition to the ban and fine, Anelka has been ordered to undertake a "compulsory education course," the FA said.

The 34-year-old, who denied the charges and asked for a personal hearing, commented on Twitter after the match that the gesture was "a dedication" to the French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala before adding: "I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic."

Known as Dieudonne, he has popularized the "quenelle" gesture in France and faces investigation by the Paris prosecutor's office for his controversial stand-up routine.

Anelka has seven days to appeal the decision.
