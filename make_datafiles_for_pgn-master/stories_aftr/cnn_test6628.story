(CNN)The BBC has suspended Jeremy Clarkson, the host of car show "Top Gear," following "a fracas with a BBC producer," the broadcaster said in a statement.

"Jeremy Clarkson has been suspended pending an investigation," they said. "No one else has been suspended. Top Gear will not be broadcast this Sunday."

"Save Clarkson?" his co-host James May tweeted. "Save empty cardboard boxes and off-cuts of string. They're far more useful."

This is not the first time that Clarkson has been at the center of controversy.

Clarkson had mumbled the n-word while reciting a children's nursery rhyme, but that version of the take was never aired.

Last year, the BBC show hit the headlines when Argentina complained about a "Top Gear" special filmed in the country in which the number plate H982 FKL was used -- interpreted by some as a reference to the 1982 Falklands War.

In a previous article on their website, the BBC said "Jeremy Clarkson is not a man given to considered opinion."
