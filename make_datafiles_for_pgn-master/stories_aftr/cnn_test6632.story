Over the course of its 80-year life, it's been played underwater, underground, in space (OK, just the tokens) and on giant game boards. It's used chocolate and featured real money. There have been games that barely lasted the night and marathon contests that went on for weeks.

Not bad for a game that, according to lore, maker Parker Brothers originally rejected for containing "52 fundamental errors."

The Landlord's Game was meant to be educational, illustrating economist Henry George's belief -- inspired by the Gilded Age -- that property ownership by individuals is inherently unfair. Magie's game was an underground success, leading to a number of offshoots, including the one that Darrow tweaked. Parker Brothers bought her patent for $500 in 1935, closing the loop.

As for Darrow, he was inspired in 1932 by a version created by a New Jersey Quaker community that made Atlantic City the locale of the game. Darrow added colors and other design elements -- "a look and feel to his board that would prove immensely appealing," writes Philip E. Orbanes in "Monopoly," a 2006 history of the game.

Darrow's game was initially rejected by Parker Brothers for three errors -- not 52 -- but when his independent sales took off, Parker Brothers bought the game from him. The date? March 19, 1935.

The numbers are staggering. Monopoly has been translated into 47 languages. It's played in 114 countries. It's sold more than 275 million copies.

Incidentally, the Monopoly Man -- named Rich Uncle Pennybags -- was likely based on mustachioed financier J.P. Morgan.

The new "Here & Now" U.S. edition, however, opened the voting to enthusiasts -- and Pierre (population 14,000), the capital of South Dakota, won pride of place as Boardwalk. (Lima, Peru, won the World Edition.)

Pierre was one of 60 cities in the running, Mayor Laurie Gill said, and was "in the bottom of the pack" when she was informed of the contest. Being a competitive sort, she was determined to push Pierre past perhaps more logical cities such as New York or Los Angeles.

Pierre may be doing better than Atlantic City, which has struggled since the mid-2000s to return to its gambling heyday. Still, the New Jersey resort does have Monopoly to thank for some of its fame -- not that it was appreciated at one time.

Do you put money from Chance and Community Chest in the center of the board and collect it when landing on Free Parking? Not in the rules. Do you give $400 for landing on Go instead of $200? Not in the rules. Do you allow secret side deals? Uh-uh. (Admittedly, there is now a set of "House Rules" that allow for variations, but they're not official.)

The dismissive line "Do not pass Go, do not collect $200," which has worked its way into a few songs, is from Monopoly. And the game also gave us the term "Monopoly money," as in worthless currency.

So forget the classic definition of "Monopoly money." Hasbro has taken quite a bunch to the bank.

Want to win at Monopoly? Though there's some chance involved (pardon the pun), the low-rent light blues and the mid-market oranges are the most desirable, according to a study done for Maxine Brady's 1974 "The Monopoly Book." The oranges and reds are the most likely to be landed on. The more upscale greens will pay off eventually, but they're expensive to develop, so you'd better have another form of cash flow in the short term.

Or you could just do what millions have done since Darrow's day: Land on someone else's hotel, get mad and turn over the game board. Hey, it worked in college.
