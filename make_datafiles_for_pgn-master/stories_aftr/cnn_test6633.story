Saddam Hussein renovated the ruins in the 1980s, leaving his own crude personal stamp on the bricks there. They bear his name and describe him as the son of Nebuchadnezzar, who had the reputation of being ancient Babylon's greatest king.

One of Hussein's former palaces still peers down over the city.

But it continues to be source of great pride for Iraqis who see themselves as the heirs of the world's oldest civilization.

And many Iraqis know better than to buy the claims of their deposed despot. "This wasn't Saddam's," said Adnan Abu Fatima. "It belonged to our grandfathers, the Babylonians."

"The Mosul museum was destroyed. Why?" he wants to know from ISIS. "That is the heritage of your grandfathers. Why did you do that?"

Antiquity is an integral part of Iraq's national identity. History is measured there not in centuries but in millennia, and Iraqi's take such vandalism to heart.

The U.S. State Department has announced it will return more than 60 items on Monday, which had been sneaked into the United States.

Safa ad-Din Hassan and other parents took Iraqi scouts on a camping trip near Babylon to teach them about their history and make ancient artwork with them.

Hassan fled Mosul when ISIS overran it last year then later ransacked the museum. "When I saw what happened, I was determined to come her to preserve our antiquities from ISIS," he said.

It's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians, who have destroyed much of it in the North, which has been out of the defensive reach of Iraqi soldiers.

Video of soldiers standing on top of it was posted to YouTube. They celebrated the posthumous slap against their former tormentor. One man fired shots into the rubble toward Hussein's grave site.

It was a piece of history they were glad to part with.
