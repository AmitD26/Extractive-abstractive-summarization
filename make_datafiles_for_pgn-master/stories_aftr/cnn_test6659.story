The Liberian-flagged oil tanker Sirius Star was recently released by pirates off Somalia.

Two or three pirate speedboats were chasing the Dutch ship, with the goal of boarding it, when the Russians intervened, said Capt. Pottengal Mukundan, director of the International Maritime Bureau in London.

He said the pirates fired two rocket-propelled grenades at the Dutch ship, but no injuries were reported.

The Russians chased one of the speedboats but the pirates got away, Mukundan said. He said he did not know where the Dutch ship was headed.

"It is important that the naval vessels continue to respond robustly to these pirates," he said.  Watch how attacks peaked in 2008 Â»

The Gulf of Aden links the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. About 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route near Somalia each year.

Most of the attacks are blamed on pirates based in largely lawless Somalia, a country racked by poverty and conflict. Watch CNN's exclusive interview with a pirate

The troubling rise in Somali piracy has led the United Nations to step up efforts to tackle the crime.

The first U.N. group to address piracy met Wednesday in New York.

He said the group was formed to "establish a counter-piracy coordination mechanism," and the members believe more can be done to halt piracy.
