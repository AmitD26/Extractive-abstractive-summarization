(CNN) -- David Beckham was upstaged on the day his AC Milan future was finally resolved as teammate Filippo Inzaghi fired a hat-trick in the 3-0 success over Atalanta at the San Siro on Sunday.

The 33-year-old midfielder will then return to the United States to play for the Galaxy between July and October.

"I'm grateful to both clubs for allowing this dream to come true," Beckham said in a statement posted on www.gazzetta.it.

What do think of Beckham's move to play in the U.S. and Italy?

The deal follows weeks of negotiations between the two clubs during which Milan baulked at the size of the transfer fee Galaxy were demanding -- thought to be around Â£12million.

Galaxy's chief executive, Tim Lieweke, admits the deal is one which suits both clubs. "I'm sorry that it had to go for so long, for him and for us and particularly for the fans," he told the Los Angeles Times.

Coach Carlo Ancelotti admits Beckham has exceeded all expectations during his first two months as an AC Milan player.

"Beckham has done more than we could have possibly expected from him," Ancelotti told PA Sport. "He has settled in very well with the squad and given a huge contribution up to now.

"He is very professional and we are all very, very happy that he is staying."

Sunday's victory gave Milan a five-point gap over fourth-placed Fiorentina, who lost 2-0 at home to Palermo.

Ancelotti said Inzaghi had helped lift the club out of a crisis after their UEFA Cup exit.

"He gave us a real helping hand. It was a tough match and for most of the first half Atalanta caused us problems," he said.

The former England captain dictated the play and helped open the way for Milan to take a seventh-minute lead when Marek Jankulovski firied across goal for the unmarked Inzaghi to score.

Milan had to wait until the 71st minute for Inzaghi's second. He beat the offside trap to latch onto Pato's chip and take the ball around Consigli before slotting home.

After that Ancelotti took both Inzaghi and Beckham off to give the fans the chance to show their appreciation for both players.
