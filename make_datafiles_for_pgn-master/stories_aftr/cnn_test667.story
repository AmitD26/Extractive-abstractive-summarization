Laura Zuniga and seven men were found in vehicles with guns and $50,000, Mexican police say.

Laura Zuniga and the men were traveling in two vehicles that contained AR-15 assault rifles, handguns, cartridges and $50,000 in cash, said Luis Carlos Najera Gutierrez de Velazco, secretary of public security for the state of Jalisco.

Police, who had received a tip that a group of armed men were in a home, "detected" the vehicles as they were traveling to investigate the call, Najera said.

Najera said Urquiza's brother, Ricardo Garcia Urquiza, is a member of the Juarez cartel and already was in police custody.

All eight were filed before the news media Tuesday. Zuniga, wearing blue jeans and a gray sweater, raised her handcuffed wrists to cover her face in a police picture.

Zuniga is from Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa, a center of drug activity.

According to the Nuestra Belleza Mexico Web site, she is to represent Mexico in next year's Miss International contest.
