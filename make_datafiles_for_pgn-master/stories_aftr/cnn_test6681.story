BRUNSWICK, Georgia (CNN)  -- Guy Heinze Jr., the son of one of the victims of last week's killings of eight people in a southeast Georgia mobile home, has been arrested on eight counts of first degree murder, police said Friday.

Investigators obtained an arrest warrant Friday evening for Heinze, 22, just hours after he had been freed from jail on charges of tampering with evidence and making false statements to a police officer, Glynn County, Georgia, Police Chief Matt Doering said.

The bodies were discovered last Saturday at New Hope Plantation mobile home park, north of the Atlantic coastal city of Brunswick. Seven died in the mobile home, and the eighth died Sunday at a hospital. Doering refused to reveal how the victims were killed or the suspected motive.

A 3-year-old who was injured struggles on life support at a Savannah hospital, her grandmother said.

According to the earlier arrest warrant, Heinze provided "investigators with false and misleading information about his whereabouts and involvement in the circumstances leading up to him calling 911 to report the deaths of his family members."

A man identified as Heinze reported the slayings. He told an emergency dispatcher when he called Saturday, "I was out last night. I got home just now, and everybody's dead. ... My whole family's dead. It looks like they've been beaten to death."  Listen to the 911 call Â»

Seven of the eight victims will be buried Saturday, as a 3-year-old who was injured struggles to survive at a Savannah hospital.

Police said seven of the victims died in the mobile home, and the eighth died Sunday at a hospital.

For the other seven, viewing was scheduled for Friday night, and a funeral is to be held Saturday afternoon at Youngs Island Church in Eulonia, Georgia.

Russell Toler Sr. and Isenhower were divorced.

Also killed were Guy Heinze Sr., 45 and Brenda Gail Falagan, 49, police said.

"They're the ones who walked in on that, so you know it wears on the police as well," he said. Referring to Isenhower, he added, "It has been a long week for her. She's lost all of her family, so naturally it would be."

Police have not said how the victims died, although autopsies were completed Monday.

Doering acknowledged that there is fear in the community but said that releasing details of the slayings won't allay it.

"We, too, have that same fear. We're the ones that have to get out there and try to make people feel better as best that we can," he said.
