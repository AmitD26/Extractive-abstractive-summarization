Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen play comedians in "Funny People."

Let's have a hand, then, for Judd Apatow. Hollywood's most successful contemporary comedy producer isn't resting on his laurels but continues to push toward risky subject matter: male sexual insecurity in "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," unwanted pregnancy in "Knocked Up" -- and now the big C.

It feels natural that Simmons -- faced with his dire prognosis -- should return to the comedy circuit to wrestle with his imminent extinction before a roomful of strangers, even as he decides to keep his condition a secret from everyone around him.

It's actually not so hard in his case because he doesn't have any real friends, only "showbiz friends."

The exception is Ira Wright (Rogen), a struggling young comic who lucks into a job as his hero's joke writer slash personal assistant. Simmons is by turns demanding, generous, friendly and abusive, and Ira couldn't be happier.

The cross-currents are intriguing: He's getting his first taste of the high life, just as George is trying to savor his last days by reliving his first steps on the circuit.

There's even an Andy Dick joke, in the form of Andy Dick himself -- one of several celebrity cameos, the oddest of which is surely Eminem, wondering aloud if George wouldn't be better off dead.

There's plenty of funny stuff here. Bana has a ball as the obtuse Aussie, but despite all the blue jokes, this is a more modulated, pensive effort than Apatow's previous hits.

His instincts are generous. He wants to give us the six-course meal, and to go around the table, give everybody the chance to tell us a funny story. As a result "Funny People" is consistently entertaining but also rather grueling -- as if we're watching two or three different movies at the same time. At least one of these -- the tribulations of the young roomies -- we've seen before, and amusing as these guys are, they properly belong in the deleted scenes category.

Still, if you're not averse to too much of a good-ish thing, and can stomach another of those terminal Hollywood illnesses that leaves the patient with no discernible ill-effects, "Funny People" is a fairly shrewd and nonjudgmental dissection of how celebrity skews and contaminates even the most intimate relationships.

The rich and famous aren't the only narcissists in this game, it seems. We're all a bit funny that way.

"Funny People" is rated R and runs 146 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.
