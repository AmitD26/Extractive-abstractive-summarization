(Sunset) -- '"I had such a crush on him when I was a kid," says my friend Didi Linburn, pigtails peeking out from beneath her pink ski helmet rather than the wool pompom hat she wore as a kid. I peer into the tiny ski shop at the Alta Peruvian Lodge and catch a glimpse of a cute guy in glasses behind the counter. "No idea how old he is," she says, "but I've seen him here every winter since I was 15."

Twenty-two years later, and Didi and her teenage crush are still here? I've yet to even take a run down the powder white slopes, but I already sense that Alta, Utah, just might be as special as everyone says it is -- including my self-proclaimed "Altaholic" husband.

Tired of not getting an invite to his annual "guys' trip," and admittedly jealous about the other love in his life, I decided to tag along on Didi's annual father-daughter jaunt. And finally experience for myself this almighty Alta -- with just seven lifts (and not much else) spread across 2,200 acres of heart-pumping hikes and narrow chutes, chest-deep powder, and total lack of pretension.

Skis slung over our shoulders, we walk out the weathered wooden door of the lodge, taking in a deep breath of fresh -- albeit thin -- mountain air.

I'm instantly happy to be here at 10,550 feet, on leased U.S. Forest Service land at the resolutely un-corporate resort, where faded one-pieces outnumber Bogner jackets, chairlifts seat at most four across, and five no-frills lodges, scattered up Little Cottonwood Canyon, sleep 1,200 skiers, tops. Skiers. Not shoppers. Not ski bunnies. Sunset.com: Plan your trip to Alta

And, above all, not snowboarders.

Didi's dad smiles. "Still the best snow in the West." A whopping 500 inches annually of light-as-a-feather powder -- and I can't wait to try it.

But that will take some effort. Without a convenient tram to Alta's best terrain, the limited number of skiers allowed uphill work for every turn with an almost perverse pleasure. As a typically lazy, play-it-safe sort of skier, I'm intimidated.

Is this really worth it?

But, unlike most of the longtime guests, who remain fiercely loyal to "their" lodge, never venturing steps away to check out another, I'm curious and leave Didi a few nights later for Alta's Rustler Lodge, where things are a tad more civilized (read: pricey).

Now I have a television and my own bathroom, and reservations are taken for the window-walled dining room, where the next morning, I overhear a waiter bellow "Welcome back!" to guest Roger Urban, who has been staying here since his bachelor days. He and his wife -- looking very '80s (like the lodge) in their matching rainbow-striped rugbys -- fuel up at the breakfast buffet, while their teenage daughter, Alexandra, heads out for a lesson with the same instructor she's always had.

Alta never changes

And so, because people never leave Alta, it's only natural that they grow old here. Not in the typical, canasta-by-the-pool way of growing old. Rather, Alta is like a real-life "Cocoon," where the mountain is the fountain of youth. Senior passes start at age 80.

As we climb, once again, toward Devil's Castle, a father whizzes by with a tiny skier bouncing on his shoulders. "Daddy? Are we at Devil's Castle yet?" He hikes as far as possible, plops his daughter in knee-deep powder, and off she goes: a 4-year-old making fresh tracks. I watch, dumbfounded.

And determined. I decide to hike out as far as I can. I want those fresh tracks, and this time I'm willing to work for them. Heart racing, legs aching, I reach the end of the ridge. I rest for a moment and then dip in. Flying solo through feet of untouched powder, carving near-perfect turns, snow spraying like the pros, I realize that I'm floating. This is it. This is why I've come to Alta. Sunset.com: Top 10 hotels for nature lovers

Later that evening, lounging around the Peruvian lobby after dinner -- with Scrabble, impromptu sing-alongs, nothing to face tomorrow but more fresh snow -- I get the feeling I'm continuing a tradition at risk of being lost forever to the fast-paced, froufrou world beyond Little Cottonwood Canyon.
