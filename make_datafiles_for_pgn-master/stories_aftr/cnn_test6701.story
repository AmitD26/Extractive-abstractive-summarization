LONDON, England (CNN) -- In a tough job market, MBA graduates seeking top-tier jobs are turning to a career networking site created by and catering to young professionals.

Doostang gets its name from the Latin for "reaching for talent."

The site offers its members access to selective jobs that are not really available on the open market, according to founder Mareza Larizadeh.

It's able to do that because recruiting managers are drawn by the caliber of its members, which includes students from the top business schools, he says.

Schools like The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Duke University's Fuqua School of Business have formed partnerships with Doostang that enable their students to access the network's premium job listings for free.

Larizadeh never intended to launch a career start-up. He was completing his MBA at Stanford University in 2005 when he got the idea for Doostang, which is a modified version of "reaching for talent" in Latin.

Classmates were exchanging emails about career advice, and "I thought, why don't we give this some structure?" he recalls.

Four years and a round of venture capital funding later, what started as a hobby designed to help friends share career information has turned into a network with approximately 600,000 members.

In an age where social networking sites abound, Doostang sets itself apart by taking closely knit relationships developed offline in B-school and leveraging them online to make a better job searching experience, Larizadeh says.

Larizadeh believes it isn't just the quality of people and jobs that distinguishes Doostang from other careers sites like LinkedIn and executive search service The Ladders.

Employers advertising positions on the site range from white shoe firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to Silicon Valley titans Google and Facebook.

Users initially had to be invited to join the network, but now Doostang is open to everyone. Members, however, have to pay for access to the most exclusive job postings.

The fee for premium services, which gives access to the more exclusive job postings, ranges from $25 to $40 a month.
