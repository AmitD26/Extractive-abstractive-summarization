The report by the Government Accountability Office found wide variation in the medical centers' facilities and programs for female veterans.

The department says it is taking comprehensive steps to improve, including programs for primary care and mental health care for female veterans, along with having a female veterans' program manager in each of its medical facilities.

But Veterans Affairs faces hurdles in its efforts to improve its services and facilities, the department's chief consultant for women's medical care testified before Congress on Tuesday.

"Moving to a more comprehensive primary care delivery model could challenge VA clinicians, who may have dealt predominantly with male veterans and sometimes have little or no exposure to female patients," said Patricia Hayes of the department's Women's Veterans Health Strategic Healthcare Group.

There is a goal to have a gynecologist available at every facility by 2012, she said.

And Dennis Cullinan, national legislative director for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, noted that Veterans Affairs has contracted out to provide female veterans care in the facilities where there are not in-house providers.

There are more than 1.8 million female veterans in the United States, 8 percent of the veteran population. In 2008, more than 281,000 female veterans received care from Veterans Affairs, according to the department's statistics.

The number of female veterans enrolled for medical care with the department is expected to increase by 30 percent in the next five years, it predicts.

Hayes said the department can offer female veterans better care than they would receive in private practices.

"Women are screened for unique health concerns like cervical cancer or breast cancer at higher rates than non-VA health care programs," she noted.

None of the facilities visited was fully compliant with the department's standards for privacy, investigators found, including privacy in the check-in area.

"In most clinical settings, check-in desk or windows were located in a mixed-gender waiting room or on a high-traffic public corridor," the report explained. In a majority of the clinics, "check-in desk were located in close proximity to chairs where other patients waited for their appointment."

And only two of the facilities provided sanitary napkin dispensers in at least one public restroom for women.
