Raymond Clark III was arrested Thursday and charged with murder in the death of Annie Le.

One researcher said he often went by the lab in the Yale School of Medicine building where Le was found strangled and stuffed in a wall. Lufeng Zhang worked with Clark, he said, and thinks the police may have the wrong man.

"He's a nice man, always," he said.

Clark, 24, the same age as Le, was a technician in the school of medicine's Animal Resources Center. While Le, who was pursuing a doctorate in pharmacology, conducted experiments on mice, Clark took care of the rodents and cleaned their cages.

"They work in the same building, passed in the hallways," New Haven Police Chief James Lewis said of Le and Clark. "Anything beyond that, I won't talk about."

Though details of the investigation are scant, police said they arrested Clark on Thursday and charged him with Le's murder after collecting more than 250 pieces of evidence.

High school friend Lisa Heselin remembers Clark "as a jokester, kind of a class clown," she said. "Everybody knew him. Everybody liked him."

"They can't believe it, and then, of course, you're reminiscing, like, 'Oh my God, remember when we went over to his house and we all hung out?' You don't expect somebody you grew up with to be involved in something like this," Heselin said.

Maurice Perry, who said he has been friends with Clark since first grade, told CNN on Thursday night that he doesn't believe his longtime pal is guilty.

Asked if he ever knew Clark to be violent, Perry replied, "Not at all. I've known him to be outgoing, happy, athletic, fun. Violent, not at all."

Most of his current neighbors in Middletown, about 30 miles northeast of New Haven, said they moved in after Clark or knew him only in passing. Many said he shared the second-floor apartment with his girlfriend and a dog.

Rowe also remembered the first time she met his dog.

Police arrived at his apartment Tuesday night to collect DNA samples and released him into the custody of his lawyer early Wednesday. Neighbors say they didn't see him return to the apartment.  See investigation's timeline »

Clark was arrested early Thursday at a Super 8 motel in nearby Cromwell.

"My boyfriend, Ray, if you don't know him, has no interest in any of the other girls at [the Yale Animal Resources Center] as anything more than friends," she reportedly wrote.

She said Clark had a "big heart" and tried to see the best in people, even if he didn't always make the best decisions.

"He is a bit naive, doesn't always use the best judgment, definitely is not the best judge of character, but he is a good guy," she reportedly wrote."He thinks everyone deserves a second chance and has a hard time hurting people's feelings, and it takes him getting burned to learn."

"I have always wanted to catch up with him, but I didn't want this to happen for me to try to find out how he was doing," he said.

Clark is being held on $3 million bond, Lewis said, but he would not provide details of what prompted Clark's arrest or whether DNA linked Clark to Le's murder.
