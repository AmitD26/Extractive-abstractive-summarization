Ohno, who won gold at Salt Lake City in 2002, looked to be out of the medals as Jung-Su Lee, Si-Bak Sung and Ho-Suk Lee were poised to complete a clean sweep in the men's short-track race.

The 27-year-old Ohno earned his sixth Winter Olympics medal, making him the most successful U.S. male competitor as he overtook long-track star Eric Heiden, and leaving him equal overall with female skating legend Bonnie Blair.

Jung-Su Lee had edged out Ohno in winning their semifinal, with his fellow Koreans coming top in theirs.

Her points tally of 26.63 lifted her above Heil's 25.69, which gave hosts Canada a first medal, with U.S. national champion Bahrke tallying 25.43 to add to her silver medal from Turin in 2002.

Ski-jumping

Switzerland's Simon Ammann earlier claimed the first gold medal of the 2010 Games when he won the opening men's ski-jumping event on Saturday, while Dutch skater Sven Kramer took out the first title on ice in a record time.

The 28-year-old Ammann secured his third career Olympic victory, following two golds in 2002, as he triumphed in the normal hill competition.

Ammann led after the first round and then, as the last man to leap in the final session, produced a huge jump of 108 meters at Whistler Olympic Park.

He finished with a total of 276.5 points to push Poland's Adam Malysz into the silver medal position.

Malysz had been on top after a jump of 105 meters which, when boosted by the style judges' marks, put him ahead of bronze medal winner Gregor Schlierenzauer of Austria, who had leaped 106.5 meters.

Speedskating

Kramer earned the 5,000 meters speed skating title with an Olympic record time of six minutes and 14.60 seconds.

The 23-year-old world champion went one better than his silver medal at Turin 2006 as he finished 2.35 seconds ahead of South Korea's Lee Seung-Hoon.

"I started fast, but I was dying in the end. It was probably my hardest and best race ever," Kramer said.

The first women's gold medal of the Games was claimed by Slovakia's Anastazia Kuzmina, who triumphed in the biathlon 7.5 kilometer sprint event.

She became the first athlete from the East European nation to win at a Winter Olympics, with her winning time of 19 minutes and 55.6 seconds heading off Germany's Magdalena Neuner in second place (19:57.1).

Marie Dorin of France won bronze in the event, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting, with a time of 20:06.5.

Ice Hockey

Hosts and defending champions Canada demolished Slovakia 18-0 in Saturday's other Group A fixture to break the record they set in defeating Italy 16-0 in 2006.

Alpine skiing

Skiing's blue riband event was supposed to open the program, but overnight snow and rain followed by mild temperatures made conditions unsuitable.
