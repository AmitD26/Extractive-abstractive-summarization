Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thousands of anti-government protesters defied an order Sunday to disperse from the capital's commercial center, but the government said it would use negotiation -- not force -- to get them to comply.

A spokesman for the government's peacekeeping operations, Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd, said that the protesters had "incited and created a situation which has caused great inconvenience to the conduct of business and the pursuit of normal activity."

He said that the gathering was not considered to be a "peaceful demonstration sanctioned by the constitution."

He said his administration is negotiating with the protesters to peacefully disperse and that the government did not intend to use force.

The two sides met for meetings on March 28 and 29, but they ended in a stalemate.

The demonstrators are supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. Thaksin was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full term and remains hugely popular.

He fled the country in 2008 while facing trial on corruption charges that he says were politically motivated. The protesters say Abhisit was not democratically elected and have demanded that he call elections.
