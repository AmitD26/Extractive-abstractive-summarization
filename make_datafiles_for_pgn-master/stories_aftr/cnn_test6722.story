Rava said that medical supplies and resources have improved, but the crush of volunteer doctors in Port-au-Prince can complicate treatment in the city while there is great need for help in other places hit by the earthquake.

The general hospital has nine operating rooms, but a near platoon of volunteer surgeons. That leaves many standing by for work, though there are relatively few nurses.

"We are all well-staffed," Dr. Paul Auerbach of Stanford University told the group. "The issue is coordinating."

Among the problems with the large number of doctors, Auerbach said, is that patients can have their dressings opened three or four times in close succession as one and then another crew of doctors come to evaluate their wounds.

To change that, charity groups have set up shifts and literally drawn lines, sketching maps on hospital walls showing who is working where. They are also identifying medical centers outside Port-au-Prince, where there is need for the booming supply of doctors in the capital.

Space is also an issue. A team from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is carefully assessing the buildings that survived on hospital grounds, trying to find a stable place for post-operative care. Patients now recover in tents or are taken to other hospitals.

As the city's main hospital is brimming with doctors, it is in need of nurses and physical therapists.

Thousands of amputees will need significant, specialized help from physical therapists, but few are available.

Nurses are in short supply. A nursing school on the grounds of the general hospital was crushed in the earthquake, killing some of the people who would be giving care now. The flood of outside volunteers is mostly doctors, not nurses.

Those on the ground advise doctors who want to help Haiti to wait and volunteer in a few weeks or months.
