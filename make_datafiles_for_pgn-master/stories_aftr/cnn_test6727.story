(CNN) -- When J.R. Martinez returned from serving in Iraq, he never thought he'd see his name on the marquee at the local restaurant -- but there it was, a welcome-home banner at the Applebee's in Dalton, Georgia.

More than 40 percent of J.R. Martinez's body was burned in a land mine explosion in Iraq.

But Martinez, 25, has never let the severe burns he received while serving in the United States Army stop him.

Nicole Lapin: You told your mom you'd come back in one piece. You're obviously back in one piece. You came back burned. What happened?

The other three guys, the other three soldiers walked away with minor injuries, which I'm thankful for every single day. I was trapped inside the vehicle for about ten minutes, conscious and can literally see my life slipping away from me. You know, my mother is my best friend and I kind of had the visual of my mother, and them handing her a flag and I thought to myself, that's not something I want to put my mother through.

So it's one of those things where we don't know how strong we are until we're faced with things in life and I got through it.

Martinez: Well, when I was a young child, one of my sisters passed away from an illness she was born with. She was born in Central America and I was born here in the United States and I never met her, but I always felt the connection throughout my whole childhood. I felt the connection with my sister and I was confused as to why.

And the day of my injury when I was inside the vehicle and I can literally see my life slipping away, an actual visual of my sister came to me and told me I was going to be OK and told me I'd be fine. And after that sweet whisper went away, they pulled me out of the vehicle and got me immediately into the medical team's hands.

So I guess you could say faith, my sister, my mother -- all the things that kind of kept me grounded as a young child that my mother instilled in me at a young age: to be strong and to hold on to certain things in life because they'll get you through.

Martinez: Yeah, you just do it. All of us had it inside us. We just don't know it until we're faced with it and that's when the true strength really shows.

Martinez: Yeah, I'm definitely human and there are a lot of bad days. Even being in the soap opera world, there are still days where you wake up and you're like, "Here we go again."

Lapin: We're looking at a picture of you in a soap opera right now, "All My Children." J.R., sitting in that hospital bed watching soap operas with your mother, did you ever think you'd actually be in one?

Martinez: You know, it's funny. You've got to be careful what you wish for in life. When I was in the hospital I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything. I was basically at the hands of medical staff and my mother, and every night my mother would watch novela, the Spanish soap opera.

And there wasn't nothing I could do about it. So I just sat there. And finally I just got to a point where I'm just going to take it in and watch TV with her. And one day out of a joke I said, "One day I'm going to be on a soap opera, mom."

Lapin: So you had a little premonition.

Martinez: Yeah, so you've got to be careful what you wish for in life because you never know what can happen.

Lapin: [Another viewer] has a question. He wants to know, "Your story is amazing. I wanted to ask you if it has been tough to relive the terrible pain of your real life during your filming of 'All My Children'?"

Martinez: A lot of us, we go through things in life sometimes and we don't want to sit there and go back to remember it, but it's good to go back and remember it and it's good to talk about it, whether it's to yourself or a piece of paper or whether it's to an audience or a camera like I am doing right now.
