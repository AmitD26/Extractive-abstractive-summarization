(CNN) -- "We will restore science to its rightful place."

When those words came out of President Obama's mouth during his inaugural speech, public health nerds such as myself rejoiced heartily. We believe that policy, especially health policy, should be based on scientific evidence. Funny, then, that we ignore this important piece of evidence: When scientific facts go up against moral ideologies, ideology usually wins.

I've worked for more than a decade in the field of HIV prevention. That means working with sex and drugs -- two areas where there is no shortage of good science, and an abundance of ideology.

Iran has one of the world's better prevention programs inside its jails, and sterile needles are available to injectors from dispensing machines around Tehran. The Kyrgyz Republic gives clean needles to prisoners. China makes needles available to injectors through pharmacies at subsidized prices.

That's harder to do in a democracy; if you do something upsetting to the majority of voters now, you won't be around to reap the benefits of your far-sighted action in the future. It's hardly surprising, then, that for the last 20 years, the U.S. Congress put politically popular ideology ahead of science, denying federal funding for needle exchanges. (Congress repealed the ban last year.)

At the local level, though, things often look different. Many cities, realizing that they would have to pick up the pieces of the nation's failed war on drugs, have scraped out their pockets and provided services to injectors. The result has been a huge decline in new HIV infections among drug users and their sex partners; the burden on the health system has of course fallen, too.

In my little corner of public health, the Obama administration is following through on its promise to put the science back into policy. Since the ban on federal funding for safe injecting programs was dropped in December, the sky has not fallen, and if the government falls, it certainly won't be because of this small piece of pragmatism.

But two decades of banging the "evidence-based" drum does make me think that we scientists need to learn from the evidence. Scientifically sound solutions can only be implemented where they can be made politically workable.
