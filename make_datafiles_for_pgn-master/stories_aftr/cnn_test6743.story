Okaloosa Island, Florida (CNN) -- If you could have painted the day, it would have been a Monet. A white sandy beach, blue sky and a green ocean that you may have only seen in dreams.

The only thing out of place were the BP contractors in green shirts and yellow rubber boots, with shovels, rakes and of course, the oil.

"If I see anything out there that concerns us, we may rethink that, but so far it looks good," he told CNN.

Matt Minardi and his family came from Athens for the beach, not the tar balls. They're getting a lot of the beach, and fortunately, only a few tar balls.

"And we're cleaning up. We had some oil ... and we picked it up, just like that," he said.

"We didn't feel like trying to arrange something else, and we also felt like we should come down and support this community, too, cause they definitely are feeling the effects of this," he said.

That's why local officials are quick to get the cleanup crews to those limited places where the weathered crude has come ashore.

"Our operations are deployed to support this on a wartime footing," he told CNN.

Boaters flock to this sandbar in the Destin Pass, to hang out and listen to the floating band. And, while they weren't overly distracted by oil, the thought of BP CEO Tony Hayward on his yacht this past weekend raised the blood pressure of some and was a bit of a head scratcher for others.

"He's probably in some really clean water. No oil. So, he's not trying to stop the oil leak," said one man.

Johnny Springfield has lived here for 20 years. He says his boating business is down 60 to 70 percent, but his anger is a little on the high side.

"You kind of have to look at that two ways," he explained. "One. He was relaxing and he was out on his boat, and we hate that. But on the good side of things, he wasn't down here runnin' his mouth."
