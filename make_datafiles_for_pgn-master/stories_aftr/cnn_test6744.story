(CNN) -- Seattle's character and history are closely linked to its waterside location, so it makes sense to start your sightseeing at the Waterfront.

Experience the Experience Music Project/Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame.

More than just an outstanding farmers market, Pike Place is in many ways the beating heart of Seattle. Browse the farm-fresh produce and traditional crafts, and banter with the infamous salmon-tossing fishmongers, whose tourist-pleasing antics mix market trading with street theatre.

The city's skyline is dominated by the incongruous, spindly Space Needle, part of the Seattle Center, built for the 1962 World's Fair. To get there, take the monorail, another World's Fair remnant, from the Westlake Center (Pine Street at 4th Avenue). Ride a glass elevator to the 160-meter-high observation deck for an incredible view of the city and its surroundings.

Finally, make time to stroll around the Capitol Hill and Fremont neighborhoods for a taste of the non-conformist "alternative Seattle" that brought the world Grunge and made plaid shirts fashionable.
