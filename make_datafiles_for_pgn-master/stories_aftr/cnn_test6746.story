Osh, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- The flow of refugees fleeing southern Kyrgyzstan has gone from a flood to a trickle, the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry said.

Uzbekistan authorities said even though the flow of people had slowed down they were still dealing with an estimated 120,000 refugees. Aid workers were calling the fallout from ethnic clashes in Kyrgyzstan a humanitarian crisis.

No one from Kyrgyzstan's interim government had made official contact  with them since refugees flooded into their country, the Uzbekistan  Foreign Ministry said.

The violence between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks had calmed down earlier this week after more than 170 people were killed and more than 1,400 were wounded.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov from London on Wednesday, thanking Karimov for his help with the humanitarian situation, according to a statement from Ban's office.

The secretary-general promised assistance to affected people in southern Kyrgyzstan and those seeking refuge in Uzbekistan, and said he intended to consult with key members of the U.N. Security Council upon his return to New York later Wednesday.

One U.N. plane, loaded with tons of tents, landed in the area Wednesday and others were on the way. Several countries, including the United States, Germany and Russia, have also sent aid.

Francois Blancy, deputy head of the Red Cross regional office in Uzbekistan, said more aid is needed.
