(CNN) -- Hours after the arrest of a suspect, thousands of friends, family and fellow officers gathered Saturday to pay tribute to two slain Florida policemen.

Morris surrendered after a third party tipped off police, said Police Chief Jane Castor. Police also arrested 22-year-old Cortnee Brantly, the woman believed to have been driving the car at the time of the shooting, Castor said.

"This has brought us a sense of closure, and I pray the arrest brings a level of peace to the families of the officers," she said.

At the funeral, Castor spoke of the "inherently dangerous" nature of law enforcement.

Bagpipes played "Amazing Grace" as a procession of uniformed officers and family members filled Idlewild Baptist Church. A riderless horse stood as a powerful symbol of the fallen.

Castor said the two women were supposed to have met for the first time at a party planned for Saturday night. Instead, she said, their lives became inextricably linked Tuesday by tragedy.

"We wanted to have a place where we could come under one roof as a city and a family and as friends to mourn, to grieve, to cry," he said. "Maybe even to laugh, and to honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for us this day."

Castor said Brantly was arrested by Hillsborough County sheriff's deputies in Brandon and is facing federal charges of witnessing a felony, and not reporting it.

Running a criminal history check, Curtis found that Morris had an outstanding warrant for a worthless check out of Jacksonville. He called for backup, and Kocab responded. Police said as the two officers tried to arrest the suspect, he pulled out a gun and shot them.

After the shooting, Castor called Morris "a cold-blooded killer." She reiterated that Friday night.

Mayor Pamela Lorio said she was "thankful that we have been able to arrest him before the Saturday funeral. Tonight, everyone in Tampa can sleep easier because Dontae Morris is off the street."

The funeral lasted several hours. When it ended those in attendance stood in silence as the coffin-draped caskets were placed into awaiting hearses. And tears mixed with the rain that had fallen.
