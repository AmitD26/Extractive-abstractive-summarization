MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- A killer bug is spreading like wildfire.

Streets of one of the world's biggest cities are eerily empty. Bars and restaurants have been shuttered for days.

The president goes on TV to tell workers to stay at home for their own safety.

It may sound like a sci-fi movie. It's not. Welcome to Mexico City.

Government orders to its citizens are clear: wash frequently, don't shake hands or kiss, and stay away from crowded places.

That's easier said than done.

The doors on the subway car snap open at Hidalgo station. Dozens more passengers clad in surgical masks stream on.

It's rush hour deep below the streets of downtown Mexico City.

"I'm pretty nervous of this whole virus thing," welder Frontino Valdez mumbled  through one of the masks.  Watch passengers packed onto trains trying to protect themselves »

Sitting one carriage down, Berta Hernandez, a product demonstrator, tries not to show her panic and applies eyeliner like any other morning. But today she has a problem, she has no intention of lifting her mask to paint on lip gloss.

This has been a strange epidemic since the outset. So far, the Mexican government has been unable to pinpoint where or when this outbreak started.

Authorities admit there was an outbreak of influenza in a village in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz in early April. But only one patient -- 5-year-old Edgar Hernandez -- was diagnosed as having swine flu.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta ask the boy about his symptoms »

The authorities haven't drawn up a genetic map of Edgar's illness nor compared it to the lethal strain that swept through Mexico City and other parts of the country.

Lethal it is. But getting to the truth of who has really died from the virus is tough.

Since midweek, the government abandoned its initial reporting and began to speak only of confirmed swine flu cases and confirmed deaths due to the H1N1 virus. Previously it had also tallied suspected cases and others under observation.

In practice, it is taking days for the government to get test results from autopsies and tests. By the time a case is confirmed the patient may be long buried.

One afternoon this week, at a cinder block home perched on a hillside in a poor northern neighborhood of Mexico City, a coffin was mounted on the living room table. A steady stream of neighbors filed in to pay their final tribute to a dead 24-year-old.

Biting back tears, a young man said his brother had died of "respiratory problems." When asked what kind of a person his brother was, he said simply: "He was an honest man. He never got in any trouble."

The following day came a tip-off that a 5-year-old girl, Maria Fernanda Garcia, had died. The modest side street outside her home in eastern Mexico City was swarming with police, health workers and civil protection officials.  Watch how armed guards were part of Maria Fernanda's funeral »

Little Maria Fernanda's father appeared briefly and told us we weren't welcome. He was curt when he told us his daughter had died from pneumonia.

A medic confirmed the specific cause of death was indeed pneumonia. But he added the hospital was still waiting for test results to confirm whether the underlying cause was swine flu. He conceded that process could take days.

A few minutes later, the hearse with Maria Fernanda's body pulled out of the housing complex where she lived. Her dad was clutching a Winnie Pooh cuddly toy as he rode up front.

Police and health officials shadowed the funeral cortege to the graveyard. Police guards only permitted immediate family and close friends through the iron gates.

Later that afternoon, the family had left Maria Fernanda's grave -- a tiny patch of newly dug dry earth, not much more than 3 feet long.

"Maria Fernanda. 2004 to 2009. We love you."
