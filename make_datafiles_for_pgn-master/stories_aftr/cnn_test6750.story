James headlines a list of marquee names who also are free-agents-to-be or likely free agents this summer, including Miami's Dwyane Wade, Toronto's Chris Bosh, Phoenix's Amare Stoudamire, Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki and Atlanta's Joe Johnson.

King asked James about reports that he, Wade, Bosh, Johnson and others were planning to talk to each other before they settled on where to go.

"I don't know to that extent, but it will be fun," James said. "It will be fun to get all the free agents together and figure out a way how we can make the league better."

James, a six-time NBA all-star, was named the league's MVP for the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 seasons. He's averaged 27.8 points per game, and he has helped the Cavaliers to five playoff appearances and one trip to the NBA finals.

But he's still seeking his first NBA title, and the Cavaliers were bounced from the second round of this year's playoffs by the Boston Celtics. He told King his goal is to be with a team that can win more than one NBA championship.

"I understand that me going down as one of the greats will not happen until I win a championship," he said. "I'm going to do what's best for me and my family."

The interview is scheduled to be shown on CNN's "Larry King Live" at 9 p.m. ET Friday.
