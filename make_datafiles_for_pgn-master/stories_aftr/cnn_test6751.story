(CNN) -- Police say a Camden, New Jersey, man had the audacity to return to the jail where he posted a $400 bond with counterfeit bills, demanding a refund.

Ronald T. White was charged with shoplifting July 7, but his bail was incorrectly written up. When he found out, authorities say, he returned to the Cinnaminson, New Jersey, jail the following week to demand his money back.

"Even though it was a $5,000 warrant for his arrest, they have bigger issues over in Camden, being the murder capital of the world," Fowler said.

White had posted bail using at least two bills bearing identical serial numbers, police say, and the serial numbers also matched those on one of the bills found on him when he returned to the Cinnaminson jail to reclaim his extra $200.

Upon further inspection, Fowler said, the counterfeit bills White used to post bail were of poor paper quality, although the printing appeared very accurate. The duplicate serial numbers were the giveaway, he said. "He was surprised that he was discovered," Fowler said.

Burlington County prosecutor's office representative Joel Bewley said that because White did not produce the counterfeit bills but merely attempted to purchase goods with them, the official charge was theft by unlawful taking.
