PLACERVILLE, California (CNN) -- A California couple charged with a combined 29 felony counts in connection with the kidnapping and rape of Jaycee Dugard appeared in court for a bond hearing Monday.

Phillip and Nancy Garrido, wearing red jail coveralls, were flanked by their attorneys. They appeared to glance at each other only briefly. Phillip Garrido wore a bandage on the side of his nose.

The couple had been held without bail, but Phillip Garrido's defense attorney requested that bail be set for him Monday. El Dorado County Superior Court Judge Douglas Phimister set his bond at $30 million.  Watch the Garridos at the hearing Â»

Nancy Garrido's attorney told Phimister that she was not contesting her no-bond status, although she might ask that bond be set in the future.

Phillip Garrido will undergo a psychiatric evaluation, a common step for defendants. Nancy Garrido's attorney said he was attempting to schedule one for her as well.

Both Garridos previously pleaded not guilty to the charges. They face a combined 29 felony counts; 26 counts name only one of them -- 13 for each -- and both are named in three.

Pierson acknowledged Monday that "very legitimate questions" have been raised about Garrido's release and supervision. "Those are issues which I'm confident will be addressed in a proper venue at a proper time," he said.

But Pierson praised Garrido's current parole officer for helping to bring about his capture, breaking through his "elaborate, well-planned cover story that was 18 years in the making." The parole officer summoned Garrido to his office after being tipped off by University of California-Berkeley police, who considered Garrido suspicious and questioned why he was on campus with two young girls. Those girls later were shown to be his daughters by Dugard.

Asked about a possible statute of limitations on the Garridos' alleged crimes, Pierson said it was complicated, but prosecutors have examined the issue and "we're confident we're not going to have a problem in this case."

He said he did not know whether a grand jury would be convened in the case, and did not rule out additional charges against the Garridos. He would not speculate on when the two might stand trial, saying, "in a perfect world, the criminal justice system would move much more quickly than it does."

Both the Garridos, if convicted, would face "multiple life terms," he said.

The fragment, which was analyzed by an outside expert, will go on to the state DNA lab for testing, according to an e-mail from Jimmy Lee, director of public affairs for the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office.

"The expert has determined that the bone fragment found in the backyard of Garrido's neighbor is probably human," Lee said.

Police in Hayward, California, are trying to determine whether Garrido is linked to the 1988 kidnapping of Michaela Garecht, Hayward Police Lt. Chris Orrey said earlier this month.

Garecht and Dugard were of similar age and appearance, both were abducted in daylight, and a sketch of a suspect resembled Garrido, Orrey said.

Garrido was convicted of kidnapping and raping Katie Callaway Hall in 1976. He was released from prison after serving 10 years of a 50-year sentence. He was labeled a sex offender and put on lifetime parole.
