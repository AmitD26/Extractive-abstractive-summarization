(CNN) -- Wildlife researchers in Sri Lanka have photographed one of the world's most reclusive primates for the first time.

Conservationists feared the species had become extinct during a 63-year gap between sightings from 1939 to 2002.

Research leader Saman Gamage said more than 1,000 nocturnal studies in 120 different forest areas had been conducted as part of the study.

"This discovery is a great reward for the ongoing field research we undertake across much of south-western Sri Lanka," Gamage said.

ZSL Conservation biologist Dr. Craig Turner said the study was the first close examination of a Horton Plains slender loris ever conducted.

The pictures show a 20-centimeter long male adult sitting on a forest branch forest. Conservationists have discovered it appears to have shorter and sturdier limbs than other loris; a possible adaptation for the cooler, high-altitude montane -- or cloud -- forest in which it lives.

"The discovery improves our knowledge of this species, but we need to focus our efforts on the conservation and restoration of the remaining montane forest where this species still exists. Currently this accounts for less than one percent of the land area of Sri Lanka."
