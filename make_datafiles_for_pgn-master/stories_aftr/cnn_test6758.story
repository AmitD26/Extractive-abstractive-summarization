"I know that there are a lot of people who are suffering, and my oath, my commitment to them, doesn't end," former Lt. Dan Choi told CNN's Don Lemon.

Choi was arrested in March for handcuffing himself to a White House fence in protest of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, which bars people who are openly gay or lesbian from serving in the military.

"One thing about honor, one thing about dignity -- it's not dependent on what's written on a document," he said. "That comes from standing up and being truthful to who you are."

He also vowed to "continue to speak up for those people who cannot."

"I'm going to continue to pressure those who purport to be our friends -- whether they're congressmen, senators or the president himself. If they make a promise, I will hold them to it."

President Barack Obama is pushing for a repeal of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. A bill that would overturn the measure after a Pentagon review is completed in December is currently before Congress.
