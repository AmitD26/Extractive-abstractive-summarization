Hugh Jackman emerges as Wolverine in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," which opened Friday.

Actor Hugh Jackman and film producer Lauren Shuler Donner recently sat down for a candid conversation about their new film, "X-Men Origins: Wolverine."

Specifically, the pair talked about the scene in which Jackman's character is transformed from a simple mutant with bony claws that periodically protrude from the back of his hands to an invincible mutant filled with an indestructible metal called adamantium.

This scene represents the ultimate birth of a comic legend as the character is transformed from Logan to Wolverine.  Watch the scene in which Wolverine is unleashed Â»

Lauren Shuler Donner: There were many things he had to do in the tank, you know. One of them was he had to be lowered, and then the needles had to come towards him.

They finally devised this toe method where, if Gavin pulled on Hugh's big toe, it meant the things are coming, the second toe is this, the last toe is rise up, very sophisticated. (laughter)

Donner: There's an iconic drawing of Wolverine coming out of the tank in the comics with the things popping out of him and his hair all over him in a rage, and we wanted to be that image. That's the image we wanted for the fans.
