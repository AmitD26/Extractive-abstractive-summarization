Federer, the top seed ahead of world No. 1 Rafael Nadal -- who reached the semis by beating sixth seed Robin Soderling -- later revealed that he had been hampered by injuries.

"Under the circumstances, I think I played a decent match. But I've been feeling bad for the last two, three matches now. It's just not good and healthy to play under these kind of conditions. So if there's anything good about this, it's that I'm going to get some rest, that's for sure."

But Federer's game fell apart in the third set as Berdych took it 6-1 in just 27 minutes.

Another vital break in the fourth set took Berdych to the brink of victory, and he took his second match point to seal an impressive win.

It was only Federer's sixth defeat on Centre Court, but the former champion was still afforded a huge ovation as he waved to the crowd upon leaving the arena.

Berdych reached his second grand slam semifinal, having also reached the last four in Paris earlier this month before losing to eventual runner-up Soderling.

"So far it was the toughest game in my career to serve to close out the match."

Earlier, Djokovic brushed aside the challenge of Yen-Hsun Lu to clinch a place in the last four.

Djokovic told the BBC: "Nothing is easy these days especially at this stage of the tournament but the way I played I deserved to win. I hit all the shots, played the rallies and was solid from all parts of the court and I am very happy.

"I sincerely hope I can continue with this level of my game but you never know how you are going to wake up in two days but the way I am playing match after match is very encouraging.

"You have nothing to lose in the semifinals and definitely this time I am physically fitter than in my last one three years ago."

Nadal, who beat Federer in the final in 2008 but missed out on last year's event due to knee problems, was again too strong for Soderling as he followed up his Roland Garros triumph with another win over the Swede.

The Spaniard came from behind to win 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 6-1.

He will now face Andy Murray after the British fourth seed beat French No. 10 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-7 7-6 6-2 6-2.

After that, Tsonga capitulated and Murray wrapped up the third and fourth sets with the minimum of fuss.

Speaking of his clash with Nadal Murray told the BBC: "It will be a great match, it's always fun. I think we've played four times in Grand Slams and won two each. I'm looking forward to it."
