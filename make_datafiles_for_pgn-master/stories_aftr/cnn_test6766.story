Sirens went off in downtown Dallas as one funnel cloud was spotted in Cockrell Hill southwest of downtown, according to CNN affiliate WFAA.

Aerial footage from the area showed buildings in an industrial complex with walls knocked down and roofs blown off. The roof of a tractor-trailer truck in a parking lot was caved in by cement blocks blown from a nearby building.

There was one serious injury, Jason Evans of the fire department said. A truck driver's rig was picked up by the tornado, spun around and slammed into a warehouse. The driver was sitting in the cab of the truck when the front of the building collapsed on the truck.

Operations at Dallas' Love Field airport were shut down temporarily as a tornado approached the field, according to Lynn Lunsford of the Federal Aviation Administration. Tower personnel were preparing to evacuate when the tornado turned away at the last minute, Lunsford said.

"Tornadoes are a common phenomenon on the eastern side of landfalling tropical systems due to increased turning of the winds with height or vertical wind shear," Ward said.

At least one motorist in Austin was missing.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry directed the activation of state search-and-rescue capabilities, bringing in swift-water rescue teams, UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and other resources.

Aerial images showed scores of flooded streets and some rescues in Dallas.

Portions of Austin had endured 15 inches of rain, and a middle-age motorist was missing after her car was washed away, Emergency Management spokeswoman Reyne Telles said. The car was found.

"I haven't seen anything like this happen here before," said an employee at a County Line BBQ location near Bull Creek. "One of the boat docks washed away, and there are boats and cars stranded in the river." The restaurant was closed Wednesday but may reopen Thursday. The employee asked not to be identified.

As of 5 p.m. ET, Hermine was about 135 miles (215 kilometers) southwest of Oklahoma City. It had maximum sustained winds of 25 mph (40 kph) and was moving at 12 mph (19 kph).

"Additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 Inches with localized higher amounts can be expected through Thursday from eastern Texas and Oklahoma into Missouri and Arkansas," the National Hurricane Center said. Flash flood or flood warnings were in effect for much of those states.

Meanwhile, newly formed Tropical Storm Igor was bringing "squally" weather to the Cape Verde Islands on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said.

Tropical storm-force winds extended about 50 miles from Igor's center.

Forecast maps show Igor becoming a Category 2 hurricane early next week over the open Atlantic.
