The 80,000 capacity stadium will replace nearby Upton Park as West Ham's home but will retain its capability to host athletics events thanks to a commitment from the east London club to keep the running track in place.

Spurs proposed rebuilding a 60,000-seater, football-only venue on the same site but the plan failed to convince the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) who decide on the future use of the location.

"We have made a unanimous recommendation to back West Ham as the long-term tenant," OPLC chairwoman Margaret Ford said at a press conference.

"This represents the very best legacy for the stadium and for the communities of east London, and is a really good outcome for sport," she added.

The British government still have to finalise the confirmation of West Ham as tenants, but it is expected that they will do do in the coming weeks.

The soccer club maintained it was their promise, to retain the stadium's running track in line with the policy of 2012 organizers to leave an athletic legacy in the area, that helped clinch the decision.

"We have been working on this project for some time now and are just at the starting line of the race to make this a stadium that will really make the nation proud."

The news is a blow for fifth-placed top flight side Tottenham, who had wished to expand beyond their current facilities at White Hart Lane, with the financial help of American entertainment firm AEG.

Should the move become official, however, it is not the first time a Premier League club will have taken over an athletics stadium.
