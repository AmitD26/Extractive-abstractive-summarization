(CNN) -- FBI agents are traveling to Peru to study a laptop belonging to Joran Van der Sloot -- who was arrested twice in connection with the Natalee Holloway case, but was not charged -- according to a Lima court document.

A source close to the case told InSession the FBI will be searching for any clues that can help solve the Holloway case.

The Lima court document says the unnamed FBI agents will meet March 14 with two agents of the Peruvian National Police High Technology Crime Division at the Peruvian National Police Headquarters in Lima.

During the meeting they will have access to the computer's hard drive and will be able to conduct forensic examinations on it.

He is accused of first-degree murder and robbery in the case of 21-year-old Stephany Flores. Authorities found Flores' body in a Lima hotel room registered to him in June last year.

The lawyer for Van der Sloot said Monday he has asked the court to charge his client with the lesser offense of manslaughter in Flores' death.

"Violent emotion murder" is the equivalent of manslaughter in the United States.
