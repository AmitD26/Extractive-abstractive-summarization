Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Returning from a trip to Pyongyang, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il ready for a summit with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak at any time.

"Chairman Kim sent word that he is willing to negotiate with South Korea or United States ... on any subject at any time and without any preconditions," Carter told a news conference. "He specifically told us he is prepared for a summit directly with President Lee Myung-bak at any time to discuss issues between the two heads of state."

The dramatic declaration puts Lee on the spot: Seoul is currently declining official dialogue with North Korea until it takes responsibility for two fatal incidents last year.

In 2010, 50 South Koreans were killed in the two separate incidents: South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors. In November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians.

North Korea denies the torpedo attack on the warship Cheonan, though a Seoul-led international investigation has found a North Korean mini-submarine responsible.

Following a range of nuclear and missile tests, and Pyongyang's exposure last November of a uranium-based nuclear program -- a separate program from its earlier plutonium-based program -- the Obama administration is sanctioning Pyongyang and has also put official contacts on hold.

Asked if he expected Pyongyang to apologize to Seoul, Carter said; "My own assessment is that talks should begin without preconditions on either side. My opinion is North Koreans will not admit culpability for the sinking of the Cheonan and will not apologize."

Carter, 86 and his group had met North Korea's de facto head of state Kim Yong Nam, as well as its vice defense minister and foreign minister and other officials. The visit had been intended to promote North-South dialogue, revive a denuclearization process, and assess food shortages.

The delegation included former president of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, former Prime Minister of Norway, Gro Brundtland, and former president of Ireland, Mary Robinson. They are all members of "The Elders" a group of retired leaders founded by former South African leader Nelson Mandela who undertake peace-building initiatives and non-state diplomacy.

Regarding Kim's offer of dialogues, Carter said: "The Elders' desire is that under some circumstances, these offers will be accepted by the leaders of South Korea, the United States and other leaders of the six-party talks."

As for why he had not been able to meet Kim Jong Il personally, Carter responded: "We did request a chance to meet with him, and we did request an opportunity to meet with the president of South Korea. Neither were available to meet with us."

There had been criticism of Carter in South Korea for not raising human rights issues with the North, even though he did exactly that with South Korean leaders of the authoritarian governments of the 1970s and 80s.

Carter added that he believes that there are no longer any impediments to food aid monitoring. In the past, some governments and non-governmental organizations have criticized Pyongyang for not permitting them to monitor their aid deliveries, raising suspicions that shipments could be going to the military, rather than to the most vulnerable populations.

Ahtisaari suggested that the resumption of dialogue is essential. "I think it is extremely important that we as Elders can recommend that there is, as early as possible, a resumption of dialogue on all outstanding issues," he said. "I sincerely hope that parties can agree on a time frame in which to resolve these problems instead of a process that can last forever."

In South Korea, where North Korean defectors have alleged the existence of concentration camps, torture and the imprisonment of family members, Carter's message on human rights and his linkage to food aid is likely to raise hackles.

"For the South Korean audience, we need to hear that he raised the human rights issue with North Korea as he did in South Korea during the 1970s and 80s, that would bring more credibility," said Won Jae-chun, a director general at Seoul's National Human Rights Commission of Korea. "I don't think his message will go far in [South] Korea."

Carter and his delegation will be hosted at a banquet by South Korea's foreign minister Thursday evening.

Carter has a history of private diplomacy on the peninsula.
