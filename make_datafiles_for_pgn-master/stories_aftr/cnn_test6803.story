(CNN) -- The end of the line for three fugitive siblings came Wednesday on a rural stretch of Colorado interstate. With guns scattered around their wrecked white Subaru, the suspects made their play.

One brother stayed in the car. Another brother stumbled off through the brush to a couple of nearby businesses, only to be picked up after a citizen spotted him, authorities told CNN.

The sister, who wrote on her Flickr profile that she liked "causing mayhem with my siblings," tried to reload her automatic pistol, officials said. A police officer shot her in the leg.

In custody Wednesday evening, the "Dougherty family" survived a dramatic final scene that seemed foreshadowed.

"It was going to happen somewhere," Pueblo County Sheriff Kirk Taylor said.

With that, authorities said, Ryan Dougherty, sister Lee Grace Dougherty, 29; and half-brother Dylan Dougherty Stanley, 26, began a crime spree that included a bank robbery in Georgia and the attempted murder of a Florida police officer.

A deputy spotted the suspect vehicle at a gas station after it left the campground, officials said. It was now bearing Texas tags, Taylor said.

Officers were preparing to apprehend the occupants when the car pulled away. A 20-mile high-speed chase ensued.

Colorado state troopers deployed a tire-deflation device, and that was the beginning of the end. A MAC-11 machine pistol, a handgun and two AK-47 rifles came flying out when the vehicle flipped and landed on a guard rail, Taylor said.

They were being held Wednesday evening in Pueblo County as state, federal and local officials discuss when the trio may be returned to Georgia or Florida. The Colorado State Patrol sent a Twitter message indicating each was being charged with four counts of first-degree assault on a police officer.

"I am proud to say today we won," said Sheriff Chris Nocco of Pasco County, Florida, where one incident occurred earlier this month.

"The three Doughertys were speeding," Nocco told reporters. "It's ironic they didn't learn their lesson. The Colorado State Patrol attempted to pull them over. In that attempt to pull them over, the Doughertys went back to their MO and started shooting at law enforcement."

On Tuesday, a U.S. magistrate issued warrants for the siblings' arrest in connection with the August 2 bank robbery, where an AK-47-type assault rifle and a machine pistol were used.

Since then, the siblings had been the subject of an interstate manhunt, with their faces plastered on hundreds of digital billboards from Florida to Kentucky to Texas.

According to a timeline of events that officials provided, Ryan Dougherty was sentenced August 1 in Volusia County, Florida, to 10 years' probation and two years of community control monitoring for convictions on two counts of sending harmful information to a minor.

At 6:30 a.m. August 2, a witness saw all three siblings leave in a white four-door vehicle from their Lacoochee home. At 6:59 a.m., Ryan Dougherty cut off his GPS monitoring ankle bracelet near Zephyrhills, the sheriff's office said.

At 7:12 a.m. August 2, the shooting with the Florida police officer occurred, after which 20 high-caliber casings were found at the scene, the sheriff's office said. The five-mile pursuit began after the officer tried to pull the vehicle over for speeding on State Road 54 in Zephyrhills, 30 miles northeast of Tampa, authorities said.

During that robbery, three people dressed in black with masks entered the bank's front entrance, the FBI said. Shots were fired at the ceiling, and everyone was told to get down, the bureau said. At least two of the robbers were armed, and the third obtained an undisclosed amount of cash, the FBI said.

With the most extensive record of the three, Ryan Edward Dougherty has had 14 felony arrests since 2007, including for alleged burglary, destroying evidence and probation violation, according to the sheriff's office.

The sheriff's office didn't have information on the disposition of the past charges against the brothers and sister.

It released photos of Lee Grace Dougherty, with a description of tattoos. Public information officer Douglas Tobin confirmed the photos were taken from the suspect's Flickr page, which was established in September 2010.

Photos, many from March 2011, show Dougherty in various poses.
