(CNN) -- One of the prosecution's final witnesses, Casey Anthony's mother took the stand again Tuesday in her daughter's capital murder trial, breaking into tears from time to time as she discussed items found with the remains of her 2-year-old granddaughter, Caylee.

The prosecution plans to rest its case Wednesday, prosecutor Jeff Ashton told Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. The defense was unable to move its first few witnesses, Perry said, and will begin its case Thursday.

Cindy Anthony began crying when a photograph of Caylee wearing a shirt reading "Big trouble comes in small packages" was introduced into evidence. Previous testimony has suggested that scraps of the shirt were found at the scene along with Caylee's skeletal remains.

Cindy Anthony said she did most of the laundry at the home, and "I don't ever remember seeing that shirt."

Cindy Anthony's testimony followed that of a long line of investigators and forensic experts, called to the stand in the Orlando courtroom in an effort to support prosecutors' theory that Casey Anthony, 25, killed her daughter by knocking her out with chloroform and putting duct tape over her nose and mouth. They allege she then put the little girl's body in black garbage bags and stored it in her trunk before dumping it in woods near her home.

Caylee's skeletal remains were found in December 11, 2008. She was last seen June 16, 2008, but her disappearance was not reported until July 15, 2008, after Cindy Anthony demanded answers from her daughter about Caylee's whereabouts.

Anthony faces seven counts in Caylee's death, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators. If convicted, she could face the death penalty.

She has pleaded not guilty. Her attorneys have said Caylee was not killed but rather drowned in the family pool on June 16. Defense attorney Jose Baez told jurors that Casey Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked when they discovered the body and covered up her death. George Anthony rejected that scenario in his testimony the first week of the trial.

Cindy Anthony testified Tuesday that duct tape was also in the home, stored in the garage, but she could not recall making a previous statement that duct tape was used at a command center after Caylee went missing.

Baez pointed out that in a July 2009 deposition, Cindy Anthony was asked whether Casey Anthony had removed any duct tape from the home while out of jail on bond and said she didn't think so, as the family had only one roll and her husband was using it. Cindy Anthony explained that at the time, both she and her husband were using the tape on "no trespassing" signs on their property because of protesters outside.

After Williams' testimony, Anthony's defense team moved for a mistrial on several grounds, including the fact that prosecutors asked Williams whether she seemed remorseful, although Perry did not allow Williams to answer. Prosecutor Jeff Ashton countered that the question came in response to Baez's asking Williams whether customers do not often get tattoos to remember departed loved ones. Perry denied the mistrial motion.

Defense attorneys said they will move for acquittal when the prosecution rests.

Earlier Tuesday, FBI forensic examiner Catherine Theisen said that neither Anthony nor Caylee could be excluded as the source of a hair found in Anthony's trunk.

Nuclear DNA, she said, is inherited from both parents and can identify a person to the exclusion of all others. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from a person's mother, and testing shows whether a person cannot be excluded as the source of evidence -- along with their mother, their siblings and anyone else in the maternal family line.

Theisen also testified Tuesday that she tested the "hair mass" found with Caylee's remains and found that it shared the same mitochondrial DNA type as the hair in the trunk.

On cross-examination, Baez attempted to question Theisen, over numerous objections from prosecutors, about whether she was aware that Lee Anthony owned the car before his sister. Theisen said she did not recall seeing the name Lee Anthony in the communications she was given about the case.

FBI trace evidence examiner Karen Lowe previously testified that a 9-inch piece of hair from the trunk appeared similar to a piece of hair recovered from the little girl's hairbrush and was not similar to Casey Anthony's hair.

Cindy Anthony said that it was possible her mother had been in the car and that her hair, a mixture of blonde, brown, white and gray, has been shoulder-length for years.

On Monday, an FBI latent print examiner testified that adhesive in the shape of a heart was found on a corner of a piece of duct tape that was covering the mouth portion of Caylee's remains.

A sticker was also found at the site where Caylee's remains were discovered on a small piece of cardboard. An FBI analysis showed that sticker did not match those found at the Anthony home.

Roy Kronk, the meter reader who discovered Caylee's remains, has been subpoenaed by the defense, his attorney, David Evans, said Tuesday. He was not given a date to appear in court, Evans said.
