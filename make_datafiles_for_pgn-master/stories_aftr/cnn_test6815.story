However, it was the Dutch who were most impressive coming away from their Group E match in Hungary with a thumping 4-0 success.

Tottenham forward Rafael van der Vaart set the visitors on their way with an eighth minute opener and Barcelona midfielder Ibrahim Afellay added a second on the stroke of half time.

The victory maintained Netherlands' 100% group record. They have won all five of their matches, conceding just two goals in the process, and are now six points clear of second-placed Hungary.

That result puts Italy on 13 points from their five games, six points clear of Slovenia who remain in second.

Serbia are up to third place, level on points with Slovenia, after coming from behind to beat Northern Ireland 2-1 in the evening's other group match.

Meanwhile, goals in each half from Philippe Mexes and Yoann Gourcuff gave France a 2-0 win in Luxembourg to consolidate their position at the top of Group D.

The result leaves France on 12 points, four clear of Belarus, and well on course to qualify for next year's finals.
