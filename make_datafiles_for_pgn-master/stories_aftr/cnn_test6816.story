Former Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian walks inside the Taipei Detention Centre in Tucheng on Friday.

He was fined 200 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S.$6.1 million) as well.

Chen's wife, Wu Shu-chen, who earlier had been convicted of lying to prosecutors, also was convicted on similar charges. She received a life sentence and was fined 300 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S. $9.1 million), according to the Central News Agency, Taiwan's official news agency.

Prosecutors say Chen embezzled 600 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S.$17.7 million), took bribes, laundered money and illegally removed classified documents from the president's office.

Chen has countered that the bribe money was actually political donations. He has also said that a special presidential fund from which he is accused of embezzling does not clearly say what the money can and cannot be used for.

Prosecutors said the former first couple's son has a Swiss bank account with $22 million they think are illegal proceeds.

The challenge for prosecutors was to prove that Chen handed out political favors in exchange for money. The former president said he was being persecuted politically by his successor.

Chen's party favors independence for Taiwan. His successor, President Ma Ying-jeou, favors closer ties with mainland China.
