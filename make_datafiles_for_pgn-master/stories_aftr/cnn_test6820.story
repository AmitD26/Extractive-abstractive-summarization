But if plans for official observances were still forming, people across the world touched by his vision, and the products that resulted, were already clamoring for ways to celebrate and memorialize his legacy.

A statement from Jobs' family late Wednesday said a website is going to be created "for those who wish to offer tributes and memories." While saying "we know many of you will mourn with us," the statement did not mention any plans for a public memorial service.

Early Thursday, that website did not appear to be live yet. A spokeswoman for the family did not immediately respond to a request for details.

Apple has said the company does not know when, or if, there will be a public memorial.

Apple retail stores everywhere became gathering places for the Apple faithful who looked at Jobs as much more than a CEO. At an Apple store in Tokyo, iPads and iPhones showing flickering images of candles had been propped beside flowers and other more traditional items.

"We admire his work. We've embraced his vision. And we love what he's brought to the world," reads the group's website. "Let's take a day to honor the man himself and say thank you."

"We planned this the day he retired and announced it in September," the group wrote on a Facebook page where people can RSVP to "attend" the day. "It was intended to be a celebration of his life. Not a memorial." On Thursday morning, more than 7,000 people had said they would participate.

Tech-focused publications, including BoingBoing and Wired, also turned their website homepages into tributes to Jobs. BoingBoing's site was reskinned to look like an older Mac computer interface. Wired made most of its page black in reverence for the passing of a tech titan.
