Bangkok (CNN) -- More than two months of floods and 8 million people affected -- the disaster in Thailand is immense; the aid effort a challenge.

Much of the effort appears to be internally driven. Thais across the country are donating food, water and clothing to help their countrymen in the worst-hit areas. Donations have far surpassed previous years. Floods happen every year here, but these are the worst in half a century and have left at least 283 dead.

Anyone who has a boat is using it to transport aid or to help neighbors carrying their possessions as water levels rise and engulf homes. Those who don't have a boat are making do with rubber tires or even slabs of Styrofoam. There is a true sense of teamwork between the communities.

"It's very bad around here," he told CNN. "We don't have enough to eat."

Temples are playing a significant role in the disaster. Thailand is overwhelmingly Buddhist and many temples, although flooded themselves, have some dry floors on higher ground and have opened their doors to those in need.

But Thanajaro's first concern is helping his community, many of whom are now sleeping in the temple. "Whenever we get donations, we share it all with the villagers," he says.

United Nations agencies also are on standby, activating their assessment teams and contingency planning in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The World Health Organization has offered emergency health kits.
