Anchorage, Alaska (CNN) -- It's a competition that brings out some of the toughest, hardiest, most ferociously determined athletes in the world. In fact, most of the competitors in this sport aren't even human.

It's a race boasting more mileage and fur coats than perhaps any other on the planet -- worn by both participants and spectators bundled from head to toe to face a punishing 2012 Alaska winter. Dubbed the "Last Great Race" by organizers, the Iditarod sled dog trail in Alaska is legendary. The race is currently celebrating its 40th running, now under way on the trail between Anchorage and Nome.

This year, Iditarod spectators had to brave near-record snowfall in Anchorage just to get a glimpse of their favorite teams -- howling at top of their lungs in anxious anticipation of their turn at the starting point. The nearly 1,000-mile race covers some of the most extreme terrain on Earth, each team powered by 64 booted paws and a musher's dogged desire to be the first to reach the finish line on the Bering Sea Coast.

The 2012 trail covers approximately 945 miles, so spectators must first determine which portion of the race they aim to see. The ceremonial start of the race is, by far, the most popular choice of fans seeking access and convenience. There are a number of events in and around Anchorage leading up to the Iditarod start, such as the Mushers' Banquet, various Iditarod educational seminars featuring mushers and race officials, and even a competing annual festival and parade in Anchorage, the Fur Rondy.

On the first Saturday of March, thousands of Iditarod enthusiasts line Anchorage's historic Fourth Avenue to participate in the celebratory send-off. Race officials personally introduce each team as they depart "the chute," announcers struggling to be heard over a cacophony of howling dog teams. Mushers and their dogs often don festive regalia at the noncompetitive ceremonial start while also toting warmly bundled "Iditariders" in their sleds.

For most spectators, the next eight to 12 days involve closely monitoring the race online with the assistance of real-time GPS tracking and video coverage from the trail checkpoints -- available on www.Iditarod.com .

Hotels in Nome, however, are scarce and must be booked months in advance for die-hard fans and visitors hoping to be present when the leaders arrive. For other spectators happy to simply get any glimpse of the remaining teams' arrivals at the finish line, opportunities continue for approximately a week.

While the Iditarod may be known as "The Last Great Race," there's no sign it's coming to an end anytime soon. If you're unable to witness this year's race at points along the trail, 2013 promises to deliver yet another compelling Iditarod -- a truly Alaskan experience.
