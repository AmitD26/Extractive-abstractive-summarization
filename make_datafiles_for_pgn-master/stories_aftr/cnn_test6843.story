(CNN)  -- John Isner says his 11-hour match at Wimbledon against Nicolas Mahut was "absolutely crazy" and at one point he thought it might never end.

The world number 23 from the United States has gone down in the record books as the winner of the longest match in tennis history.

His epic battle with Frenchman Mahut on Court 18 at the All England Club stretched over three days and 183 games before he claimed the first round clash, 6-4 3-6 6-7 7-6 70-68.

The pair battled for over seven hours and by the time it was called off all the record books had already been re-written.

"That one set just didn't want to end, we played 118 games with no decider and we had to come back next day to finish it off," Isner explained to CNN.

"I think once we got to 30 (games) all I really didn't think it was going to end.

"Both of us were serving fantastic and it got to the point when we didn't want to make a mistake on our service game.

"We were still able to hit an inordinate amount of aces and every time someone got in a jam we were able to claw our way out of it.

So fit was Isner that his coach Craig Boynton had made a prophetic prediction ahead of the third grand slam of the year.

"It was pretty brutal, it was ugly," he said.
