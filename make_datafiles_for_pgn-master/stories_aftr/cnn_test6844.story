Roger Federer screams in joy after beating Juan Martin del Potro to reach the French Open final.

Swede Soderling, who earlier this week caused a sensation by knocking out defending champion and world number one Rafael Nadal, defeated Fernando Gonzalez 6-3 7-5 5-7 4-6 6-4 in another thrilling five-setter to continue his remarkable run in Paris.

It was Federer's second five-set win this tournament -- he was also taken the distance by Tommy Haas in the fourth round -- and he has squeezed through to his fourth straight Paris final without hitting top form.

But he was broken in the fifth and ninth games to lose the first set as Del Potro dictated the rallies, feasting off Federer's weak and short backhands.

However, as the South American tired, Federer found an extra gear -- as he has done so often this past fortnight -- and suddenly began to dominate Del Potro's serve.

Federer is now just one win away from becoming the sixth player to complete a sweep of the Majors. The title here would also move him level with Pete Sampras on a record 14 grand-slam crowns.

"Soderling played a great match against Gonzalez to be in the final. He deserves to be there because he also beat Nadal and he was the man to beat in this tournament."
