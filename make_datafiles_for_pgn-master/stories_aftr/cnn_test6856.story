(CNN) -- The son of a man who died from intestinal problems says he now wonders whether his father's wife might have poisoned him.

Betty Johnson Neumar is shown at her booking. She is charged with hiring a hit man to kill her husband.

Neumar's son appeared on "Nancy Grace" on Wednesday along with Jay Almond, a news editor with the Stanly News and Press in North Carolina.

He said he learned of his father's death when he read it in a local newspaper. Betty Neumar has not been charged in connection with that death or her other three husbands.

"She has only been charged in one state," her attorney Charles Parnell said. "I want to remind everybody she has only been charged in North Carolina, and obviously, she is presumed to be innocent. There is nothing with the other states because there are no charges at this particular time."

Here is an edited transcript of the show:

Neumar: You know, actually, murder almost never crossed my mind until the Gentry case came up. In fact, we did not know she was married all this time. We just thought that she was married one time and she was a widow lady who married my father.

Well, it wasn't long after my father married her that he started being sick and everything. And he was never sick a day in his life [before then]. And I figured something was wrong because he put -- such a wedge became between our families that shouldn't have existed. We were so close.

And the longer she was married to him, the less we had to do with him and the more time it seemed like he was sick but she wouldn't let us know about it. In fact, when he did die, I read about it in the newspaper and didn't even know he was dead.

Neumar: Well, it's a complicated thing, and I'm not very good with these technical terms and all. But from what the doctors say, it was some type of stomach and bowel and, you know, intestine problem and everything, which I've been told later by some people that the symptoms that he had could be caused by arsenic poisoning.

Grace: John, when you first met her, didn't you tell me you believed at that time she was a widow, a one-time widow that married your father?

Neumar: Right. That was correct. We were told that her husband just passed away, and my mother had passed away a couple years before that. And we -- you know, we just figured it was a widow and a widower getting married.

Neumar: A friend of his went up there to where she had a salon to get haircutting. My father, he went to go up there and get his haircut because I think his barber had retired. So he went up there to get his haircut, and that's where he met her.

Grace: And how long after they met did they marry?

Neumar: You know, I'm bad with time frame, but I'd say, I think within a year or something like that [1989].

Grace: Quick courtship.

Almond: She's a 76-year-old widow ... and she's been married four other times. She initially was inviting to family members, but then sort of became more of a wedge in the family and has gone from there, got colder and -- with previous family members.
