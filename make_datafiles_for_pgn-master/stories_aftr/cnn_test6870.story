Did you ever wonder how all these people made all that money?

I sure hope you did, because we went and did all this research.

1. Rich DeVos, Orlando Magic (NBA)

In 1959, DeVos and high school friend Jay Van Andel started selling all-purpose cleaner.

Their business grew to become Amway, which now brings in $6 billion each year under the ominous-sounding Alticor name.

Forbes estimates his wealth at $3.5 billion, making the paltry $85 million he spent on the Magic in 1991 a minor investment.

2. Robert L. Johnson, Charlotte Bobcats (NBA)

Lower on my list of dream jobs is running a cable network that caters to urban youth.

So I'm all kinds of envious of Robert L., who founded BET and sold it to Viacom for $3 billion in 2001.

His resume is full of firsts  BET was the first African-American owned company traded on the NYSE.

He was the first African-American billionaire in the U.S. And, in 2002, he became the first African-American majority owner of a professional sports franchise.

3. Robert Kraft, New England Patriots (NFL)

In 1972, Kraft founded International Forest Products, which is now part of the Kraft Group -- a diversified collection of companies ranging from Gillette Stadium to the New England Revolution (Major League Soccer) to Carmel Container Systems (Israel's largest packaging plant).

Kraft is seen as a savior in New England -- before he bought the team in 1994, the Pats seemed destined for relocation to St. Louis. Plus he's made them really, really good, winning three Super Bowls this decade.

Another reason I'm so keen on owning a team is the access to foreign heads of state.

4. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Seattle Mariners (MLB)

Despite America's strong resistance to Japanese ownership -- and despite his admitted lack of interest in baseball -- Hiroshi Yamauchi became majority owner of the Seattle Mariners in 1992.

Yamauchi is the man credited with transforming Nintendo from playing-card company to video game giant.

His 55-year tenure saw incredible growth. But that doesn't mean there weren't a few bumps along the way. Forays into instant rice, taxi service and short-stay hotels (also known as "love hotels") did not pan out.

5. Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys (NFL)

An undersized guard, Jones was captain of the 1965 Cotton Bowl-winning Arkansas Razorbacks.

He immediately made waves by firing Tom Landry -- the only coach in Cowboys history -- and replacing him with his college buddy (the aforementioned Jimmy Johnson, who was coaching the University of Miami).

After a rocky 1-15 start in 1989, the Cowboys went on to win three Super Bowls in the 1990s.   Mental Floss: A brief history of stadium naming rights

6. Malcolm Glazer, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (NFL), Manchester United (English Premier League)

Today, the Glazer family oversees strip malls and nursing homes throughout the land.

Glazer also has a large stake in Zapata, an oil company founded by George H.W. Bush.

The New York Times said Glazer had "a reputation as a franchise window shopper, one who looks at virtually every team that comes up for sale."

7. Stanley Kroenke, Denver Nuggets (NBA), Colorado Avalanche (NHL), St. Louis Rams (NFL -- partial owner)

Kroenke is a self-made man who also married mega-rich.

He earned his estimated $2.1 billion fortune in real estate, developing shopping centers across the country.

Then he went ahead and married a Walton -- Ann Walton. Sam's niece. She's worth another $3+ billion.

8. Daniel Gilbert, Cleveland Cavaliers (NBA)

With $5,000 he'd earned delivering pizzas -- and after a stint as a TV reporter -- the future Cavs owner started a small mortgage company called Rock Financial in 1985.

In 1999, the company was bought by Intuit for $532 million.

He also owns Fathead, which makes wall decals and tiresome ads.

9. Stephen Bisciotti, Baltimore Ravens (NFL)

With Jim Davis, Bisciotti founded Aerotek in 1983 (he was 23).

Their staffing company, now known as the Allegis Group, had revenues of $4.4 billion in 2005.
