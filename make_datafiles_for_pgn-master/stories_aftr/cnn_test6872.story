(CNN) -- The possibility of engine fires has prompted General Motors to recall nearly 1.5 million passenger sedans manufactured between 1997 and 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Monday.

On Friday, the federal government acknowledged the filing and agreed to the plan.

The problem involves a potential for oil to leak on the exhaust manifold during hard braking. When a car operates under normal conditions, the manifold can get very hot.

Oil that runs below the manifold's heat shield could ignite and spread to plastic channels that hold spark plug wires.

As a solution, the company recommends a change in the bracket that holds spark plug wires, which will be done free of charge.

GM issued a recall on a similar engine in 2008, according to the company's filing with the government. That problem was traced to a faulty gasket on the engine rocker cover.
