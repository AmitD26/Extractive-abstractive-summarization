"I've talked to Caroline Kennedy and she's clearly interested," New York Sen. Chuck Schumer said at a news conference Monday afternoon.

He indicated that 12 people were interested in the position.

"She's interested in the position," New York Gov. David Paterson confirmed. But at the same time "she realizes it's not a campaign." Paterson, who will name Clinton's successor, noted that Kennedy had indicated a desire to "sit down and tell me what her qualifications are."

The Rev. Al Sharpton also released a statement Monday indicating that he had received a call from Kennedy "who expressed to me her interest in [Clinton's] Senate seat."

Kennedy's interest in the seat could mean the continuation of a family legacy in the Senate that began 56 years ago with the election of her father as the then-junior senator from Massachusetts.  Background: The Kennendys in Politics »

Her uncle Ted Kennedy has represented Massachusetts in the Senate since 1963, and her uncle Robert Kennedy served as New York's junior senator from 1965 until he was assassinated in 1968.

CNN reported earlier this month that Caroline Kennedy had called Paterson to discuss the possibility of taking the seat.

One Democratic source close to the Kennedy family told CNN earlier this month Kennedy was "interested to say the least" in the Senate seat and had asked a tight circle of other family friends and political advisers for advice.

"I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them," she wrote. "But for the first time, I believe I have found the man who could be that president -- not just for me, but for a new generation of Americans."

"Apparently, she has acquired a taste for politics," Schneider noted. "She wants to be part of this new regime in America, clearly playing a key role in the Senate if she gets that appointment."  Watch Bill Schneider's report »

Caroline Kennedy has also spent most of her life in the city, working there after graduating from Harvard, meeting her husband, Edwin Schlossberg, on the job at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and attending Columbia Law School there.

Her most prominent public roles involved overseeing her father's presidential library and presenting the annual Profiles in Courage Award.

She's also edited several books, from a volume of children's poetry and an updated edition of her father's book "Profiles in Courage" to a collection of patriotic verse ("A Patriot's Handbook: Songs, Poems, Stories, and Speeches Celebrating the Land We Love").

In late spring and early summer she was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate and more recently as a contender for secretary of education in an Obama Cabinet.  But elected office would mark a major shift for Kennedy.

CNN's John King, Kate Bolduan, Mark Preston and Alexander Mooney contributed to this report.
