SATSUMA, Florida (CNN) -- The father of a missing 5-year-old Florida girl made a renewed plea Thursday for the return of his daughter.

"If you have my daughter and you're watching this, drop her off somewhere safe," Roland Cummings said of his daughter Haleigh.

"I'm not out for revenge, I'm not out for nothing else. I want my daughter back," Cummings said, with his girlfriend, Misty Croslin, at his side.

"Why would anybody be sick enough" to abduct a child? he asked.

Police have no official suspects, but say they are treating everyone they interview as one.

"She said, 'Your back door's open and your daughter's gone,' " Cummings told Nancy Grace on her show on CNN's sister network HLN on Wednesday night.  Watch Cummings describe his shock »

Croslin waited until Cummings came home to phone 911 about the girl's disappearance, though it's unclear how long that wait was.  Watch the father describe what happened »

Police said Wednesday that Croslin had tucked the girl and her 4-year-old brother into bed at 8 p.m. before going to sleep at 10.

Croslin told police she woke up around 3 a.m. to use the bathroom and returned to find the girl missing. The boy was still in bed, Cummings told CNN.

Police say they believe the girl was abducted.

The police must "assume abduction," he said, adding, "All the answers to why you'd want to take a 5-year-old are ugly."

A nationwide Amber Alert says the girl was last seen wearing a pink shirt and underwear.

Croslin is staying with relatives as the investigation continues, said Bowling, describing the girlfriend as a "child herself."

Griffis said that her daughter and Ronald Cummings had a "rocky relationship" and that the two took turns spending weekends with their daughter.  Watch mother's tearful plea »

Investigators are looking into various angles of the case, including finding out the location of 44 registered sexual offenders who live within a five-mile radius of the Cummings home, said Lt. Johnny Greenwood of the Putnam County Sheriff's Office.

A familiar face from the Caylee Anthony case is involved in the search. Bounty hunter Leonard Padilla joined the hunt Tuesday and is offering a $25,000 reward for the girl's return.

Padilla initially bonded out Caylee's mother, Casey, who has been charged with first-degree murder in the toddler's death, and then helped launch one of several searches for Caylee.

CNN's John Couwels, Brad Lendon and Natisha Lance contributed to this report.
