LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The sponsor of a proposal to rein in aggressive celebrity photographers is meeting resistance from Los Angeles' top cop, who says the law is not needed when celebrities just behave.

Photographers swarm a car carrying Britney Spears after a Los Angeles court appearance in October 2007.

City Councilman Dennis Zine wants to require photographers to stay a safe distance from celebrities.

His proposed ordinance is nicknamed the "Britney Law" for the hordes of paparazzi that swarm around pop star Britney Spears, sometimes costing the city thousands of dollars for escorts and other enforcement.

The proposal gained exposure last month when officials from around Southern California asked former independent counsel Kenneth Starr -- whose investigation of former President Clinton spawned its own share of tabloid headlines -- to help craft a law that would protect celebrities without infringing on freedom of the press.  iReport.com: Share your celeb stories and photos

"She's thankfully disappeared from the scene," Bratton said.

At the hearing, members of the paparazzi also said the law would be impossible to enforce.

Those attending included musician John Mayer, actor Eric Roberts, sheriff's officials, representatives of the Screen Actors Guild and officials from West Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Malibu.

CNN's Kareen Wynter contributed to this report.
