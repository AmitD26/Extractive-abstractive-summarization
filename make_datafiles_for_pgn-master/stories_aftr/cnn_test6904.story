CONYERS, Georgia (CNN) -- "Your daughter is a walking time bomb." We have been told this more times than I like to remember. We have lived every day not knowing if the next breath she takes will be her last.

After 22 years in the dark, Mandy Young is grateful to finally have a name for her condition.

Her illnesses come so quickly. It's a daily battle of fear, worry, misery, faith and hope. She has been in the hospital more than 100 times. She has suffered one life-threatening infection after another.

We make sure that Mandy knows this is not just her illness.

Mandy was a healthy, nine pound, green-eyed beauty -- until the day she was diagnosed with Spinal Meningitis.

Hours and days crept by, waiting every four hours for our ICU visit, 10 minutes of torture.

"Your daughter is very sick. Her mind is surely in a vegetated state from the seizures she continues to have. The stroke that she suffered has caused the left side of her body to be paralyzed," the doctors said.

"She is in a coma and we see no way she will wake up. We really don't think she will live through the night. It's time to tell her goodbye," they continued.

By day five, after six trips to doctors and emergency rooms, when her eye was swollen beyond seeing and looked like a piece of raw meat, we were finally able to beg her doctor for more aggressive testing.

At 21 months. Spinal Meningitis again. The same promises of certain death. ICU. Seizures. A 106 degree temperature raged. "There is no way that she has the strength to fight off another infection of this magnitude. It's time to let go. We're losing her by the minute."

After the first bout of meningitis we were told, "No one gets it twice. Live your life and enjoy your child!" Then, bout two. Although not the same type of meningitis, it was the same family.

It's rare to have it twice. But impossible to have it three times. But time three did come. "You have to find out why this keeps happening. She can't go through this again. What can you do?" we pleaded with the doctors.

Mandy was discharged and our journey for a reason began. Our lives were changed forever. Twice a week for the next two years, we handed her over for blood to be drawn. She went into isolation. Daily preventative antibiotics.

Surgically implanted tubes in her ears, infection, tubes out, surgery, tubes in. 11 times. An abscess the size of a cantaloupe in her abdomen.

Gas Gangrene and Clostridia Septicemia. A combination not seen since WWII. "She's fighting to stay alive. Five percent chance to live," the doctors said. ICU. And then, in an attempt to save her life, they began to amputate her leg. Before they stopped the spreading, her leg and hip were gone.

As she lay in a coma, we prayed for help. Our search for a research specialist intensified. That's when we found Dr. John Gallin at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland.

Mandy is 27 now. Her immune studies began when she was two in 1983. And in May 2003, we received an email that said, "At long last we have discovered the basis of Amanda's problem."

Mandy has a genetic defect, called IRAK-4. Her body doesn't recognize infection and doesn't produce the cells needed to fight it off.

She is still studied at the NIH in hopes of finding a treatment or cure for her disease. And although finding a cure for her would be the ultimate gift, knowing that we have a name for her illness is the prize.

"A place for families to find hope, just like we did."
