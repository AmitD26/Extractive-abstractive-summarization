WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A senior administration official said Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Sgt. James Crowley of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, Police Department will be visiting the White House Thursday.

President Obama will meet Thursday with a Harvard professor and the officer who arrested him.

Last week, Obama said he called Crowley and "there was a discussion about he and I and Professor Gates having a beer here in the White House."

Cambridge police called on Obama to apologize for the remark. Obama did not apologize, but in the phone call with Crowley he said his choice of words was "unfortunate."

Crowley said Gates accused him of racism when he was at the home simply trying to do his job and assuring that Gates was safe and alone in the home.

Cambridge police officials have praised Crowley, who in recent years had been selected by a black police officer to teach a police academy course on how to avoid racial profiling. Officials said they take pride in their relationship with the diverse community in the area.

Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert Haas said he "deeply regrets" the arrest, but stands by the procedures his department followed. iReport.com: Share stories, concerns on racial profiling

Meanwhile, authorities in Cambridge announced Monday that they have created a panel to advise police on racial issues.

The committee "will identify lessons to be taken from the circumstances surrounding the incident" and will advise the police department on how "those lessons can be applied" to its policies and practices.
