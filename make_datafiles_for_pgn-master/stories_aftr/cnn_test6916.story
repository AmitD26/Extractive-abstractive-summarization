(CNN)  -- Loretta Chaisson Lewis, 28, was the first to die. She was reported missing on May 17, 2005. Three days later, fishermen found her body floating in a canal off Highway 26 in Jennings, Louisiana.

Victims, clockwise: Laconia Brown, 23, Whitnei Dubois, 26, Brittney Gary, 17 and Necole Guillory, 26.

Her father, Thomas Lewis, recently posted a plea on a Web site established in September by the Jefferson Davis Parish Sheriff's Office to draw attention to the killing of his daughter and the deaths of seven other women in the area. Police say the slayings may be linked.

The victims' bodies were dumped on the outskirts of Jennings -- population 10,546 -- west of Lafayette, Louisiana. Townspeople are perplexed. They're asking themselves, "Is there a serial killer among us?"

"Based on an analysis of the investigation thus far, we believe the homicides may be linked to a common offender," Sheriff Ricky Edwards said in a recent news release.

Mike Dubois, Whitnei's brother, criticized the slow pace of the investigation.

But Edwards said his department and investigators from the neighboring parishes of Acadia and Calcasieu, the state attorney general's office, the Louisiana State Police and the FBI are doing everything they can.

"This investigation is intense," he said. "We are following up on all leads. I assure you that we are working tirelessly to solve these murders."

Zeno's mother, Sarah Benoit, posted this message on the Sheriff Department's Web site:

"How beautiful you are. Your smile is forever a reminder of how special you are. It has almost been a year, but it seems like yesterday that you were taken from us. If anyone has any information on my daughter's death, please come forward. Without closure, not knowing who could have done this is very frightening. I pray every day that God will give the task force what they need to solve these cases."

In the most recent case, the body of Necole Guillory, 26, was found in Acadia Parish, off Interstate 10, in August.  Edwards believes this represented a change in the killer's modus operandi. The bodies of all the previous victims were left on the side of smaller, rural roads.

Investigators think the offender has significant ties to Jefferson Davis Parish and is known to its residents, because he has demonstrated a strong familiarity with the area, Edwards said.

Of the victims, the sheriff said, "All of these young ladies had substance abuse problems and would go anywhere to fulfill their addictions." But he said he stopped referring to their "high-risk lifestyle" after the family of one of the victims expressed outrage and accused his department of not caring about the women.

He encouraged anyone with information to visit the site, www.jeffdaviscrimes.net, or contact the task force at 337-824-6662.

In the meantime, the families continue to wait for news.

Benoit, Zeno's mother, has distributed more than 1,200 fliers in the community urging everyone to attend an October 17 prayer vigil at Lake Arthur.

"It's called Community United in Prayer," she said. "Everyone is invited to pray for the victims and their families. It's a healing for our community."
