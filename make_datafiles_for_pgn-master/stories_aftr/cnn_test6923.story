SARATOGA SPRINGS, New York (CNN) -- Two years ago, Dawn Warfield was drowning in debt.

She had 17 credit cards and admits that living beyond her means was part of the problem.

"There is always unforeseen expenses, and when you are making the minimum payments on these credit cards, when you think you can't afford to make more than that, they don't go down."

But Warfield's spending was not the only factor working against her.  Watch Warfield describe how the debt piled up, and how she started paying it off Â»

"And the interest rates ranged from like 6 percent to 33 percent. So it was impossible.

So Warfield took matters into her own hands.

"I sat down one day and I called each credit card one by one, and I asked each one to work with me ... to lower my interest rate."

The credit card companies did not respond to her plea.

"I don't even have to think about it, which makes it a lot easier for me, because when you have a lot of debt, it's not just financial, but it's emotional, you know, even physical," Warfield said.

"You think about it all the time."

Adds Jackson: "She's making her payments on time, they're posting to her creditor accounts, she has very low interest rates -- that was one of the benefits -- and she's definitely doing well.

"She is on track to get all her debts paid off in full within the five years."

Today, Warfield is less than $40,000 in debt.

"I'm about halfway," she said. "It hasn't been easy, but we're getting there."
