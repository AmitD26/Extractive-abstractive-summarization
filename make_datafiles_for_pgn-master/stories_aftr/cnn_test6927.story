New York (CNN) -- The teen who mysteriously turned up in New York with apparent amnesia emptied her bank account and left behind "everything" before she left her home in Washington, police told CNN.

The woman, now identified as Kacie Aleece Peterson, 18, of Hansville, Washington, withdrew about $400 from her Bank of America account, said Scott Wilson, spokesman for the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office in Washington.

There's no indication that she's feigning her memory loss, said Paul Browne, deputy commissioner of the New York Police Department.

At the same time, because Peterson is an adult, authorities have not ruled out the theory that she left home to re-establish herself elsewhere, Wilson said.

Her father also told investigators that in another incident his daughter was found unconscious on her bedroom floor, Wilson said.

Kacie Peterson, a high school senior, started anew at Kingston High School in Kingston, Washington, but only attended for three weeks, said Chris Case, director of community relations for North Kitsap school district. Enrolled in the Running Start program there, Kacie Peterson had two advanced placement classes at the school and also classes at Olympic College in Poulsbo, about 10 miles away, Case said.

Kingston high school officials said Kacie Peterson was quiet, shy and that "she had no friends," Wilson said.

The last time she showed up for class was on September 29, Case said.

The next time some employees of the school saw the student she was sporting a new look.

Police asked for help identifying the teen after she was found in midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. on October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter. The organization had said she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility.

Officers interviewed her, but it became clear that she couldn't provide authorities with any information about herself.

A photo of the then-unidentified woman aired on CNN, and a viewer in Maryland who was familiar with Kacie Peterson alerted authorities. Police established a positive identification.

Police say they do not know how she lost her memory.

She is still in New York and receiving care from the city agency, Browne said.
