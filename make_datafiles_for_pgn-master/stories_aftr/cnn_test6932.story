(CNN) -- Jennifer Valdivia scooped up the baseball after it sailed into the right-field stands. The 12-year-old smiled and giggled over the keepsake from her first Major League ballgame.

Jennifer Valdivia, 12, holds the record-setting baseball after it was returned this week to her.

She'd have to sue to get the ball back.

This is the story of a baseball and the big leagues, of a young girl, a slugger and a lawsuit. It's about another stain on America's pastime -- commercialism colliding with a kid's innocent joy.

Jennifer's big catch was the 200th home run for Ryan Howard, an All-Star for the Philadelphia Phillies. The 29-year-old first baseman achieved the milestone faster than any player in Major League history, in his 658th career game, 48 fewer games than the previous record.

"I was rubbing it in my brother's face," Jennifer later recalled. He'd been to many games before, but had never caught a homer ball. "I got a ball and you didn't," she teased.

Switcheroo leaves mom steaming

Excitedly, Jennifer called her mom on the phone. "Mom, I got the ball!"

A Phillies employee, Jennifer says, told her if she handed over the ball, she could come back after the game, meet the slugger and get him to autograph it. She gave the ball up. In exchange, she got cotton candy and a soda.

Jennifer went back to her seat but returned to the clubhouse after the game -- this time, with her grandfather and the rest of her party. They waited. The Phillies slugger never showed up.

A security guard walked up and gave Jennifer a ball autographed by Howard. But it wasn't the one she caught.

"I was, like, really sad."

Howard told reporters after the game that he was proud of his feat. He eclipsed Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner, who played on three teams from 1946 to 1955. Kiner's record had stood for more than a half-century.

"It's a nice record to have," Howard said. "I'll take it and run with it."

Vanegas' motherly instinct kicked in. She felt her daughter had been duped, robbed of something potentially worth thousands of dollars.

She contacted the Phillies and asked for the ball. In baseball parlance, the Phillies balked. But the team did offer to give the family VIP tickets the next time they played in Florida.

"I don't want tickets," Vanegas replied. "I want the ball back."

True value, and memories

Letting fans keep the home-run balls they catch is a time-honored tradition. It's a way for ordinary fans to connect with the superstars -- and to cash in on the catch if history has been made.

When Salvatore Durante snagged Roger Maris' 61st home-run ball -- the one that broke Babe Ruth's single season home-run record in 1961 -- his life changed forever.

So, Kent's efforts to get the ball back for his young client met with resistance.

The ball was promptly returned.

The Phillies, in the middle of a pitched playoff battle, have declined comment on the ball brouhaha. Howard's agent, Terry Prince, told CNN affiliate WSVN: "He's willing to give the ball back to her without any strings attached. Free of charge."

As part of the settlement, Kent said Howard and the Phillies agreed to pay his attorney fee, about $1,000.

Jennifer has no plans to sell. She keeps the ball in her room, hidden near her bunk so friends can't take it.

Her message to ballclubs and millionaire players?

The next time a child catches a home-run ball, let the kid keep it.
