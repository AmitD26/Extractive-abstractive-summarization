Best thing about 'em? You don't even have to take your film in to the corner drugstore to get developed -- because digital cameras don't rely on film to make their pictures "stick." Thanks to technology, the entire process, from clicking the shutter to printing the pictures, is now entirely within the power of the consumer.

Maybe you've taken a picture that's just not as perfect as you'd like it to be. Instead of being at the mercy of a darkroom-shackled photo lackey to improve upon it, you've got more tools than ever to take it upon yourself to edit, store, organize, and share your images with the world.

Here's a roundup of 10 free, and mostly free, online tools for the budding digital photographer:

2. Splashup-- Splashup "is a powerful editing tool and photo manager. With all the features professionals use and novices want, it's easy to use, works in real-time, and allows you to edit many images at once." You'd wonder how something this extensive could be free - and it all runs within the browser.

4. Pixlr -- "Pixlr is a free online photo editor; jump in and start: edit, adjust, filter. It's just what you imagine!" Alexa says it's the "fastest growing photo editor online." If these resources are starting to look similar to your eye, remember you don't have to use all of them - just pick the one that works best for your needs.

5. flauntR-- flauntR is a suite that includes the ability to edit images, add effects, add text, and print the results on everything from mugs to posters. You might be overwhelmed with the options here, but... isn't that better than being underwhelmed?

7. PiZap-- PiZap's tagline is "fun with photos made easy." It's another flavor of photo editor/storage center that, like flauntR, allows you to print the results to mugs, bags, and t-shirts. PiZap invites developers to check out its API for more personalization options (which is usually a good thing).

9. DrPic-- DrPic says it's "the easiest free online picture editor" and that it has "processed over five million pictures." I say they're easy enough, but not necessarily THE easiest. Everything's relative, no?

As you can see, there are plenty of options for photo editing, storing, and sharing out there. Some are going to fit your personal workflow more neatly than others, so it's worth it to try a few and see what works best for your needs.
