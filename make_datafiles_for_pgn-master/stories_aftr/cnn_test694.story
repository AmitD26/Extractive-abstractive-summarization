Mourners at the 20th anniversary memorial service for the victims of the Lockerbie bombing.

Scotland's Justice Minister Frank MacAskill is weighing up whether to release him on compassionate grounds so he can die at home; to transfer him to a Libyan jail under a prisoner transfer agreement drawn up between Libya and the UK; or whether to keep him in a Scottish jail for the rest of his days.

"I've never talked about the politics of the thing because I had no interest," he says. "People here aren't interested in the politics, they just want to carry on with their lives."

Stobbs has vivid memories of the night of December 21, 1988 -- the "shortest and darkest night of the year," he says.

"We were told about the 747," he says, "and we realized we weren't looking for twenty people but for 300. But where were they?"

"Gentle Lockerbie" reads one of the inscriptions from a family member who lost a loved one. "Some say the land there is now tainted, I say it is blessed."

The force of the explosion and the wind that night blew bits of the plane, personal possessions and body parts across a vast area.

The crucial piece of evidence that implicated Al Megrahi was a scrap of clothing wrapped around a part of the device used to detonate the suitcase bomb. It was traced back to a Maltese boutique whose shop-owner recognized Al Megrahi.

Lockerbie local John Gair said he was never entirely convinced of Al Megrahi's guilt. "I did feel that some of the evidence was circumstantial," he says. "I think partly out of compassion and partly out of a possible element of doubt, he should be allowed out."

As he looks down Sherwood Crescent at the neat rows of houses, not yet twenty years old, he says: "Life goes on and once a tragedy like this is over people pick up the threads of their lives. And they don't forget but they don't dwell on it. Because there's no earthly point in dwelling on any of this."

270 people from 21 nations lost their lives in the beautiful hills around Lockerbie. Some of them had been so badly incinerated no trace of them was ever found, just their personal belongings and the Pan Am passenger list which proved they'd been on board.

Twenty years later in the town of Lockerbie, the streets have been rebuilt, the past buried, but not forgotten.
