After, Obama said, "I am just very proud of the extraordinary work that the troops are doing here in Kuwait; you're providing all the logistical support that's needed for folks in the battlefield and without you this effort would not be successful."

Hagel agreed, saying, "We're here first to thank the troops."

Obama spoke briefly to a pool reporter about his trip just before leaving Washington.

"I think it is very important to recognize that I'm going over there as a U.S. senator. We have one president at a time, so it's the president's job to deliver those messages," Obama said.  Watch Obama's foreign policy adviser discuss overseas trip »

Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday that U.S. officials are looking for ways to send more troops to Afghanistan, amid the resurgence of violence nearly seven years after the ousting of the Taliban government.

Gates said the hope is to send additional forces "sooner rather than later."

He said the Pentagon is "working very hard to see if there are opportunities to send additional forces sooner rather than later." That probably means further reductions in troop levels in Iraq this year to free up forces for Afghanistan.  Watch officials discuss need for more troops in Afghanistan »
