(CNN) -- Despite some high-profile bombings in recent days, Iraq's security forces are ready to take over for U.S. forces this week to stabilize the nation's major cities, the U.S. commander in Iraq told CNN on Sunday.

Except for soldiers in advisory roles, all U.S. combat troops will leave Iraqi cities and towns by June 30.

Army Gen. Ray Odierno said he's seen a "constant improvement" in both the security situation and governance in Iraq to prepare for the June 30 deadline for U.S. troops to withdraw from major cities.

"They've been working for this for a long time," Odierno said on CNN's "State of the Union."

In the CNN interview, Odierno blamed the recent violence in Iraq on "extremist elements using the timeframe and date to gain attention to themselves and divert attention from the success of Iraqi security forces."

He said his biggest worry is a breakdown in stability such as a "consistent increase in violence" or a situation that Iraqi forces can't handle.

"I don't see that" happening, Odierno said. "I think we're on the right path."

"I'm not authorized to do anything outside the borders of Iraq," he said.

Iran's government has repeatedly denied fomenting violence inside Iraq.
