Jose Mourinho's men had already claimed the Serie A and Italian Cup crowns ahead of Saturday night's showdown with Bayern, who had also achieved the domestic double in Germany.

Two clinical finishes from Milito in the 35th and 70th minutes settled an enthralling showdown in the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid and left Mourinho as only the third coach to win Europe's top club competition with two teams.

He achieved the feat with Porto in 2004 before leaving to manage Chelsea in the English Premier League.

Bayern had made the better start in terms of possession without creating a clear cut chance before Inter scored the crucial opening goal.

The Argentine forward reacted quickly and quickly turned to receive a perfect return pass from Sneijder and clip the ball over Hans Jorg Butt in the Bayern goal.

Hamit Altintop played in Thomas Mueller but the young German striker fluffed the opportunity as he shot straight at Cesar.

Milito also scored the only goal to help Inter beat Siena last weekend to wrap up the Serie A title for the fifth straight year.

Bayern could offer little threat as Inter comfortably held on for a deserved triumph having beaten Chelsea and reigning champions Barcelona en-route to the final.

It ended a 45-year wait for the Italian giants, who last won the European Cup in 1965.

With victory assured, Mourinho shook hands with his beaten Bayern counterpart Louis van Gaal before embarking on an emotional celebration with his team, appearing to wave goodbye as he saluted their delirious fans.

"I want to be the only coach to win the Champions League with three different clubs," AFP quoted him from Italian television.

"It's more likely that I will leave rather than stay."
