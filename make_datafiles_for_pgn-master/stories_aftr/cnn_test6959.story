Gen. Than Shwe received a ceremonial reception in the sandstone presidential palace in New Delhi before he drove to the shrine to India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi to pay homage.

Indian president Pratibha Devisingh Patil, prime minister Manmohan Singh, members of his cabinet and several top bureaucrats greeted the junta leader as a state guest.

The military ruler's trip underscored the close relationship between the two nations -- one seen as one of the world's most vibrant democracies and another despised by the West as a repressive regime.

It came days after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged India and other countries in the region to push Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to comply with UN human rights resolutions and nuclear nonproliferation agreements.

Clinton described life in Myanmar as "dangerous" for the country's inhabitants and called upon other nations to push for democratic reforms there.

"We would encourage India and other countries to send a clear message to Burma that it needs to change its course," State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said last week.

The Myanmar general's itinerary also includes tours of India's information-technology hub in Hyderabad and the industrial center of Jamshedpur.
