(CNN) -- Fifteen years ago, representatives from every nation came together to voice one common goal: to advance the global status of women in the spirit of equality.

We were there in Beijing, China, when women broke their silence and a resounding message burst forth from the walls of the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women: No longer would it be acceptable to separate women's rights from human rights.

Today, we are seeing a powerful momentum materialize as women in diverse regions raise their voices to claim their rights and inspire change while leading neighborhoods, villages, parliaments and nations forward.

Progress on women's equality is reaching different regions at different paces, but we can see improvement in girls' education, workforce participation and political representation. The global net rate of primary school enrollment for girls is up to 89 percent; the number of women holding nonagricultural, paid jobs continues to increase worldwide; and women's global share of parliamentary seats is rising, now at 18.4 percent.

Something much harder to measure, but maybe the most significant of all indicators, is a widespread shift over the past 15 years in the global conversation about women.

Our campaign for equality has come out from the darkness of the periphery. We are moving into an age that enables progress and an environment that sustains it.

Hers is one voice among the millions threatened by a global increase in violence against women -- one in three women will experience violence in her lifetime. We are confronted with a pandemic of violence, and must address it with commensurate force and urgency.

Rebecca carries the weight of unrealized human rights on her shoulders. It is our duty to help lessen her load.

If we want to promote peace and prosperity, we must begin with women. We have seen that in societies where women's rights are respected, economies are stronger, civil societies thrive and political institutions are more open and free.
