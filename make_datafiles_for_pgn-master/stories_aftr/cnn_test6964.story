As he has in the past in humanitarian cases, the pope would intervene if asked by authorities in another country and would do so through proper diplomatic channels, not publicly, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said in a statement.

"The Holy See is following the case with attention and participation," Lombardi said. "The position of the church, which is opposed to the death penalty, is that stoning is a particularly brutal form."

A large photo of Ashtiani has been hung outside Italy's Equal Opportunities Ministry to draw attention to her plight, ANSA reported.

"'This unprecedented act aims to mobilize opinion and contribute to saving Sakineh from a brutal, unacceptable sentence,'' Foreign Minister Franco Frattini and Equal Opportunities Minister Mara Carfagna said in a joint statement, according to ANSA.

Italy's Foreign Ministry told ANSA that it is pursuing clemency for Ashtiani through diplomatic channels.

''The case is being followed closely by the foreign ministry and personally by Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, who has given instructions for close bilateral relations to be maintained with the Iranian authorities so that they consider clemency in this specific case,'' a recent ministry statement said.

Italy is one of Iran's most important trade partners in the European Union, with bilateral trade exceeding $8 billion in 2009, according to a report on the website of the Iranian-Italian Chamber of Commerce.

Iranian authorities imposed the sentence after they saw the photo of a woman without a head scarf in the newspaper, said the International Committee Against Stoning, a human rights group.

In an apology, The Times of London, which ran the photo on its front page August 28, said the woman was wrongly identified as Ashtiani.

According to the Times, one of Ashtiani's former lawyers, Mohammed Mostafaei, gave the paper the photo.

Mostafaei told CNN on Saturday that he still thinks the photo may be of his former client.

The Times reported that Mostafaei said Ashtiani's 22-year-old son had e-mailed the lawyer two photographs three months ago and told him both were of his mother.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran did not answer a CNN telephone call early Sunday morning.

The Committee Against Stoning said Friday "it is Mr. Mostafaei's responsibility to provide an explanation as to why he has disseminated [a] counterfeit photo and information regarding Sakineh's case; his action has only led to increased pressure on Sakineh and her family."

Mostafaei told CNN that Ghaderzadeh three months ago gave him two photos -- one of Ashtiani wearing a hijab (covering) and one without it.

The lawyer said he immediately released the photo of Ashtiani wearing the chador and sent the Times the photo of her without the hijab more recently.

Ashtiani, who is being held in Tabriz, Iran, no longer has visitation rights, the family told CNN.
