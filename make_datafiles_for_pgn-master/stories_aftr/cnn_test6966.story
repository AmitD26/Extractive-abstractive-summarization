(CNN) -- After Haiti's devastating earthquake, Georges Nader picked up Hector Hyppolite's oil-on-cardboard painting like a father would a wounded child. He could barely hold back his tears.

Like so many other things in Haiti, the painting by one of Haiti's foremost artists was gone. A masterpiece lost, and with it a part of Haiti's history.

Each told the history and aspirations of a people who survived hardship and expressed themselves through painting and sculpture.

With few functioning institutions or the kinds of buildings and monuments found in wealthier nations, depictions of sun and sea, people and animals by untrained artists -- some infused with the spiritual traditions of voodoo culture -- came to serve as Haiti's collective memory.

Hyppolite, a voodoo priest and self-taught artist, painted with his fingers and with brushes made of chicken feathers.

On Friday, Nader will stand again before Hyppolite's 1946 still life, its brilliant hues brought back to life by conservators working with the Smithsonian Institution.

"I think it's a miracle," Nader said.

In the immediate aftermath of earthquake, Nader and other art collectors in Haiti rescued thousands of pieces from the rubble that might have been forever lost. In just one room of his museum, he salvaged 1,000 pieces -- 70 percent needed restorative work.

As the second floor of his gallery transformed into a hospital ward for art, Nader was determined to make them all well again.

He and Alexis began making phone calls, knocking on doors. It would take people with tremendous expertise to perform intricate surgery on delicate paintings and objects to make them whole again.

Richard Kurin, under-secretary for history, art and culture at the Smithsonian, said it would have been unconscionable to leave art under the rubble.

The center is also training Haitians how to conserve. A course in September taught 26 participants how to identify deterioration agents, apply first aid treatment, prepare and respond to emergencies and create safe storage spaces for collections.

"I think we look at the restoration of art as the restoration of hope," he said. "By restoring the past you are giving people access to their heritage."

"We wanted to give Haitian art, the Haitian people, a voice," she said about "Saving Grace," the first such show of Haitian art in the United States in over a decade. Many of the pieces have previously not been seen outside Haiti.

Nader hopes those who relish the visual feast will gather an understanding of the vital role that art plays in Haitian society. And why it is incumbent on Haitians to bring back what an earthquake buried last January.
