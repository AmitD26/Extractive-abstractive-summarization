Eli "Paperboy" Reed sang for more than three hours for an audience of no more than 15. Men named Red, Bubba and Sledge nodded with approval. And word on the street was out: Been a long time since somebody like the Paperboy has come through!

It's been more than 18 months since that performance. The Paperboy is now hitting the big stage.

When he hits stride, Reed unleashes raw sexual energy through deep-bellied hollers, explosive bursts from his band and auctioneer-like rapidity. "... There's gonna be an explosion, baby. Gonna be a-, gonna be a-, gonna be a- ... Owwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!! ..."

Mike Elizondo, who has produced stars like Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, is the producer for "Come and Get It."

"I played it for Justin Timberlake and a couple other people. I was like, 'Dude, you've gotta check this kid out.' "

Blues, gospel and the 'strange cat'

In high school, instead of poring over algebra books, Reed studied the likes of Sam Cooke and other R&B greats, listening to their tone, as well as the heart and soul they put into their music.

He played saxophone and guitar in a jazz band in high school. When he performed, he wore his grandfather's hat, and soon got dubbed "Paperboy" for his 1950s newsboy looks. The name stuck.

Shortly after high school graduation, at the age of 18, the Jewish kid from Brookline, Massachusetts, set out from his parents' home to the heart of the nation's blues country.

"I found myself thrust into it from the word go, playing all the time," he says. "I pretty much immersed myself in this culture 24 hours a day."

"Once people see that you're enthusiastic and love the music and that I could sing ... everybody was very forgiving of it."

At juke joints, he says, the audiences were working-class folks "just there to have a good time." They never got out of hand with him or the band, he pauses, "unless they're really drunk." When he gets a chance, he still goes back to Red's, the first juke joint he ever played in Clarksdale.

Along the way, Reed has picked up fans from Natasha Bedingfield to Nick Lowe to Daryl Hall of Hall & Oates.

Earlier this year, Hall had Reed perform on his Web show "Live from Daryl's House," where musicians play along with Hall at his place in New York. Hall ranks Reed in the top 5 of those who have played on his show. "I look for unique people and I look for really talented people, and he fits that bill all the way," Hall says.

"The guy is a strange throwback of the time, but he doesn't do it like an Elvis impersonator. He's the real thing."

Hall says he was so stunned by Reed's looks that he pulled out pictures from his youth to show the budding musician. "He was dressed in almost identical clothing as me," Hall says, laughing. "He's a strange cat."

But, he adds, of Reed's authentic style: "I don't know how he does it, to tell you the truth. He's a musical time traveler."

Producer Elizondo agrees. "He's doing something that nobody his age is doing."

The new album -- with most of its songs written by Reed -- was recorded live in Boston over 12 days. Six days were spent tracking the rhythm section, and another six days to track the band's horns and strings.

"Sonically, it stands up to anything that's out there," Elizondo says.

Like everything in the music business, the verdict is still out on if Reed catches on in the mainstream. To that end, Hall says that "there is no mainstream that matters" anymore.

"It's all about enthusiasm and fanaticism to your particular thing," Hall says. "And that's more important than being mainstream. It always was, really."

And there's no doubt about Reed's soul. Hall and Elizondo say his audience will grow at the grass-roots level as more and more people hear his stuff.
