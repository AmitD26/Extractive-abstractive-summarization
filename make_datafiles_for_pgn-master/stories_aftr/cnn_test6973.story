(CNN) -- Top seed Caroline Wozniacki remained on track for a first grand slam singles title after a straight sets win over Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova saw the Dane progress to the semifinals of the U.S. Open.

Last year's runner up in New York made just 18 unforced errors in the match, compared to 43 from 45th ranked Cibulkova who also struggled to hold serve on the Arthur Ashe court.

"It felt like playing in a hurricane," world number two Wozniacki told the official U.S. Open website. "But it was the same for both players and I was happy to get through."

Home hopes distant ahead of U.S. Open

"I don't think she was just making errors for no reason," Zvonareva, who is yet to drop a set during  the tournament, told the official U.S. Open website. "I think I was making it difficult for her."

The result also means 26-year-old Zvonareva has now reached the last four in two successive grand slams, following her run to the Wimbledon final in June.

Meanwhile, in the other half of the draw defending champion Kim Clijsters came through a tough three-set quarterfinal to set up a last-four clash with former winner Venus Williams.

The Belgian second seed battled past Australian Sam Stosur 6-4 5-7 6-3, while third seed Williams overcame Italy's Francesca Schiavone 7-6 6-4 to book her place in the semifinal.

The pair will meet for the 13th time in their careers in Friday's semifinal, with their head-to-head tied at 6-6. They are both chasing their third titles at Flushing meadows.
