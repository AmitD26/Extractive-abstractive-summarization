(CNN) -- A widely anticipated meeting of North Korean ruling party members went off anticlimactically Tuesday, with only the announcement that leader Kim Jong Il was reappointed general-secretary of the party.

The Korean Workers' Party last convened its delegates more than four decades ago.

On Monday, Kim's youngest son, Kim Jong Un, was promoted to the rank of general, a sign of the transitioning of power to the next generation that was nevertheless buried in the last paragraph of an article by state-run media.

Opinion: Change in the wind?

That kind of mystery surrounds the man who is widely expected to become the secretive communist nation's next leader.

Vice guide to North Korea

Little else is known about Kim Jong Un. Two photos of him consistently circulate in news reports outside of North Korea. That's because he's been kept off the radar by the North.

Before Kim's promotion to general on Monday, North Korea's state-run media didn't mention him -- there were no family photos showing him as a youngster and no images of him by his father's side, learning to lead.

In January 2009, South Korean intelligence reportedly intercepted a message circulated around North Korean embassies globally, stating that Kim Jong Un was being prepared for succession. Since then, there has been no further confirmation from any North Korean official source.

What is life like inside North Korea?

One key question if Kim Jong Un does inherit leadership: Can he sustain his grandfather's and father's legacy, even as North Koreans go hungry while the country pours money into its nuclear program and military?

Kim Jong Il introduced his "Red Banner" policy in 1996, a more militant tack than his father's blend of Stalinism and Korean self-reliance.

North Korea has acknowledged producing roughly 40 kilograms of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs, according to the U.S. State Department.

The U.N. Security Council last year condemned North Korea's launch of a long-range rocket, saying it violated a resolution banning ballistic missile testing. The North expelled U.S. nuclear experts and U.N. nuclear inspectors after the rebuke.
