A video image shows Rielle Hunter arriving at the federal courthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina, on August 6.

Last year, after months of denials, Edwards admitted having an affair with Hunter while he was campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2006.

Edwards denies that he is the father of a baby Hunter bore in February 2008, saying the affair was over before she became pregnant.

Former Edwards aide Andrew Young claimed the baby was his. But Young later said that the former senator is the father and that his paternity claim had been made at Edwards' request. Hunter has not said who the father is.  Watch Hunter and baby arrive at federal court »

Hunter, born Lisa Druck in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was known for her partying ways as a young adult in New York, novelist Jay McInerney told People. He said Hunter, whom he dated for a while, and her friends inspired his book "Story of My Life."

After moving to Los Angeles, California, in 1991, she married Alexander Hunter III, according to the Raleigh (North Carolina) News & Observer. They divorced in 2000.  Watch how a scandal might not wreck a career »

Hunter told the television show "Extra" that she met Edwards by chance in 2006 when she was 42.

"It was a random meeting. He was in a business meeting in New York, and I was in the same place," she said.

Edwards' wife, Elizabeth, related to talk show host Oprah Winfrey how her husband described the beginning of the affair.

"She was standing in front of the hotel and said to him, 'You are so hot.' I can't deliver it, because I don't know how to deliver such lines," she told Winfrey. "But 'You are so hot' are the words she said to him."

The tabloid National Enquirer first reported in October 2007 that Edwards had engaged in an affair, but he denied it for months. He finally acknowledged the liaison in an August 2008 interview with ABC's "Nightline" as the Enquirer's reporting gained momentum, including the publication of a photo the tabloid said showed Edwards holding the baby.

Since the birth of her daughter, according to ABC, Hunter has assumed aliases and resided in various expensive homes in North Carolina and, more recently, in Santa Barbara, California.
