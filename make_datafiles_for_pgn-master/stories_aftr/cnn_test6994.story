(CNN) -- A 26-year police veteran who headed the Dallas Crime Stoppers has been indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with the tipster-based crime fighting program, U.S. Attorney James T. Jacks of the Northern District of Texas said Thursday.

Ross and other officers determined which tips were eligible for a cash reward, based on whether an arrest or indictment of a particular subject was related to the tip, Jacks said.

Ross selected the tips to be presented to the NTCC for approval of a cash reward, Jacks said.

Once the NTCC gave its approval, the anonymous tipster could call Crime Stoppers with a previously assigned tip number and would be given a tip number and code word, Jacks said.

The tip numbers and code words were emailed to JP Morgan Chase Bank, where the anonymous tipster was required to present the tip number and code word to collect the reward, Jacks said.

Ross allegedly sent the bank the Crime Stoppers cash reward list that included legitimate code words as well as tip numbers and code words for tips that Ross had allegedly altered, Jacks said.

Ross allegedly gave the bogus tip information to Delley, who would collect reward money from the bank, Jacks said. Ross allegedly instructed Delley to deposit the money into Ross' personal bank account or give the cash directly to Ross, Jacks charged.

If convicted, Ross and Delley each could face a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and a $250,000 fine, Jacks said.
