He pulled three clear by the fifth, play briefly held up by a hailstorm which left the players sheltering for cover, and was never headed.

But Germany's Kaymer hit back when Donald three-putted the short sixth and a birdie on the par-5 eighth saw the gap cut to just one hole.

He closed out the biggest victory of his career on the short 16th and the $1.4 million check.

"It couldn't have gone any better -- not to get to the 18th hole in any match this week and pretty much go through reasonably stress-free," Donald told the official PGA Tour website.

"I played solid this week. It's nice to get the victory."

Donald had never trailed throughout his six matches and needed just 73 holes to reach the final, beating Tiger Woods' record of 77.

In the all-American third place play-off, Matt Kuchar beat Bubba Watson 2&1 in a scrappy match.
