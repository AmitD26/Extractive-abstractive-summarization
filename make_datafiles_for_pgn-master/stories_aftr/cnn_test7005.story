Barcelona are also lodging an official complaint to the European governing body after Mourinho's comments.

But Mourinho told gathered reporters Friday that he would have no more to say on the subject, claiming pictures of the incidents would back up his claims.

"An image is worth more than a thousand words. I said what I said and I have nothing to add," he told the official Real Madrid website.

"Whoever criticizes my words must criticize the images and think that the photos have been edited by photoshop and that the video was staged."

Mourinho said he would be resting key players for this weekend's Spanish league match against Real Zaragoza ahead of the return tie in the Nou Camp Tuesday.

Despite his pessimism about the eventual outcome after Wednesday's defeat, the Portuguese coach refused to write off Real's season.
