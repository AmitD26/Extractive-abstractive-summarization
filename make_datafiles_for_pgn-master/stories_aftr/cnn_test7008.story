(CNN) -- Canada secured only their second-ever win at the Cricket World Cup on Monday with a five wicket defeat of Kenya.

The result leaves Kenya bottom of Group A, with Canada one place above them in seventh after picking up their first points of the tournament.

Eldine Baptiste's Kenya team batted for the full 50 overs for the first time at this World Cup, with all-rounder Thomas Odoyo their top scorer after he hit 51 runs off 62 balls.

Kenya will go up against reigning champions Australia on the same day at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.

The South-Africa born opener will return to England in order to have surgery on a hernia injury.

The International Cricket Council have granted England permission to call up 24-year-old Eoin Morgan as a replacement.

Morgan, who represented Ireland in the 2007 World Cup, was initially ruled out of the competition with a finger injury.
