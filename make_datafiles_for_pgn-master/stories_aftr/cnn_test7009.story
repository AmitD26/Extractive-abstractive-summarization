(CNN)  -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has sent letters of invite to both the Pakistani president and prime minister for them to attend the semifinal of the Cricket World Cup between the two nations next week.

The match between the two Asian rivals -- two of most passionately supported cricket nations in the world -- takes place in Mohali, India on March 30, and will provide the biggest clash of the 2011 event.

And, with tensions between the nations having been high in recent years, Prime Minister Singh has taken the opportunity to prove India and Pakistan can show unity on what is likely to be a passionate and dramatic occasion.

"Both nations love good cricket so it will be a tough contest. I'm hosting a lunch so that all of my office can watch the game, but I hope the team that plays the best cricket wins."

Wednesday's showdown will be the biggest fixture between the sporting and political rivals in recent years.

However, it would be the first visit to India by a Pakistani head of state or government for a decade.

"We're coming back to cricket diplomacy. The point is not to win the game but the fact that we are playing together. There is excitement on both sides. The politicians have to take this forward in a meaningful way."
