(CNN) -- Yuvraj Singh held his nerve to steer India into the last four of the World Cup and end Australia's 12-year reign as champions.

Yuvraj struck a vital 57 not out to ensure co-hosts India reached their target of 261 with more than two overs to spare and book a semifinal clash with Asian rivals Pakistan.

Earlier, captain Ricky Ponting had hit an imperious 104 and Brad Haddin a quickfire 53 as Australia reached a competitive total of 260-5.

After the game Yuvraj told Sky Sports: "The pressure was something else. People say it's just another game, but beating the three-time champions I feel is really special for me and our team."

Defeat came as a bitter blow to Ponting, who has had to field questions about his future both as player and captain throughout the tournament, but he later insisted he wouldn't be stepping down.

"We competed hard, there's no doubt about that," he said. "We thought we were in with a chance at the half-way stage, and that we had a reasonable total.

India reached 44 in their reply before Virender Sehwag fell but Tendulkar (53) and Gambhir (50) continued the charge with a partnership of 70 before the batsman known as "the little master" was dismissed by Shaun Tait.

But Yuvraj showed plenty of character to lead his side home, despite the calamitous run out of Gambhir. Raina added a vital 34 and when Yuvraj smashed the winning runs it sparked wild scenes of celebration in Ahmedabad.

Meanwhile, England spinner Michael Yardy has flown home from the World Cup because he is suffering from depression.

"But I felt it was the only sensible option for me and I wanted to be honest about the reason behind that decision."
