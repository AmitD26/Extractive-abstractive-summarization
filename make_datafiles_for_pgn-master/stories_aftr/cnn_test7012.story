(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is recovering "really, really well" from surgery that implanted a synthetic bone and a shunt in her skull, her doctors said Thursday.

The Arizona Democrat told her neurosurgeon that she was extremely excited to have crossed a key milestone in her recovery, which her doctors called "almost miraculous" considering she was shot point-blank in the head in January.

"She looks great," he said. "I started calling her 'Gorgeous Gaby' today."

The Arizona Democrat was shot outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket where she was meeting with constituents in January. Six people -- including a federal judge -- were killed and 13 others were wounded in the attack.

Jared Lee Loughner stands accused in the shooting.

"It really is a significant step. More than just getting the bone back, it is a marker for where we are" in Giffords' recovery, Kim said.

Kim said an internal drain, called a shunt, was inserted into Giffords' cranial cavity to carry excess fluids from the brain to the abdominal cavity. Giffords will have to wear the shunt forever.

"Everything went as planned," he told PBS Thursday from the International Space Station. "Her neurosurgeons are very happy and she's recuperating and she's actually getting back to therapy today so it went really, really well."

Monday, Giffords watched and cheered as the Endeavour took off on its final voyage from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
