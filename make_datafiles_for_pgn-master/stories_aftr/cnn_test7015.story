Clichy, 25, will cost Roberto Mancini's side $11.2 million and has signed a four-year contract at the City of Manchester Stadium.

"I'm really happy to be joining such a great club," Clichy told Manchester City's official web site.

As a member of the Gunners' last title-winning squad, Clichy became the youngest player to receive a Premier League title medal and his compatriot and former manager Arsene Wenger thanked him for his services.

"We would like to thank Gael for eight years of terrific service to Arsenal, during which time he gave absolutely everything for the club ...Gael leaves with our respect and best wishes. We wish him the very best for his future career."

Clichy will be reunited with former teammates Kolo Toure and Patrick Vieira at City, and the Toulouse native is looking forward to working with his old friends.

"Kolo would pick me up and drop me at home and his wife used to cook meals for me. Patrick was always there to offer me advice so it's wonderful to be back and at the same club they are at."

FA Cup winners City finished third in England's top flight last season to qualify for their first-ever Champions League campaign.
