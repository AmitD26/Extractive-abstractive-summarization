(CNN) -- For all of our talk of Americans being straight shooters who don't like to mince words and have the freedom of speech to say exactly what's on our minds, we sure punk out when it comes to elected officials speaking the truth.

Case in point: President Barack Obama describing American corporations as being "lazy" in competing globally.

Now, if you hear that word by itself, you would think, "Man, that's horrible our president said such a thing." But here is EXACTLY what he said during a conversation with Boeing's CEO as they discussed American businesses selling more products overseas, and attracting foreign investment to the U.S.:

Then all of a sudden, Texas Gov. Rick Perry used the word in an ad, not even bothering with the context. Fox anchor Martha MacCallum said Obama was "scolding" Americans. Sean Hannity, never one to let facts get in the way of a good lie, said Obama "attacked" Americans. And the king of taking anything out of context, Rush Limbaugh, said the president "insults the people who make this country work."

There is another word for this: arrogance.

A few months ago I read a story where American college students were dismayed that they had to apply for jobs overseas. Well, if that's where multinational corporations are hiring, then we might have to learn to get a passport, hop on the plane, and learn how to Skype in order to talk to family members. Are we so arrogant to think the rest of the world is desperate to come here and we may not have to go to other countries?

We can't continue to act like our stuff doesn't stink. There are many areas where Americans are lazy, and in the words of President George W. Bush, we must end "the soft bigotry of low expectations."

Well, that ain't gonna cut it. And when we lose, Americans totally freak out, wondering how we got beat. Easy. H-A-R-D W-O-R-K.

We need a dose of reality at times to remind us that to to be the best, we must have the right work ethic.

According to the Broad Education Foundation:

-- America's top math students rank 25th out of 30 countries

In 2000, the last time The World Health Organization ranked the top health systems in the world, the U.S. was 37th, behind France (first); Oman (eighth); and Chile (33rd).

Maybe part of the problem is the American culture rewards weakness. If America wants to be the absolute best, we must stop telling our children that they are so exceptional when they are not. If your kid can't shoot, pass, dribble or rebound, guess what? They are terrible at basketball and should find a new sport. If it's just about the enjoyment, fine. But if it's about winning, they can't cut it.

I was talking to a CNN colleague whose mother is a teacher and she said that her mom can't grade papers in red ink anymore because that is considered too aggressive. Really? Has America become so weak that we can't even handle a school paper graded in red?

Notre Dame's Brian Kelly and Nebraska's Bo Pelini had to apologize because folks complained about them yelling and shouting at their players on the sidelines. Thank God Vince Lombardi and Knute Rockne are dead. We would run them out of town!

Hey, I'm down with the philosophy of Jobs. Those are the kind of companies I've worked for in the past, and I was taught that if you want to win at something, you better be the best. Heck, even Jobs wasn't above criticizing President Obama, saying that one of the reasons he was on his way to a one-term presidency was because, "He's having trouble leading because he's reluctant to offend people or piss them off."

"Yes, that's not a problem I ever had," Isaacson quotes Jobs as saying.

I'll guarantee you this: Weak and lazy corporate bosses allow weak and lazy employees to stick around. And weak and lazy employees tend to turn out a weak and sorry product that nobody wants. And weak and lazy people accept mediocrity with ease.

America, it's time to suck it up. If we love the harsh and in-your-face American Idol/X Factor judging of Simon Cowell, then we should accept it in the real world. This nation needs a swift kick in the butt, and there is nothing wrong when President Obama says it. If House Speaker John Boehner said the same, I would be hollering, "Amen!"

So Gov. Perry, instead of spending time taking President Obama out of context in an ad, you need to work harder in debates. Herman Cain, you don't like the president using the word lazy? Then bone up on foreign affairs. Republicans and Democrats unhappy with President Obama challenging our corporate leaders, stop kicking the can down the road on the tough budget stuff and make a principled, not partisan, call.

We have been better and can be better. So let's do better. Today.
