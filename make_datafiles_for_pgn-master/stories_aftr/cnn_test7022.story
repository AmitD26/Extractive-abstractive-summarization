(CNN) -- Three American college students were being held Tuesday, possibly in a Cairo courthouse, accused of lobbing Molotov cocktails during the unrest gripping Tahrir Square, authorities and family members said.

"I can't remember seeing his face look like that," said Nicole Sweeney, whose brother Derrik Sweeney is among those detained. "He looks absolutely terrified."

American University in Cairo identified the three detained students as Sweeney, 19, a Georgetown University student from Jefferson City, Missouri; Gregory Porter, 19, from Glenside, Pennsylvania, who attends Drexel University in Philadelphia; and Luke Gates, 21, of Bloomington, Indiana, who goes to Indiana University.

They were spending the semester in Cairo as part of a study-abroad program, according to American University.

Cairo police have questioned the three, who were detained Monday night, and they will face additional investigation by prosecutors, said Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the office of Egypt's general prosecutor.

Later, he told CNN that the prosecutor was unable to question the students on Tuesday because of ongoing protests. They will be questioned on Wednesday in the presence of legal representatives from the U.S. Embassy, he said.

Nicole Sweeney said her family had been told the men were apparently being held in a courthouse.

Social-media posts appear to show Gates and Sweeney in the thick of recent protests in Cairo, with Gates indicating he had been injured in clashes over the weekend.

Another Facebook account shows a man resembling Sweeney during protests in Cairo.

CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the posts.

"He told us that everything was fine and he was really happy," Gates said of an earlier conversation with his son. "Luke said so many people were friendly to him and that it was easy to make friends there."

News of their detention came on the fourth consecutive day of clashes between protesters and police in and around Tahrir Square, which also was the focal point of a popular uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak as president in February. Demonstrators are calling for the removal of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, the ruling body that took power after Mubarak's ouster.

Georgetown and Drexel officials both released statements saying they are working with American University and U.S. authorities to obtain their students' release.

David Lynfield, deputy press officer for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, said the Egyptian authorities' "claims are being currently investigated."

Sweeney interned for U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Missouri, between February and May, press secretary Pat Sloca said. Luetkemeyer has been in touch with the U.S. State Department about Sweeney's detention, said Sloca, who added that the student had been an "outstanding worker" during his internship.

He is a dual Arabic and psychology major who wanted to get more experience in an Arabic-speaking country, according to his sister.

"The Cairo program was actually the most stable of his options," she said.

Amin Bonnah, a visiting professor at Georgetown who taught an Arabic class Sweeney took, recalled him as a "very peaceful, socially peaceful, loving person."

"I do not believe he is the kind of person who did that," Bonnah said.

Gates has been interested in different cultures since childhood and began applying to overseas programs before the Egyptian revolution this year, according to his father.

The American University in Cairo, where the three were studying, describes itself as "an American liberal arts university in the heart of the Middle East." The university was founded in 1919 by Americans and says it "offers a vital bridge between the cultures of East and West." It is chartered and accredited in both the United States and Egypt.

The university boasts nearly 5,000 undergraduates from 113 countries as well as the largest English-language library in Egypt. The AUC Press is the leading publisher of English-language books in the Arab world, the school says.
