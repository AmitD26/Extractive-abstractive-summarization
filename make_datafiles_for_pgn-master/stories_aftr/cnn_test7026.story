Luckily for them, Whedon is a comic-book fan.

In 2005's "Serenity: Those Left Behind" and 2008's "Serenity: Better Days" -- both produced by Whedon for Dark Horse Comics -- we get to see Captain Mal and friends in action.

"Float Out," released Thursday by Dark Horse, is written by actor, comedian and "Firefly" devotee Patton Oswalt based on an idea he floated to Whedon.

The one-off book opens with three friends of Wash (full name: Hoban Washburne) pausing to remember him before christening a new ship -- The Jetwash -- in his honor. That setup serves as an excuse to flash back to three stories from Wash's past, each showing a different side of his endearing personality.

Diehard fans won't learn a whole lot about Wash that they didn't already know. And anyone hoping to see the entire Serenity crew back together will be disappointed.

But Wash and surprise endings apparently go together.

The next visit is scheduled for November, when "Serenity: The Shepherd's Tale," a look at the backstory of Shepherd Book, is due to be released.
