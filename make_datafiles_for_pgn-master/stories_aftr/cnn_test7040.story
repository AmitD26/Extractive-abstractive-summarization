(CNN) -- Good things come to those who wait.

Reminiscent of "Desperate Housewives" in its less desperate heyday, "GCB" follows Amanda Vaughn (Leslie Bibb), a woman who ruled in high school but has since been humbled by life when her marriage ends in scandal and she has to return home to Dallas.

Unfortunately for Amanda, a mother of two, her former "frenemies"-turned-socialites and their husbands haven't quite evolved, and they do everything they can to make her life miserable. Emmy- and Tony-winning actress Kristin Chenoweth stars as one of Amanda's rivals, and Annie Potts steals scenes as Amanda's meddlesome mother. The show is based on a best-selling book from Kim Gatlin.

NBC's "30 Rock" is returning at 8 p.m. ET Thursday for a sixth season, TNT's gritty cop drama "Southland" will be back at 10 p.m. ET January 17 for a fourth season, and the 11th season of "American Idol" resumes at 8 p.m. ET January 18 and 19 on Fox.

There are also a slew of new offerings to sort through. For your channel-surfing pleasure, we've selected the good, the bad and the forgettable:

The good

Don't worry. It sounds more complicated than it is, and Lucas is a treat to watch.

• "Alcatraz" (debuts 8 p.m. ET January 16, Fox): America's most infamous prison becomes a time-travel portal in this trippy but fun new sci-fi drama from none other than J.J. Abrams ("Lost" and "Fringe"). "Alcatraz" stars Sam Neill ("Jurassic Park") and Jorge Garcia of "Lost" fame.

• "Luck" (debuts 9 p.m. ET January 29, HBO): The latest creation from David Milch ("Deadwood"), "Luck" stars Oscar-winning actor Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man," "Kramer vs. Kramer") as a gangster of sorts. Hoffman leads a stellar cast that includes Nick Nolte and Dennis Farina in this methodical and fascinating drama about horse racing and the troubled people who inhabit that world.

• "Smash" (debuts 10 p.m. ET February 6, NBC): Executive producer Steven Spielberg and NBC hope to steal the spotlight from "Glee" with this exciting new music-driven drama. "Smash" follows a Broadway musical from its planning stages to the big stage and stars Debra Messing and Oscar-winning actress Anjelica Huston ("Prizzi's Honor").

• "The River" (debuts 9 p.m. ET February 7, ABC): Bruce Greenwood ("Star Trek" the movie) stars as an explorer and wildlife TV host who goes missing in the Amazon jungle. Leslie Hope ("24") plays his wife, a woman determined to find him who heads to the Amazon with a reality TV crew and her son (Joe Anderson of "The Crazies"). Instead, she finds lots of ghosts and questions.

• "The Finder" (debuts 9 p.m. ET Thursday, Fox): Geoff Stults ("Happy Town") and Michael Clarke Duncan ("The Green Mile") star in this dull but well-intentioned spinoff of "Bones."

• "Fashion Star" (debuts 10 p.m. ET March 13, NBC): In a lopsided attempt to imitate "Project Runway," former supermodel Elle Macpherson has created this reality competition series that features celebrity mentors Jessica Simpson and Nicole Richie.

Yawn.
