London, England (CNN) -- Formula 1 will continue to take place in Britain for the next 17 years after a deal was struck between Silverstone's owners and the sport's chief Bernie Ecclestone.

Monday's announcement by the track's owners means the oldest venue on the F1 calendar keeps its place.

Silverstone managing director Richard Phillips told the Press Association: "We've always had five-year deals and never been able to get the investment we needed to redevelop.

"The relationship with Formula One Management has been improving," added Phillips. "There's a good working relationship with him now and we don't have any issues."

Applauding the negotiating team, BRDC president and 1996 F1 world champion Damon Hill told the Press Association: "It's not easy to enter into an agreement of this magnitude. It's a big commitment.

"But the BRDC felt we wanted this relationship to continue, and we were prepared to back the negotiating team, with the level of risk satisfactory for the deal to go ahead.
