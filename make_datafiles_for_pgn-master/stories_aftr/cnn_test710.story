LONDON, England -- Graffiti artist Banksy, famed for infiltrating museum collections without their knowledge and spray-painting public buildings around the world, is holding his first major exhibition in years.

A Banksy painting of the British House of Commons at England's Bristol museum.

CNN's Max Foster got a preview of his largest project to date.

The artist's anonymity gained him notoriety and he became one of the art world's biggest names with his works selling at auction for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

His work is hidden among the museum's usual exhibits and is split into different rooms, including installations, paintings and sculptures.

In one of the paintings, a character has been cut out and is instead sitting on the painting's frame, perhaps taking a break from posing?

Another piece, which at first glance, looks like a copy of an ancient classical statue, is in fact a woman over-loaded with countless shopping bags as she browses for yet another item.

Perhaps the most controversial, yet equally light-hearted piece, is a painting of the British Parliamentary House of Commons, filled with chimpanzees who are looking surprisingly "ministerial."

While one of the more poignant installations is that of Tweety, the Warner Bros. animated character famous for his upbeat personality and energy, looking old and life-less.

"This show is my vision of the future," the artist said .
