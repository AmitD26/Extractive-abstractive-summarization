Editor's note: We asked readers to weigh in on CNN.com Live producer Jarrett Bellini's vacation destination, and you chose South Africa. Check back for a wrap-up of his trip.

Jarrett Bellini explores South Africa's Cape of Good Hope.

Next thing I know, a glass of tequila is slammed in front of me with a bit of sage bartender advice, "Might as well."

Normally, one would simply decline and go about attempting to have a relatively human-like existence on planet Earth.  But at this place, there's really no backing out. In fact, unless you like spontaneous hat parties and have a thing for sleeping under tables, it's best not to hang out in the reception room.

Fortunately, I'm a rather strong-willed individual, free-thinking and confident. So, naturally, I buckled under the pressure. What can I say? I like these people. They wear funny hats.

But as I was sitting there with a few other hostel folks who, apparently, also found it completely fit to begin ruining their day before nine, a Dutch kid came into the room and offhandedly mentioned that he and two Dutch girls had a car and were driving out to the Cape of Good Hope. My ears perked up.

"Can I come?"

Might as well.
