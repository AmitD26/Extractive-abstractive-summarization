(CNN) -- Troops in the southern Philippines early Sunday took advantage of martial law to hunt down those believed responsible for last week's killings there.

Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the Eastern Mindanao command, told CNN on Saturday that searchers have made arrests and recovered firearms and vehicles from a clan implicated in the killings. He said local residents welcome the deployment of the troops.

Army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said martial law -- under which police can make arrests without a warrant -- went into effect at 9 p.m. Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days.

Brawner said the measure was invoked to impose peace on the region after the unrest, which led to troops being mobilized.

Andal Ampatuan Sr., the patriarch, became ill and was hospitalized after he, too, was taken in.

On Tuesday, Philippine authorities charged Ampatuan and other suspects with 25 counts of murder in the killings. Still more suspects were taken into custody Friday.

The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said.

The National Bureau of Investigation has moved a third witness to Manila for questioning, the Philippines News Agency reported Thursday.

"At the moment, we are interviewing the witness so that we would know what he knows about the incident in Maguindanao," NBI Director Nestor Mantaring said. The witness claimed to have been at the site during the massacre.

Witnesses and local officials have blamed the younger Ampatuan, a longtime ally of the Philippines president and a known warlord. They said the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging him in the May gubernatorial election.

Asked why martial law was imposed 12 days after the killings, Cabangbang said authorities "were trying to build a case -- a tight case" against suspects.

"But it is taking long to build a case, so I think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects, and allowed us to search, even without warrant. So we really need this declaration of state of martial law."

Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media.

Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation.
