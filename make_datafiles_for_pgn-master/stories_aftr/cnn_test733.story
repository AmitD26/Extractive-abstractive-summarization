Abu Zubaydah, considered one of al Qaeda's senior lieutenants, lay in a pool of blood on a street in Faisalabad, Pakistan, having been shot three times during a U.S.-coordinated raid on a house where a group of suspected terrorists was building a bomb. CIA operative John Kiriakou, who helped plan the raid, rushed to the scene. But when he gazed down at the critically wounded man, it didn't quite look like the person he had seen in a 4-year-old passport.

In his new book, "The Reluctant Spy," Kiriakou gives an insider's view of his secret life as a spy and his role in fighting the war on terror.

Kiriakou said he was able to quickly verify Zubaydah's identity by sending a picture of his ear to CIA headquarters in Virginia. "I didn't realize until that night that no two people have the same ears. It's like a fingerprint," he said. The American spy was ordered by then-CIA Director George Tenet to do everything in his power to keep Zubaydah alive and to never let him out of his sight. That's exactly what Kiriakou did.

Rushed to a rundown Pakistani hospital, Zubaydah barely made it through surgery. Word had apparently gotten out to al Qaeda where he was being treated. "Al Qaeda people started driving by the hospital just opening fire on the hospital," Kiriakou said, and a Pakistani security officer quickly arranged for a helicopter to transfer Zubaydah to a military base. Once on the base, Kiriakou used a sheet to tie the comatose Zubaydah to his bed and then stood watch.

After a couple of days, Zubaydah was transferred to an undisclosed location for further treatment. That was the last time Kiriakou saw him.

Kiriakou said his conversations with Zubaydah were surprising. "I expected an irrational, radical, hate-filled, hard-core terrorist, and what I got was a frightened young guy who realized he was in way over his head, had made terrible mistakes and was going to pay for it."

In summer 2002, Kiriakou was back working at headquarters in Virginia when he was summoned to a top-secret meeting. He said he was told the Bush administration had decided the United States was going to invade Iraq in the spring -- it was a done deal. His job was to support the mission. Kiriakou said he was dumbfounded. "Here was someone at the CIA, obviously plugged into the plans of the executive branch, telling us that the public debate in Congress, reflected almost daily in the press, meant nothing." Months later, Congress passed a war resolution.

Kiriakou also discussed the CIA's use of harsh interrogation techniques on detainees.

However, a government report released in summer 2009 said the technique was actually used 83 times against Zubaydah. Kiriakou said he now feels he was duped by the agency. He questioned whether any useful information really came from the detainee and said he believes "it caused more damage to our national prestige than was worth it."
