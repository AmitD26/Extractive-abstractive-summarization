(CNN) -- Nigeria joined Group C rivals Egypt in the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations after they completed a 3-0 victory over Mozambique on Wednesday.

Osaze Odemwingie struck either side of halftime break for Nigeria at the Tundavala Stadium in Lubango before substitute Obafemi Martins sealed victory for the the 'Super Eagles'.

Nigeria had enjoyed the majority of possession and took the lead moments before the interval when Odemwingie found space inside the penalty area.

The Lokomotiv Moscow midfielder was able to take full advantage and rifled a low near-post shot past Mozambique goalkeeper Joao Rafael and into the net.

Everton striker Yakubu was substituted and replaced by Martins who got his name on the scoresheet five minutes from time.

Defending champions Egypt cruised into the knockout stages with a 100 percent record after a routine 2-0 victory over Benin which extended their unbeaten run in the Africa Cup of Nations to 16 games.

Egypt coach Hassan Shehata rested key players Ahmed Fathi and Wael Gomaa but they still had too much quality for Benin and took the lead in the seventh minute with an audacious effort by Ahmed Al-Mohammadi.
