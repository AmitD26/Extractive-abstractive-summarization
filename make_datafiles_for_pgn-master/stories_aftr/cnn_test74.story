(CNN) -- It might be Oz, Kansas or simply somewhere over the rainbow.

While the destination may not be known, there's no doubt the blue gingham dress wore by Judy Garland, as Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz," has a new home.

The price was not the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West, as the Wizard of Oz demanded from Dorothy to send her back home to Auntie Em in the classic 1939 movie. Rather, someone this weekend paid $480,000 for Dorothy's dress, according to Julien's Auctions.

Buyers of the items were not identified.

It remains to be seen if Dorothy's dress will be reunited with her ruby slippers.

The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures -- with the help of "angel donors" including actor Leonardo DiCaprio -- acquired one of four pairs of the iconic red shoes last February.

That set are called the "Witch's Shoes," because they were likely seen on the Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in the film, according to the Academy. They're also likely the pair Dorothy, as played by Garland, had on in close-ups, such as in the memorable scene when she clicks the heels of the red shoes three times to head home.
