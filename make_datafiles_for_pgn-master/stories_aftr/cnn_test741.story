CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Lend us your ears and follow your nose. This broadcast of CNN Student News appeals to the senses. From the CNN Center, I'm Carl Azuz.

First Up: Nuclear Summit

I.D. Me

TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1964. I graduated from Princeton University and got my law degree from Harvard. I have two daughters: Malia and Sasha. I'm first lady Michelle Obama, the country's first African-American first lady.

AZUZ: Right now, Michelle Obama is on her first official, solo trip as first lady. She arrived in Mexico yesterday for a three-day visit there. It's being made "in recognition of the deep ties between the United States and Mexico." While she is there, Mrs. Obama will meet with the first lady of Mexico, tour different cultural museums, and give a speech at a local university. But before that, she was in Haiti. It was a surprise stop Tuesday on her way to Mexico. She toured some of the areas that were devastated by the massive earthquake that hit the country in January. Afterward, the first lady promised that the U.S. is committed to helping Haiti recover from the disaster.

Offer of Resignation

AZUZ: In Asia, Kurmanbek Bakiev, the president of Kyrgyzstan, says that he is willing to resign, but only if he and his relatives are allowed to leave the country safely. Kyrgyzstan has been going through some political turmoil recently. And when protesters took over the main government building, Bakiev left the capital city and a temporary government took over. Some officials in that new government would be just fine with Bakiev leaving Kyrgyzstan. Others think the president should have to stay and be held accountable for what they say are criminal actions. Charges have been filed against some of his relatives and associates. But Bakiev says he doesn't recognize any decisions made by the interim government.

AZUZ: "Don't buy: Safety risk." It's a warning that Consumer Reports doesn't make too often. But it is making that warning about a sport utility vehicle made by Lexus. The Lexus GX460, you see right here, during a severe turn, it slides almost completely sideways. Consumer Reports says that's because a system that should stop the slide doesn't kick in in time, and that could cause a rollover. That's why the magazine issued the rare "Don't buy" warning. The last one of those was given out, in 2001. Toyota, which owns Lexus, said it'll conduct its own tests to see what steps need to be taken.

April 14, 1828 - Noah Webster publishes the first edition of his dictionary.

April 14, 1865 - President Abraham Lincoln is shot by John Wilkes Booth.

April 14, 1910 - President William Taft throws out the first pitch at a Washington Senators baseball game, starting the tradition of presidents throwing out first pitches.

MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! The word "olfactory" refers to what sense? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Touch, B) Smell, C) Taste or D) Sight? You've got three seconds -- GO! You might have sniffed out that olfactory refers to your sense of smell. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout!

AZUZ: It comes in handy with flowers or food. But experts say our sense of smell can also work like a warning system. Kind of an olfactory alarm. That's also why dogs are sometimes used to sniff out danger. Their sense of smell can be a thousand times more sensitive than ours. And as Jeanne Meserve explains, what their nose knows could help save lives.

CAPTAIN WILLIAM PARKER, AMTRAK POLICE K-9 PROGRAM: Michael Jordan, and the reason why I say that is because Michael Jordan is one of the best basketball players of all time, and these vapor wake dogs, I put in that same category.

JEANNE BROCK, MANAGER, AUBURN UNIVERSITY PUPPY PROGRAM: They'll hunt and hunt and hunt and won't come back without it.

MESERVE: They are introduced at an early age to slippery surfaces and a variety of environments before being sent to prisons in Georgia, Florida and Mississippi, where inmates begin training the dogs to use their noses. Back at the Auburn facility, older dogs are conditioned on a souped-up golf cart to handle the rigors of their future jobs. They recognize about a dozen explosives and could be trained to find additional ones in just a day or two. I take a backpack containing explosives into a building to test a dog. I walk, sit and walk some more.

So now, I'm going to hide this backpack full of smokeless powder right here.

DR. ROB GILLETTE, AUBURN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE: There are certain chefs who'll smell a pot of stew and say, "Oh, that's oregano, or that's this type of spice." The dog walks into it, smells this whole thing and says, "Oh, that's C-4."

MESERVE: The U.S. Capitol Police are just starting to use vapor wake dogs. They've already augmented security at sporting events and other large gatherings. But Amtrak has embraced them despite the $20,000 price tag per dog. The rail carrier believes that in a high-risk, ever-changing transit environment, the dogs have advantages over machines, even though they can only work for about 90 minutes at a stretch.
