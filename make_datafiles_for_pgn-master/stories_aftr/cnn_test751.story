Want to avoid a heart attack or stroke? In addition to well-known risk factors like diet and exercise, you may want to keep an eye on your vitamin D levels too.

Small amounts of vitamin D is available in food, such as fish, cod liver oil, and fortified milk and juice.

Low levels of the "sunshine vitamin" -- so nicknamed because we get most of our vitamin D from sunlight -- may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, according to a report published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

About 30 to 50 pecent of American children and adults don't get enough vitamin D, says coauthor James O'Keefe, M.D., cardiologist and director of preventative cardiology at the Mid America Heart Institute, in Kansas City, Missouri.

Small amounts of vitamin D can be consumed through food, such as fish, cod liver oil, and fortified milk and juice. But to achieve the daily 1,000 to 2,000 international units (IUs) that most people need, a dietary supplement is almost always necessary, according to the report. Oral doses of up to 2,000 IUs a day are considered safe and are available over the counter.  Watch more on vitamin D recommendations for children Â»

Susan Harris, D.Sc., an epidemiologist in the Bone Metabolism Laboratory at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts, agrees that there's little harm in assuming that vitamin D may help the heart. "It looks like vitamin D is important in very basic physiological functions like appropriate immune responses and inflammation, which play a role in cardiovascular disease and other chronic illnesses," she says.

O'Keefe and his colleagues at the University of Alabama, the Mayo Clinic, and the vitamin D laboratory at Boston University recommend that people with cardiovascular disease or related risk factors -- such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, or a family history -- have their vitamin D levels checked by a doctor.

Harris agrees with most of these recommendations, although she warns that sun exposure in the northern United States during the months of November through April tends to be an inadequate source of vitamin D.

The bottom line, says O'Keefe, is that adequate vitamin D levels are a necessity for overall health -- and they probably improve heart functioning as well.
