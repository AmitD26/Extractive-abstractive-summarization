(CNN) -- More than 5,000 people have been arrested and nearly $10 million seized in an operation targeting alleged illegal soccer gambling in Asia during the World Cup, Interpol reported Friday.

"The results we have seen are impressive, not only in the number of arrests and seizures made across the region in just one month, but in terms of the police cooperation which made this possible," said Jean-Michel Louboutin, Interpol's executive director of police services.

"As well as having clear connections to organized crime gangs, illegal soccer gambling is also linked with corruption, money laundering and prostitution, and Operation SOGA III will also have a significant long term impact on these serious offenses as well," Louboutin said.

"The experience and expertise developed in each of these types of operations provides an even stronger base from which police can work, not only in targeting the organized crime networks behind illegal soccer gambling, but in combating all types of criminal activity which require a regional or international response," Louboutin said.

Governments have released details of these latest busts in their respective countries over the month, such as Hong Kong in China.

Hong Kong police, which dubbed its local operation "Crowbeak," said on Friday it arrested 235 people, seized $361 million in betting slips, and arrested males and females ranging in age from 16 to 79 years.

"Officers of the Police Technology Crime Division are currently examining the computers and server seized during the operations to investigate the identities of bookmakers, agents and punters," police said. Punters are people placing bets.

Police engaged in an anti-illegal bookmaking efforts and created an anti-illegal bookmaking webpage.

"Illegal bookmakers had used mobile phones and the Internet as platforms for receiving bets. With wider use of the internet and the increasing number of internet users, police believe that more criminals will take advantage of this platform to commit crimes and police will adopt appropriate measures in combating such crimes."

Last month, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported that police in the northeastern city of Shenyang broke an illegal soccer gambling ring ahead of the World Cup.
