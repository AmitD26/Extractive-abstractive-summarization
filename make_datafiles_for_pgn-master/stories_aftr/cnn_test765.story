Baluchistan, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan is taking a page from America's counterinsurgency playbook in trying to win the hearts and the minds of those who might otherwise join Taliban militants or Balochistan nationalists against its military.

Balochistan province -- Pakistan's largest and one of its most troubled -- is home to a nationalist insurgency and an increasingly violent Taliban presence.

"The whole exercise is to integrate the Balochi youth," said Gen. Athar Abbas, a Pakistani army spokesman. "If you encourage people all over the province to join the army and the state system ... that is going to diffuse whatever insurgency is left in these parts."

"We are established since the inception of Pakistan and we have more expertise and variety here," said Brig. Jamil Sarwar Malik.

When earthquakes hit the province two years ago, the army rushed in to help, but then stayed and boosted their popularity with a rebuilding program in the absence of government reconstruction.

After nearly a quarter century, the army has reopened mines that were closed, while warring tribes fought because the central government was keeping the profits. The alienation led to calls for independence -- the Balochistan nationalist movement.

With the mines open, $75 million dollars worth of coal has been extracted so far, with $16 billion dollars worth still underground.

"It is being spent overwhelmingly -- over 80 to 90 percent -- on the area itself," for residents, for the children and for future generations, said Abbas.

Tribal leader Rab Nawaz Zing said he's been attacked 18 times for supporting the army. He blames other tribal chiefs.

While the counterinsurgency is making progress, the military acknowledges that it will take many more years of its best efforts to turn the tide and make the Taliban and nationalist ambitions a thing of the past.
