Oldies, But Goodies

As you're reminiscing about the good ol' days with family, it's only fitting that you watch some cinematic masterpieces from yesteryear. First up is a jumbo-sized James Bond movie marathon. Celebrate the franchise's 50th anniversary with a two-day Syfy blockbuster fest from 12 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. tomorrow. I'm sure the release of the latest and highest-grossing 007 installment, "Skyfall," has opened up the age-old debate about the best Bond flick.

If you're more gangster than suave, AMC's "Godfather" marathon is the way to go. With two consecutive airings of "The Godfather" and "The Godfather Part II" from 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. tomorrow, you're sure to get your mafia fix (the third film is officially not worth watching).

iReport: Who's at your Thanksgiving table?

Keeping with the theme of taking trips down memory lane, here are some old-school TV shows to balance out the classic movies. Your favorite gothic soap opera, "Dark Shadows," will run on Chiller from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m., while your favorite science fiction sitcom, "ALF," will air from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. tomorrow on The Hub.

You can also catch back-to-back episodes of "I Love Lucy" (noon to 4 p.m.) on TV Land followed by "The Andy Griffith Show "(4 to 9 p.m.).

Tough-Guy TV

For even more life-threatening adventures, check out "Alaska: The Last Frontier" (10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Discovery), "Finding Bigfoot" (9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Animal Planet), and "Wicked Tuna" (9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on National Geographic Channel). Spike will also air "Tattoo Nightmares" followed by "Ink Master" from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Crime Procedurals

So many hookers, so little time! USA will air 24 hours of "NCIS" (the "Gibbs That Keeps On Giving" marathon) beginning at 6 a.m., while Oxygen will offer a half day of "Law & Order: Criminal Intent" from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m. tomorrow.

If you like murder with a side of comedy, tune into "Castle" (10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on TNT) or "Psych" (running until 6 a.m. tomorrow on Cloo). You can also flip to A&E's "The First 48" (3 p.m. to 4 a.m. tomorrow) for the real scoop.

On top of your heavy heaping of tough-guy reality shows, add some voyeuristic series, with "Breaking Amish" (11 a.m. to 9 p.m. on TLC), "Secretly Pregnant" (2 to 10 p.m. on Discovery Fit & Health), and "Million Dollar Listing" (11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Bravo).

Or, if the thought of food doesn't make you want to hurl, try some food programming with "Best Sandwich" (9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Travel), "Cake Boss" (6 a.m. to 11 a.m. on TLC), and "Restaurant Impossible" (10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Food Network).
