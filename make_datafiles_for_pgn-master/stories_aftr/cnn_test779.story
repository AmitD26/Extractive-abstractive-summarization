(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal fired an ominous warning that he is ready to reclaim his French Open crown from Roger Federer after picking up a record-equaling sixth consecutive Monte Carlo Masters title on Sunday.

Nadal needed surgery on his knees after that setback, and his hiatus allowed Federer to take both his Wimbledon title and the No. 1 ranking.

The Mallorcan reached the semifinals in his past two tournaments on hardcourts surfaces in the United States, and blitzed his opponents in Monaco as three times he dropped only one game in a match.

"It is probably my favorite tournament. I love this tournament. To win here another time is a dream for me. The atmosphere here is unbelievable. I feel like I'm at home.

Nadal, by comparison, drew level with Federer on 16 Masters titles, behind only the 18 won by American Andre Agassi.

He has now won 54 successive matches on clay in the month of April, with six titles in Monte Carlo and five in Barcelona in that time.

Federer, who has not played since the Miami Masters last month, is set to make his return to the circuit at the Rome clay event starting on April 25.

Nadal will be top seed at the Barcelona Open starting next week, with the draw also including Sweden's Soderling, Verdasco, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France and Monte Carlo semifinalist David Ferrer.

The French Open, the second grand slam tournament of the tennis season, begins in Paris on May 24.

Meanwhile, Samantha Stosur of Australia won her second title on the women's WTA Tour circuit on Sunday.
