Washington (CNN) -- Apparently President Barack Obama doesn't need an iPad; he's got an aide for that: iReggie.

The Thai leader nodded and asked Obama if he had one.

Not everyone has an arsenal of human apps like the president's: a personal aide, several advisers, cabinet secretaries, a press shop and military leaders at his beck and call.

Obama may not have a personal iPad, but he's not too disconnected from Apple's latest technological craze. According to the pool reporter, Jonathan Weisman, the president told Abhisit that he recently bought an iPad for first lady Michelle Obama.

At a rally in Seattle last month, the president was approached by someone with an iPad that said, "Mr. President, sign my iPad." Obama penned his signature with the swipe of a finger instead of a pen.

The White House posted a photo of the president sitting at personal secretary Katie Johnson's desk. He was due to deliver remarks that day and made last-minute edits on her computer.

Maybe there's not an app for everything.
