(CNN) -- An Arlington, Texas, police officer was among three people killed in a shooting at an apartment complex Tuesday night, officials said.

On Monday, a Georgia state trooper was fatally shot after a traffic stop in northwest Atlanta.

In the Arlington incident, the officer had been dispatched to an apartment complex to check out a report of domestic assault, city spokeswoman Tiara Richard told reporters.

"It's a tragic  situation. Our hearts are broken tonight," Mayor Robert Cluck said in a statement.

In January, another Arlington police officer died in the line of duty, Richard said.

Officer Craig Story was killed when his motorcycle struck a school bus about a mile away from Tuesday's shooting scene, CNN affiliate WFAA reported.

"Any time you lose an officer who  is working in the line of duty -- or not in the line of duty -- it's hard on the  department," Richard told reporters.

"It's hard on the city as a whole. These are people who day in and  day out, they go out and do their job and they are doing it to protect the  citizens here.  It's a hard loss for anyone...especially during this time of  year."

The suspect escaped in the trooper's patrol car, which was found abandoned about half a mile away. Shortly afterward, he was taken into custody, the spokesman said.
