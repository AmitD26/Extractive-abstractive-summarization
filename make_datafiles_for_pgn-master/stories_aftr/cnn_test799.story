So, just how cold is it?

Temperatures in Boston dropped to 2 degrees below zero Monday morning, according to CNN meteorologists. To the south, in New York, it was even worse, with the morning temperature sitting at 6 below zero.

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has urged people in his state to take extra caution in the dangerously cold weather. In a statement released on Monday, the governor announced that he had put state agencies on high alert to respond to any public safety and public health issues that may emerge.

"We are also reaching out to cities and towns to make sure they are prepared, and have pledged support, where needed," the statement said.

Boston might be considered cozy by its neighbors to the west, according to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. In North Adams, Massachusetts, Monday morning's low was 20 below zero.

In New York state, the cold weather caused trouble for travelers. Schools in North Syracuse had to close after several dozen of the district's 136 buses failed to start, according to local media reports.

Amtrak had to shut down part of its service in New York as well.

A statement sent out on Monday said the sub-zero temperatures had caused some signals, switches and equipment to freeze, leading to the cancellation of some services in the region.
