James, center, traveled from the UK to Switzerland to commit suicide. He was 23.

Worcestershire Coroner's Service, which is conducing an inquest into the circumstances of his death, states on its Web site that James died on September 12 after he "traveled to Switzerland with a view to ending his own life. He was admitted to a clinic where he died." The inquest was adjourned on September 19 for reports. What do you think about assisted suicide?

Many in the UK have voiced support for Mark and Julie James, who flew to the Swiss clinic with their son.  Watch the debate on assisted suicide Â»

Mark Roebuck, uncle to Daniel, described the injury on a Web site for the Dan James Trust, which he set up to help his nephew's recovery.

"He dislocated his C6/C7 vertebrae, trapping his spinal cord and becoming a tetraplegic in a split second," Roebuck wrote. "This means that Dan (had) lost the complete use of his body from the chest down."

James, regained some use of his fingers, Roebuck wrote, but that was the extent of his recovery.

Roebuck wrote this month that his nephew had died in an assisted suicide. "His death was an extremely sad loss," his parents said in a statement, "but was no doubt a welcome relief from the prison he felt his body had become."

In a statement last week James' parents paid tribute to their son and said that he had attempted to kill himself several times already.

They added that their son, "an intelligent young man of sound mind," had never come to terms with his condition and was "not prepared to live what he felt was a second-class existence".

Matt Hampson, an English rugby player who was also paralyzed from the neck down with an almost identical spinal injury in 2005, now runs a rugby Web site that supports a charity for children with spinal injuries.

"You either get on with it or you die," added Hampson, who played for the England Under 21 team . "I kind of see my role as getting on with my life to show people that, just because I've had this catastrophic injury, that doesn't mean I can't do things. I don't think my life is worse. It's a lot better in some ways."

"I want to know what the law considers to be assisting a suicide," Purdy writes. "Is Omar open to prosecution if he helps me into a taxi to the airport, or books my flights?"
