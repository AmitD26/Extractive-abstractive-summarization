(CNN)  -- Two late goals from Robin van Persie and Andrey Arshavin gave Arsenal a 2-1 win over Spanish champions Barcelona in their last 16, first leg tie at the Emirates Wednesday night.

Barcelona led through a 26th minute goal from David Villa and might have added to their tally as Lionel Messi endured a frustrating night.

Arshavin capped a dream comeback for Arsene Wenger's men with a curling shot past Valdes five minutes later after the ball had been perfectly laid into his path by Samir Nasri.

Messi, who missed a gilt-edged opening early in the first half, was crowded out by desperate Arsenal defense as Barca pushed for an equalizer, but to no avail.

"We suffered for some spells in the game but never gave up," he added.

His Barcelona counterpart Pep Guardiola believes his men will emerge on top after the second leg on their home ground.

"I think we more or less controlled the game and we just need to create the chances we did tonight in the Nou Camp and then take them.

The Argentina ace looked certain to score but sent his chipped effort just wide.

Van Persie had seen his volleyed effort saved by Valdes and came within a whisker of heading home a Cesc Fabregas cross, only for Eric Abidal to make a timely interception.

But in the next attack, Barcelona were ahead as Messi played in Villa to score neatly.

A Messi header was disallowed for a marginal offside decision and he shot into the side netting after another typical burst into the penalty area, but Arsenal were also a threat going forward in an open game.

"Roma live under great pressure, I don't understand the fans' jeers, it's tough to play under these conditions," Shakhtar's Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu told AFP.
