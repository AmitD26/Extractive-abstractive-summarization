(CNN) -- Virender Sehwag smashed a career-best one-day innings of 175 as India opened the 2011 Cricket World Cup with a convincing 87-run victory over co-hosts Bangladesh in Dhaka on Saturday.

Bangladesh made a game effort in reply but could manage only 283-9, crucially losing five wickets while scoring just 47 runs in the final 10 overs of the match.

"It was a good start for the team, I have said this is a revenge game and we have won," the 32-year-old told reporters.

"I have said before Bangladesh are not good in Tests, but they can compete in ODIs -- but today they could not. Special thanks to my physio for helping me, I was carrying a couple of injuries and they got me ready for this game."

Gautam Gambhir, who usually opens for India in five-day Tests, made a run-a-ball 39 before falling at 152-2 in the 24th over, bringing Koli to the crease.

The 22-year-old reached three figures for the fourth time in one-day internationals, needing only 83 deliveries as he hit eight fours and two sixes.

And when captain Shakib Al Hasan was caught in the deep by Harbhajan Singh for 55 off 50 balls in the 40th over, it signaled the end of the home team's resistance.

Spinner Harbhajan picked up a wicket and a runout, while Patel finished with figures of 4-48 off his 10 overs to give India a winning start to their Group B campaign.
