Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The use of U.S. strike aircraft in Libya is set to expire Monday as uncertainty lingers about whether Western allies will arm opposition members trying to oust Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi.

Over the weekend, fierce destruction permeated the city of Misrata, which has been choked off by pro-Gadhafi forces surrounding the city.

"We need a lot of help in Misrata. There's so much death there," said Mustafa Abdul Hamali, a 46-year-old taxi driver who lost half of a leg. "I was driving in my car with my wife, and my car just blew up. I don't know what happened."

Khalid Moteridi, a 32-year-old businessman-turned-rebel fighter, said the situation in Libya's third-largest city has turned dire.

A doctor in Misrata told CNN government forces shelled a clinic, leaving one dead and 15 injured on Sunday. Last week, a hospital official said 398 people have been killed since the Libyan conflict began last month. He feared there were more deaths that his hospital didn't know about.

Some rebels from Misrata got a bit of a reprieve Sunday, when a Turkish hospital ship picked up more than 300 of the wounded fighters. Their injuries included amputated limbs, broken bones and shrapnel wounds.

Rebel fighters retreated east of al-Brega on Sunday, reporting an ambush, roadside mines and a need for more ammunition.

"We were fighting with light weapons, but they had so much more," Moteridi said. "Artillery, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank rockets -- that's how they were fighting back."

U.S. and British officials have said they have not decided whether to arm rebel fighters. Both countries participated in airstrikes to weaken Gadhafi's military resources before NATO officially took command of the international operation.

Over the weekend, opposition spokesmen said 13 rebels were killed when NATO airstrikes hit several vehicles.

"Based on the information we have, they (the opposition forces who were hit) heard the airstrikes and went ahead to see what the damage was, and that's when they got hit," rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said. "They were told to stay back, but they jumped the gun."

"NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously, but exact details are hard to verify as we have no reliable sources on the ground," she said.

Libya asked Greece to allow a special envoy to travel there to communicate a message from Gadhafi, Greek foreign ministry spokesman Grigoris Delavekouras said. The nature of that message was not immediately known.

Despite the unyielding conflict, Moteridi, the rebel fighter who was shot twice in the legs by a sniper, said he won't give up.

"I'll go back to Misrata when I get better, God willing, and ... Gadhafi and his gangs will be defeated."
