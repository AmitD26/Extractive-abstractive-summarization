It is no surprise then that Bolt leads the nominations for the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) male athelete of the year award.

Bolt is joined on the list by two other male stars that enjoyed a successful summer in the English capital.

Olympic hero Bolt to play for Manchester United?

The second athlete chosen is American Aries Merritt, who took the men's 110m hurdles crown in London, before breaking the world record at a meet in Belgium shortly after.

Merritt took seven hundredths of a second off the previous mark, held by Dayron Robles, which had stood for four years.

The 27-year-old also took gold over the 60m distance at the World Indoor Championships held in the Turkish city of Istanbul in March.

His performances drew praise for the chairman of the London Organizing Committee, Sebastian Coe, who called Rushida "the most impressive track and field athlete at these Games."

The 26-year-old held off the challenge of compatriot Yohan Blake to secure his 100m and 200m double, labeling himself the "greatest athlete" to have lived after his triumph.

Bolt's holds the world record in both disciplines and holds six Olympic gold medals, after also winning the men's 4x100m relay in 2008.
