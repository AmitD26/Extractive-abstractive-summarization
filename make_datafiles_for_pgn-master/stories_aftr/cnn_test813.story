Radzyminski, now 19 and on an Army ROTC scholarship at Tennessee Tech University, spoke with CNN's Danielle Berger about reaching this goal.

Berger: Where will these discs be headed?

I know for a fact that we have boxes going to the Horn of Africa, which many people don't know (that) we do have troops there. They'll be going to Iraq and Afghanistan. Some of the boxes are going to military hospitals in Germany.

These CDs are going to all four military branches. They're going to everybody, because they all serve our country and are all greatly appreciated.

Berger: Why was it important to you to continue this work when you went on to college?

Radzyminski: With all the hard work that I had put in, I wanted to make sure it would continue after graduation from high school. The troops have always had a special place in my heart. I'd do anything for them ... because they sacrifice so much. Even when I graduate (college), there will still be troops serving overseas. When I graduate, I'll be one of them.

Berger: Tunes 4 the Troops is now based at Tennessee Tech. How does it work?

Radzyminski: Tunes 4 the Troops is part of the Service Learning Center here at the university, so there's basically a staff and student workers who volunteer for community service hours that are able to work on Tunes 4 the Troops. So this way, Tunes 4 the Troops will be able to continue even once I graduate.

Radzyminski: After the CNN article on the 12 ways of giving, we got an increase in donations that helped us reach our 1 million goal. That was definitely one of the big things that helped us knock six months off our goal of collecting 1 million CDs and DVDs. (And) we got some local artists and major record labels to donate as well. It got the word out there that we are still doing this.
