The same day, the Kuwait Investment Authority also participated in a $6.6 billion boost for U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch.

They're the latest in a long line of substantial investments emanating from the Middle East; most made by Sovereign Wealth Funds spending the proceeds of the oil boom.

What are they? Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) are not a new phenomenon -- the first was founded in 1953 -- but recently, they've become much more active. In the past six months, in the financial sector alone, they've taken stakes in Morgan Stanley, UBS and Bear Stearns, as well as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.

How much are they worth? Figures vary as many of the larger funds don't divulge valuations. Morgan Stanley says, combined, they could be worth as much as $2.5 trillion. Standard Chartered says the total assets managed in SWFs correspond to around 12 percent of the market capitalization of the NYSE, or about 42 percent of total stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Who owns them? Sovereign Wealth Funds aren't solely the preserve of Middle Eastern royalty. Norway's Government Pension Fund is one of the biggest SWFs in the world, worth an estimated $322 billion. Singapore, China and Russia also have sizeable funds. In fact, they're all featured Standard Chartered's "Super Seven"; funds with more than $100 billion in assets.

Sounds great, what's the catch? Many commentators view the rise of SWFs as a positive force in the world market. For example, while the prospect of a recession in the U.S. has sent other investors running for cover, they've been willing and able to pump vast sums of money into the U.S. banking sector. However, there's some trepidation about their lack of transparency; many don't provide details of their size, investment returns or asset allocation.
