The 17-year-old McCreery is juggling his senior year of high school this fall along with promoting his album. So just how exactly does that work? CNN spoke with McCreery from his home in Garner, North Carolina, about just that as well as young love, and what drink he will walk miles to enjoy.

Scotty McCreery: They didn't want me to have the first block because they didn't want me to be a distraction to kids getting to school. So I go in the second block and am there for the rest of the day. Next semester's going to be the tough one. I have AP English and all that jazz.

CNN: Tell me about recording "Clear as Day."

CNN: Looking back, does the record evoke certain themes?

It's got a cool thing about love. Not necessarily the boy-girl love or anything; it talks about everyday love, it talks about family love with kids and parents, love with loss, love for my hometown on "Water Tower Town." It's not necessarily one theme of love, but it's got a lot of influences. It's a cool way that I like to think of it.

CNN: It's very much rooted in what someone you're age would be going through: Summer love, figuring out girls, football games.

McCreery: For me, an emotion is an emotion, whether you're 70 or 17. At 70, you might have much more experience with it and know a little bit more about it, but if a 17 year old says they have a broken heart, in my eyes, they have one.

CNN: Some country records are riddled with clichÃ©s; how do you avoid those?

McCreery: The whole clichÃ© thing people think about country music, you know, "drinking with the boys" it isn't country music at all. Country music is real and talks about real-life situations and I think with this record we did that.

There's a song called "Back on the Ground" and it can talk about a college student or someone like me, where you want to get of town and go live life but then when you're at it for awhile, you can't wait to get back. I've been at home for maybe 10 days since February and any time I can get a chance to get home, it's a blessing.

CNN: Does going into this genre after "American Idol" give you a leg up versus other people coming out of that show that make a pop or an R&B record?

CNN: Obviously, your voice is the bread and butter. How do you take care of it these days?

McCreery: On the road it was tough, singing every night and talking a lot. We had this thing called Throat Coat that we'd drink a lot. Anytime I don't have to be yellin' or talking, I'm trying to ease off on it. I'm using it a lot and I don't want to hurt it. It's my instrument.

CNN: You mentioned the song "Water Tower Town" -- it might be one of the only songs that gives a shout out to sweet tea.

McCreery: I think that was the only one. I was the guy on 'Idol' that walked six miles to [get some tea]. There was a time that I was going to go to McDonald's because that was the only place in California you could find sweet tea. I took a right instead of a left, and I ended up walking six miles to get some sweet tea. I kept thinking as I was walking "Man this is a long mile."
