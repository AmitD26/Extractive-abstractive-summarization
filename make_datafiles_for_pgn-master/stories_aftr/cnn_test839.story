(CNN) -- Getting the details out of his head and on to paper was Executive Producer Ronald D. Moore's most important priority of the day.

It was the first Tuesday in March, and he had been up late the night before typing out the details of life in the "17th Precinct," an innovative new world in which police detectives relied on magic, not forensics, to catch criminals.

Writing the "show bible" was Moore's way of conveying his vision to his cast and crew. Until a couple of months ago, these ideas existed only in his head. This one document would spell out every detail of life, from the way detectives picked apart a crime scene to the way they could make evidence float off the ground for closer forensic examination.

The concept had already taken shape at Sony, where executives had teamed with Moore's Tall Ship Productions for content. It was then successfully pitched to NBC, where executives agreed to fund the pilot.

After that, Moore's professional life became a frenzied ballet of scripting, casting, coordinating artwork and setting production schedules. He was now just a week away from a table read with the cast, and he already had a crew scouting shoot locations in and around Vancouver.

For him, a whole new world was unfolding. "I wrote letters to NASA in first and second grade, and then I found 'Lost in Space,' " Moore recalls. "In third grade, I discovered 'Star Trek,' and that was the defining show of my life. Channel 26, four o'clock every afternoon."

As Moore got older, he explored the jock route, playing football and running track in high school. He eventually became a self-described "baseball fanatic," but that sense of discovery and exploration stayed with him and led to a writing job on "Star Trek: The Next Generation."

Running the show

Eventually, it would be his executive producer role in the reimagined "Battlestar Galactica" series that would draw the most critical acclaim. It was also the first time Moore had been a co-creator on a show from beginning to end. He and Executive Producer David Eick just seemed to click.

"Ron is the scariest writer I know" his former producing partner recalls.

"I'm not sure there's anything he can't do remarkably well. Even within the context of 'Battlestar,' there was such a wild panoply of styles and emotions -- action, tragedy, melodrama, comedy, philosophy, even music -- all of which I watched him nail."

"But he's also weirdly unpretentious," Eick said. "We'd argue about whether something worked, but never whether or not it was 'good,' because if you tell Ron something's not good, he doesn't take it personally. He just says OK and then does something great."

Moore's sense of flexibility and vision were solidifying his reputation among his cast and crew.

Writer and Executive Producer Jane Espenson first met Moore while pitching show ideas for "Star Trek: The Next Generation" as a grad student at UC Berkeley. She later joined "Battlestar's" writing team.

"There could be a million distractions around him -- he could be on a bad phone connection, in an airport, running for a plane, and he'd immediately grasp a complex story as five of us shouted it into a speaker phone, and he'd have the fix," she said.

Moore was acquiring a dedicated following with the show's success. He understood how much the geek culture's acceptance by the mainstream had helped his own success as genre material had made the transformation from niche to widespread commercial viability.

"That's good and bad," Moore said.

With "Battlestar," Moore had success in spades. He had led a team that was honored with a Peabody Award, and Moore himself was nominated for an Emmy for best writing in a dramatic series, followed by an Emmy win for the "Battlestar Galactica" webisodes.

But even as he accepted critical praise for "Battlestar," there was a line from another scene running through his head. It came from the movie "Patton," in which the famous general described victorious Romans returning from battle in triumphant chariots: "A slave stood behind the conqueror holding a golden crown and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory is fleeting."

By the end of March, Moore was wrapping up shooting for "17th Precinct."

He was guardedly optimistic. He had seen strong performances from the actors, had seen some beautiful effects come to life, and had even been a little surprised by how some of the characters had popped onscreen. He had been in the business long enough to know that what he had in his head would seldom compare to what was actually shot.

As he returned to L.A. for final post-production work, a deadline loomed in his head. He had to have the show turned over to the executives at NBC by May 2. He'd make it, but he knew that the weeks of waiting that would follow would be nerve-racking.

But bad news came early.

"There are creative lessons I'm trying to draw from, and there were some conceptual mistakes I probably made. But at the same time, you kind of balance that with the knowledge that each one of these projects is unique and they are all special."
