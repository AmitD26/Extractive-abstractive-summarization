Redknapp had minor heart surgery three weeks ago, but returned earlier than expected to see his side edge above London rivals Chelsea and Newcastle on goal difference.

The victory extended Spurs' unbeaten league run to nine matches following two early defeats to the Manchester sides -- the club's best showing in the opening 11 games since the 1967-68 season.

"I enjoyed the way we played tonight, I think the fans enjoyed it as well -- they've seen lots of great teams over the years and they're enjoying the way this team's playing," Redknapp said.

Adebayor's brace at White Hart Lane represented his first goals for Spurs since a double against Liverpool in his second league appearance for the club on September 18.

But manager Alex McLeish's ploy failed to pay off as Welsh winger Bale caused constant problems, and it was from his scuffed shot after Villa failed to clear a corner that Adebayor acrobatically hooked home the 13th-minute opener.

Villa stayed eighth on 15 points after 12 games, but have yet to win away in the league this season after four draws and two defeats.

Meanwhile, Chelsea manager Andre Villas Boas earlier insisted that his job is safe despite Sunday's 2-1 defeat by Liverpool, the club's third in four league games.

"He didn't pay 15 million euros ($20 million) to get me out of Porto and another fortune to get me out of Chelsea," he said.

"It is not a question of the owner having patience. I have said we have set out to build something new at this club and the club is committed to what we are building for the future."

Malaga moved up to fifth in Spain with a 3-1 victory away to struggling Racing Santander on Monday.

Visiting Malaga broke the deadlock three minutes after halftime through teenage midfielder Isco, and a 66th-minute own-goal by Alvaro Gonzalez doubled the lead.

Manuel Arana gave Santander hope four minutes later, but veteran Dutch substitute Ruud van Nistelrooy set up Uruguayan forward Seba Fernandez for a late volley.
