(CNN) -- Harry Redknapp is hoping to perform another Premier League rescue act after being confirmed as the new manager of bottom club Queens Park Rangers on Saturday.

The 65-year-old, who kept both Portsmouth and Tottenham in the English top flight, has replaced Mark Hughes.

The Welshman was fired on Friday after 11 months in charge, having failed to win a league match this season.

Winless QPR sack Hughes

Redknapp has been out of work since being sacked by Tottenham five months ago, having taken the London club to fourth in the Premier League but missing out on another Champions League campaign after Chelsea's Munich triumph in May.

"I'm delighted to be back in the managerial hot-seat at QPR," said Redknapp, who won the English FA Cup with Portsmouth in 2008 after returning the club following a controversial move to neighboring Southampton, who were relegated in 2005.

Redknapp was named Premier League manager of the year for 2009-10 after taking Spurs to Champions League qualification for the first time, and he guided the team to the quarterfinals in Europe the following season.

"Harry was our number one target, the unanimous choice of the board and we're delighted we've been able to attract him to the club," QPR chairman Tony Fernandes said.

"His man-management skills are second to none and we are confident he is the right man to lead us away from the bottom of the table."

"It was a job which excited me. We met the people and they were fantastic," he said.

"It was exciting and something I'd never done in my life and something I was really up for.

"But when Mark left the job it changed everything. Yesterday, I was almost on my way to Ukraine. But when I got the phone call it changed everything around."
