Starting Thursday, the site began testing a system that lets people with a large number of subscribers submit a government ID to prove they really are who they say they are.

Unlike Twitter, Facebook has required users to register under their real names.

Twitter, which lets folks create an account using any handle they want, has long had "verified" accounts for public figures to distinguish the real people and their tweets from the impersonators. While at one point users could request one, the site now makes its own decisions about who gets the coveted check-mark.

In the early going, Google+ had taken flak from early adopters, some of whom were booted for signing up with names that were not real. Many of those people argued they were more widely known by nicknames on the Web.

Celebrities, sports stars, journalists and the like who have been verified by Facebook will now get more prominent display on the site's "People To Subscribe To" list.

Facebook has been allowing subscriptions for about five months. They let users share information with anyone who chooses to subscribe to their feeds without having to actually become Facebook friends with them.
