Check out a video trailer for "The Last Werewolf."

If you didn't make it to the beach in person this year, Don Winslow's "The Gentlemen's Hour" may be the next best thing. Winslow is an award winning veteran of the summertime crime novel. He captivated readers and critics with his best-seller, "Savages" last year, which is being turned into a big-budget movie by Oscar-winning director, Oliver Stone. Now Winslow's out with a sequel to 2009's "The Dawn Patrol," featuring the return of Boone Daniels, a former cop turned private investigator, who would rather surf than work.

For anyone who loves a good puzzle, John's Verdon's "Shut Your Eyes Tight" is the easy answer. Verdon is a retired advertising executive who waited until his late sixties to try his hand at writing. The result was his 2010 bestselling debut, "Think of a Number." Now in Verdon's sophomore novel, superstar detective Dave Gurney is once again making a go at retirement with his wife, Madeleine.

However, when a young bride is gruesomely murdered at her own wedding reception, the puzzle proves too tempting for Gurney to resist. Well-known mystery writers like David Baldacci, Nelson DeMille and Tess Gerritsen are rallying behind Verdon for his clever plots and nuanced characters. A slew of reviewers, including the New York Times have heaped praise on Verdon, even comparing his whodunits to the classic Sherlock Holmes tales.

Speaking of Baldacci and Gerritsen, they're among the "murderer's row" of writers who penned "No Rest for the Dead." As the book jacket says, there are twenty-six writers and one mystery. Andrew Gulli, editor of the Strand, a mystery magazine organized this effort, bringing together more than two-dozen bestselling writers, each contributed a chapter to this hard-boiled collaboration. Combined these authors have sold hundreds of millions of books, and their expertise is not wasted here.
