While other kids his age spent their Saturday shopping at the mall or tossing around a football, Tolbert traveled from Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, to Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington dressed in a navy blue Civil War reenactment uniform and armed with a brass bugle.

It is perhaps the most famous of military signals, and on Saturday it turned 150 years old.

Taps, traditionally played at military funerals and also known as "Butterfield's Lullaby" or "Day is Done," were born during the Civil War along the James River.

To commemorate the 150th anniversary, Buglers Across America, a nonprofit organization that seeks to play live renditions for veteran funerals rather than subject the mourners to a CD version, enlisted nearly 200 volunteer buglers and trumpeters.

The musicians joined together and played a united taps performance before they set off in search of a single soldier's tombstone in the 624-acre burial ground. Some chose a spot simply for its convenient location. Others, like Tolbert, chose them for their significance.

"I don't think I want to be in the military one day, so the best I can do to serve our country is to honor those who are," Tolbert said.

For those who did serve in the military, playing taps in Arlington National Cemetery is one of the greatest honors for a bugler.

"Whether it would be after a career, 20, 30 years, or even those who have died on active duty, it's our way of officially saying to the military, 'Thank you. Safely rest. God is nigh,'" he explained, quoting the final lyrics associated with the melody.

Allison Cummings, a patrol officer from Hudson, New Hampshire, usually plays taps at law enforcement funerals and ceremonies in her home state, but said playing in Arlington was a unique experience.

"I started playing the trumpet when I was in fifth grade so I've been playing for quite a while... Even from that age, I remember visiting here when I just started playing," said Cummings, dressed in a black uniform trimmed in gold with her trumpet hanging by her side.
