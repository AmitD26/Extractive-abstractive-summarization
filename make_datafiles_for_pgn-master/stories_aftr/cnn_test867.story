(CNN) -- Snigdha Nandipati, 14, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday night by spelling "guetapens," which means an ambush, snare or trap.

She said that properly spelling the winning word, which is derived from French, was not difficult. She had seen the word before and knew it, she said.

"I didn't expect to win. There were some very good competitors this year," she said.

In last year's spelling bee, she tied for 27th place.

Nandipati's victory in the 13th round came moments after her final challenger, Stuti Mishra of Orlando, also 14, stumbled over the spelling of "schwarmerei," which means excessive, unbridled enthusiasm or attachment.

According to a tweet from @ScrippsBee, Nandipati studied six hours per day. She was cheered on by her brother, her parents (her father coached her) and her grandparents, who had traveled from India to watch.

This year's spelling bee saw the youngest contestant, 6-year-old Lori Anne Madison of Lake Ridge, Virginia. She spelled "dirigible" with aplomb, but was eliminated Wednesday night when she misspelled "ingluvies," which is a pouch used by birds as a receptacle for food.

Nicholas Rushlow, a 14-year-old eighth-grader from Lancaster, Ohio, was eliminated when he misspelled "vetiver," an aeromatic grass whose especially fragrant root yields an oil used in perfumery and mats in India. Asked what was going through his mind when he heard the word, he said, "Oh, crap."

Asked what he was going to do with all the time he had previously devoted to spelling, he said, "I'm going to have to find a new hobby."
