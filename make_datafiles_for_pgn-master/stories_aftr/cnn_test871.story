(CNN) -- The Torkham border crossing in Pakistan was opened for NATO supply convoy traffic Sunday morning, authorities told CNN.

Pakistan closed the main land route for NATO supplies crossing from Pakistan to Afghanistan after U.S. helicopter strikes across the border killed two Pakistani soldiers.

While the main route has been closed, at least seven attacks on convoys carrying supplies for NATO forces in Afghanistan have taken place in Pakistan. The convoys are generally operated by contracted Pakistani firms, using Pakistani trucks and drivers.

Since October 1, at least six people have been killed in attacks on supply vehicles.

The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the most recent attack, which took place Saturday in Pakistan's western Baluchistan province.

Assailants attacked 28 oil tankers with a machine gun and rockets, said Meeran Bukhsh, a police official in the Bolan district, said. Police said the tankers caught fire, and two people were injured.

"We are very proud of the performance of this squad as they have been able to successfully target NATO convoys all over Pakistan," Khan said.
