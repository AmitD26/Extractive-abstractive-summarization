Atlanta (CNN) -- "It's so empowering to see yourself as a machine."

Jennie Finch speaks gently from an overstuffed chair in the CNN newsroom. The camera is finally off, and although her heart-shaped face was made for TV, it's easy to see she's more comfortable now that she's not reciting lines in front of the blinking red light.

Finch became the face of fast-pitch softball as the sport's popularity grew in America and abroad. Her competitive nature aided her on the field; her polite optimism helped her off of it.

But that doesn't mean Finch has slowed down any. In November, four months after giving birth to son Diesel, she ran the New York City Marathon. Starting dead last, Finch passed 30,397 people on her way to the finish line, earning more than $30,000 for charity.

"There's nothing better than working up a good sweat," Finch says. "I make time to keep active. I know how important it is to keep moving."

It's no secret that girls can be mean, especially in high school. Did you have to deal with that at all?

Yeah, you know you're always going to have tough people to deal with. I think it's a matter of taking the high road.`

You have to look yourself in the mirror at night. If you know that you've given your best and your heart is in the right place, that's all you can do. The truth will reveal itself. I've seen it over and over. Success finds those that truly work hard and that truly do have the right heart and the right mind.

How did your dad walk that fine line between being supportive and being your coach?

He was crazy, definitely. But you know, without that crazy father of mine, I would not be where I am today.

My mom knew whether it was a good or bad workout because I was either in tears or happy after. But it was like he knew how far to push me and I don't think he ever went to the point where I resented the game for it.

As teenagers, we're instinctively lazy. You want to just hang with your friends, go to the mall. How did you get past that?

Something my dad always said: "God gave you this gift, and it's your responsibility to carry it out."

And I think my competitive nature. Growing up with two older brothers, losing at everything, I have this competitive fire [and] drive within me that helped carry me through a lot.

When I look at teens today ... we're used to instant gratification with technology. Success doesn't come in an instant. It's the process; it's the journey. It's the hard work that it takes to get there. So I think that (you have to) try to enjoy the process and know that it's a lot of blood, sweat and tears to get you there.

You often hear that people don't watch women's professional sports. Why do you think that is?

I think, you know, you have to appreciate the women's games for the women's games. Can we compare it to the men's? On some levels yes, on some levels no.

And I think too, marketing is a lot, a huge part of it. Unfortunately there's not much PR or marketing in women's athletics. We've gotten a lot better but we still have more to accomplish and to keep breaking down those barriers.

It's been great to see the college game picked up and the ratings be so successful. Because people are watching and there is an audience out there and that do enjoy it and the ratings prove that.

You ran a marathon four months after having your second son. How did you do it?

Mental toughness. So much of it is between your own ears and fighting that doubt. We will always have that doubt, but that's what keeps us on edge and keeps us working harder.

Tell us a bit about you stay healthy at home.

I'm all about balance. Nothing extreme. I live in Louisiana so we eat; we're surrounded by way too much good food. So I kind of work out to eat. But like I said it's all about balance. It's not like I never have dessert, I just try to eat it in moderation and make my workouts so I can eat what I want and enjoy it.

Do you have any advice for someone who's sitting at home right now, going, "Yeah, OK, Jennie, but you're a natural athlete. How do I run a marathon?"

I saw something recently that was like, as long as you're moving, you're better off than being on the couch. No matter what pace you're at.

You're not going to get off the couch and be at some amazing fast pace or burn crazy amounts of calories but you have to start somewhere. ... Eventually you'll get there. We all have excuses but leave those excuses at the door.
