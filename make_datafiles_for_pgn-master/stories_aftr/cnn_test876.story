"I don't want to repeat mistakes I made before," she told AFP.

"I would sometimes play when I was not a hundred percent, when I was only fifty percent sometimes.

"It did no good for myself or the tournament. Health is the most important thing. After tennis there is hopefully a long life, and I can't jeopardize that."

Azarenka went to the top of the rankings with her stunning straight sets win over Maria Sharapova in the final of the first grand slam of the year and consolidated her position by winning the Qatar Open, despite the ankle problem.

"Just taking it day by day and doing absolutely everything possible to be ready today. I tried to hit yesterday, and I mean, it's just it was really clear that it's not really possible," she added.

Azarenka is likely to return home to Minsk to rest ahead of the March hard court season in the United States.

U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur of Australia also progressed, beating Lucie Safarova 6-1 6-7 6-1.

Safarova upset Wozniacki in Doha last week, but had no answer to Stosur in the deciding set.

Fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland ended the run of Israeli Shahar Peer 7-5 6-4, the match played on a secure outside court.
