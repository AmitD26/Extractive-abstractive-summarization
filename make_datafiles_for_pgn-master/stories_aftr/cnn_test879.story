Hong Kong (CNN) -- Months after announcing the reintroduction of the low-cost Datsun brand -- to be assembled in Indonesia -- Nissan Motor Company on Tuesday moved its global headquarters for its luxury Infiniti line to Hong Kong to be closer to the red-hot Chinese luxury market.

The common denominator between both moves: Building production and customer base outside the Japanese market, as export-driven companies have been hammered by the high value of the yen.

The yen hit record high of 75.93 yen to the U.S. dollar in October and remains stubbornly strong, hovering around the 79.45 yen to the dollar this week.

"I'm still not happy because of the strength of the yen. The strength of the yen is a penalty for Japan," Ghosn said. "I don't think it's so much a penalty for companies, because large companies have the possibility to off-shore production."

Despite the ongoing travails in Europe, Ghosn predicts 2012 will be a record year for the automotive industry. "Last year the industry produced and sold about 76 million cars -- we are on a trend this year to sell 79 million," he said.

"I think in 2012 we're going to have a recession in Europe, that's obvious," he added.

"The U.S. is in recovery more (and will sell) 1 million additional cars compared to last year," Ghosn said. "China, even though the growth has slowed down, there is still growth -- 5% to 6% growth of 17 million or 18 million cars sold there is still an additional million cars worth of growth.

"Brazil is growing well, India is growing well, Russia is growing well, the Middle East is coming back," he added.

The Datsun brand first emerged in Japan in 1923 but was phased out in the 1980s as the company focused on mid-market buyers and its upscale Infiniti brand, launched in 1989.
