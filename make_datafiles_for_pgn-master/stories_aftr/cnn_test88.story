(CNN) -- Sunday's showpiece European Championship final in the Ukrainian capital Kiev pits Spain against Italy, between them the winners of the last two World Cups.

Before the Euros, former Barcelona and England striker Gary Lineker said "La Furia Roja," or the Red Fury as the Spanish national team is called, was just one trophy away from greatness.

Spain reach Euro 2012 final after shootout victory

Fabregas' penalty can perhaps be seen as a symbol of Spain's unconvincing performances at Euro 2012 so far, which have left a large proportion of the watching public unsatisfied as the team struggled to break down packed opposition defenses.

The end of a love affair?

For all their possession (Spain have enjoyed around 67% of the ball in their five matches), there has been frustration that the team has neither moved the ball around quickly enough nor created enough goalscoring chances. Instead, it has worn down the other team by making their players chase shadows before waiting for a mistake.

Whisper it quietly, but some have even labeled Spain's previously much-feted tiki-taka style of play "boring" and claimed it is currently a more defensive tactic than offensive. That argument is perhaps backed up by the fact that Spain has now not conceded a knockout-stage goal in any tournament since the 2006 World Cup, a run of nine matches and a remarkable 900 minutes of action.

Against Italy in the group stage and France in the last eight, Del Bosque even picked a starting 11 without a single striker -- a tactic designed to help Spain keep the ball better and lure the opposing defense out so they could get in behind. It hasn't worked flawlessly, but the team has churned out results regardless.

Beautiful football might be what people demand, but results are what Del Bosque deals in first. Since taking over from previous coach Luis Aragones following Euro 2008, the 61-year-old has led the national team to an incredible 50 wins from 59 matches.

Midfielder Andres Iniesta, who scored the winner in the 2010 World Cup final, says Spain isn't bothered by the "boring" tag. The 27-year-old instead focuses on the positives of the team's possession-based game.

A change in mentality

It is a story that began at Euro 2008 -- and really, truly began with Spain's quarterfinal penalty shootout victory over Italy in Vienna, a match that defender Gerard Pique looks back on as the turning point.

But the 33-year-old midfielder is enjoying a stunning renaissance in his career. A year ago, he was discarded by AC Milan after 10 years of service. He signed for Juventus and led "The Old Lady" to the Italian league title before showcasing the full range of his majestic talents for the world to see in Poland and Ukraine.

The master and the maverick

Scare stories

Some of the magnificent stadia have not been full for every game, but that is probably due to the fact that Europe is going through difficult economic times right now and Poland and Ukraine are further away than most host nations have been -- resulting in increased traveling costs.

Sensational scoring

With 30 of the 31 matches played, we have seen only three red cards -- two of which came in the opening game as Poland drew with Greece. And there have been 21 goals scored from headers, which at 29% of the total 72, stands higher than at any previous Euros.

Wonderful goals have crashed in with regularity, from the acrobatics of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Balotelli to the gorgeous flick of Danny Welbeck, the emphatic volleys of Sami Khedira and Marco Reus, to the unstoppable rocket shots of Jakub Blaszczykowski and, again, Balotelli.

With England leading Italy 2-1 after the first two penalties in Sunday's quarterfinal shootout, Pirlo produced a moment of genius to change the momentum entirely in Italy's favor. He watched the England keeper buzz around on the line trying to put him off, before coolly chipping the ball -- a la Antonin Panenka in the 1976 European Championship final shootout -- delicately into the net after Joe Hart had dived early and erroneously to his right.

England missed its next two penalties and Italy triumphed.

"Hart seemed to be very confident in himself. I needed to do something to beat him and it seemed to be a psychological blow," said the unflappable Pirlo.

England boss Roy Hodgson added: "The cool, calculated way Pirlo chipped it, that is something you either have or you don't have as a player."

The football world swooned, and Pirlo produced his second successive man-of-the-match display to help Italy slay Germany in the semis and continue the Azzurri's amazing record of never having lost a competitive game to "Die Mannschaft."

On Sunday, Cesare Prandelli's team can keep another record intact: that of a country never winning three major international tournaments in a row. Spain are potentially 90 minutes away from sporting immortality.

A captivating conclusion to Euro 2012 lies in wait.
