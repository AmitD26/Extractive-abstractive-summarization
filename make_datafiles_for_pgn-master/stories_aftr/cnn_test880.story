(CNN) -- How do you solve a problem like Mario Balotelli? After an eventful fortnight that saw the Manchester City striker gatecrash a press conference, row with teammates and crash his Bentley, it's perhaps no wonder that his club manager Robert Mancini has been driven to despair.

"I can understand it. I told him (Mario), if you played with me 10 years ago I would give you every day maybe one punch in your head," Mancini said ahead of Sunday's trip to Arsenal -- a match that could have a big bearing on the English title race.

"I think in every big game he played very well. I think his problem is his concentration, but I work with him every day.

"I speak with him -- not every day because if not I need a psychologist -- but every two days I speak with him."

"Yaya Toure -- that is totally false," Mancini said. "What happened with Kolarov on the pitch, that is a situation that can happen in difficult moments.

"It is not good but I can understand this situation can happen. After the game it was finished. I am not worried -- it is important that after the game everything was okay."

Then there was Thursday's car crash in Manchester city center. Balotelli, driving his Bentley at the time, escaped unhurt, while a passenger from one of the other vehicles involved was taken to hospital as a precaution, according to police.

"Because when you have a player like Mario you should always not talk bad things against him because he is your teammate. If you say something about him, it's better to talk face-to-face, to say what you think," he said.

"Mario is young. He can do some mistakes. He has paid for his mistake. I can understand (why players are annoyed.) I understand this. But there are different ways to help guys like Mario."
