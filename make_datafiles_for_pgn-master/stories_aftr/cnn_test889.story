The crash prompted the Briton  to apologize to Kobayashi and his McLaren team via the social-networking site Twitter.

"Apologies to Kamui and to my team. The team deserves better from me. Best wishes, Lewis."

Vettel, who claimed the world title in 2010, took the checkered flag in Belgium ahead of teammate Mark Webber, with Hamilton's McLaren colleague Jenson Button recovering from 13th on the grid to take third position.

Button, a world champion in 2009, was pleased with his performance and the condition of his car.

"Our car is the best it's been all year, and I feel better than I ever have in Formula 1," the 31-year-old told McLaren's official web site. "We just need to stop the little mistakes from happening so that we can win even more races."

Meanwhile, Polish driver Robert Kubica underwent surgery on Sunday for the final time on arm injuries sustained during a pre-season rally crash.

Renault driver Kubica crashed out of the Ronde de Andorra rally in Italy in February, and was subsequently replaced by German driver Nick Heidfeld for the beginning of the 2011 season.

"Robert underwent one last scheduled operation in Italy, aimed at recovering the full mobility of his right elbow," read the statement.

"On waking up, it was immediately clear Robert was in good spirits. Why? Well, as soon as he opened his eyes, he asked for the results of today's race! He will now rest in hospital for a few days before resuming his rehabilitation and training program."
