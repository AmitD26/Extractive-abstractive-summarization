The purpose of the noise, according to the employee, was to stop Dortmund's traveling supporters from chanting insults at Hoffenheim's owner Dietmar Hopp.

"An employee of Hoffenheim admitted to using a corresponding [sound] device, on Saturday during the match against Borussia Dortmund," read a statement on Hoffenheim's official web site.

"The employee has also admitted that he was not aware of the impact his actions would have and intended them to be of a light-hearted nature.

"Hoffenheim has reacted with corresponding disciplinary action against the employee."

An investigation launched by Hoffenheim also discovered the device was set up on four occasions last season, in matches against Mainz, Cologne, Frankfurt and once again Dortmund, but not used.

Hopp is one of the founders of German software corporation SAP AG and is the Hoffenheim's chief financial backer.

The 71-year-old has overseen Hoffenheim's promotion from the eighth tier of German football to the Bundesliga and also funded the construction of the club's 30,000-seater Rhein-Neckar Arena -- which opened in January 2009.
