The 45-year-old poured gasoline over his body and ignited it at a bus station in the town of Yehud. Passersby extinguished the flames with bottles of water and a fire extinguisher but he was left with 70% burns.

The veteran had spent four months in a coma at the Beer Sheva Medical Center after he was injured at age 23, according to local media reports. He was to be married a month after he was hurt but the marriage was canceled.

Mafa'i is the second person to die in a self-immolation in Israel in less than a week.

According to local media reports, he left a note accusing the conservative Netanyahu government of "taking from the poor and giving to the rich." Israeli media have reported other suicide attempts apparently motivated by economic hardship.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the self-immolations as tragic. Such incidents are unusual in Israel.

A self-immolation in Tunisia in December 2010 by Mohamed Bouazizi, a young street vendor, was the spark that ignited the protests and revolutionary fervor of the Arab Spring.

The desperate measure is a more common form of protest in some Asian nations, in particular for Tibetans who want autonomy from China.

Some 44 Tibetans, many of them monks, have self-immolated since 2009, according to the Central Tibetan Administration, which functions as the government of Tibetans outside the Chinese territory.

Chinese official interference with Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and nunneries contributed to at least a dozen self-immolations in 2011, according to the U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom report.

Apostolos Polyzonis, who survived after being rescued by police and spending days in intensive care, told CNN in April: "At that moment, I saw my life as worthless. I really didn't care if I was going to live or die."
