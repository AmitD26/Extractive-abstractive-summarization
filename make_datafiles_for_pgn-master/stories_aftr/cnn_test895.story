The county and city attorneys originally filed a lawsuit in June, asked a judge to stop the company from improperly disposing of waste and consider fining the company for allegedly violating state laws.

"This wasn't an isolated incident. Walgreen's actions were systematic and statewide, and the company must be held accountable," Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen A. Trutanich said in a statement Monday.

A company spokesman declined to comment on details of the case.

The drug store chain should be fined, prosecutors say, under state health codes.

"Prosecutors contend that Walgreens systematically ignored those laws to cut costs," the Alameda County District Attorney's Office said in a statement.

Walgreen Co. mentioned the lawsuit in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month, citing regulations that require the company to disclose proceedings where monetary sanctions could exceed $100,000.

"The company intends to work with state and local officials in an effort to resolve this matter, but cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these efforts," the filing said.
