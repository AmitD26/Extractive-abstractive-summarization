(CNN) -- NBC was pummeled by viewers who took to social media after the network cut away early from the closing ceremony of the London Games on Sunday to air a new television show, drawing outrage from those who tuned in for the highly anticipated musical spectacle.

"I still don't understand, it's a tape delay, so can't you do the math in advance? Why do you need to cut off the closing ceremony? #nbcfail," Raj Sarkar wrote on Twitter.

Actor Nate Barlow posted to his Twitter account: "Why #nbcfail ranks last: no better way to turn people off a new show than to preempt @thewho & other rock legends for it."

The network was under fire for much of the 16 days of the Games by viewers who took to Twitter and Facebook to complain about its tape-delayed coverage of big-ticket events, which NBC has said was necessary to maximize its prime-time audience.

Earlier in the Games, NBC came under fire for filing a complaint over tweets by Guy Adams, the Los Angeles-based journalist whose Twitter account was temporarily suspended after he criticized NBC for its Olympics coverage.

The network also came under fire for spoiling the results of U.S. swimmer Missy Franklin's gold medal-winning race when it ran a "Today" show promo that revealed the outcome of the race before it was telecast that night.

NBC did air The Who's performance at the closing ceremony in late night, following "Animal Practice." But that did little to calm the fury of viewers, many of whom said they tuned in to see the British band Muse perform the official song of the Olympics.

"Their broadcast was horrible! No Muse with the OFFICIAL song of the Olympics. Who made that call? @NBC #NBCfail," LoriAndJava wrote on Twitter.

NBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision to cut away from the ceremony, though it did appear to warn viewers that it was about to end its Olympic coverage.

"And that's a wrap! Thanks for enjoying the 2012 #Olympics with us! RT if you CAN'T WAIT for #Sochi2014!," read a post that appeared on the NBC Olympics Twitter page as the closing ceremony aired on the East Coast.

Earlier, NBC streamed the ceremony live on its Olympics website.

At least those in attendance at the closing ceremony in London enjoyed the show.

"What an incredible night! Closing ceremonies were unbelievable but I am EXHAUSTED!" swimmer Franklin wrote on Twitter. "I'll post a few pics before bed."

Is it really #NBCfail?
