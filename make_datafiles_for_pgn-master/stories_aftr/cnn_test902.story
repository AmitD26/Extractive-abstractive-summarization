Just days after the webcam incident in 2010, Clementi committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge, which connects New Jersey and Manhattan.

Ravi, 20, now faces a 15-count indictment in Clementi's death that includes hate crime charges, charges of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with physical evidence, witness tampering and hindering apprehension or prosecution.

Last year, he turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time.

Prosecutors also offered to help Ravi avoid deportation, though they said they could not guarantee it. Ravi is a citizen of India who had been studying on a visa at the New Jersey university.

Molly Wei, 19, reached a plea deal that requires her to testify against Ravi.

Prosecutor: "These acts were purposeful"

Should Wei complete a three-year program on cyberbullying, as well as 300 hours of community service without any additional legal troubles, charges against her for allegedly watching the video will be dropped, according to prosecutors.

She also testified about when she learned of messages Ravi allegedly sent about the stream.

"I was very surprised because my friends brought it up, and I had no idea how they knew, but they said that Dharun had told them. ... They told me about these Twitter, tweets, that they received on Tuesday about him trying to have a viewing party," said Wei.

In November, Clementi's family consented to the use of his name on federal anti-harassment legislation called the "Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act."

The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid "to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student," said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey.
