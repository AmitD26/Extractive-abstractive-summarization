(EW.com) -- Hear the music, close your eyes, feel the rhythm â€” "Flashdance" is Broadway-bound.

Fall theater preview: 10 shows we're dying to see

"Flashdance --The Musical" features a book by Tom Hedley (co-writer of the original screenplay with Joe Eszterhas) and Robert Cary, with music by Robbie Roth, lyrics by Cary and Roth, and direction and choreography by Sergio Trujillo ("Jersey Boys," "Memphis").

"We are thrilled to be bringing "Flashdance" to Broadway," producer Marc Routh said in a press release.

"The new work we've already seen Sergio create in the studio is downright brilliant. He's come up with new ways of storytelling through dance that bring you immediately to the heart of this iconic story of a girl with a dream in a way I've never seen," Routh went on. "And we all remember where we were when we first heard these hit songs, they bring you back to a place in time. ... We can't wait for audiences to embrace this new musical across the country on tour and then in the separate flagship production on Broadway."
