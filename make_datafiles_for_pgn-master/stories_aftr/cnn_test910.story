Once a feared and respected name in German and European football, the club has been in the shadow ever since it reached the European Cup final some 52 years ago.

Promotion last season promised a bright future for the club and recent weeks have not disappointed.

Champions Dortmund held as Eintracht Frankfurt set early Bundesliga pace

Just a mention of the 1960 European Cup final will have the older supporters recollecting memories of how Real Madrid, inspired by Alfredo di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas, put the Germans to the sword that night.

Puskas, arguably one of the greatest players of his generation, scored four times, while di Stefano netted a hat-trick as Real ran out 7-3 winners in one of the finest football matches in the competition's history.

While the two clubs may have reached the pinnacle on that night in Glasgow, they soon took very different paths as Real continued to conquer, while Frankfurt began to fade.

Last weekend's defeat by Stuttgart, its second of the campaign, brought the players back down to earth.

Its home game against Greuther F端rth, a team sitting bottom of the Bundesliga at the start of the weekend, was supposed to provide the opportunity to get back on track

Frankfurt made the perfect start when Alex Meier scored with an 18-yard drive after just 20 seconds to claim his fifth goal in as many games.

But while many expected Greuther F端rth to capitulate, it was quite the opposite as Frankfurt were forced on to the back foot for much of the contest.

But it refused to give up the fight and Zoltan Stieber fired home a 53rd minute equalizer to claim a point a lift the club off the bottom of the table.

Bayern unbeaten run in Bundesliga halted by Bayer Leverkusen

The result means Frankfurt has 20 points from its ten games so far this season and sits in third ahead of the rest of this weekend's games.

And what next for Veh's side? Well, that would be the small question of a trip to the Allianz Arena to face Bayern Munich side which reached last season's Champions League Final and has won eight of its nine league games this season.

If Frankfurt was unsure whether it was back in the big time, then next week will certainly provide a healthy dose of reality.
