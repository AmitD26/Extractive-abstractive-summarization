(CNN) -- Nickey Van Exel, the 20-year-old son of former NBA player and current Atlanta Hawks coaching staff member Nick Van Exel, has been charged with capital murder in the shooting of a close friend, his attorney said.

Van Exel is charged in the shooting of Bradley Bassey Eyo, 23, in the Dallas suburb of Garland. Eyo's body was dumped near Lake Ray Hubbard, authorities said, and had an apparent gunshot wound to the upper body.

In an interview with CNN affiliate WFAA, Eyo's father said police told him that Van Exel said the shooting was an accident.

"They were playing with a shotgun, and when it went off on Bradley, he didn't know what to do, took his body and dumped it on the street," the father told WFAA.

Authorities told reporters that they reviewed the case closely before making it a capital offense.

"If a person is making the assertion this was an accident -- you place the body in a vehicle and moved it to a second location -- that in itself, coupled with the fact that property is missing, makes this a capital murder," said Deputy Chief Craig Miller.

A cell phone and shoes were the missing property, said Dallas police spokesman Kevin Janse.

Paul Johnson, Van Exel's attorney, told CNN the shooting was the result of "horseplay."

"Everybody considered them to be like brothers," the attorney said of the two young men.

"When it occurred, there was no question his friend was deceased," Johnson said.

Van Exel tried to call his family, but he "couldn't get a hold of anybody," Johnson said. "You are talking about a 20-year-old boy."
