JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has temporarily banned YouTube to block access to a video that many Muslims consider anti-Islamic.

Protesters demonstrate against an anti-Islamic film in front of the Dutch embassy in Jakarta.

The minister has asked YouTube to remove the 15-minute movie "Fitna," but has not received a reply from the company, the spokesman said.

Last week, about 50 Indonesia students broke into a Dutch consulate compound to protest the movie. They tore off the gate of the embassy in the city of Medan and ripped down a flag, said a Dutch Embassy spokeswoman.

Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkanende has said his government is worried that Geert Wilders' film could provoke a violent backlash.

Soon after its release last month, hundreds of angry Muslims rallied in Pakistan, where the government temporarily blocked access to YouTube because of a trailer for Wilders' film. The protesters burned the Dutch flag and called on Pakistan to cut ties with the Netherlands.

The Dutch government and others, including the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, have rejected the film.

But Wilders has stood by his project.

The title, "Fitna," translates in Arabic to "strife" or "conflict" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group.

The film opens with passages from the Quran, interspersed with graphic images of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States .
