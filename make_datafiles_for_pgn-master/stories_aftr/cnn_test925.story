At last, with "Brave," it's the girls' turn to shine -- a bit behind the curve in this year of the Warrior Princess. The movie itself is no more than an agreeable lark. It's not in the same league as "Up", "WALLE" or the "Toy Story" films, but fun all the same.

Set in sunny, ancient Scotland -- complete with warring clans, rampaging beasts, magical witches and supernatural will-o'-the-wisps -- the movie quickly checks off the expected sightings: kilts, haggis, caber-tossing and Billy Connolly. Nessie doesn't make the cut, but I wouldn't be too surprised if she showed up in a sequel.

Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) is the eldest child to Fergus (Connolly) and Elinor (Emma Thompson). Headstrong, with cascading, blazing red locks, Merida is a tomboy. She'd rather be riding horses, scaling cliffs or hunting with her bow and arrow than sewing, singing and accepting her mother's mind on what behaviors befit a princess of their clan.

Merida fits right in line with the dynamic damsels we have seen recently in warring "Snow White" films, "John Carter" and "The Hunger Games." It's refreshing that she's also foolhardy and no wiser than most teenagers.

Mother-daughter relationships are still at a premium in big-budget flicks, and "Brave" observes their squabbling with an affectionate, even-handed familiarity that's nice to see.

Appealing as this left-field plot twist is, it's also daft. It's as if Merida has taken a stupid pill, and the plentiful coincidences that follow are almost as hard to swallow. Pixar likes to boast that it's all about the story, but this tall tale has more holes than a draughty sporran. The time scale feels off, and King Fergus in particular is left dangling for too long.
