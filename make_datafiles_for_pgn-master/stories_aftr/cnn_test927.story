Two superb first-half goals from Mario Gomez took his tally for the tournament to three and put the Germans in complete control.

Robin Van Persie pulled a goal back as Netherlands improved in the second half, but Germany comfortably held on for a second successive victory at this tournament.

Netherlands 1-2 Germany

Striker Gomez scored two stunning goals to earn Germany a deserved win and heighten expectation that Low's side can win this European Championship.

The Germans took control of a crucial game when Gomez brilliantly collected Bastian Schweinsteiger's pass and spun to slide home a clinical finish.

The Dutch were, briefly, ranked the number one team in the world as recently as August but they looked a poor imitation of the side that reached the World Cup final in South Africa two years ago.

The Arsenal striker's touch had previously deserted him at this tournament, but he suddenly looked deadly as he spun away from Sami Khedira and smashed a superb shot past Manuel Neuer with his weaker right foot.

Forward Nicklas Bendtner appeared to have denied Portugal a crucial victory as he struck twice to wipe out a 2-0 lead.

Cristiano Ronaldo missed a glorious chance to restore Portugal's advantage but substitute Varela had the final say with a remarkable winner.

Fabio Coentrao's left-wing cross invited a volley but Varela swung wildly with his left foot and completely missed, only to spin and smash home the loose ball with his right.

It was a remarkable finish to a remarkable game and it left Portugal and Denmark locked together on three points each after two Group B games.

Bento's side urgently needed a win after losing their opening game to Germany, one of the tournament favorites, and they swept into a two-goal lead to take control of the tie.

Real Madrid defender Pepe, who had hit the bar against Germany, had a change of luck to open the scoring, timing his run to perfection to flick home a near-post header from Joao Moutinho's corner.

The Arsenal striker pounced again 10 minutes from time when he headed home Lars Jacobsen's cross -- his sixth international goal in just five appearances against Portugal.

Those are the sort of statistics more usually associated with Ronaldo, but the Portugal captain had an off-day, missing two clear chances before substitute Varela spared his blushes.
