United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council discussed Friday a resolution introduced by Morocco that calls on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down and transfer power to his vice president.

The next step is a meeting of experts from the missions of the 15 countries on the Security Council, on Monday afternoon.

The Security Council has been unable to agree on any resolution on Syria. In October, Russia and China issued a rare double-veto of a resolution that lacked sanctions but would have condemned the violence in Syria. This latest draft also lacks sanctions, but is tougher than the October version, which said nothing about transfer of power.

The draft gives Syria 15 days to comply or risk the adoption of further measures.

"The red lines include any indication of sanctions," he said. "The red lines included any sort of imposition of arms embargo, because we know how in real life, arms embargo means that you supply weapons to illegal groups but you cannot supply weapons to the government. We cannot accept that. Unfortunately the draft which we saw today did not ignore our red lines but also added some new elements which we find unacceptable as a matter of principle."

He went on to say that those added things included the idea of imposing a political outcome.

This week, the Russian ambassador to the United States accused the United States and Europe of trying to turn a Security Council resolution on Syria into an "anti-al-Assad" resolution, a step that, he argued, could "be a recipe for disaster."

Araud was sanguine: "Frankly, I don't think it will be too difficult to reach an agreement," he told reporters.

And German Ambassador Peter Wittig said world body must take action. "Let's seize this window of opportunity that we have."

"They deal with us as if we are a former colony -- that we should subjugate ourselves to their will. They are wrong and they will be disappointed."

He continued, "Syria will not be Libya; Syria will not be Iraq; Syria will not be Somalia; Syria will not be a failing state."
