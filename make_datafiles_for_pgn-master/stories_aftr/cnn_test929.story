(CNNGo) -- What? A best-markets-of-the-world lineup without Marrakesh, Istanbul's Grand Bazaar and Cairo's Khan el-Khalili in the mix? But you already know about those, and anyway we just mentioned them.

If you're still searching for that elusive knockoff, that priceless $20 trinket, that vintage earthenware goblet -- above all, that authentic bazaar experience -- you can bet your top and bottom dollar you'll score big at one of the following, one-of-a-kind markets around the world.

1. FLEA

Rose Bowl Flea Market: Los Angeles

Never mind Hollywood or Venice Beach, here's the definitive L.A. Experience. A tradition since 1969.

Best buys: Locals flock here for anti-IKEA home furnishing deals they can stuff into a friend's borrowed pickup. Travelers come for vintage clothing and accessories, cheap 502 Levi's owned by former B-list celebrities and the best people-watching in Southern California.

Rose Bowl Flea Market: 1001 Rose Bowl Drive, Pasadena, +1 323 560 7469; www.rgcshows.com

2. FLOATING

Every beige-pants-wearing Southeast Asian traveler and their posse of touts flock to the far better known Damnoen Saduak Floating Market.

Best buys: Go ahead and score that ripe mangosteen or choice bunch of Malacca grapes. The prime takeaway experience is a hired boat ride along the canals -- and an overnight in one of several homestays in the area.

Know B4 u go: Consult the heavens before you arrive. The market is only open six days a month (6 a.m.-noon) in accordance with the Thai lunar calendar.

Tsukiji Central Fish Market: Tokyo

"Lost in Translation" is an I-Can-Read book compared to the incomprehensible scene inside Japan's biggest seafood market -- a 1,200-stall, hangar-style building on Tokyo Bay packed to the gills with frenzied fishmongers and wholesalers bartering over 2,000-plus tons of marine meat every day.

Best buys: If you're a local buyer, choose from more than 450 kinds of seafood. Visitors can feast their eyes on these proceedings (after 9 a.m. when tourists are permitted inside the "inner" market) and then sample the goods in the "outer" market's lineup of top sushi bars.

Know B4 u go: The early-morning tuna auction is legendary, and currently restricted to 140 first-come-first-served spectators per day -- who line up at the market's main info center by 5 a.m.

4. FRENZIED

It's saying something when a shopping district is routinely called "incomparable" even by Indian standards.

Best buys: Pick your specialized alley for clothes, fabrics, jewelry, leather goods or electronics and let the haggling begin. The real headliner here is Delhi street food -- beginning (and ending) with a deep-fried jalebi at the institutional Old and Famous Jalebi Wala on Dariba Kalan Road.

5. FLOWER

About 20 million flowers and more than 13,000 varieties are bartered off in a visitor-friendly warehouse that's reckoned -- at 990,000 square meters -- to be the third largest in the world.

Best buys: If you're shopping for a cheap spring bouquet, stick with Amsterdam's Bloemenmarkt. Aalsmeer's more of a spectator sport where visitors can watch pros bid on football field-size quantities of tulips, gardenias, roses, lilies and gerber daisies before ending up in the site's souvenir shop for floriculture tchotchkes.

Take bus 172 from outside Centraal Station, near the Victoria Hotel, which stops right outside the auction warehouse. www.floraholland.com/en/AboutFloraHolland

6. FESTIVE

San Pedro Telmo Antiques Fair: Buenos Aires

Officially, this Sunday proceeding -- about 270 stalls and 10,000 pedestrians -- held in the main plaza of historic San Telmo is billed as an antiques fair. Fair enough.

Know B4 u go: After the vendors start packing up at around 4 p.m., stick around for the outdoor Milonga, the city's best free, Sunday evening open-air tango dance party.

7. FREAKISH

These three had been dying to come to this market for years. You can only browse through so many buckets of chilies, cactus paddles and piñata stalls at Mercado de la Merced, Mexico City's top farmers' market, before it's time for a jolt of the occult at the neighboring Mercado de Sonora -- a maze of ritualistic, remedy-filled booths that's collectively been called "the Walmart of the witch world."

Best buys: It all depends on what you're trying to attract or repel by spiritual means. The range of healing herbs, love potions, Santería charms, voodoo dolls, tarot-reading luminaries, unorthodox dandruff cures and dried critters is staggering.
