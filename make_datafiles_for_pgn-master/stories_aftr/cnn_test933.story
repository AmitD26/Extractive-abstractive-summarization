The mayor's office in Grosseto, the provincial capital, identified the victim as Sandor Feher, a member of the crew. His body was one of five recovered Tuesday.

The office said 26 people remained missing. But the list may include some of the five victims.

The family of two missing Americans, Gerald and Barbara Heil of White Bear Lake, Minnesota, said it was thankful for perilous attempts to find those still unaccounted for.

Experts say chances of finding survivors are slim.

"I think you have to look at several issues. One is just the hypothermia. If a compartment is flooded, even if there was air, at this point, most of them would have succumbed to the hypothermic problem of the water temperature," said Butch Hendrick, president of the diving safety company Lifeguard Systems.

Costa Serena, sister ship of the Concordia, sailed by the wreckage Wednesday night, safely navigating the waters around the island of Giglio.

The investigation is focusing on actions by Concordia Capt. Francesco Schettino.

The judge said the captain admitted to making a mistake and that, at the time of the collision, he was navigating by sight.

In her preliminary investigation, Montesarchio said there appears to be considerable evidence against the captain, whom she said showed "imprudence and inexperience."

The judge's findings included: Schettino made no serious attempt to return to the ship, he underestimated the damage to the Concordia and he failed to alert authorities in a timely manner.

Montesarchio described the shipwreck as "a disaster of global proportion."

Looking out the bridge window is an aid to navigation, Wright said, but "that should absolutely by no means be your primary sense of position referencing."

The shipping industry newspaper Lloyd's List reported that Friday was not the first time the Costa Concordia steamed extremely close to shore near Giglio.

The pass happened on August 14, 2011, Lloyd's List reported.

"It must have come within sniffing distance of the underwater rock that it hit on this voyage," editor-in-chief Adam Smallman of Lloyd's List told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night.

The pass occurred "under the authorization of the maritime authority, local maritime authority with the authority of the island aware, and with the permission of Costa, after having reviewed the route that the captain intended to take nearby the island," Foschi said, adding the vessel was observing San Lorenzo, known as night of the shooting stars.

The executive said the pass was not to be within 500 meters of the island.

"We believe it has been a human error here," Foschi said. "The captain did not follow the authorized route, which is used by Costa ships very frequently. There's probably more than 100 times in one year we have this route."

Schettino was arrested after leaving the ship while dozens were still aboard, panicked and fighting for lifeboats.

But as the official questions his decision, Schettino appears to reverse himself and say he had not abandoned ship but was "catapulted into the water" after the ship ran into a rock, began taking on water and started listing.

In a later conversation, an Italian coast guard official demands Schettino return to his ship, the transcripts show.

"You get on board! This is an order!" Capt. Gregorio De Falco instructed Schettino.

"You have declared 'Abandon ship.' Now I'm in charge. You get on board -- is that clear?" the port official said.

De Falco's tough tone has been celebrated across Italy, with even a T-shirt on sale featuring another line he uttered to Schettino: "Get on board, damn it."

A Facebook page praising De Falco's comments had nearly 17,000 "likes" Wednesday.

In London, where he was meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said he did not want to get ahead of the "multiple and meticulous inquiries" under way, but "obviously, any such disaster could and should be avoided."

He added that Italian authorities are also working to avoid any environmental damage as the result of the shipwreck. The company said it has hired a salvage company to recover the remaining fuel from the ship, with work beginning by the end of the week.
