London (CNN) -- A bobsled guided by mind power, guns fired by blowing into a headset, desert waves created by nanobots -- the world of disabled athletes could be very different in the near future.

A new exhibition of prototypes aimed at making sport more accessible has opened in the British capital, featuring innovative ideas from young designers.

Taking this year's London Paralympic games as their inspiration, students from Imperial College, London and the Royal College of Art have come up with 11 ingenious ideas that dream up new equipment and, in some cases, entirely new sports.

"When we started the project we said to the students: 'It can't be Marvel (comics), it can't be Quidditch (a game in the Harry Potter films), but it has to have something of that in there.' It's all about imagination, and for the students here, that is their currency," Keech, a course tutor at Imperial College, told CNN.

"Headshot" -- a new take on clay-pigeon shooting for both the able-bodied and disabled -- is a good example.

"It maintains the physicality of the sport and the man/machine connection," says co-designer Jeff Gough.

"There is a strong sense of thrill as the gun is mounted on the body. We played with a few different ideas but we wanted to mimic the fine motor skills involved in shooting."

The challenge has been sponsored by Rio Tinto (provider of the metal for medals at London Olympics and Paralympics) which awarded a Â£5,000 ($8,000) development prize to the most promising design.

The students imagine it helping to hone a swimming stroke, and Keech thinks it has "wonderful possibilities."

Iain Dawson, a visually-impaired parathlete who advised the students on the four-week project, was impressed with their efforts.

"It was really a meeting of minds," Keech said. "The best design students in the world meeting the best athletes in the world."

Other designs peered a little further into the future.
