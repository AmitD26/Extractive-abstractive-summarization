In January, Cameron said the British people should have a choice about whether to remain in the EU on the basis of a renegotiated settlement -- or to leave.

The referendum should not be held until it's clear how changes made after the crisis in the eurozone work out, he said.

He added: "From a business perspective to elect and decide to vote to move away from 50% of your business partnership doesn't strike me as a very good view."

Odell also said the weak pound would not deter Ford's operation in the UK. Sterling is under pressure as investors anticipate new stimulus measures from the Bank of England.

This week Ford is launching its new Tourneo Courier at the Geneva Motor Show, with the people carrier set to hit UK showrooms next spring. Odell says Ford is already beginning to see encouraging signs in sales in the European car industry.

"There are some signs on supplier purchasing, on our own order banks that there are some green shoots..... we could start to see some sort of recovery slow in the second half [of 2013]."
