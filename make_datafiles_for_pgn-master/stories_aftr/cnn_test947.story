(CNN) -- Allison Janney was always on the move as a child. The "West Wing" actress played sports and enjoyed figure skating, so staying active was easy. But over the years, exercise took a back seat to Janney's evolving career.

We all did, Ms. Janney.

Janney's had more than one high-profile role since "The West Wing" ended: She played the dog-obsessed mom in "Juno," a Southern socialite in "The Help" and Matthew Perry's crazy boss on "Mr. Sunshine." But Janney said White House press secretary C.J. Cregg will always be one of her favorite characters.

"I feel proud," she said. "I feel like I can die happy; I did something good. Not that I'm planning on dying anytime soon."

That's good, especially considering Janney's newest role is spokeswoman for the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women campaign.

The campaign aims to spread awareness about the No. 1 killer of women: heart disease.

Janney comes from a long line of "cream and butter" lovers, she said. Her family's history of heart disease -- including a grandfather who died of a heart attack -- led her to volunteer for the campaign.

CNN spoke with Janney about Go Red for Women, how she stays healthy and where she hopes her career heads next. The following is an edited version of that interview.

CNN: What does that color symbolize for women?

Janney: It's blood. It's love. It's your heart. It's vibrant. It's alive. Red is just the most standout, powerful color I think there is.

CNN: Let's talk about the real reason you're working with the American Heart Association.

She was driving, going to see the grandkids. She was in a motel and probably had what was a very small heart attack -- but a warning. She just thought she was having this unbelievable pressure and discomfort in her neck and shoulders.

I almost lost her. For that reason alone, I'm glad to be part of this campaign.

CNN: You mentioned that many women feel like they have to tough it out and just ignore the symptoms. Why do you think that is?

Janney: I think, as women, we tend to always put our own needs in the back seat to take care of our family or loved ones. My mother did just that.

Women feel they need to take care of everybody, (but) they can't take care of anybody if they don't take care of themselves.

CNN: How did that experience, and learning more about heart disease, change the way you looked at exercise and nutrition?

Janney: I've lost 15 (to) 20 pounds since the summer. I've been doing Pilates three days a week, and I have three dogs, which gets me out walking every single morning. It's been nice to slim down and bump up the exercise.

CNN: Do you have any favorite foods that you've had a hard time giving up?

I love chocolate, but now I go for 88% and 90% dark, dark chocolate to treat myself.

CNN: So you like to cook?

Janney: I do. I'm not the best cook, but I do like to get inspired -- you know, get the cooking magazines or watch cooking shows.

I really try to stick to that, and I find I feel better; I have more energy. I'm 50-something, and I feel better than I felt 20 years ago. So it works.

CNN: What do you do for stress relief?

Janney: I'm trying to learn to meditate. I haven't been able to achieve it successfully yet because I get impatient.

I do these breathing exercises where if I start to feel stressed I breathe in for -- I start at a high number like eight -- and breathe in for eight counts and breathe out for eight counts, until I feel like I can go down to seven and then to six ... and it really does calm me down.

Getting a dog I would highly recommend for anyone. Animals are great for stress. The morning comes, and you have to take those dogs out. And I feel better because I don't feel guilty.

CNN: What would you like to tell women about heart disease?

Janney: We only get to be here once; why not feel the best you can feel? Start making choices that are going to make a difference in your life and the people's lives around you.

CNN: You've been called one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood. What haven't you done that you'd still like to do?

Janney: Really? Wow. I just signed up for doing a series for CBS called "Mom." Anna Faris plays my daughter. It's a multicam series, the first time I'll be doing that sort of format where I'm performing in front of a live audience for television. I'm really excited about that.

I just want to keep working, because that's where I'm happy, and I think that's what I'm supposed to do in this lifetime: keep working and keep experiencing and keep healthy and stay alive as long as I can.
