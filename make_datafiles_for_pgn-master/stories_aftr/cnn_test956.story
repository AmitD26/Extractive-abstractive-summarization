(CNN) -- At this very moment, 500 miles above your freckle-pocked head, a half-million pieces of junk are orbiting around the Earth.

But figuring out how to handle your own outdated Web content is tricky business. Instead of doing the online equivalent of littering -- sweeping yesteryear into a dustbin of 0s and 1s -- refer to our handy guide for dealing with the past.

Your wedding website -- two weeks after the big day

Our two cents: Update the website shortly after you return from your sun-soaked honeymoon with pictures from the event and an earnest, grateful message to all who were there in flesh or spirit. Don't beg guests to contribute their memories to an online guest book -- they bought you a present; their obligation is done.

Let the domain registration or hosting die out in the year following your wedding, and get on with it already.

But Facebook actually has a memorialization feature, and there's good reason to take advantage of it: It freezes the account so no one else can log in as the user, and it allows only already-confirmed friends to write on the wall in remembrance. That person will no longer show up as a suggested photo tag or in "people you may know." In short, it allows the Facebook page to become an homage, an interactive equivalent of a memory book.

Your embarrassing relics of Web 2.0

-- An embarrassing tapestry of snaps in your public Photobucket account

-- An angsty LiveJournal, Xanga or Blogspot account peppered with complaints about your parents/teachers/The Man, as well as various and sundry Dashboard Confessional lyrics.

If you're older, the references might change: websites someone made for that overly involved professional football league, a derailed blog purporting to document your child's first year of life, whatever.

But the fact remains that these relics, when happened upon by bosses, new swains or those who have a vendetta against you, are just, well, embarrassing. Usually, making such exhibitionist accounts private will do the trick; if you can't remember your log-in information (and your e-mail address has changed, rendering the "forgot your password?" option useless), e-mail or call the company to ask it to log you in or take the page down.

Because like those hulking chunks of orbital debris, you never know when they'll jet onto a dangerous collision course.
