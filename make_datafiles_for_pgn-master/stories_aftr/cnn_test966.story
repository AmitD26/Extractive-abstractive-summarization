This is the story of an ambitious European entrepreneur who buys himself diplomatic immunity for less than $200,000. That would be Danish agent provocateur Mads Brugger, who greases several palms in a bid to get himself appointed the Liberian ambassador to the Central African Republic.

And why would anyone want to do that? Well, if you think Liberia could use some governmental oversight, wait until you see what goes on in the Central African Republic. While most of the populace is mired in poverty, let's not forget that this former French colony is also home to some of the world's richest diamond fields (which is where diplomatic status proves an invaluable investment).

This is his cover story, a fig leaf for his smuggling plans, and an illustration of the kind of development that might genuinely help the indigenous peoples. But it's also a cruel hoax on the pygmies he meets, collateral damage in his bid to expose their corrupt political masters and the international diplomatic classes who feed off them.

Brugger is playing with dynamite here.

The closest comparison may be Sacha Baron Cohen's knife-edge satirical rubes. The film is often very funny even if you feel lousy about laughing -- except that Baron Cohen hasn't put his own neck on the line like this.

"The Ambassador" is a damning movie on almost every level.

You might have serious reservations about his methods, but you can't fault the man's nerve. It's extraordinary just how many illicit conversations with important men Brugger manages to get on camera. Already the Liberian president has called for an inquiry, though there seems little likelihood of similar soul-searching in the Central African Republic. In any case, Brugger has given his testimony and issued his indictments, too.
