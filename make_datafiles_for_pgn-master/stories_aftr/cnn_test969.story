Osh, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- The first U.N. aid plane arrived Wednesday in Uzbekistan to help the thousands of people who have fled ethnic clashes in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, officials with a U.N. Refugee agency said Wednesday.

Relative calm continued in Osh, Kyrgyzstan's second largest city, Wednesday. But still sporadic gunfire could be heard.

The Central Asian nation's news agency 24.kg reported that the death toll had risen to 179, a number that some observers discounted as low. Kyrgyzstan's interim government had declared Wednesday a day of mourning for families of the many killed and thousands wounded in the violence that started last week.

The government had sent extra security forces into Osh and Jalal-Abad, the hardest-hit cities, on Tuesday to help calm the situation. The ICRC says it was able to visit the main detention center in Osh Wednesday for the first time since the crisis started and has delivered food provided by the World Food Program to around 1,000 detainees.

However, the WFP says transporting aid from the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, is difficult, because the roads aren't safe and commercial trucking companies are reluctant to risk their vehicles.

The clashes are part of the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Soviet republic since 1990, when hundreds of people died in skirmishes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in Osh.

"The past 20 years have been spent working very hard to avoid this kind of conflict, but everyone is aware of the danger, Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN refugee agency UNHCR, told CNN. "The situation is like a striking a match on petrol."

"It's very hard to confirm anything for sure, but cross-checking seems to indicate a planned, provocative act. The Kyrgyz government is naming names, but UNHCR is not in a position to name names or point fingers," said Colville.

The flow of people was so overwhelming that Uzbekistan had close some of its border crossing areas leaving many standing at the border on the Kyrgyzstan side of a barbed-wire fence.

Red Cross workers came across one mosque outside Jalal-Abad where an estimated 6,000 frightened people have gathered for safety.

CNN's Matthew Chance, Brian Walker, Jill Dougherty, Nic Robertson and Evan Buxbaum contributed to this report.
