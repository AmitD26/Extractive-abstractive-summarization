(CNN) -- Maybe a phone's not big enough for you and your spouse to cuddle up with on the sofa. Or single folks need to travel light when they're on the prowl.

In it, 49% of single respondents said they own a smartphone, compared with only 43% of married people. Meanwhile, 45% of people who have said "I do" reported owning a tablet, compared with 36% of singles.

Search Agency Vice President Mike Solomon said that differences in the ages of single and married respondents may have played a bigger role than specific habits.

"Married people are often older, have more disposable income and can more easily justify superfluous pieces of technology, such as tablets. At the same time, baby boomers are often more tech-literate than their slightly younger counterparts -- likely because their millennial children are pushing them to use new tools and devices."

The survey of 2,006 U.S. adults was conducted online between August 14 and 16.

And 66% of tablet owners said they've quickly jumped onto their iPad, Kindle Fire, Nexus 7 or other gadget to get more information about products they see on TV.
