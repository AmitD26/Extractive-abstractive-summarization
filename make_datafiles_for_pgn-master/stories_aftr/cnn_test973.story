(CNN) -- Sauber has confirmed that Mexico's Esteban Gutierrez will replace Kamui Kobayashi as the team's second driver for next season.

Guttierrez finished third in the GP2 championship last season after winning three races, and will continue Sauber's recent tradition of having a Mexican driver with Sergio Perez having announced he will be joining McLaren at the end of the season.

The deal means Sauber, who has a sponsorship deal with Mexican telecommunications company Telmex, has another Mexican driver at its disposal.

Guttierrez told the team's official website: "After three years working with Sauber I feel very grateful for all the attention I have received from everyone in the team and for all their input, which has allowed me to develop into a Formula One driver in a very progressive way.

"Now, after experiencing other categories of racing as an introduction to Formula One, this is the start of the real challenge to succeed at the pinnacle of motor sport.

"It will be a great pleasure to be racing in the same team as an experienced driver like Nico HÃ¼lkenberg.

Team Principal Monisha Kaltenborn added: "Esteban has already been part of the team for a long time and we have followed his career very closely.

"In 2010 we signed him up as an affiliated driver, and in 2011 and 2012 he was our test and reserve driver. We mapped out his path to Formula One step by step.

Sauber has also taken on Dutch driver Robin Frijns as its new test and reserve driver.

The 22-year-old, who recorded highest finishes of 15th at the Australian Grand Prix and European Grand Prix, is relishing the new opportunity.

"I am very proud to be able to confirm that I am joining Caterham F1 Team next year and I'm looking forward to many seasons of successful racing cooperation," he said.
