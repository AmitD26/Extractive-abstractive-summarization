Dr. Csaba Marosan taught natural Sciences at Trocaire College in Buffalo. He told CNN that he was asked not to return this year because of his formal complaint against the college in 2009.

The college denied the allegations and attributes his dismissal to  lack of qualifications. The former professor said he has taught at the college for  eight years.

A report from the New York State Division of Human Rights shows that a dean of education allegedly made comments about Marosan's nationality, accent, culture and manner of greeting colleagues.

The initial report was amended in April to include the differential treatment Marosan allegedly received since the investigation started, including his eventual dismissal. The amended report also includes a charge of discrimination based on sexual orientation, which Marosan said he initially left out.

"The decision of the New York Division of Human Rights is based on a poor and incomplete investigation," he said.

In addition, the report indicates that among a number of sexual harassment complaints made against Marosan, at least one student admitted to having been coached. All other cases were fully dismissed.
