John Edward Shearen of Leesburg, Florida, was arrested Thursday on 15 counts of possession of child pornography and 15 counts of distribution of child pornography, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced.

He was later booked, without bond, into Lake County Jail.

His arrest came after FDLE agents executed a search warrant at his residence in Leesburg's Lakeside Pointe apartment complex, about 45 miles northwest of Orlando. They found the illicit videos and images on computers and "mass media storage devices," the state agency said.

Asked what Shearen would have done with the clothes, FDLE Special Agent Jeff Duncan told CNN affiliate WFTV, "He (told us) that he utilizes them himself, but it's virtually impossible."

"Pedophiles trade porn for other child porn. They often times barter or sell it," said Rice-Hughes, president of the advocacy group Enough is Enough.

"Taking someone out of the market is important, because it's another person who may be a former or current predator."
