Rather than having dinner with her husband, Walter E. "Eugene" Crum, she spent Thursday night mourning his violent death and taking over the job he held as sheriff of Mingo County, West Virginia.

The county's three commissioners voted unanimously to appoint Rosie Crum as sheriff during an emotional meeting Thursday afternoon.

That night, she was sworn in as sheriff at the county courthouse, meaning that she'll serve at least through the remainder of her late husband's term, with an election set for 2014. Rosie Crum did not speak at the ceremony, though she did hug 22 deputies who came to the ceremony, county commissioner John Mark Hubbard said.

"(She) is the best person to fulfill" her husband's commitment as sheriff, including taking steps to curb drug abuse in the county, county Commissioner Greg "Hootie" Smith said.

She will have a role, but Williamson Police Chief Dave Rockel will "manage the law enforcement end" of the sheriff's department, he explained.

Authorities still are trying to make sense how they got into this position, how a man so admired in his community could be so brazenly gunned down while eating his lunch.

A man had walked up to the sheriff's driver's-side door from behind, fired at Crum's head, then returned to his own vehicle and drove away, Rockel told reporters Thursday. The .40-caliber shell casings recovered at the scene indicate the shots came from a semi-automatic handgun, he added.

He "said some things to us" on his way to the hospital, West Virginia State Police First Sgt. Michael Baylous told CNN on Wednesday.

"We're still trying to make sense of it," Baylous said of Maynard's comments. "It could be interpreted in different ways."

"We are unsure at this point," Rockel said, why the sheriff was killed. "We are looking at all possibilities."

Who is Tennis Melvin Maynard?

A search of Mingo County court records show no criminal arrests or civil cases involving Maynard. His only citation involves failure to wear a seat belt, according to the records.

Weeping and shaking, his mother, Olgie Maynard, confirmed as much, saying her son was institutionalized for about a week three to four years ago.

"He went crazy," Olgie Maynard told CNN, explaining her son hadn't been the same since he was involved in a workplace explosion five or six years ago in Alabama. "He was out in the yard yelling. We called the police, and they took him away."

Since then, she said Tennis had gotten more psychiatric help at another mental health center. At home in Ragland, where he lives with his parents, he mostly stayed in his bedroom and watched television.

On Thursday afternoon, he was recovering in a hospital bed. According to the state police spokesman, Maynard is expected to survive.

He's already facing at least two serious charges: first-degree murder for Crum's death and attempted murder for firing on a sheriff's deputy.

"Those charges are pending on him getting out of the hospital," Rockel said.

The man he allegedly killed, 59-year-old Eugene Crum, had been a county magistrate and a special investigator for the prosecutor's office before becoming sheriff in January.

"It's devastating," Hatfield said. "It's a big blow to the community."

Asked whether officials thought there was any connection between Crum's slaying and the recent killing of a Colorado prison official or the slayings of two Texas prosecutors, Hatfield said, "I hope not," but declined to elaborate.

For now, the focus is on remembering Crum and his family.

"It's quite obvious that the last 26 hours have been a difficult time," said Hubbard, president of the Mingo County commission. "We continue to solicit your prayers."
