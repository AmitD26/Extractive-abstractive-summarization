(CNN) -- Pop-cultural suburbia: Take your pick.

Happy children. Low taxes. Smooth roads. Picture windows. Quiet streets. Shopping malls.

Or: Bored teenagers. Sterile sprawl. Endless traffic. Creepy neighbors. Festering secrets. Shopping malls.

Why such a divide?

The suburb "was touted as the perfect way to package American life in the utopian era that we expected the end of World War II to bring us," he says. "We're in the Space Age. Television comes out. Air conditioning and dishwashers and all of this stuff. The suburbs stood for the place where this perfect kind of life was going to be lived."

The future originally looked something like the past. Tired of six-story walkups? In the suburbs you could have your own picket-fenced home, just like the ones in small towns of yore. Sick of the subway? In the suburbs you could ride the comfortable commuter train -- or, even better, travel to work on a speedy expressway in your very own car.

Television was the best mirror of this optimistic age. Mayfield's Cleavers ("Leave It to Beaver"), Springfield's Andersons ("Father Knows Best," less biting than the radio version) and Hilldale's Stones ("The Donna Reed Show") all lived in crime-free municipalities urban enough to have the latest appliances (like, well, a television) but removed enough that their kids could play and bike without those crowded city worries -- like traffic, ethnic groups and the poor.

In this period, it was writers who poked holes in suburban perfection. John Cheever, with his quietly desperate New York escapees, was the master of suburban dissatisfaction, but others -- novelist Richard Yates ("Revolutionary Road") and journalist Vance Packard ("The Status Seekers") among them -- took aim at the consumerist society entwined with suburbia. On TV, only "Twilight Zone's" Rod Serling -- at heart, a writer -- seemed to agree with them.

These days, the pop culture divide still holds. To some -- Woody Allen comes to mind -- the city, for all its faults, is vibrant and lively, and the suburbs are "American Beauty" dead ends. To others, particularly television producers, it's the suburbs -- where most of us live, after all -- where real life happens, and the city is something for the wealthy, the terminally hip, the criminals and the tourists.

The truth, of course, is neither here nor there. Today's suburbs are increasingly multicultural and, in some cases, have developed their own skyscraper-filled "edge cities," in the term popularized by journalist Joel Garreau. Accurately portraying such a complex environment is as difficult as accurately portraying the people who live there -- though there are some (author Tom Perrotta, "My So-Called Life" producers Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick) who try.

In the end, suburbia is what our imagination wants it to be, and it won't quite fit into those little boxes of ticky-tacky.
