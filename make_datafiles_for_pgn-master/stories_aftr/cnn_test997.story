"It does represent a turning point where a lot of these investors and these entities for investments are recognizing that Africa is indeed the last frontier for growth," says Lyal White, director of the Centre for Dynamic Markets at the Gordon Institute for Business Science in South Africa.

Eyeing potential

An unprecedented decade of economic growth in Africa, coupled with a series of policy and institutional reforms, has attracted emerging global powers into the continent, seeking to gain a stronger foothold in the continent in their bid to reach more markets and forge new political alliances.

Using Portuguese-speaking countries like Angola and Mozambique as an entry point to the continent, Brazil's state and private companies have made big inroads in various parts the continent, operating mostly in strategic sectors such as infrastructure, mining and energy -- last year, mining giant Vale announced plans to spend more than Â£12 billion on investments in Africa over the next five years.

But while Brazil, like China, seems to be deeply engaged with the African resource sector, some analysts say its strategy and interests are quite distinct from its resource-hungry BRICS partner.

Strong ties

Although separated by the Atlantic Ocean, Brazil and Africa have long historical and cultural ties, dating back to the days of slave trade in the 16th century, where scores of Africans where shipped to the former Portuguese colony to be exploited as slaves on the sugar cane plantations.

Today, Brazil is quick to use this cultural affinity with Africa as an advantage in its competition with the other powers acting on the continent, analysts say.

"The fact that the majority of Brazil's population is of Afro-Brazilian origin -- making Brazil the world's largest black population after Nigeria -- is frequently quoted by the, almost exclusively white, governing elite of Brazil in order to stress Brazil's cultural similarities with the African countries," says Stolte.

During his eight-year tenure, Lula made 12 trips to Africa, visiting 21 countries, more than any of his predecessors. At the same time, Brazil increased the number of its embassies in Africa from 17 in 2002 to 37, boasting today more embassies in the continent than the United Kingdom.

Business model

Analysts say Brazil has adopted a three-pronged approach to its engagement with Africa, with an "almost seamless interaction" between the government, the private sector and development institutions.

"This all kind of comes together as one coherent strategy toward Africa from Brazil," says White.

Brazilian companies seeking to do business in the continent tend to hire and train local workforce and offer social projects to foster home-grown development -- in Angola, Brazilian construction company Odebrecht has become the largest private employer in the country.

As a result, Brazil's domestic development experience and success in narrowing social inequality have attracted attention from several African countries who are keen to replicate some of its programs.

Analysts say Brazil is keen to leverage its advanced technological know-how in helping African countries in areas that are key to the continent's development, including tropical agriculture and disease fighting.
