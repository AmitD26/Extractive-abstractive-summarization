(CNN) -- Police in British Columbia have filed charges against a motorcyclist who allegedly videotaped himself reaching speeds of at least 186 mph on a busy Canadian highway.

Through tips from the public, the Saanich Police Department, on Vancouver Island, identified the rider as 25-year-old Randy George Scott of Victoria.

Scott is still on the lam, police said, and they still are trying to track him down.

The online video of the harrowing ride has been viewed nearly a million times.

"We have a dedicated group of traffic safety officers and that is a very dramatic example of some obviously dangerous driving," Sgt. Dean Jantzen told CNN.

The video shows a motorcyclist reaching an apparent top speed of 299 kilometers per hour (186 mph) weaving between cars, but authorities think his actual speed may have been even faster.

You can hear him accelerating even when it says 299 kilometers per hour," Jantzen said.

The posted speed limit is 50 mph.

The incident took place on April 6 on a busy stretch of the Trans-Canada highway.

Jantzen said motorcyclists traveling at dangerously excessive speeds are not typical in that part of Saanich, which is more urban.

Saanich police say if convicted on the current charges, he could be sentenced up to five years in jail.

Scott, who police say has had prior run-ins with the law, has been added to Saanich Police Department's "Most Wanted" fugitive list, and police are advising him to turn himself in.
