(CNN) -- When Angelina Jolie revealed she'd had a double mastectomy, she probably had a pretty good idea that her bravery would empower other women to tell their breast cancer stories.

What she didn't know was that one of these women co-anchors a national morning news show.

On May 14, when Zoraida Sambolin walked into work and heard Jolie's news, she realized this was the right time to tell viewers that five weeks before, she'd been diagnosed with breast cancer and had decided to have a double mastectomy.

"Angelina Jolie chose to bear her soul in writing and I chose to follow her lead in front of all our viewers Tuesday," she later wrote in an article on CNN.com. "I am not yet on the other side, but judging by all the e-mails I've received from survivors, I am headed to a place that is stronger, wiser and definitely more empowered."

Sambolin, co-host of CNN's "Early Start," is grateful for all the love and support she's received from CNN's viewers and readers. Many asked questions about their own health or the health of someone they love. Sambolin asked me to help answer these questions.
