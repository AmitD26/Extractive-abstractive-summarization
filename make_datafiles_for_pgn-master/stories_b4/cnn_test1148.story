(CNN Student News) -- May 22, 2014

President Obama publicly addresses a scandal concerning some Veterans Affairs facilities, but critics say he's not doing enough to solve the growing problem. Meanwhile, dozens of U.S. troops deploy to the nation of Chad, and we take a trip into a Japanese ghost town that was abandoned after a natural disaster. It's all covered this Thursday on CNN Student News.
