(CNN Student News) -- November 7, 2014

There's a lot of medical information on today's show. After defining cytology, we tell you about an effort intended to revolutionize the study. And we explore the symptoms and challenges presented by bipolar disorder. For science teachers (and fans), we've got a report on a new type of "suit" that's helping people build airplanes. And basketball skills net a college freshman a new truck.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
