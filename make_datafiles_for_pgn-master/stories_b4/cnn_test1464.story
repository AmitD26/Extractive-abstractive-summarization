Jose Callejon scored a late winner for Real Madrid against Mallorca on Saturday evening as Jose Mourinho's men fought back from a goal down to defeat Mallorca 2-1 and extend their lead at the top of La Liga.

Israeli international Tomer Hemed gave Mallorca the lead in the 39th minute which they held on to until the last quarter of the match.

Substitute Gonzalo Higuain leveled the scores in the 71st minute before Callejon netted five minutes from the end to give Real an eight-point cushion over rivals Barcelona who play Real Betis at the Nou Camp on Sunday.

Third-placed Valencia missed the chance to move within one point of Barca as they slumped to a 1-0 home defeat to Real Sociedad.

French winger Antoine Griezmann's deflected shot in the 55 minute proving enough to earn Sociedad a vital win.

Earlier, Sevilla and Espanyol played out a 0-0 draw, while bottom-of-the-table Real Zaragoza earned a point with a 1-1 draw as they hosted mid-table Getafe.

Mauricio Lanzaro gave them the lead with a well-executed header in the 39th minute, but 11 minutes from time Zaragoza defender Javier Paredes scored an own goal.

It denied the home side a valuable three points which would have put them in touch with fellow strugglers Sporting Gijon and Villarreal.

Meanwhile in Italy, Saturday's only fixture between Catania and Roma was abandoned 20 minutes into the second half due to a waterlogged pitch.

The kick-off had already been delayed due to a torrential downpour, but further rain during the game forced referee to Paolo Tagliavento to take the players off and eventually force a premature end to the match with the score a 1-1.

Nicola Legrottaglie put the hosts ahead in the 24th minute but Roma responded with an equalizer three minutes later courtesy of a strike from Daniele De Rossi.
