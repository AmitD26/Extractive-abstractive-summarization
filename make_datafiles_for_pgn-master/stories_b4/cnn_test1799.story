(CNN) -- Google has used its wealth of data to compile an interactive crisis map for massive storm Sandy, giving users up-to-date information about storm surges, power outages, shelters and evacuation routes.

The Superstorm Sandy 2012 map was assembled by Google's Crisis Response Team to help residents of the battered East Coast, as well as their families and friends elsewhere, track the storm's progress.

By toggling through various options, users can get information including:

-- Tracking data from the National Hurricane Center

-- Alerts, evacuation notices and other announcements from Weather.com and the U.S. Geological Survey

-- Current radar and cloud images from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory

-- Live cameras and YouTube videos of the storm being posted in specific areas

Superstorm Sandy's wrath: Deaths, flooding, outages - and no end in sight

By toggling through the options, users can display as many or as few of the pieces of data as they like at one time.

Google also has created a New York City-specific map, powered by NYC Open Data, which compiles information from city agencies and other organizations.

The map includes widgets that make it easy for users to share it via social media or embed it into their own websites or blogs.

Sandy, which was then a hurricane, crashed ashore Monday night, leaving 16 people dead and millions without power in 10 states and the District of Columbia.

The storm continued to churn through the northeastern U.S. Tuesday morning, bringing extreme weather conditions in a broad path that stretched from north Georgia all the way to Canada.
