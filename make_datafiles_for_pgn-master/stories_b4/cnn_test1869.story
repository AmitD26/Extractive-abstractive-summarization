(CNN Student News) -- August 27, 2013

On Tuesday, CNN Student News explains when a massive wildfire can be declared as controlled, and we consider how U.N. inspectors try to determine the use of chemical weapons in a war zone. We also report on the newest U.S. Medal of Honor recipient, and we meet a DJ who uses senses other than his hearing to make music. Plus, some students tell us what topics they'd want to discuss with President Obama.
