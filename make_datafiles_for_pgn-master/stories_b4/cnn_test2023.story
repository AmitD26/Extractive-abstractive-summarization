(CNN) -- Dempsey. Beasley. Howard.

With their exhilarating win and nailbiting draw (let's not talk about the loss) in the World Cup, the boys of the U.S. Men's National Team are taking on one-name status. But while we've been mightily impressed by their never-say-die attitude on the field, it turns out they're darned nice guys off it: family men, musicians and animal-rights advocates. Here's a side of Team USA that you might not have seen, told through their Instagram feeds.

The team plays a win-or-go-home game against Belgium at 4 p.m. ET Tuesday.

DaMarcus Beasley: He loves his baby, bowling and bling

If there were a World Cup for adorable, his daughter Lia would win.

John Brooks: Dog lover. Big brother.

Jermaine Jones: Rarely cracks a smile

The midfielder is usually sporting a serious face even when showing off his tattoos. Seriousness must run in the family; his children sport a similar look.

Clint Dempsey: Has friends in high places

Tim Howard: Serious tattoos

And that beard.

Graham Zusi: Is very fond of four-legged friends

Brad Davis: His FuelBand is cooler than yours

Has an eye for the red, white and blue.

Matt Besler: Cleans up nicely

And a great eye for nature photography.

Omar Gonzalez: Learning to play guitar

And part-time drone pilot.
