(CNN) -- They clean up rivers, build homes for disabled veterans and bring health care to some of the darkest parts of the world.

They help children who are fighting cancer, poverty and a lack of opportunity.

These are the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.

For their extraordinary efforts to change the world, each of these everyday people will receive $50,000. They were also recognized at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute," an annual show broadcast globally on CNN.

"I've long admired the CNN Heroes tribute, but even more, the heroes themselves," said Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN Worldwide. "We are proud to share the stories of these 10 exceptional individuals and to continue one of CNN's most important traditions."

The tribute show, hosted by Anderson Cooper at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, included celebrity presenters and performers. This year's presenters included Grammy Award-winning musician Ne-Yo; comedians Jim Gaffigan and Sarah Silverman; television hosts Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan; and actors Jason Biggs, Alan Cumming, Josh Lucas, Mariska Hargitay, Shay Mitchell, Allison Williams and Jeffrey Wright.

Three-time Grammy nominee Sara Bareilles performed her hit single "Brave."

This was the seventh year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. In those years, the campaign has profiled more than 200 people on CNN and CNN.com.

This year's top 10 were nominated by CNN's global audience and profiled earlier this year on CNN.

At the end of the show, one of the top 10, Chad Pregracke, was named CNN Hero of the Year. He will receive an additional $250,000 for his cause, which is cleaning up the Mississippi River and other American waterways. Pregracke was chosen as Hero of the Year through a five-week public vote on CNN.com.

Here are the top 10 Heroes of 2013, in alphabetical order:

After Dale Beatty lost his legs in the Iraq war, his community thanked him for his service by helping him build a home.
