Ultimate Warrior's death came just days after he had been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. On Monday he appeared in the WWE's weekly Raw show.

Tributes to the former WWF world champion poured in from throughout the wrestling world, including from his former rival Hulk Hogan.

Triple H, real name Paul Michael Levesque, is one of the modern day WWE "superstars" and he also mourned the death of Ultimate.

During his appearance on Raw, Ultimate gave a poignant speech.

"No man becomes a legend on their own," he told the arena. "Every man's heart one day beats its final beat. His lungs breathe their final breath.

"And if what that man did in his life makes the blood pulse through the body of others and makes them believe deeper in something that's larger than life, then his essence, his spirit, will be immortalized by the storytellers -- by the loyalty, by the memory of those who honor him, and make the running the man did live forever."
