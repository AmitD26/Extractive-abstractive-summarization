(CNN)A 30-year-old California woman was abducted from a male acquaintance's residence in the Bay Area and is being held for ransom, police said Tuesday.

The male acquaintance, also 30, witnessed the kidnapping of Denise Louise Huskins from the Vallejo home, and he is not a suspect in the case, said Vallejo Police Lt. Kenny Park.

"Ms. Huskins' whereabouts are unknown, and we are treating this matter as a kidnap for ransom," Park told reporters. "We're worried about Ms. Huskins' welfare. We don't know where she's at. And that's why we're coming to the public asking for their help."

Huskins, who has been living in Vallejo the past year, is from Huntington Beach in Southern California, police said. She works as a physical therapist, police added. She is employed at a Kaiser Hospital, CNN affiliate KGO reported, citing her Facebook page.

A cousin of Huskins, Amy Mattison, told CNN affiliate KPIX that the 30-year-old man is Huskins' boyfriend and she was abducted from his residence.

Park declined to comment on the nature of the relationship between Huskins and the 30-year-old man who saw and reported the kidnapping.

About 75 people from the Solano County Search and Rescue Team were searching for Huskins in nearby woods and on Mare Island, Park said.

Huskins' 2000 White Toyota Camry was found in Vallejo and may have been moved from the residence, Park said. Authorities don't know when her vehicle was moved, police said.

Park didn't disclose the amount of the ransom being sought.

"All I can tell is there was a ransom demand," Park said.

Police are asking the public's help in locating Huskins, who was described as white, 5-foot-7, 150 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes.

Vallejo police asked the FBI to help their investigation.
