(CNN) -- Paraguay will meet Uruguay in Sunday's Copa America final in Argentina after a dramatic penalty shoot-out win over Venezuela.

The 5-3 loss denied Venezuela the chance to reach the final of the Latin American tournament for the first time.

The match itself was largely disappointing and finished goal-less, a far cry from the 3-3 thriller played out in the group stages by the same two sides -- Venezuela had come back from 3-1 down.

Venezuela increased the tempo in extra time; twice hitting the woodwork through Maldondo's deflected cross-come-shot and a free-kick from Juan Arango.

Meanwhile, Paraguay, twice winners of the competition, were reduced to ten men for the last 20 minutes after Jonathan Santana received his second caution of the match. But still Venezuela could not make the breakthrough.

After the match, Venezuela's coach, Cesar Farias, was left to rue his team's ill fortune.

"I don't want to do them down -- but Paraguay were incredibly lucky," he said, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse. "But we go home with our heads held high.

"They chalked off a goal for us, we hit the woodwork three times and created more chances. We should have won but it didn't work out for us. This is how things go with football and I cannot reproach my players."

Paraguay goalkeeper Justo Villar also conceded fortune had favored his side.

"It's not that we have been practicing penalties -- we've been rather lucky," he told AFP.

Venezuela will now play Peru, who lost to Uruguay in the other semi-final, for 3rd place.
