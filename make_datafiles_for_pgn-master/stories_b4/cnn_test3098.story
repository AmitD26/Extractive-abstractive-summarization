(CNN)Greece is so closely linked to summer vacations that it rarely features in winter escape plans.

That's a shame, because while it rules the Mediterranean in the heat of July and August, it's also got some pretty cool moves in the dead of December.

Falling temperatures sprinkle new magic on stone-built villages lost in deep forests and medieval castles built into that beautiful Greek coastline.

Throw vibrant cities into the mix, along with buzzing ski resorts -- yes, ski resorts -- and a whole new perspective of the country opens up.

Here are six classy places to consider for a Greek winter getaway.

For romantic escapes: Aristi Mountain Resort Hotel & Spa (Zagorochoria, Aristi)

A hidden mountainous treasure in the Epirus region of northwestern Greece, Zagorochoria is a complex of 46 stone-built villages.

This parkland ecosystem is where locals take special guests to illustrate their ideals of natural beauty.

Scenic mountain roads and traditional arched stone bridges interconnect tiny villages filled with guesthouses and little cafes.

Aristi Mountain Resort, in the village of Aristi, is ideal for exploring the region.

Located atop the village, the resort enjoys grand views of the "Towers of Astraka," the striking rock cliffs that dominate the skyline.

Accommodation includes rooms scattered around a complex of stone buildings and three newly built villas.

Its spa facilities feature an indoor heated pool with stunning views of the surrounding area, while its Salvia restaurant serves local specialties and fine Greek wines.

For city breaks: The Excelsior Luxury Boutique Hotel (Thessaloniki)

There are fancy bars along Valaoritou Street, and many restaurants in between.

Its many engaging museums, important archaeological sites and byzantine monuments are an ideal winter cultural fix.

Thessaloniki's art deco Excelsior hotel is a destination in itself, housed in a historic building right in the heart of the city, a few steps from the main Aristotelous Square.

The mythical mountain of Centaurs lies in the southeast part of the Thessaly region, forming a peninsula surrounded by water.

Pinakates village, in west Pelion, looks like a scene from a painting, with stunning mansions and photogenic cobbled streets.

For year-round seaside escapes: Kyrimai Hotel (Mani, Gerolimenas)

Located on the middle of the three peninsulas of southern mainland Greece's historic Peloponnese region, Mani stands at the meeting point of the Ionian and Aegean Seas.

Home to more than 96 traditional villages, Mani is dotted with traditional tower houses, Byzantine churches, sheltered coves, gorges and a coastline that provides a dramatic backdrop for any winter road trip.

There's a local saying: "You need three lives to fully understand Mani's soul: one for its sea, one for its mountains and one for its people."

The Kyrimai Hotel helps visitors make a start on all of these.

Built in 1870 on the small bay of Gerolimenas to give the area a commercial boost, the Kyrimai started life as a residence, an old shop, a warehouse and an imposing tower.

Today, its been carefully restored and converted into a luxurious hotel run by the Kyrimis family.

Protected by the Greek government, the building is listed as a unique historic monument of traditional Maniot architecture.

Its tastefully decorated rooms, 23 in total, are all different in style.

For dramatic scenery: Moni Emvasis Luxury Suites (Monemvasia)

In the southern Peloponnese, the old town of Monemvasia is one of Greece's best-preserved Byzantine citadels.

It's a fairy tale-style castle, off limits to cars, located on a small islet linked to the mainland by a bridge.

It looks as if it's floating on the Myrtoon Sea.

It's surrounded by aristocratic mansions, churches, hammams, fountains and winding paths.

Monemvasia's important role during the Byzantine period is still evident in the walls that dive into the deep blue sea.

Just 50 meters inside the castle town's entrance, Moni Emvasis Luxury Suites features a restored complex of private, stone-built suites with views over the sea.

Suites here feature limestone domed arches, vaulted and wooden beamed ceilings and handcrafted stone masonry.

There are also amazonian showers with chromotherapy and spa bathtubs.

Furnished, private balconies look out over the fortress, the town and Aegean Sea.
