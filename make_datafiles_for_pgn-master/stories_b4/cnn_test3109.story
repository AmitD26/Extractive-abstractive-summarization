TV's Judge Joe Brown was jailed on a contempt of court charge issued by a Tennessee juvenile judge Monday, according to a court spokesman.

Brown, 66, was sentenced to five days in jail after he became "pretty raucous" and "challenged the authority" of Magistrate Harold Horne, another judge told CNN. He was later released on his own recognizance, CNN Memphis affiliate WMC-TV reported, citing the Shelby County Sheriff's Office.

Brown, a former Shelby County criminal judge, was in court to represent a client in a child-support case. He apparently became upset when he was told the case was not on the afternoon docket, Chief Magistrate Dan Michael said.

Horne, who "is a real laid-back guy," gave Brown several chances to calm down before finding him in contempt, Michael said.

Horne held Brown was in contempt five times "before they were able to get him out of the courtroom, Michael said.

The court staff and judges "were all kind of floored" by Brown's behavior, Michael said.

Brown was booked into the Shelby County jail in Memphis Monday afternoon, sheriff's spokesman Chip Washington said.

Brown presided over a syndicated reality TV show based on court case arbitration for 15 years until it was canceled last year.

He announced his candidacy for the Shelby County district attorney post last month.

CNN reached out to Brown's representatives but has not yet received a response.

CNN was first alerted to Brown's arrest by a Twitter posting.
