(CNN) -- The German blowout over Brazil stunned the world, launched countless memes and set a new Twitter record.

Twitter's trending hashtags Germany (insert your verb) #Brazil 7-1 and "BrasilDecimeQuese7" should tell you the whole story. But in case you haven't heard, here's the recap.

The pummeling of the Brazilian team on home turf was the most-discussed single sports game ever on the social media network with 35.6 million tweets.

Not many saw this coming -- including ESPN's FiveThirtyEight statistician, Nate Silver.

During the first 29 minutes, Germany scored five goals, leaving the vast sea of yellow and green in the stadium stunned.

After halftime, things didn't get any better for the hosts. The Germans weren't in the mood for mercy, as they struck twice more to drive the point home.

Some lamented the lack of Brazilian superstar Neymar, who was out with a fractured vertebra sustained in the previous game against Colombia.

Photoshop tribute

With a blowout imminent, many football fans turned away from their televisions and poured their energy to Photoshop.

Some found a new design for Rio's famous Christ the Redeemer statue -- with designs featuring an triumphant German Chancellor Angela Merkel or a weeping Jesus.

And the Brazilian flag.

Others held their heads up high, taking comfort in Brazil's storied soccer tradition.

A Tumblr called Sad Brazilians popped up showing sobbing children, women with their face paint-stained, tears streaming down their cheeks, and -- of course -- the teary Brazilian captain, David Luiz.

And as Brazil's players returned home, the German team celebrated with a picture on their plane ride back to prepare for their final showdown on Sunday in Rio de Janeiro.

They will face the winners of Wednesday's other semi-final clash between Argentina and the Netherlands.
