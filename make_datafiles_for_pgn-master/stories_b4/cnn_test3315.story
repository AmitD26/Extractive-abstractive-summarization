(CNN) -- The only surviving gunman in the 2008 attacks on Mumbai that killed more than 160 people was sentenced to death by hanging on Thursday.

Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, was convicted on Monday of murder, conspiracy, and waging war on India. He was sentenced to death on five separate counts, and life imprisonment on five others.

On receiving the sentence, Kasab lowered his head. He was silent when the judge asked him if he wanted to say anything.

Kasab is the only man to have been sentenced in connection with the three-day siege in November 2008. During the raids, 10 men attacked buildings including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, the city's Victoria Terminus train station, and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House.

Kasab was photographed holding an assault weapon during the attacks.

India blamed the attacks on the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda.

Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India's parliament. The group denied responsibility.

Indian forces killed nine suspects in the attack. Their bodies were embalmed and kept in a hospital morgue as some local Muslim groups refused to bury them in their graveyards, saying the attackers were not true followers of Islam.

An Indian official in Maharashtra state, where Mumbai is located, has said a burial took place in January this year. He did not give the date or the exact location of what he described as a secret funeral.

Two Indian nationals accused of conspiracy were acquitted in the trial.

The prosecutor said he would fight their acquittals.
