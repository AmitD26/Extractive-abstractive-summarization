(CNN) -- Between the bad commercials, Beyonce's halftime gig, the Harbaugh brothers and the action on the field, the jokesters of Twitter had plenty to snicker about during Sunday's Super Bowl.

But then the lights went out in the Superdome, and Twitter really heated up.

The year's most-watched sporting event, interrupted by a 35-minute delay in the third quarter, may forever be known as the #Blackout Bowl. The bizarre interlude seemed to energize the San Francisco 49ers and the Twitterverse, which until then had been complaining about the one-sided game.

Twitter said its volume of chatter spiked during the blackout, reaching 231,500 tweets per minute. In total, there were 24.1 million tweets posted about the game and its halftime show, said Twitter in a blog post. By the beginning of the second half, Twitter said its volume of tweets had already surpassed last year's total for the whole game.

We by no means saw all of them, but here are some of our favorites:

James Burnett ‏-- The guy refereeing Puppy Bowl IX must be thinking, "I did not get into broadcasting to call 'poopy penalty!' with a straight face."
