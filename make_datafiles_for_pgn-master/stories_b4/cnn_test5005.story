MacDill Air Force Base, Florida (CNN) -- The names of two people who tried Monday to enter MacDill Air Force Base with unauthorized weapons were released by officials Tuesday.

The individuals were identified as Army Spc. Christopher Paul Kilburn based at Fort Riley, Kansas, and civilian Micah Noel Goodier of Palm Beach, Florida.

Kilburn, who was on AWOL status from the Army, has been charged with desertion, a release from the air base said. He is being turned over to Army authorities, and additional charges are pending, the air base said.

Potential charges against Goodier will be determined by the U.S. Attorney's Office, the air base said.

Earlier, officials said a man and a woman tried to enter the base using fraudulent identifications, Vice Commander Col. David Cohen said at a news conference Tuesday.

All gates at the base reopened Tuesday. They were temporarily closed after the heavily armed man and woman were taken into custody after trying to enter the facility without authorization.

The pair were stopped early Monday evening at a gate at the base, which houses the headquarters for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Senior Airman Katherine Holt said.

A search of the vehicle after they were detained revealed three handguns and three "rifle-style" weapons, Cohen said.

The investigation was ongoing, he said.

The incident was not being investigated as a terrorist threat, Cohen said.

Authorities cordoned off the pair's sport-utility vehicle and searched it using a robot, but no explosives were found. Video showed base personnel removing weapons, ammunition and military-style clothing from the vehicle, which was later towed away.

The Tampa, Florida, installation houses the headquarters of U.S. Central Command, which runs the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the U.S. Special Operations Command.
