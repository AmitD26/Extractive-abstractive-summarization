Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lamar Odom's lawyer on Wednesday entered a "not guilty" plea for the basketball star on a driving under the influence charge, a court spokeswoman said.

Odom, who is married to reality TV star Khloe Kardashian, was not in court for the arraignment at the Van Nuys branch of Los Angeles County Superior Court.

The basketball star was arrested in the early morning hours of August 30 by a California Highway Patrol officer who reported seeing Odom, 33, driving his white Mercedes SUV in a "serpentine manner at 50 mph."

Odom "showed objective signs of intoxication and he was unable to perform his field sobriety tests," a CHP news release said.

The judge set a pretrial hearing for 8:30 a.m. November 8. Odom's lawyer did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment.

In 2001, Odom admitted to having violated NBA drug policies twice.

"I've made a couple (of mistakes) and I may make a couple again, but hopefully they won't be as big as this one," Odom told reporters then.

Khloe Kardashian, who married Odom in 2009 after a 30-day courtship, tweeted about her frustrations when rumors surfaced days before his arrest that her husband was addicted to pain medications.

"Really hard to sit here and listen to people talk (expletive) about my family! (Expletive) you and shame on you! I'm too protective for this (expletive)!" the reality figure tweeted on August 25.

Odom and Kardashian have starred in their own show, "Khloe and Lamar," which aired on the E! network.

Odom is a free agent who has played in the NBA for 14 years, for the Los Angeles Lakers, Dallas Mavericks and, most recently, the Los Angeles Clippers.
