(CNN) -- Over the past few weeks some of the biggest names in world football have been guests on CNNFC.

They include former World Cup winning defender Marcel Desailly, his French international colleague David Ginola and strikers supreme Ruud Gullit and Michael Owen.

While from tennis, the legendary Boris Becker popped in to give his views as an avid football fan.

Each week we've been asking our guests to sign our CNNFC shirt and Champions League ball.

We're donating both of these to UNICEF, and they will be auctioning them off to help fund their invaluable work in Syria.

Syria's violence has now entered its third year, devastating childhoods for millions of children.

In refugee camps and inside Syria, UNICEF is providing children and their families with the basics they need to survive.

Very soon you could be the proud owner of this prized memorabilia while helping UNICEF in their life saving efforts.
