(CNN) -- Michelin Travel Publications rolled out the results for New York City's 2015 Michelin Guide today, and 73 area restaurants earned one or more of the guide's highest honor - the Michelin star.

The Michelin Guide, or Le Guide Michelin, originated in France in 1900 and has since offered its notes, recommendations and ratings on restaurants and hotels in select cities around the globe. It published its first New York City edition in 2005.

World's 50 best restaurants for 2014

The guide's recommendations are put together by a team of "famously anonymous" inspectors, who all must undergo strict training and sign confidentiality agreements before they can file reports on their assigned establishments.

The ratings for the guide are as follows:

Three stars -- "Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey. One always eats here extremely well, sometimes superbly. Distinctive dishes are precisely executed, using superlative ingredients."

Two stars -- "Excellent cuisine, worth a detour. Skillfully and carefully crafted dishes of outstanding quality."

One star -- "A very good restaurant in its category. A place offering cuisine prepared to a consistently high standard."
