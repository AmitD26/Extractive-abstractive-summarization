(CNN)  -- Defender turned striker Daniel van Buyten scored an 88th minute winner for Bayern Munich to give them a much-needed 2-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt to revive their Bundesliga title challenge.

The Belgian was pushed up front by coach Louis van Gaal after Italian striker Luca Toni was substituted and he came up trumps with a late header.

It made amends for his sending off in the 2-1 Champions League defeat to Bordeaux in midweek.

The win also takes the Bavarian giants to fifth place in the German standings with 18 points after 10 games, four points adrift of Bayer Leverkusen, who were held 1-1 by Borussia Dortmund on Friday night.

Alexander Meier put the visitors in front on the hour mark at the Allianz Arena, but Dutch ace Arjen Robben, returning to first team action after injury, equalized 10 minutes later after Mario Gomez won an aerial battle to set him up to slot home.

Bayern coach van Gaal was relieved to claim the three points after their midweek setback in Europe.

"We created several good chances against opponents who were very defensively minded," he told reporters.

Hoffenheim ended a two-goal losing run with a 3-0 home win over Nuremberg to move up to sixth in the standings, a point behind Bayern.

Christian Eichner with a 30-meter blast and prolific striker Vedad Ibisevic scored within four minutes in the first half to put Ralf Rangnick's side on the way to three points.

Argentina's Franco Zuculini completed the scoring just after the hour mark with a fierce shot.

Elsewhere, Mainz thrashed fellow promoted side Freiburg 3-0 with captain Tim Hoogland scoring twice in the second half as they moved up to seventh.

A solitary goal by Didier Konan was enough to lead Hannover 96 to victory over Stuttgart , the goal coming after 31 minutes while  Borussia Moenchengladbach snapped a five-game losing streak in a goalless draw against Cologne.
