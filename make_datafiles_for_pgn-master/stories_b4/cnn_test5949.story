Atlanta (CNN) -- A robbery suspect nicknamed the "Grandma Bandit" died in a shootout Friday in Atlanta, Georgia, authorities said.

Later, authorities discovered that Grandma was actually Grandpa.

"After further investigation, detectives have determined the person believed to be a female suspect in fact is a male," DeKalb County police spokeswoman Mekka Parish said Friday evening.

"His name is Roxanne Taylor, a 57-year-old man."

Police had issued an arrest warrant on Thursday for someone they thought was a 58-year-old woman, Roxanne Taylor, charging her with three robberies.

The "Grandma Bandit" gained notoriety because of the apparent woman's age and signature robbing style -- approaching cashiers at Atlanta-area CVS and Rite-Aid pharmacies and demanding cash after producing a revolver from her purse.

She was a distinctive-looking woman with swollen cheeks who wore oversize, dark sunglasses and a baseball cap, according to surveillance video and witness accounts.

On Friday morning, Taylor was spotted at a Wendy's fast-food restaurant. Witnesses identified him as the "Grandma Bandit" because he was profiled on a Crime Stoppers piece earlier in the week, Parish said.

"The individuals called 9-1-1 and nearby Atlanta police officers arrived to investigate, leading to a pursuit," she said.

Taylor led police on a car chase that ended with a multi-car accident off an interstate exit.

"When officers pursued to investigate the accident, they heard a shot ring out," Parish said. "The responding officers returned fire."

It was not immediately known whether Taylor's fatal gunshot wounds were self-inflicted or caused by police, Parish said.

The arrest warrant for Taylor said he had netted about $400 from the three holdups.
