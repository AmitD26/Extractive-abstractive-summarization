ALABAMA

The death toll from the severe weather in Alabama has claimed the lives of at least 238 people, according to state emergency officials. The state Emergency Management Agency reported 18 additional deaths in Marion County, bringing the total number of deaths there to 21. Sheriff Kevin Williams told CNN Friday afternoon that 35 people had died in the county, with the additional deaths not yet included in the official state total. The state listed 20 people as missing in Marion County.

Tuscaloosa city officials reported 45 deaths as of Friday afternoon, but later revised that to 39 because of a counting error. That change was not immediately reflected in the state's total. Almost 1,000 people were treated for injuries in the city and 446 people were unaccounted for, although not necessarily missing.

President Barack Obama and the first family toured Tuscaloosa on Friday. Obama met with Gov. Robert Bentley and families affected by the storms and promised expedited emergency assistance to the devastated region.

"We're going to do everything we can to help these communities rebuild," he told reporters.

Medical personnel treated more than 1,700 injured people. Thirty-one of the state's 67 counties were affected by the tornadoes and storms.

Bentley declared a statewide state of emergency and mobilized approximately 2,000 Alabama National Guardsmen to provide emergency assistance.

Obama signed Alabama's Emergency Declaration and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts.

--  Tuscaloosa: Mayor Walter Maddox described a surreal scene as the twister plowed through: "There were parts of the city I literally didn't recognize," he told CNN's Eliot Spitzer. "We have hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed, and hundreds more damaged.

In Chickamauga Lake, north of Chattanooga, no one was injured when a funnel cloud smashed into the Camp Columbus RV park, destroying several vehicles.

The town in northwest Georgia has been hit particularly hard, with some buildings entirely demolished, Major Gary Sisk said. In Ringgold, the storm appeared to pick and choose its targets. Some homes were left virtually unscathed, or perhaps had minor roof damage. Others had no roof at all. Still more homes were simply gone, vanished into a pile of rubble. "It just looks like confetti," emergency management spokeswoman Lisa Janak said Friday, adding 300 homes were lost in the county.
