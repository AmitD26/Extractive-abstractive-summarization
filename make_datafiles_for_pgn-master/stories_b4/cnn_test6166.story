Los Angeles (CNN) -- Representatives for "Glee" star Lea Michele said Sunday that the news of her boyfriend and co-star Cory Monteith's sudden death is "devastating" to the actress.

Monteith, 31, was found dead Saturday in a Vancouver hotel room.

Michele, who had been dating Monteith for about a year, has not yet given a statement about his death.

Her representatives asked Sunday "that everyone kindly respect Lea's privacy during this devastating time."

While the "Glee" actors had been co-stars since 2009 when the show premiered, they didn't begin dating until 2012.

Celebrities react to his death

Monteith played heart throb Finn Hudson -- on-again, off-again love interest to Michele's Rachel Berry -- on the hit Fox series.

Most recently, Michele, 26, voiced support for Monteith as he announced in April that he was seeking treatment for substance abuse.

"I love and support Cory and will stand by him through this," she told People magazine. "I am grateful and proud that he made this decision."
