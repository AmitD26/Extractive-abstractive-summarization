(CNN) -- It was a weekend that Brandt Snedeker and Hunter Mahan will never forget.

For Snedeker, it saw him clinch a three-shot victory at the Canadian Open and climb to third in the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup standings.

But the American benefited from the withdrawal from the tournament of halfway leader Hunter Mahan, who left the Glen Abbey Golf Club in Ontario after receiving news his wife Kandi had gone into labor.

Kandi gave birth to a daughter, Zoe Olivia Mahan, and Snedeker plans to send the newborn a gift for inadvertently aiding his sixth PGA Tour win.

"Zoe will be getting a very nice baby gift from me," the 32-year-old told the PGA Tour's website after finishing the tournament 16-under par ahead of William McGirt in second place.

"I can't thank Kandi enough for going into labor early. I don't know if I'd be sitting here if she hadn't.

"But that is a way more important thing than a golf tournament. I missed a golf tournament when my first was born, and it was the best decision I ever made. I'm sure Hunter would say the same thing."

Snedeker is the reigning FedEx Cup champion and Sunday's win, his second of 2013, leaves him behind compatriots Matt Kuchar and world No. 1 Tiger Woods in the standings.

"It feels great to get a win," added Snedeker.

"To validate all the hard work I've put in over the past three months where I haven't played my best and know that I'm working on the right stuff and able to hold up under some pretty serious pressure this afternoon.

"To win a tournament like this with those pivotal holes coming down the stretch means a lot."
