(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 23rd hat-trick for Real Madrid on Saturday as Real Sociedad were brushed aside 5-1 at the Bernabeu.

The Portuguese maestro opened the scoring in the 12th minute before French striker Karim Benzema doubled the lead six minutes later.

The game was effectively over eight minutes later when Ronaldo tucked away his second goal of the night from the penalty spot.

Sami Khedira made it 4-0 in the 36th minute before the visitors reduced their arrears with Antoine Griezmann scoring in the 61st minute.

Inevitably it was Ronaldo who had the last word, bagging his third and Real's fifth with 14 minutes remaining.
