(CNN Student News) -- December 5, 2014

This Friday's show is especially diverse in scope: It involves the subjects of science, law, biology, engineering and art. You'll hear why one city in Philippines is particularly troubled about Typhoon Hagupit, and you'll learn why this year's flu vaccine is less effective than previous doses. We also cover a grand jury's decision in New York that's sparking protests in other cities.

On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
