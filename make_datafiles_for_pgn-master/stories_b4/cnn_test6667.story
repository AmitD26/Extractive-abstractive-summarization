Editor's note: CNN affiliates report on where job seekers are finding work across the country and how those looking for employment are coping with the situation.

Workers at the Jayco plant in Elkhart County in Indiana put together a travel trailer in February.

(CNN) -- Elkhart, Indiana, has suffered through a litany of economic bad news and layoffs.

The United States Department of Labor said that in March, the Elkhart metropolitan area had the fifth highest unemployment in the country.

Just last year the Monaco Coach Corp. closed down its motor home assembly plants in Elkhart, Nappanee and Wakarusa.

But Electric Motors Corp., which builds engines, cars and trucks, is moving into Elkhart County and bringing hundreds of jobs.

"Their production working skills will be a little bit different than RV workers, but not that much different. We'll easily be able to train the workers," County Commissioner Mike Yoder told WSJV.

Neither the company nor government officials would comment on how many jobs could potentially be created.

"It's good to get a small number just to build up and hopefully it'll keep coming," said college student Erika Miller, who is looking for summer work. Read the full report on WSJV

South: Famed New Orleans hotel closed after Katrina hiring hundreds

The Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana, is almost ready to reopen after being shuttered after Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005. After undergoing a $145 million renovation, the hotel will be staffed by 400 employees.

This past week, more than 5,000 job seekers came to a job fair at the downtown landmark. Some of the people hired will begin in a few weeks, while others will start later.

"We are looking to make some additional hires in September and in October when business picks up," Roosevelt employee Melissa Kariker told WDSU.

One applicant at the fair had worked previously at the hotel.

"I started my career with the Fairmont-Roosevelt," Gregory Smith said. "I worked in the Blue Room for several years." Read the report on WDSU

Midwest: Newspaper giving away space for 'Hire me' ads

The New Herald newspaper of Cleveland, Ohio, will publish "Hire me" ads in its Sunday editions and on its Web site.

There is no cost for job seekers, but the offer applies only to this Sunday's paper.

The Web site will also post video resumes. Read the report on WEWS
