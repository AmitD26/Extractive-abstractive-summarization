(CNN) -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic was again on target as AC Milan returned to the top of Italy's Serie A with a 2-0 victory at Cagliari on Tuesday.

Francesco Pisano's early own-goal and a second-half strike from the in-form Ibrahimovic put the defending champions one point clear of unbeaten Juventus, who visit third-placed Udinese on Wednesday.

Massimiliano Allegri's team took the lead in the fourth minute when Pisano deflected Antonio Nocerino's effort into the net after Ibrahimovic sent Robinho free down the right.

Ibrahimovic and Nocerino both scored in Saturday's win over Siena which briefly put Milan above Juve, and the Sweden striker continued his rich scoring run in the 60th minute.

He netted a fifth penalty in six matches at the weekend, but this time was on target from open play after combining again with Brazil forward Robinho.

Norwich retained ninth place despite twice losing the lead in a 2-2 draw at struggling Wolverhampton.
