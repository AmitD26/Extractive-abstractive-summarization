In Idaho, Dave Mulvihill, manager of the state's census bureau, said the organization will hire 1,200 workers. He has plenty of job searchers to choose from.

The office is holding off on taking any more applications until fall.

The Alabama census bureau is preparing to hire between 1,000 and 1,500 workers.

"We need workers so we can get good addresses [to] send the questionnaires out so we can get a good response," state census bureau official Darryl Lee told TV Alabama in Birmingham.

Census officials point out that an accurate count of U.S. citizens helps the government figure out how much funding to give each state for federally sponsored programs. Read the ABC 33/40 story

West: Man shows job hunters how to look for work on Twitter

A man who was laid off from his real estate job a year ago now organizes events that bring job seekers together while teaching them skills to use social networking tools.

Edwin Duterte runs Pink Slip Mixers and has put on 10 networking events in Southern California. Recently he held his first such event in Mountain View, California.

Perrine Crampton, a program manager who is out of work, was impressed with the willingness of other job seekers to help each other.

"With people saying, 'Hey, I found this job; I'm not a good fit. Would you like this position?' she told CNN affiliate KGO. Watch the KGO report on the mixer

"That kind of thing is going on now. That is something I really hold onto, because it shows me that there is good in humanity."

Duterte said the Web sites Twitter and LinkedIn are a great way to build an online network of contacts. "If I get other eyes to look for you maybe you'll find a job faster than if you just look for yourself."
