(CNN) -- Liverpool have signed Argentina international Maxi Rodriguez on a free transfer from Atletico Madrid.

The 29-year-old winger has penned a three-and-a-half-year deal with Rafael Benitez's side after four years in the Spanish capital.

After passing a medical and agreeing terms Rodriguez put pen to paper on the deal, which is subject to international clearance.

Manager Rafa Benitez told the club's official Web site. "We were looking for players with character and a good mentality.

"He has played for Argentina and Atletico Madrid and is a player with personality. He can play in three positions -- on the right, left or as a second striker -- and is someone with a very positive mentality, which is what we are looking for.

"He is comfortable on the ball, can pass and keep possession. He is good at getting into the box and scoring goals and a good finisher. Every year he gets five to 15 goals from the right side of midfield."
