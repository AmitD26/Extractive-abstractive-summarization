London (CNN) -- English soccer player Billy Sharp scored what he called the most important goal of his career Tuesday -- a shot in memory of his son Luey, who died Saturday, two days after he was born.

Sharp pulled up his jersey after the goal went in to reveal a t-shirt underneath reading "That's for you son."

The goal was "Dedicated to my brave boy Luey Jacob Sharp I love u son sleep tight. That's for you son," Sharp said on Twitter after the match.

"My goal had to be something special tonight for my special boy.I'm so proud of him,and his mum," he said.

Referees normally give players a yellow card for showing a message on a t-shirt, but Darren Deadman declined to penalize Sharp.

Luey was born October 27. He died October 29, said Sharp's team, Doncaster Rovers.

Sharp was not expected to play Tuesday, but not only took the field but was named team captain for the night.

Fans of both Rovers and their opponents Middlesbrough cheered to honor Sharp and his family before the match.

"This is a minute's applause to celebrate the short life of Billy and Jade's son Luey Jacob Sharp," the announcer said.

"Born October 27. Taken by the angels on the 29th. Sleep tight son," he said.

Sharp said the tribute left him in tears.

"To captain the side tonight was an honor and a pleasure,the minute applause I was crying meant so much to me thanks to both sets of fans," he tweeted.

Hundreds of people tweeted their support to Sharp and his family.

"What you've done has put life into perspective, you've won the hearts of the nation, and united football," said one, Ben Wainwright.

Sharp and his wife were "grateful for the love and support we have received," she said on Twitter. "Daddy did Luey proud tonight. Sleep tight angel."
